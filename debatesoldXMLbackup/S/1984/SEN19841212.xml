      <P>I have notice from Senator Séamus de Brún that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The immediate need for the Minister for Education to proceed with the building of the new vocational school already approved for Castlerea, County Roscommon, to replace the existing school which is totally inadequate and seriously impeding the educational progress of the students in attendance there.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The facts and circumstances leading to the preferment, on 1 May 1984, of criminal charges against Joanne Hayes, Edmund Hayes, Michael Hayes, Kathleen Hayes and Bridie Fuller, Dromcunnig Lower, Abbeydorney, County Kerry in connection with the death of an unnamed male infant and subsequent events which led to the withdrawal of those charges at Tralee District Court on 10 October 1984;</P>
      <P>(2)  related allegations made by Joanne Hayes, Mary Hayes, Edmund Hayes and Michael Hayes in written statements to their solicitor on 23 October 1984 and by Kathleen Hayes in a written statement to her solicitor on 24 October 1984 concerning the circumstances surrounding the questioning and the taking of statements from those persons on 1 May 1984;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank Senator Ferris for moving this motion.  On Thursday last I announced in the other House that the Government had decided that a tribunal should be established to carry out a sworn judicial inquiry into what has become known as the &ldquo;Kerry babies&rdquo; case.  In <Col N="717" /> accordance with the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979, this decision can be implemented only if both Houses of the Oireachtas pass a motion that it is expedient that such a tribunal be set up.  The Dáil yesterday passed a motion in identical terms to that now before this House and, if this House also passes the motion, we can proceed with the setting-up of the tribunal as proposed.</P>
      <P>As I said in the other House, I do not think it necessary or appropriate to attempt to go into any great detail about the factual background to this proposal, especially since it is precisely to establish as far as possible what that factual background is that the tribunal will be appointed if, as I hope, the proposal is approved by this House today.</P>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, in formally proposing the motion I made a statement in the other House yesterday.  That statement, apart from dealing with some pertinent matters relating to the tribunal, attempted to put the issues involved in the terms of reference in perspective and because of the importance of the issues I propose to repeat the statement in substantially the same terms for the benefit of this House.  I trust that Senators will accept that it is better that I should proceed in this way rather than that I should make changes in that statement &mdash; changes that would not, in any event, affect the substance of it &mdash; solely for the sake of saying the same thing in slightly different terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Members of the House are aware, some issues of substantial public importance have arisen in the case and, for that reason, the Government consider that it is essential that every possible effort is made to establish the truth of what occurred. An investigation was ordered by the Garda Commissioner and, as I said yesterday, he had made the decision that an investigation was necessary before any public controversy arose.  As is well known at this stage, the investigation that was carried out did not succeed in resolving the conflicting versions of the events that have been given on both sides.  This was not the fault of the two experienced <Col N="718" /> senior officers of the force who conducted the investigation.  Their inquiries were both entirely impartial and as thorough as circumstances allowed.</P>
    <P>However, because of certain comments that have been publicly made during the last week or two, I thought it necessary to emphasise yesterday &mdash; and I wish to do so again now &mdash; that the Garda investigators did not have the powers that this tribunal will have.  On the contrary, since they were carrying out an investigation against a background of allegations that included allegations of conduct that might, if supported, justify criminal proceedings, they were subject to all the constraints that apply in such cases.  That is the system under which we operate and the same problems would have faced any other investigation, whether from within the force or not, unless armed with the exceptional powers which the law gives to a tribunal such as is now proposed to be set up.</P>
    <P>The internal Garda inquiry had to be undertaken.  It was an essential first step and even if there had been no need to embark on it for the purposes of investigating the possibility that evidence might be obtained that would sustain a criminal charge &mdash; and there was such a need &mdash; the internal inquiry would have separately justified itself by the fact that the results, including many statements taken by the investigators, will be available to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>But there are, as I have said, conflicting versions of events and those conflicting versions have not been resolved. Accordingly, there is a need to resolve them, or at least to endeavour as far as possible to resolve them, by testing under oath in a public forum the veracity of what is being said.  It is only in that setting, where people can be examined on oath and subjected, as necessary, to cross-examination that there is now any realistic hope of getting at the facts.  That is what the tribunal will do.  It will have the power to compel the attendance of witnesses, to take evidence from them on oath, to compel the production of documents &mdash; in fact it will have all the powers of the High Court to enable it <Col N="719" /> do its job properly.  Likewise, witnesses appearing before it will enjoy the same immunities and privileges as witnesses before the High Court.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a few words about the terms of reference of the tribunal.  Care has been taken in drawing up the terms of reference to ensure that they are sufficiently wide to enable it to cover all relevant aspects of the issues involved in the case.  In examining the facts and circumstances leading to the preferment of charges against the members of the Hayes family of Abbeydorney, the tribunal will necessarily have to concern itself with the manner in which the investigation into the death of the baby found at White Strand, Cahirciveen was carried out by the Garda Síochána.  Then there are the specific allegations of the Hayes family of ill-treatment during the period they were questioned by the Garda &mdash; questioning which led to the making of statements by members of the family.  Finally, there is what might be termed the &ldquo;catchall&rdquo; provision in paragraph (3) which will enable the tribunal to go into any connected or relevant matter not specifically alluded to in paragraphs (1) and (2). Assuming this motion is agreed by this House, I will proceed quickly to the next step which will be the formal appointment of the tribunal by order or warrant under my hand.  The tribunal will be asked to report to me.  It will then be free to organise its procedure as it sees fit.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, Mr. Justice Kevin Lynch, judge of the High Court, has agreed to constitute the tribunal and the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Finlay, has agreed to make the arrangements necessary to release Mr. Justice Lynch as far as may be necessary from other duties.  I would like to express my thanks again to Mr. Justice Lynch for agreeing to act and to the President of the Court for his co-operation.</P>
    <P>A number of points arose in the other House yesterday that I feel I should refer to because they may be amongst the matters that some Members of this House may want to raise and have discussed. Some of them are important.  The most <Col N="720" /> important is perhaps the question of whether the tribunal should be specifically invited in its terms of reference to make recommendations.  There are, certainly, occasions where it would be appropriate and highly desirable that a tribunal should be invited to make recommendations, but I am afraid that this is not one of them.</P>
    <P>In saying that, however, I want to make it quite clear that my reasons for this view have nothing to do with not wanting to listen to any views the tribunal might have.  It is rather that I do not think it necessary.  If the inquiry should establish that one or more members of the Garda Síochána failed to observe proper standards, it is primarily for the Garda authorities to take the necessary action and they are in the best position to judge what action is appropriate.  Obviously, if a question of criminal charges arises, it will be a matter for the DPP to decide whether charges should be brought.  Likewise, if disciplinary matters arise it will be up to the Commissioner to act.  Beyond that, questions of taking action for the future may arise but that will, I suggest, follow logically and be self-evident from the findings of the tribunal. If, for example, it emerged that proper standards were not observed in the questioning of members of the Hayes family in the Garda station in Tralee, the question of adequate safeguards for persons in Garda stations will arise.  In this respect I might remind the House that we have over the past year, in the context of the Criminal Justice Bill, given this question very careful and painstaking consideration.  In the course of that debate we looked at the Ó Briain report which made certain recommendations in this regard.  We noted that many of those recommendations had been implemented and others were being implemented. We discussed many safeguards that the Criminal Justice Bill itself proposed. I outlined my proposals for further safeguards including tape-recording and a statutory code of practice governing the treatment of persons in Garda stations. Then there is the forthcoming Bill on a new complaints procedure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> Quite frankly, in the light of all of this, I do not see the need for giving this tribunal a specific power to make recommendations in relation to possible safeguards.  Of course that is not to say that if there are obvious lessons to be learned from the findings of the tribunal touching on matters that are not already covered in the Criminal Justice Act or to be covered in the proposed regulations, they will not be taken into account.  Of course they will.</P>
    <P>The tribunal is concerned essentially with what happened.  It will, I hope, be clear from its findings what should be done for the future.  It will be a matter for the Garda authorities and for me as Minister to see to it that action is taken, but I repeat my view that it is not necessary to give the tribunal power to go into this and I do not propose to give the tribunal power to make recommendations for those reasons.</P>
    <P>Another matter of importance that arose concerns the publication of the story of this case initially in a certain Sunday newspaper.  Compliments have been paid to the journalists who &ldquo;broke the story&rdquo; and I believe not unreasonably so as they undoubtedly performed a public service in highlighting the facts. But the suggestion has also been made that, were it not for its publication, a grave miscarriage of justice might have occurred.  I want to reject that suggestion absolutely.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the charges against the members of the Hayes family were withdrawn in Tralee District Court on Wednesday, 10 October.  The story was not published until the following Sunday, 14 October.  It followed that no possibility of a miscarriage of justice arose or was averted by publication of the story.  The story emerged from the fact that the relevant authorities had in fact decided to withdraw the charges and not the reverse.</P>
    <P>I referred in my statement yesterday to the question of legal representation before the tribunal and the related question of legal costs because these are matters in relation to which questions have already been asked.  I should like to <Col N="722" /> repeat what I said then.  The tribunal is empowered to authorise the legal representation of any person appearing to the tribunal to be interested.  It may also refuse such representation.  This is the effect of section 2 (b) of the 1921 Act.  It is therefore a matter for the tribunal and for it alone to decide who should be represented.  Likewise, the 1979 Act authorises the tribunal to direct that the costs of any person appearing before it should be paid by any other person, including the State.  It may so direct where, having regard to its findings and other relevant matters, it considers it equitable to do so.  Thus, there is a clear legal framework there &mdash; a framework that has been used and has proved satisfactory in other inquiries such as the Whiddy and Stardust inquiries &mdash; to deal with the question of legal representation and the related one of costs.</P>
    <P>Because the only issue before this House is the motion, some other matters affecting the Garda Síochána which have recently been the subject of publicity are not relevant.  On that account I do not propose to refer to any other case or cases except to say in passing, as I made clear yesterday, that I realise that this present case is not only one that has caused concern. As I have already said, all of those other cases have been dealt with or are being dealt with.  One at least &mdash; the Shercock case &mdash; is now <i>sub judice</i> in relation to one of its participants and we should not discuss it.  While there have been other cases, it is also right and necessary that the proposal before the House should be seen in its true perspective.  I would argue very strongly that its true perspective is not to be found just by looking at one or even at a number of cases where things have or may have been wrong but by looking at the record of the Garda Síochána day in, day out over the years.  That record speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>What I said yesterday bears repeating. Since the foundation of the State the Garda Síochána have had a role vital to the maintenance of the institutions of democracy.  The force have served this State outstandingly well and will, I am in no doubt at all, continue to do so in <Col N="723" /> the future.  Its members have done so frequently at great cost to themselves. Since 1970, 11 members have been murdered. Last year we had two such cases and this year another one.  Many members place their own safety at risk day after day in the defence of the community. These are stark facts of life and we need to remind ourselves of them from time to time and especially now.</P>
    <P>Whatever the outcome of this inquiry may be &mdash; even if the result is unfavourable to one or more members &mdash; it should not cause us for one instant to forget what we owe to the force.  Moreover, as I have previously made clear, the Commissioner shares fully, as indeed he has conclusively proved by his actions in this and other cases, my own commitment to ensuring that if and where remedial action is called for, remedial action will be taken.  That, at the end of the day, is perhaps the most important point of all and is a major reason why I have no doubt whatsoever that the force will come through this difficult period without lasting damage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the fact that this inquiry is to take place but we regret the necessity for it.  I sincerely hope that never again will we have the names of any family mentioned before this House relating to any commission of inquiry. There is absolutely no doubt that the public at large feel there is a necessity to get to the bottom of the problems which have arisen in Kerry.  It is essential for everybody concerned &mdash; the family, the Garda Síochána and the totality of the public.</P>
      <P>I regret that over the past few months this case has come so much to the fore in the media.  I suggest on a personal basis that I have never seen a more unethical or immoral programme than the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme which covered this case.  I have never seen anything as bad and I have never heard so many comments about this particular programme in which a family were brought before the public and denuded of their dignity. I sincerely hope we will never see anything of that nature again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> I am glad that the Minister mentioned that if there were improprieties with the Garda force, these improprieties would be dealt with.  I sincerely hope that at the end of the day there will be no cover-up, that whoever is at fault in this case will be brought to justice and that justice will be given to the family concerned in this case.  I do not intend to delay this debate any further.  Enough has been said about this case and the sooner the better the tribunal is set up and the judge gets down to his deliberations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the setting up of the tribunal for the judicial sworn inquiry into the Kerry babies' case.  The inquiry is welcomed not only nationally but also locally in north Kerry where, as Senator Lanigan has already pointed out, there is great concern among the community about the allegations made.  The sooner a thorough investigation is carried out the better, both for the Hayes family and the Garda as a whole.</P>
      <P>The inquiry should be held in Tralee courthouse and the local people should be allowed to sit in on the proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome very strongly the setting up of this independent inquiry. I welcome it not so much because the Garda as a whole need investigation but because to the people it is symbolic that gardaí are not above the law.  The setting up of an independent inquiry of this sort, whatever the issue &mdash; I do not want to speak about this specific issue &mdash; will quell public disquiet about the position of the Garda.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister for Justice has not taken this decision too lightly. Very often the wrongdoings of gardaí are highlighted and it is very easy for the media to pick on certain cases and specific instances where the gardaí undoubtedly commit wrongs.  It would be unrealistic for anyone in this House to say that the Garda are a 100 per cent perfect body who do no wrong.  That would be unrealistic, but it would also be unrealistic to cast all the gardaí as bad because of specific cases and the one specific case which we hear of now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> I am glad the Minister for Justice said that we should get things back into perspective and compare this with the good that the Garda do in the community. We are once again debating the evil that gardaí have possibly done but, as the Minister for Justice quite rightly said, they are the only people who have stood between us and anarchy since the foundation of the State.  If we have a few instances like this which are highly distasteful, it is absolutely right that they should be inquired into but it should be remembered that several members of the Garda have been murdered and that gardaí day in, day out are in permanent physical danger or in danger of their lives.  We should have a sense of balance in saying that while there are wrongs there is also a large amount to thank the Garda for.  I believe that the setting up of this inquiry will help in reassuring the public and it is in the interests of the Garda themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the setting up of this inquiry and the appointment of Mr. Justice Lynch who will chair the inquiry.  I am not entirely convinced, however, by the Minister's comments on why the motion does not include a specific proposal that the tribunal be enabled to make recommendations and I would like to refer in some detail to the reasons I would have welcomed the framing of the motion in terms of enabling the tribunal specifically to make recommendations. That would have been in line with the previous motions of a comparable sort establishing tribunals of this kind.</P>
      <P>Resolutions of both Houses on 6 and 8 March 1979 established the Whiddy Island inquiry.  The terms of the resolution were as follows:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  the immediate and other causes of, and the circumstances of and leading to, the explosions and fires on and in the vicinity of the <Col N="726" /> ship <i>Betelgeuse</i> and the jetty of the terminal of Gulf Oil Terminals (Ireland) Limited at Whiddy Island, Bantry, in the County of Cork on the 8th January, 1979.</P>
    <P>(2)  the circumstances of and leading to the loss of life on and in the vicinity of the ship and jetty on the 8th January, 1979,</P>
    <P>(3)  the measures, and their adequacy, taken on and before the 8th January, 1979, on, in the vicinity of and in relation to the ship and at, in the vicinity of and in relation to the terminal to prevent, and to minimise and otherwise to deal with&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  fires and explosions of the kinds aforesaid, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the occurrence of circumstances of the kinds that led to the loss of life aforesaid;</P>
    <P>There was a second part of the resolution which was framed as follows:</P>
    <P>2.  making such recommendations (if any) as the Tribunal, having regard to its findings, thinks proper.</P>
    <P>I would have felt that this was an occasion where it would have been very appropriate and very helpful to have that addition to the motion as it stands, enabling the tribunal to make any recommendations which it might wish to do, having regard to the findings it might make.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the reasons why I think this is particularly appropriate in relation to the inquiry into the Kerry babies deaths or the circumstances surrounding them, let us look at how the tribunal which was ultimately established to examine the Whiddy Island tragedy exercised those powers.  Chapter 23 of the long report compiled by the tribunal under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Declan Costello is devoted to recommendations and it begins with an introduction explaining the scope of the recommendations. This is highly relevant to the possible scope of the tribunal which we are setting up now because at paragraph 23.11 of the report the tribunal explains <Col N="727" /> why some of the recommendations go into matters subsequent to the Whiddy Island inquiry.  The introduction states:</P>
    <P>Some of the Recommendations which follow, if found to be acceptable, can be implemented by means of Regulations under the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972.</P>
    <P>It was submitted by Counsel instructed on behalf of the Attorney General that the adequacy or otherwise of the Dangerous Substances (Oil Jetties) Regulations, 1979, did not form part of the considerations of the Inquiry being undertaken by the Tribunal because the resolutions passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas referred to the establishment of a Tribunal which would inquire, <i>inter alia,</i> into &ldquo;measures, and their adequacy&rdquo;, taken on or before the 8th January, 1979.  As the 1979 Regulations came into force after that date it was submitted that their &ldquo;adequacy&rdquo; could not be considered by the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Tribunal considers that as it can make any recommendations which it thinks fit having regard to its findings, it has power to make recommendations on means of strengthening the statutory control and supervision of oil terminals even if such recommendations will involve the amendment and extension of the 1979 Regulations.  The Tribunal did not understand Counsel for the Attorney General to submit otherwise.</P>
    <P>There was an example where a tribunal of inquiry was established and following its establishment regulations were passed in an area which was broadly being examined by the tribunal of inquiry.  Because the tribunal of inquiry was specifically enabled by the resolution of both Houses to make recommendations it felt it was empowered to, and did make recommendations in relation to the 1979 regulations. This is a clear example of where it is expressly helpful when establishing the tribunal of inquiry to ensure that there is an enabling clause.  Obviously, if the tribunal does not see fit to make any recommendations that is a matter for the <Col N="728" /> tribunal.  At the same time in this extremely important area it would seem very desirable that there would be the expressed power and capacity in the tribunal to make whatever recommendations it saw fit in the body of the report. If one looks at the model of the Whiddy Island tribunal there were 45 recommendations made by the tribunal of inquiry, a number of which recommendations have not yet been implemented, but they are nonetheless as part of the output and public record of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Similarly, two years later, in February 1981, there were resolutions establishing the tribunal of inquiry into the Stardust tragedy.  The approach was a similar one. The resolution was divided into two parts, the first part saying that it is expedient that a tribunal be established to inquire into the following definite matters of urgent public importance and then setting out the immediate circumstances of the Artane fire.  The second section is as follows:</P>
    <P>...making such recommendations as the Tribunal, having regard to its findings, thinks proper in respect of the statutory and other provisions in relation to fire prevention, and means and systems of emergency escape from fire, their adequacy and enforcement and any other matters that the Tribunal considers relevant.</P>
    <P>The Stardust inquiry was enabled to and did exercise the power to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Minister when introducing these resolutions referred to the question of whether or not the tribunal should be enabled to make inquiries.  I would submit that his arguments on this are not in fact entirely convincing.  The Minister gives as his main argument that if there are to be criminal charges that is a matter for the DPP; if there are to be disciplinary measures arising from the inquiry that that is a matter for the Commissioner. There is no argument about that, but what we are concerned about in establishing this inquiry is to look closely at the detail of what happened in relation to the incidents surrounding this particular case <Col N="729" /> and to enable the tribunal to draw broad conclusions or inferences from that and, if the tribunal sees fit, to make recommendations arising from that.</P>
    <P>The distinguished chairman of the tribunal will be a judge of the High Court and he will be perfectly aware of which is the appropriate body to pursue the possibility of any criminal prosecution or to pursue any disciplinary measures that may follow.  But the tribunal itself should have a role to play in relation to the deeper and the longer-term consequences of what happened in and surrounding the events in Kerry which are the subject matter of this inquiry.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the subject matter in order to develop in a little more detail why I feel the tribunal should have the power to make recommendations. The motion refers, first of all, in paragraph (1), to the facts and circumstances leading to the preferment on 1 May 1984 of criminal charges against a number of members of the Hayes family in connection with the death of an unnamed male infant and subsequent events which led to the deplorable charges at Tralee District Court.  Paragraph (2) relates to the related allegations made by members of those families in written statements to their solicitor concerning the circumstances surrounding the questioning and the taking of statements from those persons on 1 May 1984.</P>
    <P>In themselves, those terms of reference are broad enough to allow a very detailed consideration of all the circumstances but I would have hoped that the House, in passing this motion and enabling the establishment of the inquiry, was not just concerned about what happened in relation to the Hayes family and the members of the Garda with whom they came into contact in County Kerry on certain dates. It is surely also of the utmost importance that we have an understanding of the kinds of pressures which persons can be subjected to by being brought into a Garda station in the light of what actually happened in this particular case and in a broader sense what may be the effect on persons being interrogated while being <Col N="730" /> detained in Garda custody.  I should have thought that the fact that a tribunal of inquiry is being established, which is a very elaborate, very costly, and a very time consuming process, means that we must give it the power to look very closely at what is the effect on an ordinary citizen, on a man or woman or young person, of being brought in and questioned in a Garda station.  Therefore, in looking at what happened in relation to the Kerry incident the tribunal could also avail of any research or any examination which has taken place of the possible effects of interrogation in detention and the effects of being kept for sustained periods without perhaps knowing what the outcome is going to be and where there is constant questioning.</P>
    <P>In this regard the tribunal &mdash; I ask the Minister to respond specifically to this and to say if this will be possible &mdash; I hope would be able to look at the research that has, for example, been carried out by Amnesty International into the potential effect of periods of detention, of sustained periods of interrogation on persons. This is the kind of empirical research which we very badly need.  We need to know what are the potential effects of bringing people into custody and the effect of prolonged questioning of a person in isolation from others whom the person may know are in the Garda station, and the putting of certain matters to the person.  It is not enough, in my submission, to resolve some of the factual issues in the Kerry case that may go some way towards explaining how detailed statements were made by members of a family in relation to the alleged murder of a baby which it appears for scientific reasons, among others, they were not in a position to have carried out or to have any part in.  That appears to be the situation. As yet we do not know definitively what the result of the outcome of the inquiry will be.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to know just the nitty-gritty of what happened in the Garda station in Kerry.  If we are establishing a tribunal of inquiry it should also be in a position to assess what the potential effect can be, why it is that it is possible <Col N="731" /> for a person, after a certain period of that kind, to make what appears to be completely false statements.  That just does not happen in one isolated case down in County Kerry.  That is a potential danger.  Nor does it always happen to anybody taken in for questioning by the Garda; of course not, but in so far as there are potential risks, in so far as the process can be disorientating, can be an occasion of very considerable pressure on the individual, these are the kind of things that we must know about if we are to provide the adequate safeguards and the necessary measures to ensure that there will not be a repetition of the incidents in Kerry.</P>
    <P>Another cause of concern about the terms of reference here is that they are to too great an extent narrowly focused on the circumstances surrounding the Kerry babies deaths.  It is proper that that would be the subject of the inquiry but it is extremely important in establishing a tribunal of inquiry that the tribunal be able to come forward with recommendations and with conclusions from the inquiry which have a broader and longer-term implication.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that there has been considerable debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas in the context of the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill on this whole area of the safeguards which would be considered to be necessary and desirable for persons detained in Garda custody.  He also said that there would be a further opportunity for both Houses to consider this area and these issues in the context of the Bill establishing an independent complaints machinery and also the draft regulations under section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act.  That is true, but there again the debates that have taken place in both Houses have not looked in a detailed and structured way at the effect of periods of detention on people who are unaccustomed to a Garda station.  It is slightly different in the case of the hardened criminal who might be well aware of all the surrounding circumstances of being detained and who may be very clever and <Col N="732" /> very cute about saying absolutely nothing and who may be able, in fact, to play the system for all that person is worth.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the ordinary citizen in the circumstances, as one understands them, of the members of the Hayes family who find themselves in a Garda station being questioned by gardaí whom they never knew before or met before and the effects that that has, apart from any possible allegations &mdash; and I understand there have been some allegations of other types of pressure being used &mdash; or can have on persons if they are kept for a long period and what kinds of pressures build up which might run the risk of inducing them to sign statements which contain matter which is completely untrue and unfounded but which they sign simply in order to get out of the pressure and the feeling of being trapped within the Garda station while they want to get home out of it.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that we ensure that the tribunal of inquiry will look closely and in detail at all of these aspects.  I think it would be very beneficial if the tribunal of inquiry, having looked closely at these aspects and having &mdash; we hope &mdash; inquired into the research that is being carried out &mdash; I have mentioned the research by Amnesty International and there are other bodies carrying out research into the effect of detention and interrogation on persons and I think this information should be available to the inquiry &mdash; if then, in coming to certain conclusions, the tribunal decides that it wishes to make recommendations it should surely feel empowered in the same way as the Whiddy Island inquiry felt empowered, to make recommendations which might relate to legislation or regulations adopted subsequent to the establishment of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>This is where the Whiddy Island inquiry is a very pertinent one to look at. It is a very good model for the establishment of this inquiry because, as I have said already, Mr. Justice Declan Costello in his report construed the terms of the resolution and the part of it which empowered the tribunal to make recommendations as including the capacity to <Col N="733" /> make recommendations in relation to regulations which were passed after the events and after the establishment of the inquiry itself.  That is something which could be of very real value here because the Minister has said that the next stage in relation to this inquiry is that he will make the necessary order establishing it and presumably the tribunal will then start to sit in January and will start to hear evidence and then it will ultimately report in a period after that.  It might be hard to assess at this stage how long it will take to hear the necessary evidence and have time to make its assessment.  It may very well be that at that stage the regulations under section 7 of the present Criminal Justice Act &mdash; it is hard to call it the Criminal Justice Act because we are used to calling it the Criminal Justice Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, I know.  I am naming it correctly.  Under section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act these regulations may well be passed and may have been the subject of positive resolutions before both Houses of the Oireachtas but this tribunal, having looked very closely and in detail at one particular incident and the circumstances surrounding it and also looked at research which is available into the effects of detention, or circumstances such as these in Garda stations, might well make recommendations for further improvements in the regulations or, if the regulations that are still in draft, for additions to the draft regulations. Why are we closing that off?  Why are we not saying this is why it is worthwhile establishing a tribunal of inquiry?  There is no doubt that most evidence in relation to the Stardust inquiry was very expensive. By the time all legal costs are paid and all the time of the legal profession involved is taken account of, a tribunal of inquiry is a very elaborate process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it is extremely welcome that this elaborate process is being invoked and is being established to inquire into the incidents in Kerry.  I do not think that <Col N="734" /> it should be a short-term, narrow focus into what happened during certain days and weeks in County Kerry.  It should be established with a view to learning from that what the medium and longer-term lessons are and that can only happen if the tribunal is empowered to make recommendations.  Given the fact that the Whiddy Island tribunal had to affirm its authority to make recommendations I urge the Minister to look again at this.  I do not think it would be the end of the world if the Minister were to decide to amend this motion and take it back to the Dáil, as amended, and give the tribunal power to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this would be one way of allaying the unease and the broader fears which exist and indeed there has been very widespread public concern about what happened in County Kerry.  But the concern is a broader one than that and it will require that the tribunal have the authority and that it be enabled, if it sees fit, to make more long-term recommendations in order to ensure that we have adequate safeguards in our law and in our regulations for the protection of persons to ensure that there cannot be any future incidents such as happened in Kerry and which give rise to widespread public concern.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider the possibility of enabling the tribunal specifically to make recommendations.  It is very important that it have that power because of the vital concern about this whole area in view of the fact that we have passed the Criminal Justice Act and relatively shortly, presumably, we will see the Minister bringing into operation the relevant sections of it which allow for Garda detention.  In those circumstances it seems to be strangely shortsighted not to wish to have the independent assessment of this tribunal in its recommendations. I do not accept that this is covered by paragraph (3).  Paragraph (3) says that the tribunal can look at any matters connected or relevant to the matters aforesaid which the tribunal considers it necessary to investigate in connection with their inquiries into the matters mentioned <Col N="735" /> at paragraphs 1 and 2 &mdash;&ldquo;Which the tribunal considers it necessary to investigate&rdquo;.  If that can be interpreted as being broad enough to allow the kind of inquiry that I have been talking about, where the tribunal can examine the research that exists at international level into the effects of periods of detention, and if the tribunal can, in interpreting paragraph (3) make recommendations within its report, perhaps it is not necessary to have a specific amendment.</P>
    <P>I am concerned lest an issue might arise in the course of the deliberations of the tribunal and it might be put to the tribunal by counsel for the Attorney General that the tribunal could only examine events immediately surrounding the Kerry incident and could not look beyond that for a better understanding of what happened in Kerry and what lessons we can draw from that.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister is able to assure us very positively that this is covered by the present motion then we are missing an opportunity at a time when it is vital that this inquiry discharges the full task of inquiring into, drawing any conclusions from and making any necessary recommendations on the incidents that happened in Kerry earlier this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We support the motion to establish a tribunal to hold an inquiry into the &ldquo;Kerry babies&rdquo; case.  The motion is a necessary response to issues of considerable public importance and also a response to public disquiet caused by this case.  I have a very high regard for the Garda.  The great majority of gardaí carry out their duties within the rules.  I want to pay tribute to them for the way they carry out their important work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to understand why the tribunal, as proposed, does not include an express power to make recommendations.  I quote from the terms of reference of the Whiddy case which says &ldquo;making such recommendations (if any) as the tribunal, having regard to its findings, thinks proper&rdquo;.  That is worded in a general way but it would meet our disquiet in this case.  Similarly, in the case of the Stardust <Col N="736" /> inquiry the presiding judge was empowered to make recommendations.  Both tribunals requested the judge to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that if there are criminal matters arising out of the report of inquiry the DPP can deal with those matters and also if there are disciplinary matters arising out of the report the Garda Commissioner can deal with those.  What about the issues that fall into neither category?  What about issues that may arise with regard to the conduct of investigations and the treatment of people in custody?  These are the issues &mdash; the third category if you like &mdash; that we debated at great length in the course of our discussions over many days on the Criminal Justice Act.  It is self-evident that there is considerable concern about the independence of the proposed complaints procedure.  The judge in this tribunal will be in the best position to make recommendations and not the Department of Justice or the Minister for Justice, with respect.  We want the presiding judge in this tribunal to have the power to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>Lest the Minister regards the Whiddy model for making recommendations as too broadly drawn, could I suggest an amendment confining the terms more narrowly as follows:</P>
    <P>To make recommendations in connection with the matters investigated as may appear appropriate, including recommendations as to the treatment and interrogation of persons in custody and the conduct of criminal investigations by members of the Garda.</P>
    <P>I previously expressed concern that the complaints procedure and the safeguards were not published simultaneously with the Bill.  I felt that there was something of a pig-in-the-poke nature in discussing the Bill without seeing the essential ingredients of the complaints procedure and of the regulations.</P>
    <P>It is very much in the interest of this House and in the interest of the public to approach the matter along the lines I have suggested and to empower the judge <Col N="737" /> in this tribunal to make recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion.  It is true that the House has welcomed the decision by the Minister to set up the tribunal of inquiry into the Kerry babies case.  We do not welcome the reason for the setting-up of the tribunal but we welcome the fact that the Minister has taken it upon himself to do so.  I think in the light of public opinion it was imperative that the Minister take this action.  In joining in the general welcome, it would be remiss of me if I did not express my disappointment that the internal Garda inquiry which has taken place failed to get to the bottom of the case.  This case has caused considerable public anxiety. Everybody admits that there were areas of coincidence surrounding the case. Accepting that there were areas of coincidence where a baby was found obviously murdered and a mother was discovered afterwards to have given birth to a baby, the Garda proceeded with their inquiries along those lines.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from information available that the normal, accepted procedures do not appear to have been followed in this case, the procedure of collating evidence and checking on blood types, and other procedures that would be expected by normal law-abiding citizens to be taken by gardaí in the course of their inquiries.  We will not know until the inquiry is complete how innocent people confessed to something they had not done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate that a public tribunal with the powers written into this motion should be set up to ascertain all the facts. I hope for the safeguarding of the Garda and the confidence people have in them that when the full facts are known in this case, the public will be reassured that they can depend on an element of justice when they find themselves in an investigatory procedure such as this.  Nobody has any sympathy for the hardened criminals who get pulled in quite often and know all the rules and regulations and how to overcome them, but when innocent people are involved it is frightening to <Col N="738" /> think that by some process of investigation confessions can be got from people who as we know, were proven to be innocent.</P>
    <P>We also know of the other baby who, apparently, was murdered and we are aware to date that some guilty person is still free and has not been brought to justice and has not been subjected to any questioning.  I would like an assurance from the Minister &mdash; no doubt he will give it &mdash; that an investigation into the case of the second baby is proceeding and if that baby was murdered, as the evidence indicates, the criminal will be brought to justice.  If that case is not seen to be pursued actively people will lose confidence due to the fact that we are now concentrating our efforts on an innocent person who had been charged while a person who is guilty has still not been charged.  Do I take it that investigations are still going on and that the Garda in Kerry have not being frightened off from what should be their duty by the fact that an error might have been made in this particular case?  It worries me that an unfortunate baby was brutally murdered. It is in all our interests that somebody is brought to justice for that crime as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words on the points that have been made by Senator Robinson and Senator Hillery and just act as Devil's advocate to the Minister. The Minister said that the tribunal will be asked, by the terms of this motion, to report to him.  What is the difference between reporting to the Minister and recommending to him?  The Minister has proved by his actions recently that he is a Minister who is prepared to act in delicate cases, in areas of controversy.  I have no doubt whatever that if a report comes to him from this tribunal that necessitates action in the House of the Oireachtas he will take such action.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how long this tribunal will sit but if the new Bill setting up an independent complaints commission and all those other procedures have been passed before the tribunal have completed <Col N="739" /> their inquiry and if recommendations come from the tribunal surely it will strengthen the hands of legislators if they feel that action is necessary.  I have no doubt that if the results of the tribunal indicate that action is necessary the Minister will take it.  I hope if recommendations are made that they will strengthen the hands of legislators.  I accept the Minister's reasoning that if certain findings from this tribunal indicate that there should be criminal charges brought, that the necessary action will be taken by the DPP or if disciplinary action should be taken by the Commissioner that that will follow.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that the question of taking action for the future may arise but he suggests that this would follow logically and would be self-evident from the findings of the tribunal.  I also accept the Minister's statement that in the course of setting up the safeguards in the Criminal Justice Act, tape recording and all the statutory code of practice governing the treatment of persons in Garda stations will be accounted for.  The Minister stated that if there are any obvious lessons to be learned from the findings of the tribunal touching on matters that are not already covered in the Criminal Justice Act, or to be covered in proposed regulations, that action would be taken.</P>
    <P>I concur with the arguments that Senator Robinson and Senator Hillery made, that if recommendations come from this tribunal it would make it obligatory on the Minister, any future Minister or, indeed, the Houses of the Oireachtas, to take action in areas that we felt would not already be covered.  I have no doubt that the Minister has looked at all the implications in this and I look forward to his reply.  Those are my sentiments.  I can see no reason why the tribunal would not have the power to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with the principle of the tribunal recommending to the Minister if they consider action is necessary. Perhaps the Minister considers that already he has sufficient powers to act on <Col N="740" /> the findings without a specific recommendation. If that is the situation, then it is as well to have it on the record of this House.  Then at some future date, if matters arise in this area, we will be able to point to the fact that in this House there was a commitment that if action was necessary in this area &mdash; outside areas already covered in the ordinary criminal code or disciplinary code in the Garda Síochána &mdash; the Houses of the Oireachtas would be empowered to point to this debate and say there was an assurance given by a Minister that if any other action was necessary he would take it. The public will expect us to take action.</P>
    <P>It is important that we make a constructive submission to the Minister in relation to the setting-up of this tribunal. It should deal with the whole principle of the detention of people by the Garda for questioning.  That does not take from the importance of the inquiry dealing with the Kerry babies situation which has caused widespread disquiet and regret.  I am sure the ordinary rank and file members of the Garda are as upset as anybody else in the country that these things should happen.  It is appropriate that the Minister has taken the courage to set up the tribunal.  I have expressed concern that the evidence that should have been available did not come through the normal internal Garda process.  I believe the Garda would have come out better in this particular case if that had happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any of us could take issue with the need to do what is contained in the motion.  Bearing in mind that the Minister in this House and in the other House and, at various stages, the entire senior officer corps of the Garda Síochána, have told us that they had no power until the Criminal Justice Act was passed to detain people for questioning it is somewhat intriguing that in the terms of reference of this judicial inquiry no specific reference is made to the circumstances under which the people named in this motion were actually brought into Garda custody.  The circumstances of their making a confession are mentioned.  I would have thought, <Col N="741" /> since were told that it was a fundamental basis of the need for a large part of the Criminal Justice Bill that no such power existed, that the actual decision of the Garda and the manner in which they brought four people, who apparently are innocent, into custody and questioned them at length, would be part of the investigation.</P>
      <P>It appears &mdash; I will go through a number of things about this judicial inquiry &mdash; to those of us who perhaps do not share the Minister's credulous attitude to the activities of a section of the Garda that there are a number of question marks.  The first is were these people in lawful custody in the first place or were they in fact held in unlawful custody by the Garda at the time?  I assume that under paragraph (3) something can be done there.  It seems extraordinary, in the light of the fuss that was made about the lack of such powers on the part of the Garda, that no reference was made in the terms of reference for this tribunal of inquiry to the fact that the people were apparently under the impression that they were in custody for questioning, which is something we were told the Garda could not do.  Apparently they did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It could have been put in in much more explicit detail if the Minister intended it to be considered. With respect, the terms of reference that I read could possibly mean that but given the fact that I am a good deal more suspicious of a lot of these things the fact that it could possibly be read into it does not necessarily mean that it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to be thankful for progress.  I am very glad that this tribunal of inquiry is being set up.  I would hate to interpret it otherwise.  I suppose we can recognise progress when it is made but there are various aspects of what the Minister has to say that profoundly disturb me.  One of these is the fact that the Garda could not resolve the conflicts of opinion.  My experience in the past, when I have asked <Col N="742" /> senior Garda officers to investigate complaints, is that they never have any problems in resolving conflicts of opinion because the investigator always believes the gardaí.  I can give the Minister a long list of examples in which the final outcome of any investigation that I asked about was: &ldquo;The gardaí deny the allegation, therefore, we do not see any point in pursuing it,&rdquo; or words to that effect. Presumably, the reason there is a further investigation in this case is not because of the difficulty in resolving conflicts of evidence but because the public concern is at such a level that we have to do something to resolve those complaints. Therefore, I suppose we are making progress. There are many other areas in which I could give the Minister a long list of complaints, going back to a famous murder case in Cork in the middle seventies in which complaints about the treatment of persons in custody, made by an eminent solicitor, were never even replied to not to mention investigated.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the major difference here is the level of public concern, not really the fact that a conflict of evidence could not be resolved.  Secondly, the circumstances that are now unfolding would seriously inhibit any innocent person from making allegations against the Garda.  My sympathy goes out to the people named in this motion who will be subjected to the most rigorous and public cross-examinations because of statements they made.  By and large, not judging the circumstances under which they made certain confessions, most people will accept that innocent people were being charged with an offence they could not have committed, yet the consequences for all of them will be a harrowing experience of severe cross-examination by some of the most eminent legal people in the country.  These are vulnerable, ordinary innocent people who simply felt they were suffering an injustice.  They will suffer enormously, irrespective of the outcome of this inquiry.</P>
    <P>This leads on to the central question that has been raised on a number of occasions, that is the absence of any provision <Col N="743" /> for the inquiry to make recommendations. The fact that the Minister does not think this inquiry needs to make recommendations is all very well and he may well be quite satisfied with his own judgment in these matters, his own perceptions and his own understandings, but it is entirely another matter to decide that the tribunal does not need powers to make recommendations.  They are two very different things.  It is not up to the usual quality of the Minister's logic and powers of argument to suggest that the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Garda Commissioner will take the necessary action.  That is not at all an adequate reason for saying that recommendations cannot be made.</P>
    <P>There is the extraordinary suggestion that questions of taking action for the future will follow logically and be self-evident. If matters of this nature were both logical and self-evident we would not have had the intense debate on the Criminal Justice Bill, regrettably, now the Criminal Justice Act, that we had in both Houses for the last 18 months. Because certain matters were not either logical or self-evident we had an intense debate.  The issues that arise are precisely the issues in regard to which what should be done is not self-evident.</P>
    <P>I regret having to say I have some questions about what are the real reasons for excluding recommendations from this.  One of the suspicions I have is that there is a fear abroad that this investigation might make recommendations which might sound suspiciously like those parts of the Ó Briain Report that were not incorporated in recent legislation, particularly the right to have and the insistence on having a third party present during Garda questioning.  The second thing is that it would be very difficult to proceed with legislation for a complaints procedure and the proper care of persons in Garda custody if we were awaiting the outcome of a tribunal which has the power to make recommendations.  It is conceivable that the fact that the tribunal will attempt to state things clearly will be open to the interpretation, by the Minister <Col N="744" /> and the Government, that the tribunal and the regulations cover all the conclusions adequately, whereas specific recommendations for future behaviour will be much more difficult to ignore.</P>
    <P>On another occasion Senator Michael Higgins described the minimalist approach, to minimise the damage to the institutions of the State and at the same time have the minimalist sense of justice being seen to be done.  That is the only conclusion I can come to from what is a most inadequately argued case for not having recommendations from the Minister in view of the level of public concern that is evident in regard to this case.  The Minister has this extraordinarily naïve attitude in regard to how certain sections of the Garda operate.  It is probably on the basis of the advice he gets.  I have complained to senior officers and to the Garda Commissioner about what I would regard as racist remarks about the travelling people by a senior Garda officer. To suggest that the Garda Commissioner knew what was the appropriate action to take is being extremely charitable to him since his final conclusion was that he did not see the programme and he could not comment on it.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that senior Garda officers necessarily know what is the appropriate action to take because they often feel that the appropriate action to take, as was evidenced in the fingerprints case recently, is to minimise the damage rather than deal with the injustice.  I would respectfully suggest that what we are liable to get out of this inquiry is a couple of innocent junior gardaí becoming official scapegoats.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible, if there are conclusions which are unfavourable to the Garda, that the conclusions will be couched in such a way that it will be a couple of junior gardaí who will suffer rather than that a detailed analysis of the procedures under which the Garda are managed would be produced and on which recommendations could be made for future progress.  It is unfortunately a minimalist approach.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, to some extent, trivialised some of the questions that other <Col N="745" /> people have raised.  He talked about the suggestion that if it had not been for the newspaper reports there would have been a miscarriage of justice and produced a very conclusive statement of facts that the case had been withdrawn before the matter came to the public's attention.  Technically he is correct. It would not be appropriate to use the term &ldquo;miscarriage of justice&rdquo; but a profound injustice would have been done to the people in question if it had not been for the publicity given to this case.</P>
    <P>We have no evidence to suggest that if it had not been for the publicity that the media gave to this case anything other than an internal Garda inquiry would have taken place.  I hasten to add, as evidence of my suspicions that nothing else would have happened, that as in the case of Nicky Kelly the examination of the allegations was cursory.  It was the minimum that could be done to say that an investigation was carried out.</P>
    <P>I do not share the Minister's benign view of the way the Establishment operates to protect itself in society.  While I would not oppose this motion I do not share the optimism of many people that this will get to the root of not just this case but the problem with the Garda that is widely perceived, that the standards that are being practised by a large minority of members of the Garda Síochána are below those that the community are entitled to expect and that the people most wounded by the inadequacy of Garda standards are those who compose the remainder of the Garda force who suffer more than anybody else from the inadequacies of some of their members.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the crunch the Establishment almost invariably believes itself. In this case the wording of this motion is such as to ensure that any damage that is done to the Establishment &mdash; in that I include the law enforcement agencies &mdash; will be minimal and will not be able to suggest that there are any fundamental inadequacies in the way the Garda do their business.  It is regrettable that a Minister whom I have, to my embarrassment on some occasions, commended before for his ability to argue a case, has <Col N="746" /> left himself open to an accusation of a fundamental lack of logic and thought in the way he justified the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the best possible recommendations, and possible future planning and decision-making for the Garda, be assisted by the tribunal and that the terms should be amended to include recommendations as to the future because that really is the core of public concern on this issue.  There are two things.  How and why did it happen and secondly, how can we prevent it happening again?  Leaving the second entirely to the conclusions of the Minister and the Garda Commissioner on the basis of the facts as established is to me entirely inadequate and leaves as many questions unanswered as the present situation does.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I was not here when this debate commenced but I was detained on my way here.  Nevertheless I have listened with interest to the comments that have been made by other Senators. I also have had the opportunity of reading the Minister's speeches here today and in the Dáil yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are discussing the establishment of a tribunal under the Tribunals of Inquiry Acts, 1921 and 1979.  We have before us a pretty specific motion.  We are not discussing the establishment of a commission which will examine every aspect of the operation of the Garda Síochána.  We are discussing a specific case.  I find it difficult to agree with the logic of certain Senators who are suggesting that the scope should be far broader than that.  We are discussing a very bizarre and Agatha Christie-type case and one which requires the ability of somebody like Agatha Christie to resolve it.  It is something very specific.  The procedure available to us is a satisfactory one.  The establishment of statutory tribunals in this country has been used for very specific matters and matters of public concern.  The Whiddy disaster and the Stardust disaster are two recent examples of that.  Statute, in effect, provides for the establishment of an inquiry conducted by the High Court, presided over by a High Court judge, an <Col N="747" /> inquiry with the power of subpoena, with the power of discovery; an inquiry which gives to witnesses the privilege which witnesses would normally have in High Court proceedings.  Furthermore, the 1979 Act gives to the tribunal the discretion to award costs in favour of a party to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>So far as the Kerry babies' case is concerned it is only right and proper that this case should be examined and investigated by a tribunal of this nature.  It is also right that we appreciate the fact that this case came to light at a time when the Houses of the Oireachtas were debating amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill, which, in effect, dealt with the issue as to whether certain controversial provisions of that legislation should come into effect until a Garda complaints procedure was in existence.</P>
    <P>At the very same time the courts were considering another case in which criminal charges were preferred against gardaí arising out of the death of Mr. Matthews in a Garda station in County Cavan. The public, who, on the one hand, had been expressing concern about the lack of powers which the Garda had and who were expressing concern at the fact that the Garda appeared to be unable to cope with our criminal problem, on the other hand, were suddenly faced with two situations which suggested to them that the Garda were operating in a very improper fashion.  Both of these cases, in the manner in which they were publicised at that time, very clearly gave the impression to the public that the Garda throughout the length and breadth of this country in the broad investigation of crime were acting in an improper way.</P>
    <P>Media headlines can often give an improper view of what is happening.  This evening's <i>Evening Press</i>, which I picked up on my way here, has a headline &ldquo;Lawyers lash rogue Gardaí&rdquo;.  That headline caught my attention as I was passing by a newsstand.  That is the kind of headline that casts a reflection on the entire Garda force and draws the public attention from specific cases and gives the impression that improper things are happening in <Col N="748" /> broad practice.  It is that conflict, on the one hand, the impression that is conveyed to the public that the Garda are across the board acting in an improper way and on the other hand, the concern that the public have that the Garda should have increased powers, which really is an issue when we are debating this today.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that this motion and the need to establish this tribunal is considered.  It must also be considered on the basis of the very specific allegations which have been made in this case.  Obviously something happened which has not yet been explained, despite an internal Garda inquiry.  These Garda inquiries operate in a very narrow way.  The people who conduct them do not have the powers necessary to compel attendance of witnesses or to extract the evidence that can be required to give a conclusive result. Nevertheless, despite the internal inquiry, which has been inconclusive, serious allegations have been made.  It is only right and proper that the Minister for Justice and both Houses of the Oireachtas should establish a tribunal to allay public fears with regard to that issue.</P>
    <P>It is very important that this opportunity be used, in so far as it relates to a specific case, to help to restore confidence in the gardaí.  The Minister in the Dáil yesterday referred to the services the gardaí have given to the State since its foundation and since their establishment. That is something that we accept.  The Minister also said other things in his speech which give cause for concern.  He said in the Dáil yesterday:</P>
    <P>I am not to be taken as implying that I necessarily accept that every person involved was justified in extending to the two Garda investigators only the particular degree of co-operation which was in fact extended.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister makes this curious comment, having stated the obvious:</P>
    <P>I am not commenting at all on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> There are, as I have said, conflicting versions of events and those conflicting versions have not been resolved.  I hope that the establishment of this inquiry will resolve those conflicting versions.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference have been criticised by some Members of this House and also by some Members of the other House.  The terms of reference simply impose on the tribunal the obligation to establish the reasons for the preferring of charges in the first case, the reason for the withdrawing of these charges, secondly and related allegations by the Hayes family.  More importantly, the third term of reference states:</P>
    <P>any matters connected with or relevant to the matters aforesaid which the tribunal considers it necessary to investigate in connection with their inquiries into the matters mentioned at (1) and (2).</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any matters connected with it&rdquo; is pretty specific, but &ldquo;any matters relevant to the matters aforesaid&rdquo; would seem to me to be pretty broad.  I do not agree with the criticism of the terms of reference No. 3, that it is narrow.  There is a broad term of reference there and I believe that the tribunal of inquiry, having heard the evidence, will be entitled to look at the matter in a broad way on the basis of that phraseology.</P>
    <P>This was a most bizarre saga.  It is a saga which has caused a lot of concern to the people and a lot of concern to the Garda.  From the point of view of restoring public confidence in the Garda and from the point of view of giving the Garda the reassurance which they need, this inquiry should be established.  I fully support the motion before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief, not because I do not feel strongly about this matter &mdash; I do, as I believe most people do &mdash; but there is not much of a constructive nature that I could add to what has already been said. I welcome the decision to establish the tribunal.  It is very important for the Hayes family, a decent, hard-working family, who were brought into this unfortunate <Col N="750" /> situation.  It is very important for Joanne Hayes, a young lady whose private life has been made public, and presumably will be made more public during the course of this tribunal.  It is very important for the Garda who have very serious charges to answer.  I do not see how they can answer those charges.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to a few of the aspects that have already been dealt with such as the failure of the internal Garda investigation.  It is difficult to understand how a body like the Garda whose job it is to investigate all these things internally and who had all the evidence at their disposal, could fail to find the solution.</P>
      <P>Investigation by interrogation was referred to during the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill.  The fears expressed by many people seem to have been justified in this case &mdash; where Joanne Hayes told the Garda that she had placed the body of her own baby in a certain place and they did not bother to go to see if that was so.  The ill-treatment and the pressure by the Garda in getting those decent people to sign confessions to a crime which they could not have committed and the signing of those statements with such graphic details have been covered and I shall not go into them again but I do say that this case and the Shercock case and many other cases have cast a gloom over the Garda Síochána. As Members have said on this motion and during the discussion of the Criminal Justice Bill, the Garda Síochána is a body of which we may all be proud.</P>
      <P>Recommendations were made by different people as to what could be done to improve the Garda Síochána such as better recruitment and better training.  I subscribe to all of these.  Those members of the Garda Síochána who are not fit to be in the force for whatever reason should be taken out of it, whether it is excessive zeal or enthusiasm or whatever.  They have no place in the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the media for their exposure of this case and many other cases and their eternal vigilance.  The Minister did say that the suggestion was made that were it not for the publicity <Col N="751" /> regarding this case a grave miscarriage of justice might have occurred but he rejected that suggestion absolutely and said nothing could be further from the truth.  He went on to say that the charges against members of the Hayes family were withdrawn in Tralee District Court on Wednesday, 10 October.  The story was not published until the following Sunday, 14 October.</P>
    <P>Most people would feel that the investigation must have taken a considerable time.  It certainly was not carried out in those four days and there would be a suspicion in my mind, and I am sure in many people's minds, that it was well known that this investigation was being carried out by the media, by the papers and that perhaps there are some people who would still believe that were it not for this exposure by the media this case might not have ended in this way.  We have so many other situations where we could use our imagination and wonder was justice done.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to speak about the decision not to include recommendations in the terms of reference of the tribunal. I think it is a mistake.  The tribunal should have been asked to make recommendations. At least if not asked to make recommendations the tribunal should have been allowed to make recommendations if they felt that these were necessary. I understand they are debarred from making recommendations, because the Minister said: &ldquo;I do not propose to give the tribunal power to make recommendations for those reasons&rdquo;.  I think that is a mistake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the motion and to express my thanks to the Government and to the Minister for setting up a tribunal to investigate this matter.  I consider the terms of reference to be adequate, and consequently I will refrain from any further comment until the result of the inquiry is debated in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the fact that the tribunal, as Senator Fitzsimons said, is <Col N="752" /> unable to make recommendations, because in inquiries of this nature such as Whiddy and Stardust where there has been loss of life it has been standard practice and procedure that the tribunal would be empowered to make recommendations, and in the so-called Kerry babies case it is a fact that lives have been lost.  It strikes me as being a defect that the Minister and the Government do not see their way to allow the tribunal to make recommendations.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this tribunal of inquiry is being set up.  I also welcome the fact that where members of the Garda have been involved in breaking the laws that they are sworn to uphold they have been brought to justice.  I do not accept that there is a general lack of confidence on the part of members of the general public in the Garda Síochána as a force.  There is concern about a minority of people who should never in the first place have been admitted to the Garda.  There is concern about the admission procedures even now, that people who may be physically suitable are psychologically unsuited for the role they have to play in society but I do not accept that there is a general lack of confidence in the Garda as a law-keeping force in this State.  I do believe that people are disturbed at the apparent frequency in which members of the Garda are involved in breaking the law which they have sworn to uphold.</P>
      <P>Public confidence in the Minister for Justice is well placed.  Since he took office he has demonstrated that as far as he is concerned as Minister for Justice in this Government, the rights of the citizen are paramount and there is nobody above the law.  The Minister as the office holder in this particular case adds to the feeling I have expressed that there is no general lack of confidence in the Garda as a force or in the Minister as Minister for Justice but there is, as I said, some disquiet about certain elements within the Garda.  There are people who ought not to have been members in the first place, being psychologically unsuited for the position they now have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> Senator Fitzsimons mentioned a number of the facts in relation to the Kerry babies case, and it certainly struck me that incompetence of a very high order would be the minimum charge you could lay against members of the force who investigated that case.  This inquiry will suspend the 2,000 inquiries that there are at the moment among ordinary members of the public pending the report the tribunal will give to the Minister. People will want action &mdash; let us have no doubt about that whatsoever &mdash; whether it is taken by the DPP or the Garda Commissioner.  The Minister cannot and will not be allowed by the public to escape the inescapable fact that action will have to be taken in this case when this report is through.  Nobody can be whitewashed, nobody ought to be whitewashed.  It is without doubt that if the people involved in this case are not guilty of serious crimes, they are guilty of gross incompetency at the very minimum, and I would sincerely hope that there will be no attempt whatsoever, irrespective of rank, to minimise the consequences for any person who is adjudged by the tribunal to have failed in his or her duty in relation to the investigation and prosecution of this case.  I support the inquiry.  I support the motion.  I am unhappy about the fact that the Government did not see their way to allow the tribunal to make recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I support the motion for setting up this inquiry and the tribunal that is to carry it out.  The Minister has acted perfectly rightly in doing this and in accepting that the internal Garda inquiry was not sufficient, not alone that it was not sufficient to deal with the actual justice or injustice of the matter but that it was not sufficient to deal with the most important factor that justice was not seen to be done, that there was public confidence involved.  The Minister in setting up this tribunal is responding to a definite feeling of public lack of confidence not, as has been said, in the Garda force as a whole but that there are things going on <Col N="754" /> that should not be going on and particularly in view of the atmosphere of the passing of the legislation contained in the Criminal Justice Bill that we should be presented with situations where the very fears that many of us have expressed about the questioning sections of the Criminal Justice Bill appear to have been justified by what has been going on.</P>
      <P>One of the things that one cannot help feeling in looking, for instance, at the story as it has appeared in the media about what is known as the Kerry babies case is that when the lady involved did give what later turned out to be a truthful account of what she had done about her own child, this was not investigated but she was pressured into confessing to something else.  One cannot help feeling that this is the sort of pressure that occurs if there is a limited amount of time in which a person can be questioned in a Garda station.  The gardaí are not going to waste that time in investigating things outside the Garda station; they are going to use that time to keep on applying pressure in order to get an admission of some sort.  That is the kind of fear that I would personally have expressed all along about the idea of people being able to be kept for a period of time in a Garda station for questioning.</P>
      <P>It is with all the more pleasure that I welcome the setting up of this tribunal and the appointment of the very learned judge who is to head it.  I would support its setting up.</P>
      <P>Like other Senators, including Senator Magner, I am sorry that the tribunal does not of itself have power to make recommendations. A Leas-Chathaoirligh, you will be aware of what can happen where committees or tribunals are not empowered to make recommendations and the difficulties that may arise, and I would not like to see this kind of situation evolve.  Perhaps the tribunal may be allowed to have opinions and make proposals, as was another well-known committee. It would finish off the thing better if the tribunal was allowed to make recommendations, and I would suggest that the Minister might amend his terms of reference so to provide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): First of all, I would like to thank the Senators for their contributions here.  Some of the contributions tended, in my opinion, to prejudge the situation. It inhibits me quite a lot from dealing with anything in great detail because now that the tribunal is being set up we have to approach it in an open manner and I do not think we should proceed on the basis that facts which have not been established by the tribunal have actually been established.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator Lanigan for his general welcome on behalf of his party for the tribunal.  Senator Deenihan asked specifically where the inquiry would be held.  This is a matter which is essentially up to the judge.  It would be only speculation on my part, but I would imagine that he would sit in Tralee at least for part of the time, so that evidence could be taken from people who are based in Tralee or near Tralee.  I would also envisage, and again it is speculation, that he would sit in Dublin because it would convenience himself in drawing up his report and establishing whatever conclusions he arrives at.  That is a matter for the judge himself but that would be the usual manner in which a tribunal such as this would be conducted.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank Senator Ross for his supportive statement and for putting the question in perspective and putting the difficulties in respect of certain incidents in perspective of the records of the Garda Síochána as a whole.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson in a major contribution referred to the Whiddy Tribunal and the Stardust Tribunal.  The only precedent in my area of responsibility that I am aware of is an inquiry in 1967 which dealt with the death of a person in Garda custody in the Bridewell in Cork.  The terms of reference of that inquiry are along the lines of the terms of reference that I put forward here, and they did not include a specific term of reference that recommendations should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Whiddy and Stardust we were dealing with highly technical matters about which ordinary people have no particular <Col N="756" /> knowledge.  The tribunal had its professional assessors in those cases, people who are technically competent.  In that case all the matters that could arise from the tribunal were examined and certain recommendations were made.</P>
    <P>In the case here, as I said in my introductory remarks, the same need does not arise for specific recommendations.  In a sense Senator Robinson, if you listen carefully to the remarks she made more clearly than I could, explained why it probably would not be appropriate to have a specific term of reference dealing with recommendations.  She argued that the tribunal should examine matters relating to questions of human psychology <i>in vaccuo</i>.  She argued that reports available, research available, should be made known and that people who conducted the research should come to the tribunal and should make recommendations based on their professional expertise about the effects of questioning people in isolation or in company.  Certainly these areas might be appropriate areas of investigation, but this tribunal is to establish the facts in a specific set of circumstances.  The kind of things Senator Robinson has argued for would be more appropriate for a general inquiry into the areas she suggests if such a general inquiry was thought desirable.  We have looked at many of these situations in the context of the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
    <P>If the conclusions of the tribunal indicate that criminal charges should be prefered that is a matter for the DPP and it is not appropriate for the tribunal to recommend that criminal charges should be preferred.  It is a matter of Garda discipline.  The Commissioner is the disciplinary officer.  He has statutory obligations as well as statutory powers to act in this situation.</P>
    <P>If it is a question of something having occurred in a Garda station in Tralee that should not have occurred then it will be self-evident from the report that if an abuse was perpetrated the abuse should stop.  I do not think we need anything more than a very strong report from the judge in that particular instance.  I do not see that the case which Senator Robinson <Col N="757" /> makes stands up, especially when we consider that we dealt with matters of safeguarding people in Garda custody when we debated the Criminal Justice Act. Also, we should not forget the Ó Briain report, where Judge Ó Briain and the two people who sat on that tribunal with him were specifically empowered to recommend safeguards for the treatment of people in Garda custody.</P>
    <P>I have committed myself to this House and to the other House that we would have two pieces of legislation, statutory safeguards to govern the treatment of people in custody.  Both Houses will have every opportunity to debate these safeguards in full.  We have also the question of an independent complaints procedure, again a piece of legislation which will go through all stages.</P>
    <P>If the tribunal, as I expect it will, makes a very, very full report, the conclusions in that report will certainly recommend themselves to us in a particular way and if action is needed to be taken then action will be taken.  I share the concern expressed here by every Senator.  But there were two dead babies in Kerry.  We should not proceed as if there was only one.  If we are to cry for dead babies we should cry for all dead babies and we should not proceed on the basis that we know everything, because if that is the case we do not need the tribunal.  The tribunal is being set up to establish what happened and the terms of reference are certainly specific enough on the one hand and wide enough on the other hand to give the judge absolute freedom with the powers of the tribunal, the powers to subpoena witnesses, the powers to cross-examine witnesses and the powers to look for documentation.  He has the powers there and I hope he will come up with the answers to the questions that we want answered.</P>
    <P>If the report on this case which the judge will present to me requires particular action then there will be particular action.  If the conclusions of the tribunal in a particular case give rise to a situation where we can move from the particular to the general and the general solutions are necessary arising from the specific <Col N="758" /> case, then I will not be averse to acting in that case either.</P>
    <P>In the light of Senator Robinson's contribution I would like to say that very frequently coming into the Dáil or the Seanad Senators and Deputies proceed as if the Minister was bringing in a train onto which they would hook various carriages. That is fine as far as it goes provided the engine of the train can carry the load, and in this instance we are giving a judge a specific job to do.  He has all the powers within the terms of reference and within the law governing tribunals of this sort to do that specific job.  I do not think we can ask him to take on other jobs which might make it difficult for him to do the specific job we are asking him to do and to do it in an expeditious way so that we can have a report in the short-term rather than in the long-term, because the public are concerned and will continue to be concerned until a report is presented to me and until that report is made available to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to the public.</P>
    <P>Various other Senators contributed along the same lines.  Some Senators asked specific questions.  I think I have answered them in my initial remarks. Senator Ferris in particular asked what would be the situation of the judge and what would the procedure actually be. Once the Seanad passes this motion I will proceed to set up the tribunal by order or by warrant.  The judge will make a report and the tribunal will make a report and the findings will be submitted to me. The conclusions of the report will be the basis for action.  I do not think it is necessary to go into the semantics of the difference between a report and recommendations arising from the report.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further that I should say at this point.  I would like to thank the various Senators for their contributions.  I share the concern of Senators.  I thank the Senators for their general support, and if certain Senators see things in a different light that is inevitable and I do not think there is any point in commenting on that today.</P>
    <P>I hope the tribunal will work expeditiously. <Col N="759" /> I certainly have every confidence in the eminent judge who will constitute the tribunal and I wish him every success in his difficult task.  I look forward to an expeditious report.  If action is necessary on foot of the conclusions of that report then there will be action.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Salmon, Eel and Oyster Fishing Licences (Alteration of Licence Duties) Order, 1984.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. D'Arcy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959, as amended, empowers the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry from time to time by order to alter salmon, eel and oyster fishing licence duties.  Whenever the Minister is proposing to make such an order he must lay a draft of the order before Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann and he cannot make the order until a resolution approving of the draft order has been passed by Seanad Éireann and by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry is satisfied in the light of the rate of inflation that salmon, eel and oyster fishing licences should be increased to take effect from 1 January 1985.  While the rate of inflation since these fishing licence duties were last increased on 1 January 1983 would justify an increase of 20 per cent, the Minister is restricting the increase to 15 per cent in view of the <Col N="760" /> reduced level of catches of salmon this year.</P>
    <P>In the event of the resolutions being passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, the implementation of the order will have the effect of increasing the estimated revenue from licence fees to £320,000 approximately in 1985, which would be an increase of about £40,000 over the 1984 figure.  I am aware that the commercial fishermen and some of the anglers will be unhappy at having to pay more for their licences in 1985.  I desire to point out to them, however, that the Exchequer is providing £1.1 million in 1985 towards the non-pay element of expenditure by the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards which is an increase of 46 per cent over the 1984 figure.  In addition, the Exchequer is providing £3.3 million in 1985 towards the cost of salaries and wages for Central and Regional Fisheries Boards' staffs.</P>
    <P>Accordingly I recommend to the House that this motion be passed approving of the draft order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Fianna Fáil are opposed in principle to this measure to increase duties on salmon, eel and oyster fishing licences, especially on salmon rod fishermen, eel fishermen and net fishermen, because we do not see that the amount which is expected to be brought in will be of any use to fishermen or to the fisheries boards.  It was a pity that when the Minister was speaking he did not state his general policy in relation to the whole inland fisheries industry.  It is not prudent to impose increases in fishery licences in view of the state of the country in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally recognised that salmon inland fisheries are in a seriously declining state and this will result in an extra burden on many licensed anglers which will have the ultimate result of some refusing to take out licences.  If there is a fall-off in the number of applications for licences it is inevitable that the Minister will not get the extra £40,000 he expects from the imposition of this measure. Everybody knows that the £40,000 will <Col N="761" /> not go anywhere when it is divided among the fisheries boards throughout the country who are in very severe financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>Development work on inland fisheries is at a standstill.  This was admitted as late as yesterday by Mr. Breathnach, chief of the Central Fisheries Board, as reported in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  The Central Fisheries Board's development activities are almost completely at a standstill.  The work initiated by the old Inland Fisheries Trust has not been completed because of lack of finance.  The regional boards are also financially embarrassed and waterkeepers are unable to control illegal fishing.  They are pushed to the limit to try to combat illegal fishing.</P>
    <P>Some very crude methods are used in illegal fishing.  The use of cyanide should be completely outlawed as it is a very cruel method of illegal fishing.  Some illegal operators can reap enormous financial benefits from such an operation.</P>
    <P>This new imposition will undermine the confidence of the genuine anglers who are not enjoying very much success at present.  This measure will not in any way curtail the activities of the illegal operators who have had such a harmful influence on our fisheries over the past few years.  We need direct cash for the central board and the regional boards to help them tackle the widespread illegal activities on our rivers and lakes.  Because of lack of finance the regional boards are able to provide only a skeleton staff for fisheries protection and the increasing of the licence fees will not supplement the finances of either the central or regional boards to the extent necessary to combat such illegal fishing.  It would be more proper if there were greater supervision of lakes and rivers to detect illegal fishing and impose greater fines for offences. thereby ensuring that our inland fishing would be protected.</P>
    <P>Tourism is also very badly hit because of lack of developed inland fisheries. Thousands of anglers could be attracted to fish on our many lakes and rivers which are envied by fishing patrons who have visited this country.  It could be of <Col N="762" /> immense benefit to the State and to the immediate community if a small effort were made to develop the inland fishing.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the angling associations throughout the country for their enormous interest in the inland fishing industry, especially in their efforts to stock and restock our rivers and lakes.  In this respect I might be somewhat parochial in complimenting the Deale Anglers Association on the great work they are doing in stocking and restocking the River Deale and its tributaries and also the lakes in its immediate area.  I am sure that other angling associations are doing similar work and only for their efforts the inland fisheries would be in dire trouble.</P>
    <P>I would appeal therefore to the Minister to recognise the enormous work that these anglers' associations are doing for the development of inland fishing and to find some way of giving them financial assistance at some time.</P>
    <P>Pollution is also a very serious hazard in inland fishing and caused 150 kills this year which resulted in losses of many thousands of pounds.  While pollution cannot be avoided, especially with the development of industry and agriculture which are vital to our economy, every effort should be made to ensure that pollution of our rivers and lakes is eliminated. The Government could provide some financial assistance by way of grant to encourage and help those whose developments probably cause pollution to install some facilities such as effluent tanks to eliminate the pollution of our lakes and rivers.  The Government should play a big part so as not to put undue expense on those people who are causing it because it could put them out of business. The Government should look sympathetically at this issue.</P>
    <P>I also understand that there is serious staff dissatisfaction in the Central Fisheries Board.  I understand a strike is threatened and I would appreciate if the Minister would inform the House what steps he is taking to ensure that strike action is not taken because it would have serious repercussions for our fishing <Col N="763" /> industry.  We are opposed to this measure in principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion.  I accept many of the points made by Senator Kiely and I would like to see many of his suggestions implemented when the resources are available.  I have spoken from the luxury of the other side of the House and I was as good as Senator Kiely at recommending that this, that and the other thing be done when it did not fall on the shoulders of the side of the House I represented to provide the necessary financial resources to put the measures into effect.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the proposed increase is enormous.  The Minister has pointed out in his speech that it is considerably less than the inflation figure would have justified.  It would have justified an increase of about 20 per cent. But this increase is 15 per cent, a total of about £40,000.</P>
      <P>I want to join in the tribute Senator Kiely paid to the work of the angling associations.  Worthwhile progress is being made.  I would share his views about the value of fishing to the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>It is not quite fair to suggest, as I understood Senator Kiely to suggest, that there is to be little or no Government input for 1985.  The Minister has made it clear that £1.1 million on the non-pay element is being allocated and £3.3 million is going towards the cost of wages and salaries of the staff of the central and the regional fisheries boards.  There is a contribution of almost £4.5 million at a time of scarce resources.  The increase that has been asked for is not major and there should not be any major objection to it.</P>

      <P>I have to agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Kiely.  I understand the increases are not very large and that angling clubs and associations would not have any serious objections to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The salmon inland fisheries are a cause of concern.  I will speak briefly with regard to the position in the Blackwater <Col N="764" /> area in Kells, County Meath, from which I come.  Up to 1981 the nets were taken up on Friday night and put back on Monday morning.  In 1981 181 salmon were caught with rod and line between Navan and Virginia.  In that year there was a very bad kill of fish in the river, including 103 salmon in a two-mile stretch from Kells. Since then the nets are only taken up for one day a week on Saturday and put back on Monday.  Only 55 salmon were caught in 1982 in that stretch of river.  In 1983 55 salmon were caught and this year only 14 salmon were caught.  That paints a gloomy picture.  People involved in fishing believe that we should go back to the position which obtained in 1981 because what is happening is that the fish are not getting up the river to spawn and the fishermen are spoiling their own ends.</P>
    <P>Poaching is a problem.  We have a small loss from local poaching but also gangs, allegedly from the North, are poaching in that area.  The bailiffs or water keepers will only be replaced when three of them retire.  This is an area where personnel should not be reduced.</P>
    <P>In the Lough Sheelin area we had a slurry problem.  There was a subsidy for lorries to take away the slurry but it ends this month.  All that would be needed next year would be £16,000 to continue the work.  It is unfortunate that this is not forthcoming, and it should be looked at again to see if something can be done.</P>
    <P>We have the problem in Meath where the drainage work has been completed and the rivers have virtually been converted to canals.  I understand the fishing situation is good.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one important point in relation to the catching of salmon.  The salmon caught with drift nets will be sold for perhaps £2 per pound but a salmon caught with rod and line would be worth at least £600 to the economy, taking into consideration the money spent by tourists locally.  This is an important consideration which should be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>This morning I attended the briefing on public venture capital for the Oireachtas Members and I was glad to see that the investment decisions include one smoked <Col N="765" /> salmon venture.  This will result in increased revenue for the country.  It will involve salmon farms.  We could build up something like they have in Norway where they export 22,000 tonnes of salmon each year.  Our exports are in the region of 250 tonnes but I believe this will shortly go up to 500 tonnes.  The salmon which comes from Irish waters is considered to be of very superior quality. We have problems with marketing arrangements and the supply of smolts and I hope these factors will be taken into consideration.  I hope that the necessary attention will be paid to the area of coarse fishing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to those of Senators Kiely and Fitzsimons when they say that this is not an appropriate time for an increase in the cost of licences. Going on to what Senator Fitzsimons has said with regard to the fall in the number of salmon being caught by rod and line method, it is obvious that no increase should be sought from fishermen because their chances of catching fish are being greatly reduced.</P>
      <P>Coming from the part of the country that I do there is another very serious matter which to me the inland fisheries board should be tackling.  That is the problems caused by foreign fishermen who are poaching our coarse fishing rivers and lakes.  We know that pike is a delicacy commanding in Germany possibly the same price as salmon, and the net result is that the coarse lakes are being robbed of those fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a well known fact that German gangs are operating in parts of this country using sonar equipment to seek out the fish in the lakes and to take them out, often by very illegal means.  I would hope that the Central Fisheries Board would immediately tackle this problem, even if it means deportation.  Deportation should be the penalty for anybody who is found to be poaching in this way from our lakes and rivers.  To allow this to continue will erode our angling industry, which has been a major source of income especially in Cavan, Leitrim and Monaghan. That area has built up a traditional <Col N="766" /> angling market with anglers from Great Britain and continental Europe.  The true angler will not do any damage at all to fish stocks, but these types of poaching gangs will do serious damage in the long term.  I would hope that the inland fisheries boards would immediately set about tackling this problem.</P>
    <P>The lack of a definite policy with regard to the development of our coarse fisheries is something that all Governments can be blamed for down the years.  I would hope that the Minister of State would ask his Department to come up with a definite policy for the fishing industry.  Allowing this type of activity to go on will mean that we will lose one of our great leisure activities, not alone for our tourists but for our own people.  It would be sad if we allowed our lakes to become run down in terms of stocks of fish, because no fisherman likes to go out and come home without at least catching something for the day.  If it is to be a case of having to buy a red herring on the way home to prove to his wife that he was fishing, it will be a very sad state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister of State will look at that and that he will make available to the inland fisheries boards more money for restocking of our rivers than has been made available down the years.  He hopes to provide &mdash; I would hope for the provision of stocks in our rivers &mdash; £1.1 million in 1985 towards the non-pay element of expenditure by the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards.  This is an increase of 46 per cent over 1984, which means that the 1984 figure would be in the region of £½ million. An investment of £½ million is very small when we consider the amount of money that is coming from tourism and licence fees and from the sale of fish caught legally and illegally, since we all know there is a poaching problem in our salmon rivers.  The amount of money would need to be increased at least five times so that we could set about bringing up the stock of fish within our rivers and lakes to an acceptable level to allow us to exploit them further as the great waters that they are.  They will no longer be a tourist attraction if their stocks are depleted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to contribute briefly to this debate.  What brings me to my feet are the remarks of the last speaker, which I fully support.  We sometimes forget that our natural resources are our greatest asset, and we tend only to put asset value on something we have to build up physically by our own resources. Our greatest natural resources, particularly in the west, are our fisheries and our natural amenities.  I fully support the point of view expressed by Senator Ellis that these amenities are being plundered, not merely by Irish people but very frequently by tourists who come here and are not aware in any way of the basic standards we require of fishermen who are out to enjoy themselves.  I have had the experience when fishing on some of the County Mayo lakes of observing non-Irish fishermen using equipment to fish in a very improper manner and having available on the shores refrigerated vehicles to bring the catch away.  I am aware that certain people have come from outside to fish in that manner.  That is absolutely improper.</P>
      <P>The level of increase which this order proposes is very reasonable, bearing in mind the pleasure and enjoyment that increase can give.  The Minister will have to look at the role and function of the regional fisheries boards.  More funding must be made available to them to employ staff to operate, not in a manner that is seen as negative but in a manner that is seen as positive.  We frequently look upon the fisheries boards and their staff as people who are there to restrain poaching by Irish people and to operate in a very negative sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had very considerable dealings with the fisheries boards, particularly the North Western Regional Fisheries Board, and I must commend them on the work they have undertaken in the area of restocking, preventing pollution and of ensuring that this valuable natural resource is protected.  That work cannot be done to its maximum if funding is not made available to allow them to employ the necessary staff to operate in a positive way, to encourage people to use the natural resources in a constructive way and <Col N="768" /> above all to indicate to our tourists and to people who are not aware of how we use these resources how they should be used.  I would like to see, particularly on our lakes in County Mayo, resources being made available to the North Western Regional Fisheries Board and to other fisheries boards to allow them retain that type of staff to enable a constructive and positive job be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from an area in north Meath close to the Cavan border where by tradition the fishing lakes and rivers are the major tourist attraction, together with our ancient monuments at Lough Crew.  In this area we have the River Inny and the Blackwater.  Lough Sheelin has been regarded for many years as the best trout fishing lake in Europe. We have Lough Ramor and we have a lake on the Meath-Westmeath border over near Fore known as the White Lake, a very renowned fishing lake.  We have had many battles over the last number of years, and I must pay special tribute to the inland fisheries board for the part they played in combating pollution, which is a very serious problem.  I am happy to say in the case of Lough Sheelin that the problem is certainly abating and fishing is coming back there.</P>
      <P>I would be concerned about introducing any measure that would restrict tourism in our area.  I rise mainly to bring to the attention of the Minister who would be most appropriate to deal with it the problem that has come to the north Meath area through the viaducts and rivers.  Apparently wild mink escaped some years ago.  While no great alarm was raised at that time, they have come down through the River Inny in our instance and have invaded chicken farms, egg farms and attacked cattle and in one instance killed a cow.  These fierce animals kill the victim, in the case of hens and chickens, by cutting their jugular vein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In attacking cattle they cut a vein in the cow's or bullock's tail.  I wonder how they affect the fish in rivers because their movement is by river.  I have full proof and evidence of this where a particular <Col N="769" /> hatchery had its site based on the River Inny.  In one night alone one mink killed 60 chickens or laying hens. They are very fierce animals. They are believed to be capable of attacking human beings.  If the population of this wild mink increases we will have a very serious problem on our hands.</P>

      <P>I have made my point in so far as it relates to the fact that they travel by the water courses; that is how they get to their destination.  They are known to and have been seen to kill fish. I wonder what effect they have on our fishing stocks.  I would appreciate very much, if the Minister cannot give a reply today, that he would communicate with me in writing and see what can be done to alleviate the situation.  I can guarantee to the Members of this House that this is a very serious problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. D'Arcy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with some of the specifics first. Senator Lynch raised the question of wild mink.  Neither I nor my Department have responsibility in respect of wild mink.  I understand they are a problem.  They are really the problem for the Department of Agriculture.  However, the Senator asked a specific question in relation to what effect they are having on stocks.  I will ask the Department if there are any reports available and I will communicate with the Senator.</P>
      <P>On the question of Lough Sheelin, the Department of the Environment are in the process of finalising a new management committee.  This new committee, I understand, is coming into operation on 1 January 1985 and I sincerely hope they make a success of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons raised the question of the Blackwater.  As the Senator knows, the Blackwater was subject to a very substantial drainage scheme by the Office of <Col N="770" /> Public Works.  Very serious damage was done there both to the vegetation and to the banks.  As a result of that, it is not inhabited by fish.  I am told by my Department officials that it will take about three years for the fish to return to that river. They see no reason why we cannot get up to the same level as we had prior to the drainage scheme being carried out. Meanwhile I agree with what the Senator says; it is a very valuable asset.  The question of the restocking of the river is one for the board operating in that area.</P>
    <P>A general question was raised by Senator Kiely and other Senators in relation to development.  I would like to point out, first of all, that the Department supply about 90 per cent of the money for all fishery boards.  The remainder of the money comes from the boards themselves. I would further like to point out that the increase this year is substantial, in view of there being such stringency in relation to finance.  The increase of 46 per cent is very substantial.  If we segregate this figure I would like to inform people that it is the non-pay element; it is for development work in general.  Senator Kiely also made the point that fishermen, as a result of increasing prices, will not take out licences.  I have grave doubts about that.  The increase is around 15 per cent.  Inflation during the same period was 20 per cent.  I am satisfied that the fishermen in general will take out licences for 1985 and that extra £40,000 of an increase will be sent to the regional board for development.  Most of these increases are taken up by the Department of Finance. It is right that we have fought for and succeeded in getting these increases for regional boards for development work in general.  I am satisfied that this will happen.</P>
    <P>On the question of the strike which the Senator mentioned, I am hopeful that the Labour Court, the Government agency responsible for dealing with public relations problems in relation to staff, will be successful in this instance.  I would ask people to be reasonable in their demands. I certainly do not want any strike on our hands.  We had a difficult problem last year.  We thought we had it sorted out. <Col N="771" /> However, Senators can be assured that we will be watching and monitoring the situation.  We are hopeful that there will be a successful conclusion to the satisfaction of everybody.  There is no use in people getting a settlement if they are not satisfied.  I would again appeal to people to be reasonable in their demands.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons asked about the value of salmon caught by drift net and the comparison with salmon caught by rod and line.  I could not agree with him more.  It just indicates the value of the fishing industry in general.  While I am not satisfied about the progress being made, nevertheless the progress in relation to the development is reasonable in view of the amount of money available.  I would further like to point out that the development work initiated by the former Inland Fisheries Trust is ongoing and there has been no scaling down whatsoever of the work.  It is true to say that funds have not been provided for any major extension or development work in the last couple of years.  We are awaiting a development plan from the Central Fisheries Board. Certainly, once that development plan comes to my Department it will be dealt with straight away.  It would be wrong for us to push money into large developments in the absence of this plan.  I am hopeful that this plan will be made available in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I want to express very sincere thanks to the Members who contributed and all the points made will be noted.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that we have here before us this Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, if enacted, will provide an important complement to other measures <Col N="772" /> already taken to rationalise the organisation of the potato sector.  The prime objective of the overall effort is to improve the quality of domestic supplies of potatoes reaching the market place. We are all well aware of the poor organisation of the sector.  The distribution system from producer to retailer is not organised in an orderly way.  Marketing tends to be haphazard, consisting really of individual efforts by producers, packers, merchants and others.  We are seriously lacking in adequate facilities for the storing, grading, packing and processing of potatoes.</P>
    <P>A survey carried out by the Department of Agriculture last year showed that less than 50 per cent of the potato crop had adequate storage facilities, particularly long-term storage.  This situation gives rise to losses and wastage which we can ill afford.  A characteristic of our potato industry is the fluctuation in supplies which can occur from one year to the next.  So we frequently have a year of short supply and high prices followed by a year of excess supply and poor prices. Even within a season in which there is a reasonable equilibrium between supply and demand there is often over-supply early in the season and a shortfall towards the end of the season indicating our storage problems.</P>
    <P>The consequences of these organisational weaknesses are readily apparent. High quality, well-presented potatoes and potato products are gaining inroads into our domestic market.  In fact £25 million worth of potatoes and potato products were imported in 1982.  The corresponding figure for 1983 was £17 million and for this year it is estimated at £27 million.  The bulk of this figure comprises of processed potatoes, primarily potato chips.</P>
    <P>This situation is a matter for serious concern.  However, it has to be understood that, under EC rules, there is intra-Community free trade in potatoes as there is in other commodities.  This means that we have the same freedom to sell our potatoes in other member states as they have to sell in this country.  The reality, however, is that due to our poor <Col N="773" /> standards generally, not only are we unable to export ware potatoes to other member states, but some of those states, notably the Netherlands, are able to compete successfully with our produce on our own home market.  Until 1980 we were shielded from this international competition by our plant health regulations. Following the implementation of the EC plant health directive in 1980 our producers face the full rigours of EC competition.</P>
    <P>The industry must adapt to this situation at production, distribution marketing and processing levels.  Failure to do so will inevitably lead to even greater volumes of imported potatoes and potato products.  After all, we have many advantages. Many areas in the country have excellent soils and climatic conditions for potato growing.  High quality home grown certified seed is available and the control, research and advisory services of the Department of Agriculture, An Foras Talúntais and ACOT are readily available to producers.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation and development of the industry is primarily a matter for the commercial forces which operate the sector.  The Government can help by providing conditions and promoting a climate wherein the sector can ultimately compete more efficiently and effectively. I referred at the beginning to other measures already taken.  The Food Standards (Potatoes) Regulations were introduced in 1977.  These regulations lay down that potatoes for sale should be graded and in good condition.  The enforcement of these regulations which apply also to imports, has brought about some improvement in the quality of Irish potatoes offered for sale.  Nowadays, in the market place product presentation is becoming increasingly important.  In this connection I would urge producers to pay particular attention to the selection of potato varieties which have good storage quality and which look attractive to shoppers. A recent survey indicated that 70 per cent of the housewife's decision-making is based on the visual impact of food.</P>
    <P>The State is providing financial aid <Col N="774" /> towards the development of a national potato co-operative.  The task of establishing this co-operative was undertaken by the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society in conjunction with the Irish Farmers' Association.  I understand that 12 local potato producer co-operatives have been set up and these form the constituent bodies of the national co-operative. Much remains to be done by the co-operative. It will be endeavouring to get the fullest support from the local co-operatives by way of channelling their entire output through the co-operative. It will also be looking to the local and regional needs in terms of grading, handling, packing and storing facilities.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to grant aid which is available.  Under an EC regulation on the marketing and processing of agricultural products, grant-aid may be obtained from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, FEOGA towards the cost of certain approved projects which are aimed at improving structural efficiency in the marketing and processing of agricultural products in the Community.  Successful applicants must have the approval of the member state, which must contribute a minimum national grant of 8 per cent of the cost of the project, 16 per cent for projects in the disadvantaged areas of the west of Ireland, in order to attract the maximum level of EC grant which amounts to 25 per cent, 50 per cent in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>On-farm production projects involving modernisation, rationalisation or development of individual farms are not eligible for consideration under this FEOGA projects scheme.  Under the farm modernisation scheme however, aid is available for the construction of potato stores on the applicant's farm.  Farmers in the &ldquo;development&rdquo; category are eligible for grant-aid of 25 per cent, 35 per cent in the disadvantaged areas.  Those in the &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; category are eligible for an interest subsidy equivalent to a capital grant of 15 per cent payable over seven years.  The &ldquo;other&rdquo; category is eligible for grant aid of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House provides for <Col N="775" /> a system of registration of all who grow ware potatoes as distinct from seed and other potatoes for sale and of all who pack such potatoes.  It will be illegal to sell potatoes other than those grown by a registered grower or to sell packaged potatoes other than those packed by a registered packer.  A packer or a grower who packs will be required to show his or her registered number on the pack. About 80 per cent of the trade in 25kg packs is met by growers who are also packers.  The proposed registration system will facilitate trace-back of substandard potatoes through the sales chain, as middlemen who trade in potatoes but do not pack them, will be required to put their names and addresses or other approved identification on the packs.  This will make it easier to take the appropriate action against those who pack poor quality potatoes.  This is the biggest problem facing officers in the Department, that is because of the lack of registration they are unable on many occasions to trace back the potatoes to source.  It will encourage the collection and dissemination of information, for example, with regard to acreage planted, varieties, etc.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this legislation will not solve all the problems associated with the potato industry.  It will be no substitute for the action that is required by the commercial sector.  I am confident, however, that the provisions of the Bill, in conjunction with the other measures I have mentioned, will provide an overall framework for improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the potato sector. Before concluding, I should like to add that one of the reasons why the Bill will succeed is that the demand for the Bill did not come from parliamentarians but from the people involved in the industry &mdash; the growers, packers and the processors. These people demanded this and discussed it in detail.  In some cases it is not going far enough, but, by and large, they are satisfied with it.</P>
    <P>One of the points which was raised in the Dáil was the problem of the country of origin.  Members on the other side of <Col N="776" /> the House said that putting the country of origin on the packs would be a good idea.  I had the same idea but ran into some difficulties with it.  However, this problem is still being examined and it appears that there is a way around it; as this is a registration Bill, it cannot come under it.  It now appears that it can be brought in under other legislation, for example, the Regulations under the Food Standards Act, 1974.</P>
    <P>I commened this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Bill.  Any measure introduced by the Government to streamline the production and marketing of potatoes is welcome. As far as we are concerned on this side of the House, we will not delay its passage.  It is a pity that this legislation was not brought before the House earlier. It is a bad reflection on our country, an agricultural country that is suitable for the growing of potatoes, when, as the Minister has stated, £25 million worth of potatoes and potato products were imported in 1982 and the corresponding figure for 1983 was £17 million and for this year it is estimated at £27 million. For a country where the soil and climatic conditions are suitable for the growing of potatoes it is unfortunate that this should happen.  The potato has been a traditional crop here going back over the years.  Over 100 years ago 285,000 acres of potatoes were cultivated.  This figure fell to approximately 200,000 acres by 1961 and in the present year to something perhaps in the region of a little over 100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot look at the industry without dividing it into its two basic components, (a) the production of certified seed for the home and export trade, which is the raw material side of the industry, and (b) ware production which is a final consumer product.  Up to recent times ware production had been on a traditional rather than a commercial basis.  It is only now that the acreage of ware is becoming concentrated in more large-scale commercial units, concentrated around the main population centres such as Dublin and, to a lesser extent, Cork.  This has not been so to the same extent with seed <Col N="777" /> potato production.  As from the introduction of the certification scheme in the early 1920s and especially after the introduction of the Agricultural Produce (Potatoes) Act of 1931, the crop of seed potatoes as a raw material was always grown for commercial use.  Because of this the seed industry has been more commercially orientated.  There are health and grading standards which are rigidly enforced and there is also the continual introduction of new varieties mainly for seed.  This, of course, has also been so for early ware production for many years where it has been developed and has orientated itself totally towards commercialisation.</P>
    <P>But this cannot be said of the main crop ware trade.  It is not organised on any regular basis.  There are no health or grading or quality standards except for the limited export trade and &mdash; something that is common to both seed and ware &mdash; little decent storage exists and no specialised storage is present except with some of the processing firms.  The varieties which we are producing like Kerr's Pinks, Record and British Queens may be acceptable for the home trade but unfortunately we are the only country of any consequence which uses them.  If we look at the production trend since 1966 in both seed and ware, the area grown has decreased in every country in the EC except Holland.  It is not a coincidence that Holland is the only country where, because of its soil type, almost total mechanisation has been introduced into potato growing so that now it is a one or two-man operation from planting to harvest. Coupled with this is their vast system of farms and large-scale centralised storage systems.  It is very important to have storage because unless we have, we cannot market a good potato.</P>
    <P>We have been waiting for a long time for the common organisation of the potato market which was eventually done by the EC.  I see no reason why we, in this country, have to wait for CAP on potatoes to introduce quality standard. In the home trade, if we are to give the housewife the high quality potatoes she requires, quality standards are generations <Col N="778" /> overdue.  If we are to take part in an export trade in potatoes, which does not seem likely at the moment, we must have overall quality standards, as we cannot have quality and grading standards for export and none for the home trade.  We must also produce varieties which are acceptable in the export markets and not just acceptable solely at home.</P>
    <P>It has been proved also that the planting of certified seed is very important to the production of maximum yields.  Yet, in this country where we produce very high grade seed, many of our ware growers are still planting seed which in some cases may be four to five years removed from certification.  If we are to expand either in our seed or ware industry we need to have a greater commitment, and also greater investment in the industry. We will have to invest in machinery for use in planting and harvesting.  A welcome bonus which has emanated from the high prices of recent times is that many of the consistent potato growers are reinvesting this money in machinery and handling methods, and this is very necessary at the present time.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has rightly pointed out, there are little or no storage facilities for potatoes in this country.  If we wish to expand we must provide large-scale storage units.  The larger grower of ware may be able to do this himself.  If prices are to be maintained to the producer it is essential that potatoes are put into store at harvest rather than dumped on to the market, thereby depressing prices below that which is necessary.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I believe the measures that are being introduced here today are necessary.  If we look at the presentation of potatoes in shops and supermarkets over the years, we will agree that it has left a lot to be desired. Housewives will not be fooled any longer; they will go for the best product, regardless of whether it is Irish or otherwise; they will look for value for money.  Over the years they have not been getting value for money with the Irish potato.  When we see how nicely imported potatoes are packed and presented, we have a lot to <Col N="779" /> learn.  It is up to us to find out, first of all, what the housewife needs and to present a product which she will buy.  How often have we seen stones, clay and so on in bags of potatoes, which, naturally, will not encourage the housewife to buy Irish products?  It is only by competing and producing the right type of potato that we can hope to sell and to stem the flow of potatoes into this country.  It is a sad day when £27 million worth of potatoes are being imported every year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take this opportunity of speaking on this Bill to express my support of the terms of the Bill, which, in fact, I have been one of the sponsors of.  I particularly wish to support all the efforts which have been made by my colleague Senator Brendan Ryan in presenting this Bill, all the background information to the Bill and in highlighting the plight of homeless people in Ireland, in particular highlighting the fact that there is no end responsibility, as <Col N="780" /> it were, for dealing with the problem of homelessness and we are left in the position where each institution or statutory authority passes responsibility to another.</P>
      <P>It is interesting &mdash; I make no apology for going back to something which was emphasised by Senator Ryan in his original speech on the Bill about a year ago &mdash; that this Bill has received support from so many voluntary groups of all sorts who deal with the homeless, the elderly homeless and the young homeless, the boys and girls who are now sleeping rough.  All those voluntary bodies are, in fact, putting in the vast majority of effort in dealing with homeless persons at the moment, because 90 per cent of the actual beds provided for homeless people are provided through voluntary bodies rather than through the State.  These people have the experience of dealing with the problem and they have the right to speak about it.  It is very interesting and important that they have expressed their support of this Bill.  They are extremely concerned with the need to do something about the problem of homelessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill and the body of information that lies behind it has been based on firsthand research, much of it carried out by these voluntary bodies.  It gives an opportunity for the creation of a partnership between the State and the voluntary bodies of a kind which repeatedly has been advocated by various Ministers for Health and Social Welfare over the years.  Indeed, one of the primary aims of the National Social Service Board, which used to be the National Social Service Council, was to arrange co-operation between voluntary and statutory bodies in this kind of area.  It would be an extremely good example in the whole area of care for deprived and oppressed persons if we could move into a situation where we could have a fruitful partnership between the voluntary and statutory bodies, where there would be a responsibility, where the State would be prepared to provide on a reasonable level for the care of homeless people and where, really in principle, there would be <Col N="781" /> a statutory responsibility for the housing of people who do not have homes; they would no longer be allowed to fall through the gaps in the services, as it were.</P>
    <P>We have had numerous examples over the past year, even since the Bill was introduced, of the vulnerability, the difficulties associated with poverty and age, poverty and unemployment and poverty and youth which give rise to homelessness. We have seen most often in recent weeks how very vulnerable old people, for instance, even where they have housing and are living alone, can be.  People who have no homes are perhaps some of the most vulnerable people in our society, and therefore, people for whose care we have a primary responsibility.</P>
    <P>Some of the reports relied on by Senator Ryan were reports from the Simon Community, with which he is most closely involved, but, even since he originally introduced the Bill, there has been further evidence from organisations like the St. Vincent de Paul Society, ALONE, HOPE and so on which spell out even more the extent of this problem and the difficulties suffered by those who are homeless.</P>
    <P>To respond to homelessness with the provisions of the Vagrancy Act, 1824 is an insult rather than an answer.  To suggest that by criminalising homelessness, by making it a chargeable offence, as it were, we will do away with it is to go back to the worst excesses of the poor law system.  Even under the poor law system there was a framework of workhouse accommodation which has gradually been whittled away because in various areas of the country the county homes have simply ceased to provide wards for casual people, wards for the homeless, so that there is an enormous variation from county to county, from health board area to health board area and from local authority area to local authority area as to what is in fact provided and what is not provided for homeless people.</P>
    <P>The closing of the facilities in county homes for homeless people, as happened for instance in Carlow, can in a provincial <Col N="782" /> town like that give rise to a problem of homelessness which was not so acute beforehand.  All this is allowed to fall back on the voluntary bodies.  Some of these voluntary bodies, of course, receive grants from the State to help them in their work, but it certainly has turned out to be a cheaper alternative for the State and for the community as a whole to say: &ldquo;ah, well, we will give the odd grant to the voluntary organisations and they will look after this problem&rdquo; rather than accepting that even through the county homes system or through the health boards system some kind of provision of a home for homeless people should be made.</P>
    <P>Many homeless people at present spend their nights in hostels.  There are good and bad hostels, but hostels are not an ideal form of accommodation and certainly would not be regarded as a first priority by people who were asked what sort of a home they wanted.  If any of us were asked about this problem and if we thought about it as affecting our own lives, there is no doubt about it that we would put a great value on having a real home for ourselves, however small.  To spend one's nights in hostel accommodation, particularly when on almost all occasions these hostels insist on the people who stay there during the night leaving during the day and spending their day wandering in the streets, is a very low grade form of accommodation.  Even that, of course, does not cover all the people who need beds for the night.  I do not think it would be a sufficient response to say that if we could produce enough hostel accommodation that will be enough.  We need to look a good deal further into it and try to produce some much more real solution in providing a real form of accommodation for homeless people, whether they are young or old.</P>
    <P>There is the basic difficulty that neither the local authorities nor the health boards have a final responsibility for housing a homeless person in this country, and there are enormous variations in their approach.  Some will use the excuse that they have not got any housing available <Col N="783" /> for single persons, only housing available for families.  Others, perhaps, will go to considerable lengths to provide housing and accommodation for such people.  The real difficulty is that there is no final responsibility and that so often in different areas the buck passes so quickly from one statutory authority to another that it can hardly be seen by the naked eye.  Also, we must contrast what we have failed to do in this country with what has been done in other countries.  In Britain and in the other countries in the EC very considerable advances have been made.</P>
    <P>There is one particular example that I would like to give of what can be done where responsibility is established.  That is in the city of New York, a city which, Senators know, has suffered considerable financial difficulties in the past few years, so that we cannot sit back and say: &ldquo;that is a rich authority whereas this is a poor country&rdquo;.  There is no doubt that the city of New York has been practically in liquidation on several occasions because of its financial problems.  Therefore, when we see how much they can spend and think worthwhile spending on the provision of accommodation for the homeless this should make us pause.</P>
    <P>In the present financial year New York city is spending $58.8 million on services to homeless individuals, which is a 600 per cent increase on what they did in 1978.  In the fiscal year of 1985 they will be spending in current expenditure $75.9 million, which is added to a capital expenditure of $27.4 million, that is well over $100 million for provision for homeless people in New York city.  If you take comparable population figures with this country that would be at least £10 million in a year for us.</P>
    <P>This is a real commitment for provision of proper decent accommodation for homeless people.  Part of the reason for that is that it was established legally that there was a right to shelter and a right to accommodation, that it was part of the human rights of the ordinary person. Therefore, a responsibility was created whereby the authority must provide housing.  This is what has been lacking <Col N="784" /> here.  We do not see this as a human right although it is certainly arguable that it is the kind of unenumerated human right that one might have in the Constitution, the right to a home.  It is largely because we have not got this feeling of responsibility for provision that we do not make provision.  The Bill before the House is directed at this.  Without going any further into the detail of the matter I would like to express my absolute support for the Bill and to direct the attention of the Minister to the acute problem that exists and to the fact that there is really no bottom line, no responsibility for dealing with people in this situation and that these are a genuinely oppressed class within our society and one for which we have a moral, if not a constitutional responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I feel that one of our greatest social evils is the problem of the homeless.  These people exist on the fringe of society and live as social outcasts.  They invariably are wretchedly poor, are socially and economically isolated, usually cut off from family ties and are not always supported by statutory agencies, as has been pointed out.  The assistance given by health boards and housing authorities is clearly inadequate.</P>
      <P>The plight of the homeless must not be dependant on voluntary housing organisations as the scale of the problem is well beyond their financial capacity.  The responsibility for the homeless must rest directly with local authorities.  That is not to say that the various voluntary groups should be made redundant, rather that their role should be strengthened.  They have built up over the years a wealth of experience in dealing with homeless people.  I believe this can be put to very good use in any future arrangement.  I see their role in the future as an extension of their previous commitment, helping in their social and personal development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once the homeless are housed such organisations could be engaged in support groups, helping the homeless to integrate into the community.  The day centres, having shed the responsibility <Col N="785" /> for accommodation, would offer a more streamlined and sophisticated service to the homeless.  The day centres could evolve into social centres.  I support the Bill and the idea that local authorities are to be responsible agencies for housing homeless people.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the Glasgow model.  The Glasgow model, which has proved to be so successful, might offer a solution to the problem.  Here homeless people were put on the housing waiting list after a fair points system was devised. Existing hostels were greatly improved and a council for the single homeless was established.  Ireland stands alone in Europe as being the only country which does not have a clear statutory provision for the homeless.  I believe that a fair housing policy would solve the many social problems which afflict the homeless. Alcoholism, illness, psychiatric difficulties, unemployment, personal and social inadequacies probably exist because of the dreadful living conditions the homeless must endure rather than the converse.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the growing problem of youth homelessness.  This a problem that we will have to face sooner rather than later.  The Irish environment, especially the larger urban centres, has been characterised by dramatic change over the last decade.  Over this period social factors, particularly changes to the traditional family unit compounded by economic factors, notably a marked increase in unemployment have created conditions where youth homelessness is now a growing problem facing our people.</P>
    <P>The causes of youth homelessness are not readily definable.  Many factors can be identified as contributing to a young person's homeless status but no single factor can be isolated as a sole cause. The causes of youth homelessness can be expected to be complex and interrelated. Recent surveys indicate that homelessness has many causes.  Among the factors identified as contributing to youth homelessness are young person's economic situation, which is the product <Col N="786" /> of youth unemployment, which is steadily increasing, and uncertainty of income benefits, where people under 18 cannot receive any social benefits, low level of benefits for persons over 18, together with crisis factors such as the loss of jobs or a waiting period for benefits.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to youth access to the housing market.  I feel that there is prejudice against young people by landlords and estate agents as regards granting them accommodation.  The high cost of the rent of flats and private houses is definitely prohibitive, as well as that the availability of public housing to young people.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to part 3 of the recent National Youth Policy Committee Report.  They point out this problem that I am talking about here.  I would like to quote from section 13 (3) (ii):</P>
    <P>The plight of the homeless generally has been well established.  It is estimated that there are about 3,000 homeless of all ages in the State of whom about 200 sleep rough.  The majority are in hostels or night shelters. The homeless class of people were earlier seen as consisting mainly of men over 40 but there is now a new class of young homeless persons, boys and girls.  We are anxious that this disturbing fact should be borne in mind by the Government when formulating a national youth policy.  We have received evidence of those sleeping rough in Dublin that in June 1983, 61 were under 40 and 11 were under 18 years of age.  Every night between five and seven young people and more in the 30 to 40 age group call at a night shelter of an organisation who submitted evidence to us.  In Cork we have received evidence of the soup run organised by the same organisation to people sleeping rough which in 1983 identified ten children sleeping rough and 50 under age of 30.  In Dundalk the same organisation accommodated 24 people under the age of 35 in the year 1983.  In Galway there is one night shelter for 15 men and for women. There are two refuges for six families.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> In the year 1983 a young homeless class appeared there.</P>
    <P>That supports my case for young homeless people.</P>
    <P>The problem should be faced immediately. It could escalate, especially with the increasing problem of unemployment and the seeming breakdown of the traditional family unit.  It should be nipped in the bud before it escalates into a major social problem.  I would like the Minister to consider those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was first introduced by Senator Ryan in November 1983, which is an indication of the slow progress, if any, that it has made in this House.  It certainly is not a lack of commitment on behalf of Senator Ryan or indeed of the Government that so far we have not been able to deal with this legislation effectively or amend it if necessary.  The preferable alternative for me and even for the Senator, quoting a previous speech of his, is that the Government would come in with effective legislation in this area.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like &mdash; it is important that all of us do this &mdash; to compliment Senator Ryan and the Simon Community, with whom he has direct association, on their social consciousness in this tragic area of Irish life, that is the area of homeless people.  People who have contributed so far to this Bill, whether they are Ministers of State or Members from all sides of the House, agree that as a matter of principle it is now socially unacceptable that this tragedy of homeless people should be allowed to continue indefinitely.  It is of paramount importance to all of us that legislation should be initiated in this area. We are led to believe that in the Department of the Environment a Bill is at an advanced stage.  I have been told that for a period of almost 12 months and I am still patiently waiting to see the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of this legislation it is only appropriate that those of us who have a Bill before us should address ourselves to the Bill.  I commend Senator Ryan for the spirit of the Bill.  I know he <Col N="788" /> will accept that, as a member of a local authority with a statutory responsibility for housing people, and also a member of a health board with other statutory responsibilities, I have a concern in this area.  I will put my few comments on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>First of all, I find it difficult to come to grips with Senator Ryan's terminology of homeless.  Reading the document that was submitted by the Simon Community in their case for initiating an Act to cover homeless people, apart altogether from housing them, it is obvious that in the area of homelessness they can be treated under the existing law as being in some way criminal by the fact that they are without a home.  In the opening document on that on page 1 they refer to the very serious problem and they say that homelessness has always been a feature of Irish society.  That is an indictment on all of us.  It is something that we should take very seriously.  I hope that in the discussion of this Bill, or indeed any Bill, we would legislate in the knowledge that for some reason since the foundation of the State and going back into the old era of the British occupation here homelessness seems to have been a feature of Irish society.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that present surveys give us some idea of the extent of the problem, the causes of homelessness and some of the reasons why it becomes a poverty trap that is hard to break out of. There are some amazing statistics that, in fairness to the Simon Community, we should put on the record of the House which will give us the context in which we are looking at the legislation.</P>
    <P>They say that it is their contention that there are significant numbers of homeless people in the country.  This is not a historically new phenomenon.  In 1708 cells were erected in the Dublin House of Industry for the insane poor, which is a reference to my previous comment that because people are homeless they are considered to be outlaws in some way or another.  In 1708 they were considered to be insane poor.  They were chained and fettered.  In 1817, a hundred years afterwards, the country was divided into <Col N="789" /> mental hospital districts with lunatic asylums established and many were filled with vagrants &mdash; the same process and the same attitude to these people.  Repeated parliamentary commissions throughout the nineteenth century investigated the plight of the poor, the beggars and the vagrants.  In 1851 the RIC &mdash; we have many historic references to those &mdash; were charged with compiling censuses on lunatics, idiots and those in asylums, prisons. workhouses and wandering abroad.  I presume wandering abroad refers to wandering on the roadway.</P>
    <P>In 1871 70,202 fitted into this category of whom 7,000 were at large.  These are amazing statistics and they are all documented. The word &ldquo;at large&rdquo; means that they were wandering and walking around with nobody taking any interest in them. Homelessness, they contend, was not a new phenomenon.  It has been a social feature of Irish history throughout recorded time.  It is very important that we would seriously look at what Senator Ryan has been trying to do in this area and make a valued judgment on whether the legislation he has initiated here will meet some of the problems that he has outlined.</P>
    <P>I am still at a loss to understand what his definition of homeless is.  It is simple to say it is someone without a home.  If I try to reason with that, if it is someone without a home, is it someone who has a home but has left home?  Is it somebody who, because of family circumstances and acceptance in the community, or for some reason, is unable to get on the housing list and is without a home?  In a section of the Bill he talks about homelessness or threatened homelessness.  We all know that, in compiling local authority housing lists, many people try to improve their position on housing lists by becoming threatened to be evicted out of their existing accommodation.  If the words &ldquo;threatened homelessness&rdquo; be abused there is no doubt that this legislation, worthy and all as the principles involved in it might be, would create widespread havoc with the existing housing list throughout the local authority areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> Local authorities that I have any dealings with in urban areas and corporations have priority lists for rehousing people and they house single people.  In some areas they house unmarried mothers.  In some other areas they try to evict them.  In county council areas they do not have a priority list but they have a system of investigation of applicants at particular times.  In my county we have a three month review of our housing list. That list is compiled by officers of the health board acting on behalf of the county council, investigating people's circumstances. For the 17 years that I have been a member of a local authority the first requirement to be rehoused is to be living in an unfit house.  I am worried if a husband, wife and six children are living in an unfit house with the roof leaking and no toilet or bathroom facilities, no running water, no concrete floors, clay on the floors, absolute unacceptable standards in anybody's terminology that that husband and wife and six children would somehow by this legislation be not on the top of the list, that the person who was termed in the Bill to be homeless would have first priority.  I am not the one to make the decision in the first instance.  It would be an investigating officer from the health board on behalf of the local authority.</P>
    <P>The second category that are chosen are people living in overcrowded conditions. It goes down along.  We have a set of regulations under the Housing Act that we try to meet.  We do this in a very thorough fashion to try to ensure fair play and that people who need a house in the family situation will get it.  In adopting that process a lot of progress is being made by local authorities under this Government and under previous Governments.  Under this Government I am pleased to say that millions of pounds have been invested in the building of a very high standard of local authority houses throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We have made tremendous inroads on housing lists, even housing people who are unmarried but in need of a house.  I am accepting that people without a home should be housed.  I am trying to decide <Col N="791" /> the priority in which people should be placed.  If somebody is without a home I have to know the reason first of all.  It may be that they just decided to leave their own home, to go away, to abdicate or it may be illness, alcoholism or any other social problem that has created the traumatic upheaval in their life that puts them on the road.  Then I have to consider that they are men of the road; they are on the roads day and night; they try to get food where they can; they try to get work where they can; they try to get shelter of some description.  It is in this area that there is a major responsibility to do something.</P>
    <P>If people in those categories are on the move continuously &mdash; and my experience as a member of a health board is that they are generally on the move and want to be on the move &mdash; how can we accommodate them by building houses for them. In fact they would probably be gone out of the house the following day or the following week and, if so, is that house to be kept specifically for somebody else who comes along the way or do I house an unmarried mother in it with a child or two children or do I house an old person who can no longer survive in a three or four-bedroomed house who will surrender that house to the local authority for a smaller house?  As a housing authority member do I have a responsibility to build isolated houses to take care of homeless persons who are on the road but do not want to be pinned down to a particular area?  If that is what Senator Ryan's Bill is trying to do then I would like to discuss the implications with him at some length.  If people are on the road regularly and want to be on the road, it is their right if they so choose, and some of them cannot come to grips with being settled.</P>
    <P>Are we talking about the responsibility then of health boards to provide shelter? I know some health boards provide shelter, and that is to be commended.  I know that my own health board in the southeast region originally provided shelter for men of the road and the matrons of two or three geriatric hospitals throughout <Col N="792" /> the region had a special place set aside for them but because there was no order in it the accommodation that was set aside was always second class.  It never got priority because the persons were not in need of hospitalisation.  All they needed was a bed, a place to stay for the night, breakfast, and they went away again.  Some of this accommodation was not to the standard I would have liked.  I would like the health boards to provide proper accommodation if that is their responsibility.</P>
    <P>I hope that whatever legislation is introduced will define categorically where the responsibility lies, whether the health boards should look after people who are not sick but in need of a house or whether local authorities as the housing authorities should do that and under what regulations we would house them.</P>
    <P>I have to have regard in all our deliberations to the needs as we see them.  We have the needs of the family unit, needs of old people living alone in isolated areas, and with all the problems that have been happening recently many of them might wish to come into complexes of housing in villages and towns and avail of the new special small dwellings schemes that most local authorities have in operation. If that is the case are they a priority before the homeless, because technically they would consider themselves psychologically homeless?  If they are living alone, they desperately need company and they want to get to where there is activity and where there are services and company.  Everybody can sympathise with them, especially these days where other people who are on the road seem to have total disregard for either their person or their lives.  I have to find out whether they have a priority and at what stage does a person have a priority as a homeless person.</P>
    <P>It is an emotive area, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and I am sure you share some of the sentiments I have expressed, being a member of a local authority.  It is an emotive area because nobody wants to be accused of not wanting to do something about the problem.  That is the <Col N="793" /> problem as we see it, that nobody seems to have addressed it in a specific way, particularly the statutory bodies who have done very little in this area.  The health boards, who have done a limited amount, definitely have not done enough.  Perhaps one of their arguments is that they are not funded in such a way that they can do enough.  They find difficulty in keeping the service going as it is to provide attention for people who are sick and in need of service.</P>
    <P>We have to look at our responsibilities in this area.  We have to decide whether a homeless person is one who is homeless by choice or by circumstances.  Is a person living in a caravan a homeless person?  In my opinion a caravan is not a home for anybody whether it is an itinerant or a person who has been refused a county council house and who is forced to live in a caravan with his wife and children. There are many such persons living in caravans.  There are itinerants who move into areas who want to settle and want to send their children to school and want to have them attending Church ceremonies, being confirmed and receiving Communion. There are all these social situations, and we must come to grips with them.</P>
    <P>Society has not been easy in trying to come to grips with it.  The moment you talk about opening some special place where you can deal with homeless people even on an overnight basis there is quite often community resentment to it because they say these people are coming in at all hours of the day and night creating disturbances, that they attract other people of a similar nature.  There was a complaint from some people running some of the institutions in the health boards that they were unable to cope, because of lack of control.  If the health boards are to provide a shelter it must be done in an orderly way; it must be done to a correct standard and there must be supervision to make sure that people do not have the freedom to walk in and out and disregard other people's privacy and property when they move in.  It is important that everybody's rights are protected. We must condition the community to accept that there are people on the road, <Col N="794" /> there are people who should be housed and there are people who might not need to be housed.  Would the proposed legislation insist that people in that category be housed over and above all others?  I do not think that Senator Ryan would like to go along that road.  I believe that he too, as a humanitarian, involved in community work in this field, would like to think that everybody in need of a house would get a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>I think two Ministers of State in responding to Senator Ryan's Bill have given various commitments about pending legislation.  It is important that until we see that legislation this House should be seen to be prodding the Government, if that is the proper word to use, by our discussion of this Bill, we will create a continued sense of urgency in the Department of the Environment where this legislation is still sitting.  I do not know whether the heads of the Bill have gone to the Cabinet or at what level it is.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister of State, Deputy Pattison, last week, it is obvious that it is imminent.  The previous Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, speaking on this Bill, said he had no arguments about the existence of the problem of homelessness and that he had the fullest sympathy with the motivation underlying the Bill but that he had reservations.  He outlined the reservations that he had as Minister. Those reservations have been expressed by many speakers.  I have expressed them without coming down on the side of anybody in particular.  I have tried to put on the record of the House the system by which houses are allocated by local authorities, the responsibilities we have, the plans we have for producing houses, the kind of schemes we have, the approval from the Department of various schemes, the tender system, the review of the priority list every three months and the responsibility of the health board to do something extra in the area of accommodating persons who are homeless but who want to be on the move.</P>
    <P>A statutory authority cannot respond effectively to the problem unless the people they are trying to house have a commitment to staying in a house.  If <Col N="795" /> houses become ghettoes a disservice might be done to the homeless and to the community who need continued progress in rehousing.</P>
    <P>I hope Senator Ryan will agree that there is a commitment on all sides to do something about housing the homeless. We have put down reservations about the way he wants to go about it because we feel there are snags inherent in the sections I have looked at in detail.  I have given some time to considering them.  I can only consider them in the light of the experience I have as a member of two local authorities.  I know Senator Ryan has more experience than many of us in dealing with the plight of homeless persons.  I have commended him and the Simon Community for what they have been doing for these persons, who have the same constitutional rights as everybody else.  We have statutory and legal obligations to do something for them.  We should do it in an orderly fashion and in a way that will benefit them and will address itself to the problem.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that there will be persons who will not want to conform.  We will have to accept those and we will have to make their lives a little bit easier in some way.  We will have to accommodate them, make food available for them.  In this regard I would pay compliments to all the statutory bodies and the voluntary bodies.  I have mentioned the Simon Community.  There are many other voluntary organisations including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul who do tremendous work.  They are to be commended. They now feel that there is statutory responsibility to provide capital investment.  As long as there are voluntary organisations to look after persons who will not conform they can be assured that there will be a place for them to sleep at night whoever provides it.</P>
    <P>There are itinerants, homeless persons, and unmarried mothers who need houses and who are prepared to avail of the services and facilities that are their right.  If we make progress in that area we will have made a major contribution in dealing with the problem of housing <Col N="796" /> the homeless.  There are many homeless persons and urgent action is required.</P>
    <P>I support the principle of Senator Ryan's Bill and I hope that the Minister and his advisers will accept the urgency of the situation and that the only constructive way to deal with it is either to accept this Bill or amend it or replace it with better legislation if that is what the parliamentary draftsman feels is required. Senator Ryan in his original contribution to the House accepted that.  He said that legislation from the Government side which meets the requirements of his Bill would, obviously be equally welcome. This House will support his views on that, and I look forward to the new legislation or the amendment of this Bill.</P>

      <P>In welcoming the Bill and being aware of the problems because I represent an area of high homelessness could I say that we have come to a stage in our society that we can now boast that over the last ten to 15 years we have got on top as regards providing accommodation for family units of at least three or four.  There is a big cost involved in providing accommodation.  I use the word &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;housing&rdquo; because for far too long we gave an impression that a person must be housed rather than accommodated.  There is still a very sad situation in our society in that there are persons who want to wander throughout Ireland but it is expected of us to provide some type of accommodation for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area I represent we are in the position where we can provide some type of accommodation for persons who want it on a long term basis.  Unfortunately, there is an impression that we are not able or that we do not want to provide it for persons seeking accommodation on a long term basis.  I have made inquiries through local authority officials.  We have a situation, particularly in the Cork area, where the St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Simon Community care for persons who are not accommodated by the local authority or the local health board. I am informed that if accommodation is needed in the Cork area for a person who <Col N="797" /> is prepared to stay in that accommodation on a long term basis, accommodation could be provided within the three to six months.  That is a fair boast and it is only right to compliment each Minister for the Environment over the last ten to 15 years and the relevant staff for the work they have done in providing proper accommodation. At the same time, there will always be a problem with regard to trying to provide reasonable accommodation for persons who do not want to stay in the one area and who really do not want to say that they need long term accommodation. I do not want to give the impression that it is the same situation throughout the country generally, I suppose it is not.  Speaking for my own area it must be put on record that we are quite proud of the situation that exists there.</P>
    <P>Let us give some examples of what we should be doing, I do not understand why it is not being done.  The cost of housing is unbelievable.  The cost is in the region of £70 a week per accommodation or per house.  That is a lot of money.  I am glad to say that because of the new grant scheme I would envisage more houses coming on stream.</P>
    <P>Under the Landlord and Tenant Act elderly tenants of old landlord houses can now be subsidised up to a certain amount after going to the relevant rent tribunal. We have a lot of private accommodation that is still available.  These people, who are indeed our travelling people in one sense or, in another sense, our very own and indeed, might I say, our blue blooded people, are in a situation that if they do not get one type of accommodation they will get none.  They either go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society or the Simon Community, or whatever, or whoever can provide.  We provide subsidised rent for local authority tenants and for private tenants in private housing with a landlord under the Landlord and Tenant Act.  That is an excellent Act.  A landlord is getting a reasonable rent but at the same time we know who the landlord is and we can tax accordingly, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>Why is it that we cannot say to a person who is in need of accommodation, which might be available in the private sector, <Col N="798" />&ldquo;We can put you in there and we will subsidise you accordingly&rdquo;.  We do not suggest that.  Yet we are quite prepared to say, &ldquo;We will build £35,000 houses and we can put you in there&rdquo;.  We are not prepared to broaden our minds as a people and say, &ldquo;Is there accommodation available in the private sector?  If there is why are we not using it and why do we not subsidise accordingly?&rdquo;  In the long run it would be much cheaper to the people and to the taxpayer generally.  We must seriously consider that possibility. In fairness, it must be said that a husband and wife and one child can get accommodation. It may not be the best.  After two or three years they can get new homes.  We can be quite boastful of that. We have a situation where there is lots of accommodation available which we are not considering.</P>
    <P>If a person is on £29 a week a health board may consider, after thorough investigation, giving a subsidy of £5 a week extra.  That is a total of £34, but the person must provide accommodation for himself.  On the other hand, persons in local authority housing or accommodation owned by a private landlord can be subsidised to the amount of £10 to £15 or to the amount of £50 per week in our local authority.  We are quite prepared to give every type of benefits to these people while their own brother, sister or whatever, who wants to travel or who wants to be on his own gets no consideration. There is a responsibility on us to think otherwise.</P>
    <P>Are we saying, if we do this, the private sector makes more?  If that is the situation we can tax them accordingly.  There is nothing wrong with that.  I do not agree with Governments handing out subsidies to people who can look after themselves, including private landlords.  We did have a situation where the landlord was not prepared to keep up repairs or to upgrade accommodation generally and things were deteriorating at a rapid rate.</P>
    <P>That is one area where there is a great deal of accommodation available but the problem is that we are not prepared to say it and really look into it.  In the Cork area &mdash; I speak about the area I know <Col N="799" /> best &mdash; approximately 2,000,000 sq.ft. is available in the centre of Cork that could be taken up in accommodation for different types of people.  I am not saying that only one person accommodation should be provided.  There are avenues there that we should be using.  I have been at conferences on behalf of the Government and the local authority where renewals generally in older areas of cities and our towns were discussed. This type of renewal should be provided for the good of cities and towns generally. There is a rapid deterioration of older areas particularly in big towns and cities. The ground floor can be in use, the second floor can be in use but the third and fourth floors are not in use.  This accommodation could be used for persons on their own, or for brothers and sisters, or young couples.  I see no reason why we should not bring about a situation in the private sector where the people involved would revitalise these areas and provide a facility that is badly needed.</P>
    <P>For far too long we gave the impression that if it is not a house you do not have accommodation.  For far too long we gave an impression that everybody must have his own front door, his own front and back garden, which may never be used. It is a frightening thought that we do have that situation even with big families.  Let us get our priorities right and talk about what kind of accommodation we can provide. The accommodation is there.  We do not really have to build.  We need only revitalise.  It is sad to think that there is an area of a quarter mile square in Cork and we cannot use it to provide accommodation. We must be seen to be doing deals, getting talks moving with the private and public sectors for the good of all and at the same time provide facilities for persons who want to stay in these areas. The persons particularly mentioned in this Bill need to stay in built-up areas. They need, because of their loneliness and being alone and trying to provide for themselves, to stay in lively areas.  We need to accommodate them, to consider what to do about it.  We certainly are not doing enough.  I am quite prepared to say <Col N="800" /> we spend in the region of £12 million a year &mdash; that is just one local authority &mdash; on providing top class accommodation for people who are certainly in need, but we must ask whether they should get priority over people who have nothing but £29 per week.  Whether priority should be given to a person who with some help could accommodate himself or to a person who could not possibly accommodate himself is a big question. We put too much emphasis on making sure we look after people who speak well for themselves and, if I may go a little further, people who vote more often.  The person who is travelling or not seen to be in the one place all of the time may not be getting the priority he should be getting. That is my view on it.</P>
    <P>We have made some start by bringing in the £5,000 grant.  We can say to these people: &ldquo;If you leave we will give you £5,000.  We will also give you the subsidy of £3,000 plus the £1,000 grant for first-time buyers, a total lump sum of £6,000 into your hands if you come out of local authority accommodation and do your own thing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With a small bit of initiative maybe we will provide for £1,000 or £2,000 in the private sector.  I do not speak for the private sector, but at the same time I would give an example of what we could do if we had two floors over a relevant property in the middle of Cork.  We could say that we were prepared to put £6,000 into that premises to make four units out of it for people who are on their own. Even if it cost £10,000 it would still cost us only £2,500 to get that accommodation for each of these people.  I see no reason why we should not be doing that.  We do not owe any apologies to anybody for considering that type of idea.  It is very cheap.  If we are not going to do that, the responsibility lies with us to make sure that we provide other accommodation. Certainly, we can go about building some type of apartments at a cost of about £20 or £25 per square foot.  We should be considering whether enough is being done in this area and I would like to get the views of the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>I have been to other countries looking <Col N="801" /> at urban renewal.  Recently I was in a particular area of Rotterdam and I saw how the local authority there brought about a complete renewal in the inner city, which was completely deteriorating. They purchased on the long term 50,000 properties within the older area of Rotterdam. I appreciate that this is a lot of accommodation, but there are 500,000 people living in Rotterdam.  In purchasing the property they gave the lease of the lower ground, which was already the business sector of that property, to the person who was already the owner of the property.  In other words he got first priority on the same property, but the rest of the property was completely taken over by the local authority and re-structured to get people living back in the city centre area.  The number of people now living in the inner area of Rotterdam is literally unbelievable.  It is difficult to understand that in an area like Henry Street or O'Connell Street after 7 o'clock in the evening there could be a lot of people with lights on in their homes.  It is a fact of life in these areas of Rotterdam but at a cost, we do not deny it.  It is still much cheaper than building on green fields.  It is much cheaper to re-vitalise the older areas.  People need and want to stay in these areas.  We can provide accommodation at a very minimum cost by doing a deal with the landlord and with the private sector.  I can see no reason why we should not be looking at that area.  There are excellent opportunities there.  I would like to see if we can broaden that avenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this stage of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill because I believe it is an area where great care is needed.  Since the mid-fifties I have had the honour to be a member of a local authority and I am conscious of the accommodation that all our local authorities have provided.  Successive Governments provided the money for them down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, there is a social aspect to this problem and in that area more needs to be achieved.  We should have <Col N="802" /> more concerned people who believe in self-help endeavouring to cater for people within their own communities. One has to be aware of the great work that has been carried on by selfless organisations. Many of them have been mentioned here over the years &mdash; the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Simon Community and many old and highly regarded organisations, especially in our cities, who have quietly and very effectively filled a void over the years.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Minister for the Environment and the Government on the novel approaches that they have taken to the provision of housing over the past couple of years.  This year the new criteria and the new schemes they have introduced will have a knock-on effect and the Government will reach their targets.  I compliment the Minister of State on the work that he has put into it and I hope his efforts will meet with considerable success.</P>
    <P>I am acutely aware of the problem, but in a rural area the problem may not be as great as in some of the larger urban areas.  Nevertheless, even in the rural areas we have the new problem that has become very evident and made the headlines last week where old people are being attacked in their homes.  We have in every county, in every parish, old people who worked hard throughout their years and now find themselves through family or other circumstances residing alone in their own homes.  While they may have in the main lots of comforts and be adequately housed they have not got contentment because they are in fear of being attacked.</P>
    <P>We as the community must encourage more self-help.  This year I have played a role in introducing another voluntary organisation to this country, the Sue Ryder organisation which is going to assist in the social aspects where people have accommodation but are afraid or unable to stay there alone.  This is very important.  The work of the Ryder Foundation, which is closely aligned with the Cheshire Foundation, will urge communities to encourage self-help and to keep people within their communities <Col N="803" /> and be conscious of them.  It is very easy to respond generously to whatever charity is getting the headlines for the time being but most of us who are out and about are in such a hurry that we pass by people who may be in difficulties of one kind or another.  I appeal to my colleagues here and to everyone else to give some of their time and care to people who are less fortunate than themselves.</P>
    <P>When we speak about the homeless we must look at the difficulties that arise from the fact that there is a definite social dimension to this problem, especially for the type of persons envisaged in Senator Ryan's Bill.  It was very encouraging to hear the Minister, in the course of his address last week, tell the House clearly that the Government are considering legislation to provide more adequately for the various categories of person who have been mentioned many times.  As our country progresses it is only possible for us to be content with whatever progress we make if we demonstrate clearly that we are a Christian and a public-spirited people, if it is clear to everyone that we as a community are providing for people who have few of the goods of this world. It is not valid to lay the blame on these people if they are unable to maintain a house or to keep a flat.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan made the very important point that over the last 40 or 50 years local authorities in rural areas have provided half an acre or an acre cottage plot whether the people wanted that real estate or not.  This must be changed.  In every village and town in my county we provide what are called maisonettes which comprise one bedroom, a living room, kitchenette, bathroom and a small shed, a total of about 800 square feet which is made available to people for a few pence per week.  These are in small communities so that they are part of the existing community infrastructure.  It gets older people away from the feeling that they are isolated.  We want to see more of that kind of development.  Older people are entitled to be free.</P>
    <P>There are other categories of homeless people who may occupy the lower age <Col N="804" /> groups which present a problem which is difficult to deal with.  I do not share the view that these people should be conveniently assigned to mental institutions just because they may kick up a shindy while on the beer.  The community should be more caring and should provide for these people and endeavour to understand them.  I am convinced there are sufficient people in our community who have the generosity to give of their time to assist these people in holding on to their place in society.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister of State on the progress that his Department have achieved during the year in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be given the opportunity this evening to express a few thoughts in relation to the Bill.  I should like to compliment Senator Brendan Ryan on his initiative in preparing this Bill and having it tabled before this House.  There are few enough Members of either House who table Private Members' Bills and go to the trouble to deal with an area of social concern to the extent that he has.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (1) states:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this Act, a person shall be regarded as homeless and in need of accommodation when the housing authority is satisfied that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  he or any person who might reasonably be expected to reside with him (i) has no accommodation and is vulnerable as a result of old age, mental illness, handicap or physical disability, pregnancy, or other special reason and/or (ii) has no fixed abode and/or (iii) is usually resident in common lodging houses, refuges, night shelters or hostels and/or (iv) solely because of having no alternative accommodation, is forced to continue to reside in a general or psychiatric hospital, a county home or other such institution; or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  he has accommodation but he cannot secure entry to it or it is probable that occupation of it will lead <Col N="805" /> to violence from some other person residing in it; or</P>
    <P>(c)  his accommodation consists of a movable structure, vehicle or vessel designed or adapted for human habitation and there is no place where he is entitled or permitted both to place it and to reside in it.</P>
    <P>I have been looking into this matter in recent times.  There are areas of Dublin city where the homeless are prevalent, where the numbers of people living in hostels are numerous.  In the city centre area there are 1,000 single people residing in hostels at this moment.  The ratio of males to females is 4:1.</P>
    <P>I should like to read from an article prepared by Dr. Joe Fernandez who runs a very important assessment centre at St. Brendan's Hospital.  It states;</P>
    <P>... homeless men came from large families in which the bread-winner was usually an unskilled labourer.  Having spent their childhood in over-crowded conditions in areas of social and economic deprivation they were known to leave school at an early age and, being devoid of specific vocational skills, were known to migrate to find casual work wherever their manual skills were likely to be in demand.  They tended to be single because of their unsettled way of life and were known to gravitate towards male-dominated occupations, as in the building industry or in the hotel trade.  Their inability to save money or to contribute towards pension schemes left them in financially precarious straits which were easily breached by a not-unexpected crisis or illness which precipitated destitution, usually around the mid-30s, if not at an earlier age as now seems to be the case.  Having shown this downward drift, they then had to contend with living off welfare, or by begging and scavenging.</P>
    <P>These are the sort of people who are in many instances living in hostels in this city today.  They are people who have <Col N="806" /> become vulnerable to society.  According to statistics of those being treated at the assessment centre in St. Brendan's, these people are in the main single and male, people who have worked for a period and who have run into financial difficulties. Those difficulties have been compounded by an alcoholic-related problem.  At least 46 per cent of those who have been treated have a problem of that kind and another 33 per cent would be psychotic in some form or another.</P>
    <P>I was fortunate in being able to avail of an opportunity recently to attend a meeting in Leinster House with housing officers from Glasgow Corporation.  The vast majority of the hostel dwellers who were provided with accommodation in Glasgow in the last decade have been perfectly satisfactorily housed, to the extent of 85 per cent, within the new situation.  Those people were remarkably well able to respond to looking after themselves in this new situation.  I am not suggesting that there is not support given to them.  We can see the kind of support arrangement that could be given to them.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Dr. Joe Fernandez on the hostel arrangement in St. Brendan's Hospital.  Not alone have they an assessment centre there where individual patients are assessed as to their needs, but they also operate a day centre where advice is available on medical and social matters.  Outside the hostels where those people are now living they attend the assessment centre or for in-patient treatment and benefit from day centre facilities.  This establishment, even on a European level, is a commendable achievement.  It is tremendous to know that somebody as dedicated as Joe Fernandez has been able to get the support of the Eastern Health Board in getting this enlightened service underway and so far it has been working extremely well.</P>
    <P>Already the level of support by the Eastern Health Board to 11 hostels in this city is a growing charge on the health services.  We must find other ways of giving these people less institutional emphasis, turning them into the community and giving them support through the day centre and the other facilities that <Col N="807" /> are run from St. Brendan's and, we hope, in the long run making them far more satisfied members of the community.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have recently agreed, due to pressure from a number of organisations handling the homeless, the single-parent and smaller families to the allocation in the immediate future of some 50 units of accommodation to the single homeless.  One hopes that if this scheme is successful there will be another 50 allocated after that.  In the first instance it is intended to confine this scheme to persons over 40 years of age who are recommended by the Eastern Health Board or hostel personnel and are vetted by the corporation's chief welfare officer.  This is a scheme which has been initiated this year and it has already had some effect on the people who deserve to be recognised in their own right and given satisfactory housing.</P>
    <P>The problem is by no means solved.  It is a big problem which over the years has been known to many people in public life but has not been given the recognition that it requires.  Over the years we have had such enormous difficulties in dealing with the housing needs of the people.  We first faced the problem of housing the traditional large families of the Irish community. Until ten years ago the emphasis was on the large family and they still absorb a high percentage of money allocated for public housing.  The advice from a housing officer was that the more children you had the better chance you had of getting a house.  This was the traditional approach until fairly recent years.</P>
    <P>In the past ten years we concentrated on looking after the aged by providing sheltered housing and maisonettes. These developments to handle the aged have been a new emphasis, a second category of need that we have begun to recognise and do something about.  The extent to which we have done this is enormous, although we have on the national waiting list 33,000 families awaiting accommodation.  There are approximately 6,000 homes built annually.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city there are enormous <Col N="808" /> problems in handling the third category of persons &mdash; the small family.  We have done very little in this area.  In the period from December 1983 to the end of this year out of a total of 1,500 units built by Dublin Corporation only 72 units had fewer than three bedrooms.  The majority of units had three or four bedrooms. Enormous problems are faced by the small family, particularly the non-expanding family.  It is necessary to have these small families satisfactorily housed in the kind of community setting they have been used to.  We have not recognised this.  It is fair to say that there has been a move in this direction by including in future schemes some units for this category.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter I wish to raise concerns the deplorable and totally unacceptable situation regarding vocational education in Castlerea, County Roscommon, over many years.  I shall now outline the underlying facts which clearly demonstrate the continued neglect of the needs <Col N="809" /> of the area in this regard.  Until the mid-thirties the vocational school was the first second level educational centre in the town.  It was a four-classroom building and started with an enrolment of approximately 40 students.  Meánscoil Iosaf a co-educational lay secondary school, was founded by Mary O'Flanagan in private accommodation in the early forties.  The Sisters of Mercy started their full-scale secondary school some 20 years afterwards. With the advent of free education and the provision of school transport, accommodation difficulties in the vocational school reached crisis proportions.</P>
    <P>It was on account of this that the VEC provided eight prefabs which were located close to the main school building. This, however, proved quite insufficient. Additional accommodation had to be rented at other locations in different parts of the town.  As attendances continued to increase, it became patently obvious that the only solution to the problem was to build a new school.  Various overtures to the Department of Education in this regard proved fruitless, and so this disgraceful situation was allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>In 1979 the Roscommon VEC applied to the Department of Education for permission to build a new school.  Three years elapsed before permission or approval was given early in 1982.  By then the enrolments had increased enormously and the approved school was planned to cater for 275 students.  It was purely coincidental that on 2 June, 1982 Meánscoil Iosaf, the co-educational secondary school in the town, applied to the VEC to amalgamate with the vocational school.  This was nothing new.  A similar amalgamation had been successfully effected in Elphin some years previously when the vocational school there amalgamated with the local Grammar school.  At its July meeting of 1982 the VEC agreed to the request for amalgamation from Meánscoil Iosaf.  The new combination became known as St. Joseph's Vocational College.  Surprisingly, the Department were very slow to sanction this amalgamation.  The school operated for almost two years on a <i>de <Col N="810" /> facto</i> basis before approval was finally received.</P>
    <P>As was expected, the amalgamation increased a need for more accommodation and, accordingly, the VEC sought approval for an increased schedule of accommodation in September 1982.  The submissions made sought permission for a structure to accommodate 350 student places.  There was no positive response to this submission for quite some time. Meanwhile, St. Joseph's Vocational College was compelled to operate in four different locations throughout the town. For administrative purposes, these centres are designed as units 1, 2, 3 and 4. The late Paddy Crosby will be affectionately remembered for his wonderful radio programme &ldquo;The School around the Corner,&rdquo; but I am quite sure that the Castlerea Vocational School will be remembered &mdash; not fondly perhaps &mdash; as the school around many corners.</P>
    <P>Unit No. 1 comprises the main school building, the original vocational school and its cluster of eight prefabs.  Unit No 2 is accommodated in Hanly Hall, formerly a primary school which was condemned as such and replaced more than 20 years ago.  Is it not strange that a building considered unfit for use as a primary school then is deemed good enough to house the secretarial and commercial sector of vocational education in 1984?  It is scarcely compatible with our claims to have kept in line with technological and scientific developments in education in recent years.  Unit No. 3 consists of two rooms which are extensions to the rear of a private dwelling and also two prefabs. There is no toilet facility here and hence there is no need for the oft repeated joke: &ldquo;An bhfuil cead agam dul amach?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The accommodation is rented from the owner, Mary O'Flanagan, by the VEC. To date, however, no rent has been paid to the owner for the reason that the Department of Education have failed to sanction the contractual arrangements.  I request the Minister to ensure that this injustice is remedied without delay.</P>
    <P>I now come to Unit No. 4.  Of all the units this is the least conducive to educational pursuits.  The centre is a disused <Col N="811" /> ballroom initially built for that purpose more than 40 years ago.  It might well have been the &ldquo;ballroom of romance&rdquo; as it was very popular and well-patronised in its early years.  It is now the woodwork room of St. Joseph's Vocational College although situated at least half a mile away from the main building, the administration centre.  Teachers and students often joke about the incompatibility of their environment, but one cannot be facetious about such matters.  The conditions under which this school is being administered must seriously affect the physical, educational and psychological welfare of the students.  For that reason the parents, members of the board of management and the public generally throughout the area are gravely concerned about this unfortunate position.  How could it be otherwise?  The foregoing chronicled facts clearly show that the very adverse conditions governing the administration of vocational education in Castlerea are discriminatory if not, indeed, unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Article 40 of Bunreacht na hÉireann clearly affirms: &ldquo;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law&rdquo;.  One must ask where is the equality in the educational opportunities offered to students of St. Joseph's Vocational College.  How can they be expected to achieve the same educational attainments as their more fortunate counterparts who are privileged to be educated in a properly-equipped school environment where all the educational facilities are readily available.  Surely their chances of qualifying for grants and scholarships at examination time cannot be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Such discrimination is very far removed from Pádraig Pearse's ideals and aspirations of cherishing all the children of the nation equally.  I have already mentioned the dangers to physical well-being of students which might result from movement to and from classes in the various centres.  In bad weather they often get very wet going to and coming from classes.  This surely must be a health hazard.  There is also obviously the ever-present danger of accidents.  In one case, <Col N="812" /> the students must cross a very busy street to get to the outside centre.  Thank God, as yet, there has been no accident.  One wonders what the position is in regard to insurance.</P>
    <P>Despite all these serious disadvantages there is no real movement in the schedule of progress of the new school.  In April 1984 approval was given for the purchase of a site approved by the Department's architect for a new school.  The offer made by the VEC was accepted by the vendors and the deed of sale is being legally processed.  Disappointed with the lack of progress the VEC sought a meeting with the Minister for Education.  The Minister met a full delegation on 6 June 1984.  A decision in regard to the matter was promised by the Minister inside three weeks.  Subsequently the Minister advised the VEC to have consultations with the IVEA.  These consultations took place on 2 October 1984 but again no progress was reported.  On 3 October 1984 the chairman of the VEC and the CEO, Mr. Kevin McBride, had a meeting with the members of the Planning Section in the Department of Education.  Mr. O'Carroll from the planning section stated that the Department's view then was that there should be one school in Castlerea.  He emphasised, however, that he was not promoting any particular school or type of school but that the Sisters of Mercy favoured a community school.  The VEC maintain that they already agreed that St. Joseph's College extension should be proceeded with and that the proposed new school be built on the approved site.  This site is in an ideal location in the old demesne and is centrally situated convenient to the GAA sports complex and the town swimming pool.  I urge the Minister not to abandon this decision.</P>
    <P>I have agreed with Senator Mullooly who is a member of the committee to join with me in supporting this motion.  How many minutes do I have now?</P>

      <P>I shall be finished <Col N="813" /> before then le cúnamh Dé.  In the meantime the prefabs need to be repaired immediately if they are to remain intact. Some of them are in use for 16 years.  Ten years ago they were leaking through the roofs.  Presently, dampness is rising in through them from the ground and they are a veritable breeding ground for pests. In short they are in a state of collapse and will soon fall if not repaired immediately. Despite the tragically inadequate conditions under which they are working the headmaster and staff of this school deserve to be warmly congratulated on their achievements.  The school operates a full junior and senior second level curriculum providing for intermediate and leaving certificate examinations.  The examination results, if this can be considered a criterion of success, are indeed very creditable.  Equally so is their success record of placing the students in gainful employment.  As one who taught for most of my teaching career in Castlerea Vocational School I am truly proud of its continuing success record.  I also hope that teachers and students will soon be provided with a more worthy and congenial school building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should like to remind the Minister that the people of Castlerea and its environment feel deeply aggrieved and angered by the treatment they have received.  They have a firm conviction that were this school located anywhere along the eastern seaboard or in the southern area of the country it would be replaced long since.  It must be agreed that the parents and board of management have been very patient.  I should like to assert, however, that their patience is running out; their sense of frustration has reached saturation point.  If some evidence of progress is not forthcoming in the very near future they will demonstrate their disappointment in public protest. I would very much regret this because I am not one to advocate public protest or any such activities.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister on three counts: one, to provide funds for the immediate repair of the prefabs to keep them intact; two, to proceed immediately with the building of the new school and so provide <Col N="814" /> a long-felt want in the area; and three, to authorise payment of the rental due to Mary O'Flanagan for the use of the accommodation in her premises.  Tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh an tAire éisteacht do mo achainí agus go rachfar ar aghaidh le tógáil na scoile nua chomh luath agus is féidir.  Tá súil agam go bhfeicfear sar i bhfad toradh ar an achainí sin agus go mbeidh muintir Chaisleán Riabhaigh sásta dá réir.  Níl aon áibhéil in aon rud atá ráite agam anseo; tá gach focal de fíor.  Tá cruthú le fáil agus sin mar atá caite le muintir Chaisleán Riabhaigh i gcúrsaí gairmoideachais le níos mó ná scór blianta.  Tá súil agam go dtabharfar aird ar mo achainí anseo anocht.</P>

      <P>As a member of Roscommon Vocational Education Committee I wish to support the case made by Senator de Brún.  I want to join with him in pleading with the Minister to give this project the green light without further delay.  The situation is, Castlerea must be the worst in the country.  Senator de Brún has given an accurate description of what the conditions are like for teachers and pupils.  This matter has been dragging on for years.  The situation in Castlerea has been deteriorating all the time.  As Senator de Brún said, on 29 April 1982 the Department approved a new vocational school for 275 pupils on a new site.  In December 1982 the proposed site for the new vocational school was inspected and approved by the Department's architect.  The purchase of 7½ acres was approved by the Department.  This is a most ideal site.  It is adjacent to the industrial estate, the swimming pool, the O'Rourke GAA park and recreation centre and is off the main thoroughfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1984, I was a member of a deputation from the VEC which met the Minister for Education in connection with Castlerea.  The Minister accepted that the conditions and facilities in Castlerea were sub-standard and needed to be replaced.  The Minister referred to the sections of the action plan which deal with rationalisation.  She promised that there would be an early decision on the matter.  In September, the VEC directed <Col N="815" /> our CEO to write to the Minister pointing out that the accommodation being sought by the VEC was the minimum of new buildings that would be required in Castlerea centre as a whole and that approval to proceed would not conflict with her action plan and with any rationalisation which might take place in Castlerea.  The present situation in Castlerea is most unfair to both teachers and students.  I would like to join with Senator de Brún in congratulating the principal and the staff there on their achievements and on their dedicated work under such adverse circumstances. The Minister should consider granting a 15 per cent or 20 per cent compensatory grade to those students who are working under such adverse conditions in Castlerea school at the moment and who will be doing public examinations at the end of the year.  In justice this is something to which they should be entitled.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by pleading with the Minister to give the green light to the project in Castlerea.</P>

      <P>Is oth liom go raibh mé mall ag teacht chúgaibh, agus d'eistigh mé go cúramach lena raibh le rá ag an Seanadóir de Brún agus an Seanadóir Mullooly.  Cuirfidh mé in iúl daoibh anois conas mar atá an scéal i gCaisleán Riabhach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I apologise to the House for my lateness which was caused by my own misjudgment of the distance between the Cabinet Room and the Seanad Chamber. The position is that Castlerea has two post-primary schools with a total combined enrolment of about 680 pupils.  As has been stated by the Senators, the vocational school is in need of replacement and some additional accommodation is needed in the Convent of Mercy Secondary School.  The building of a new vocational school has been approved. Castlerea is one of a number of centres, however, where plans already made for the provision of post-primary education facilities have had to be reviewed in the light of the Programme for Action in Education published last January.  Its <Col N="816" /> publication heralded a new emphasis on the desirability of rationalising post-primary facilities as opportunities arose for doing so, an emphasis which was widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the action plan further emphasis was given to the policy of rationalisation of post-primary schools by the recommendations of the National Planning Board, the independent planning board which was established and which reported last April, and also by the national economic plan itself, <i>Building on Reality</i>, published in October.  Both of these documents refer to the desirability of the rationalisation of post-primary education facilities.  The need for rationalisation is justified by reference to a combination of policy objectives, policy objectives which have been widely accepted and widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>Included in these policy objectives are the following: the need, without increasing expenditure, to make educational improvements and meet new challenges through more effective and cost-efficient use of available resources; the need to eliminate in so far as possible duplication and waste in the provision of capital and current facilities; to enhance movement towards greater equality of education and opportunity generally and in particular for girls; to promote coeducation; to encourage greater participation in technical, technological and scientific subject areas by all pupils and in particular to facilitate girls to participate more in non-traditional subject areas. Indeed, that was a matter under considerable discussion in this House last week and one which was very much approved by all Senators.</P>
    <P>We must also associate a policy of rationalisation with anticipated developments and curriculum at second level. The Curriculum and Examinations Board is in operation since last January.  It has been asked, as part of its work, to undertake as a matter of urgency a review of the post-primary curriculum generally. The creation of larger school units, where feasible, should result in a greater capability in adapting to a situation where there was greater diversification in the <Col N="817" /> type of courses available for post primary pupils.</P>
    <P>Following the review of the situation in Castlerea, officials from the Department had consultations with representatives of the County Roscommon Vocational Education Committee.  It was suggested to them that the educational interests of Castlerea would best be served by the development of a single post-primary school in the town instead of continuing with a separate secondary school and vocational school.  The vocational education committee have considered the matter.  They said that they wish to continue with the separate development of a vocational school.  The Mercy Sisters have told my Department that they are willing to participate in one school.  They are willing to have such a school developed at their school complex where there is already a good amount of satisfactory accommodation including a sports hall. The Department are now in the process of getting the views of two teacher unions on the proposal for a single school.</P>
    <P>One thing is certain: new school accommodation will be provided in Castlerea.  What is at issue now is how this accommodation should be best provided. Should it be provided in two separate schools some distance apart or as a single school complex?  I had hoped that agreement could be reached on an overall national approach to centres such as Castlerea in discussions with the national representatives of the interests involved. Because of this discussion there has been some delay in coming to a decision on these interests.  It has not been possible, unfortunately, to achieve the hoped for agreement, so I will be making a decision on Castlerea very shortly after I have fully considered the views of all the interests concerned and the future educational needs of the centre.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> On the questions that were raised regarding the condition and maintenance of the prefabricated buildings, that is obviously a matter for discussion between the VEC and the Department regarding the maintenance and the payment for maintenance and repairs to buildings. Another point was raised by Senator de Brún regarding the payment of rent.  That is a matter which is being considered in the Department, but I would say at this point and I would not like to go further &mdash; that that matter is not as simple or as cut-and-dried as might appear from what the Senator has said.  The Senator is probably aware that there are some complications in that area.</P>
    <P>I have tried to set out for the House what the position is regarding Castlerea. I fully accept the urgency of providing first-class accommodation for all the children of the area, and therefore I expect to arrive at a decision on that whole matter very shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I just inform the Minister that at the October meeting Roscommon Vocational Education Committee considered the situation and the committee would be quite happy to participate in a single school situation in Castlerea provided it is a community college, because <i>de facto</i> such a college exists in Castlerea at the moment since Saint Joseph's lay secondary school and the vocational school amalgamated there?  The vocational committee would be quite happy to participate in a single school situation in Castlerea.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 December 1984.</P>
