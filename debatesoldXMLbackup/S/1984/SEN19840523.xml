      <P>I have been having great difficulty getting into the House during the last two weeks.  I have been besieged on both occasions by some very charming ladies and their elders holding placards. I wonder if it would be possible to draw to the attention of the House the difficulty which these young ladies are having in applying to sit for the examination which they would prefer to do, the one that they are studying for at present, namely the leaving certificate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution arises from the arrangement recently concluded with the Dublin Gas Company and their bankers on the distribution of natural gas in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>There are four sources of finance for the project.  One of these involves the provision by the principal contractor for the first phase of the conversion plan of a supplier credit facility of £10 million to Dublin Gas at a market rate of interest. Repayments of one-quarter of the total amount outstanding will be made on 31 December 1989, one-quarter on 31 December 1990 and the balance on 31 December 1991.  The contractor has agreed to provide this facility only on the basis that it will be secured by a guarantee of the Minister for Finance, to whom the Dublin Gas Company will issue a debenture over their assets.  It is to this facility that the proposed order refers.</P>
      <P>All of the elements of the project financing package are inter-dependent.  It is therefore, essential that the Seanad approves the resolution before it.</P>
      <P>In addition to the supplier's credit of £10 million, the company intend to raise £54 million by means of bank loans and a further £10 million by the issue of loan stocks, some of which it will be possible to convert, at a future date, into equity. The agreement with the company does not involve the State in the giving of guarantees for any part of these funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State will also be providing, <Col N="4" /> through Bord Gáis Éireann, a loan facility of £17 million, £5 million of which has already been drawn down and £12 million for drawdown in July 1984.  The terms provide for interest on the £17 million facility to be rolled up and repaid, one half on 31 December 1989 and one half on 31 December 1989.  The loan is to be repaid in the period up to 31 December 1991.</P>
    <P>In addition, BGE will provide a stand-by facility of £6 million.  This will be matched on a pound for pound basis by the banks and will only be drawn down in the event of the debt profile agreed with the banks being exceeded for reasons other than capital costs arising from the conversion and development programmes.  Where the excess arises as a result of overruns on these programmes, it has been agreed that BGE would advance additional credit on gas sales to offset it.  This will not commit BGE to anything more than they are committed to already to put into the project, that is the BGE contribution in this regard can never exceed their existing total commitment to the project.  Anything contributed by BGE will be clawed back as soon as the overrun is corrected or the debt falls back within the projected level.  I would stress these are contingency measures and that strict arrangements for monitoring and controlling the project expenditure will be in place.  Both the £17 million loan and BGE stand-by facilities will be secured but this security will initially be subordinated to the secured bank loans, the loan stocks and the existing debenture stocks of the company, which are secured by virtue of statute.  When the bank debt has been reduced to £26 million, the State loans will rank <i>pari passu</i> for security purposes with all other facilities.</P>
    <P>The supply agreement between BGE and Dublin Gas provides that, in order to expedite the introduction of natural gas to existing consumers of gas in the Dublin area, the price payable for natural gas under the agreement will be rebated by an amount expected to be approximately £42 million, allowing for anticipated inflation.  This is to meet the cost of converting consumers to direct usage <Col N="5" /> of natural gas.  Any conversion costs &mdash; apart from labour costs and a limited amount of other Dublin Gas internal costs &mdash; in excess of that amount will be funded by a conversion loan provided by BGE.  In addition, in order to facilitate the introduction of natural gas to new consumers of gas in the parts of Dublin which are not currently serviced by the company, the price will be rebated by a further amount expected to be approximately £28 million, allowing for anticipated inflation.  As part of the agreement on these rebates Dublin Gas have agreed to pay a surcharge of £5 million to BGE in 1991.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from what I have already said that the State is making a substantial financial commitment to the Dublin natural gas project.  The bulk of the money is being provided by way of rebates off the price of future gas sales and the remainder by way of loans.  The State will also incur a £10 million contingent liability in respect of the guarantee order now being sought.  The benefits of this approach are twofold.  Firstly, the impact of this enormous and costly infrastructural project on the Exchequer is minimised and, secondly, it provides a neat method of ensuring the maximum incentive for the Dublin Gas Company to go out and sell gas so that they can earn the rebates.</P>
    <P>The provision of a supply of natural gas for Dublin is the most significant infrastructural development undertaken in this country for decades.  It is a fundamental first step in the implementation of the Government's strategy for the orderly, efficient and profitable development of Kinsale gas.  The cornerstone of this strategy is the capture for natural gas of as many as possible of the premium markets.  Overall, the manufacturing sector will also benefit from the arrangements made with Dublin Gas as natural gas will also be available to industry.</P>
    <P>The Government wish to maximise sales of natural gas in the kind of markets which will give the highest return to the Exchequer, have the greatest possible impact on the balance of payments by substituting for the more costly of the imported fuels, and which will use our <Col N="6" /> limited supplies of gas in the most efficient way possible.  Basically what we are talking about are the domestic market, commercial heating and cooking and certain industrial processes.</P>
    <P>The largest concentration of such premium markets is in the Dublin area so it was obvious that our first task would be the construction of a natural gas pipeline from Cork to Dublin.  It is a matter of record that Bord Gáis Éireann, the State body which carried out this work did so in a manner which would be the envy of many a private undertaking.  The pipeline was completed ahead of schedule and comfortably within an extremely demanding budget.  I would go so far as to say that the building of the pipeline was one of the most successful ventures carried out to date by the State and I would like to pay tribute here to Bord Gáis Éireann, their employees and contractors, and all involved.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning that over 70 per cent of the contracts awarded went to Irish industry.  This is particularly satisfying when one considers that it was not possible to obtain the pipeline itself in Ireland.  It is the Government's firm intention that this policy of maximising the participation of Irish industry will be vigorously pursued in relation to all contracts for the Dublin project and indeed all other natural gas transmission and distribution projects throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Having constructed the pipeline, the Government were then faced with a decision as to the best means of distributing the gas when it arrived in Dublin. I should say here that it was decided at a very early stage that gas would be made available to the ESB for use in their Pool-beg and North Wall generating stations. By using the gas in Dublin, the ESB were able to eliminate significant transmission losses and make other efficiencies.  The savings from this alone justified the economics of the pipeline.  But the long-term aim was to give the Dublin consumer the benefits of natural gas at a competitive price.</P>
    <P>In coming to their decision on the arrangements for the distribution of the gas, the Government were conscious of <Col N="7" /> the existence of the Dublin Gas Company, which had an extensive gas mains system already in place.  The Government concluded that it would be possible to negotiate an agreement with the company which would be satisfactory from the point of view of return to the State for its investment and retention by the State of an appropriate level of control over both the distribution project itself and the level of profits which will accrue to private shareholders from the sale of this valuable and limited national resource.  The Government decided, therefore, that the existing Dublin Gas Company should be the vehicle for the distribution of natural gas in the Dublin area but that the State would substantially participate in both the profits and the running of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>An agreement was negotiated with Dublin Gas on this basis, which provided for the financial package which I have already outlined, including the guarantee of the supplier credit arrangement.  The House is now being asked to approve in draft the order to give effect to the guarantee. In return for its quite substantial investment, the State is to receive 56 per cent of the profits of the company, plus an additional 50 per cent of any profits over and above a certain level.  When, after a number of years the bank loans have been repaid, the State will in fact be receiving about 70-80 per cent of the profits of the company, taking taxation into account.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the agreement which entitles the State to guaranteed dividends of £20 million by December, 1992.  The effect of this is that the State will receive, with some minor exceptions, priority over other shareholders in the matter of payment of dividends until this figure has been achieved.  In addition the State in the form of Bord Gáis Éireann will also be paid for the gas itself.</P>
    <P>Under the agreement, one-third of the voting directors of the company, including the chairman for the first two years, have been appointed by the State.  The Government have also appointed a senior management official to Dublin Gas to oversee the conversion and development <Col N="8" /> projects and to oversee the company's health generally.  The State is also actively involved in the conversion and development monitoring committees which are being established to give advance warning of any possible serious overruns on expenditure and will enable measures to be taken in good time to rectify such situations.  The State also has a number of legislative controls over the company.  For example, its memorandum and articles and any amendments to these are subject to the approval of the Minister for Energy.</P>
    <P>It has always been a feature of discussions with the Dublin Gas Company that a supply of natural gas was contingent on their implementing a number of measures to improve radically their operations, which were up until recently riddled with inefficiencies and restrictive practices.  To give credit where credit is due, the company and their workforce have made significant strides in this area and are now, in the view of the Government, a fit vehicle for the safe and efficient distribution of natural gas.</P>
    <P>Up to now the company have simply substituted natural gas for their naphtha feedstock and continued to reform towns gas.  They are at present embarking on a major conversion programme largely funded by the State under the system of rebates which I have already described. Direct use of natural gas is more efficient. It means that gas delivered to homes in Dublin will be non-toxic.  To that extent it is a safer gas.  It will enable the consumer to have the benefit of cheaper, more modern and more efficient gas burning appliances.  Natural gas has twice the energy content of towns gas.  Conversion will, therefore, at a stroke, double the capacity of the existing Dublin Gas network and will make it possible for new mains, providing gas to areas not at present served, to be constructed more cheaply.</P>
    <P>The importance of this project both in the Dublin area and the country as a whole cannot be over-estimated.  It will result in greatly improved use from the point of view of efficiency of our natural gas resource, in significantly increased revenue to the Exchequer and in a substantial <Col N="9" /> beneficial effect on the balance of payments &mdash;estimated to be in excess of £25 million in 1984 alone.  It has ensured the future of more than 1,000 jobs in the Dublin Gas Company which otherwise would have been lost.  The conversion and development programmes will directly result in the creation of more than 700 jobs for their duration.</P>
    <P>The spin-off benefits to industry of the conversion and development programmes will be enormous and will certainly lead to the creation of many new jobs.  It will improve our strategic position in the vital area of security of our energy supplies.  The huge expansion in the market for natural gas will provide just the kind of incentive needed for exploration off our coasts.  In short, we are on the threshold of a new energy era in Ireland.  We have taken the first steps towards making a reasonably priced and secure indigenous fuel available in houses and businesses throughout the country. The draft order which I have placed before the House for approval is an essential first step in this process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all agree with the Minister that Bord Gáis Éireann have done a tremendous job in bringing natural gas to the country.  The switch-on in the Dublin area was certainly an historic occasion and I would agree with the Minister that we are on the threshhold of a new energy era.  It is to be welcomed.  We as legislators must endeavour not alone to bring the gas to Dublin but to divert natural gas into every possible area.  I was in full agreement with the negotiations which took place with regard to the piping of natural gas into the North of Ireland.  That was an historic agreement, to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a bit concerned when the Minister suggests that the Government concluded that it would be possible to negotiate an agreement with Bord Gáis Éireann which would be satisfactory from the point of view of return to the State for its investment. He refers to the retention by the State of an appropriate level of control over both the distribution project itself and the level of profit which would accrue to private shareholders from the sale of <Col N="10" /> this valuable limited natural resource. We see that only one-third of the voting directors of the company, including the chairman for the first two years, have been appointed by the State.  The Government have appointed a senior management official to Dublin Gas to oversee the conversion and development of the project and to oversee the health of the company generally.  I would take it that we are referring here to the financial health and stability of the company.</P>
    <P>I am sceptical, to say the least, with regard to the agreement which has been reached by the Minister and I voice certain reservations with regard to this order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael Members I welcome the motion and express our support for it.  It is impossible for us to consider this motion and the order on which it is based without also considering some of the controversy which has raged about this matter in the press and elsewhere over the last few years.  It is reasonable for the House to see whether it has a function in that regard and whether it can add to public knowledge by its consideration of these matters.</P>
      <P>As I am the proud owner of 100 shares in Dublin Gas, somebody might consider that I have a vested interest in the matter, but that vested interest is so small that it will not significantly affect the contribution which I will make.  Nevertheless I would like to put it on the record of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complexity of the arrangements which have been arrived at between the Minister, acting on behalf of the Government, and Bord Gáis Éireann on the one hand and the Dublin Gas Company on the other, are such as to defy critical examination by this House.  I do not believe anyone could understand what the Minister said here today.  It may well be that the Minister understands it, but the Minister would not understand it if he was basing his information only on the speech which he has read here.  No doubt he has additional information which enables him to understand the background to what he is saying.  Therefore, <Col N="11" /> in supporting the motion which is before the House I do so on the basis of my confidence in the integrity and good judgment of the Government rather than on any intellectual commitment or conviction that what has been put before us is right.  On the basis of the information which is put before us here, it is impossible to say that this is the correct decision for us to take.</P>
    <P>The complex nature of the arrangement can be seen by the examination of one very simple part of it.  It is proposed to have a rebate to Dublin Gas by Bord Gáis Éireann in the sum of £42 million, allowing for anticipated inflation, together with a further rebate amounting to £28 million, a total expected rebate of £70 million.  If you do not know the price which is being charged in the first instance and if you do not know what the price should be, the fact that you are told that they are being rebated to the extent of £70 million does not mean anything. Therefore, is that sum being rebated from a high price or is it being rebated from a low price?  It makes all the difference. We should not gild this occasion with a sense of solemnity which it does not deserve.  No Member of this House should be expected to understand the significance of those two sums of money because we do not know on what rate these rebates are based, or whether that rate was adequate.</P>
    <P>It is also true to say that a substantial amount of the public criticism of this deal has been based on speculation and inadequate information.  Therefore many of the people who would like to portray this as a mistake and to portray the attitude of the Government to Dublin Gas as being unnecessarily protective have not the available information on which to base that decision, no more than we have the available information to base the decision that they are doing the right thing today.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a number of strategic decisions to which the Seanad could make a useful contribution but I do not think we can make a contribution to the numbers game because we do not have the back-up information.  Among the <Col N="12" /> strategic aspects which we can consider is the effect of the decision to continue with a supply of gas, particularly natural gas, to householders in Dublin and the disruption which can be expected as a result of the decision to convert.  The Minister will find himself in considerable difficulty, as being the ultimate guarantor of this conversion programme, unless the conversion programme is executed in a vastly more efficient fashion than was the case in Cork city.  He could have a near revolution on his hands.  My experience with the conversion programme in Cork which is now coming to its conclusion is that it was handled in a disastrous way. The gas company there, probably because they wished to spare people trouble, indicated that old appliances were capable of being converted and held out that expectation to people and found eventually that that indication could not be delivered on.  First-rate customers of the gas company were unable to cook in their homes over a long period because of the manner in which this conversion took place.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about monitoring the over-runs which might arise in this conversion programme.  That is an area to which the Minister should give particular attention because, if the experience in Cork city is anything to go by, the kind of numbers we are talking about here will be nothing compared to the increased costs which could arise as a result of an inefficiently executed conversion programme. This is a lot more significant than any individual once-off guarantee which we might decide to give here in the Seanad today.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have the information.  If the project is successful we will praise them and if it is not we will criticise them, but I do not think it is rational to expect us to be in a position to pass judgment on it.  Confident as I am that the Minister would not come in here looking for a State guarantee unless it was absolutely necessary to do so, I feel that the Seanad should agree to extend the State guarantee under the State Guarantees Act, 1954 in respect of the £10 million specifically asked for by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself at a loss in trying to discuss the implications of this order.  It is a very complex order and to get it at 2.30 p.m. and be expected to digest it while the Minister is speaking is a little bit much, considering that it is a matter of national importance and that a company which is 75 per cent privately owned is being given a State guarantee against loss over the next couple of years. It would appear that the guarantee is to the principal contractor but when one reads on I do not think that is what appears.  Bord Gáis Éireann will provide a stand-by facility of £6 million.  This will be matched on a pound for pound basis by the banks and will only be drawn down in the event of the debt profile agreed with the banks being exceeded for reasons other than capital costs arising from the conversion and development charges.  I would like further clarification of what exactly that means.  It is a totally open-ended guarantee if it covers costs being exceeded for reasons other than capital costs arising from the conversion. What exactly is meant by that statement?</P>
      <P>In the negotiations that went on between Bord Gáis Éireann and the Dublin Gas Company there was a total divergence of opinion as to where Dublin Gas were going.  We had seen public squabbling for a number of years before the Dublin Gas Company were basically taken over by a new group.  The new group are apparently committed to bringing the Dublin Gas Company to a financial state where at the end of the day the State will not be a loser.</P>
      <P>I agree that the provision of the gas pipeline did create many jobs and the contract was carried out in the fastest time and more efficiently than I have ever seen.  Irish workers and the Irish companies involved must be complimented on getting the gas as far as Dublin.  I was not too sure of the symbolism of the Minister going around with a brush at the opening of the pipeline yesterday.  I was not too sure wherther he was going to plug some sort of a pipe or other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The gas supply now <Col N="14" /> being available, I sincerely hope that the problems which have arisen in Cork will not continue to arise.  The Minister's final statement is that we have taken the first step towards making a reasonably priced, secure indigenous fuel available in houses and businesses throughout the country. Unfortunately this is at the very time when another semi-State body have proposals for closing down a number of power stations which are using indigenous fuel.  Some 99 per cent of the fuel that will be used in the Moneypoint project will be foreign fuel.  From what I can gather now, the ESB will be selling from Moneypoint fuels to other native users. When we have the possibility of co-operation with the North of Ireland in the mixing of lignite with the crow coal that is available in Arigna, and indeed in other areas of the country, which could be used in industry, it is a pity to see a running down of those facilities at a time when we are talking about maximising the use of indigenous fuels here in Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is very hard to discuss this order due to the fact that we only got it just as the Minister began to speak.  If it does provide Dublin city with a fuel that is at a reasonable price we must agree with the order.  I sincerely hope that by the time it does get to industry the cost of the BTUs that can be produced by this fuel will be less than the cost of oil and the other fuels that are available at present.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope that if in future there is an order of such importance to be presented to the House at least we will have an opportunity of getting the order in time to have a look at it so that we can discuss it in a rational manner.  It is a 12-page document which we had to look through while the Minister was speaking and the time available was totally inadequate. I would appeal to the Chair and to the Minister that if ever there is another order of this type coming before the House that we be given the courtesy of getting it beforehand so that we know what is going to be in it and can discuss it in a rational manner.  We cannot have a proper discussion on it today.</P>

      <P>In supporting this motion in relation to the State Guarantees Act, 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) Order, 1984, to allow the Minister to assist what is in fact a private company, I take Senator Lanigan's point completely and because it is such a complex measure I would not attempt to analyse it fully in view of all the media controversy about this particular deal.  I might be a little biased but I am quite satisfied that with somebody of the calibre of the Minister, Deputy Spring, in charge of this Department the State's interest will be protected throughout the whole project even when it comes to full fruition.  I am satisfied that the State will be likely to get credit for the amount of money it is making available to the company at this time, particularly in the area of profits in the future &mdash; 56 per cent of the profits of the company plus an additional 50 per cent over and above a certain level.</P>
      <P>As Senator O'Leary said, without knowledge of some of the figures it would be impossible to comment.  To me it sounds a reasonably good deal.  If one looks at the advantage of having for the first time natural gas available to us, it was quite likely that we would have to turn to somebody who was already in the business of providing gas to the people of Dublin.  They had the natural infrastructure and the expertise available to them. They carried out in an efficient manner the conversion of appliances which are being used throughout the city.  I was pleased to see the Minister at his &ldquo;Spring cleaning&rdquo; involved in that particular procedure the other day.  I am pleased also at the number of jobs protected by the deal which I think has gone unnoticed in much of the controversy.  One thousand jobs were protected and a further direct result would gain an additional 700 jobs in further stages of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to join with the Minister in complimenting the people involved in the laying of the gas line.  It came right through the heart of the country and although the crow can fly very easily from Cork to Dublin some of the terrain that these people have been involved with in laying these pipelines is not easy to deal <Col N="16" /> with; it crosses all sorts of natural boundaries and rivers.  They have done an excellent job and the work force are to be complimented.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech he referred to the possibility of the distribution of natural gas throughout the country.  As he will know in his Department my own county have put proposals to him about the possible extension of this gas line because it passes quite close to two very important industrial towns.  First of all, in my own county, Clonmel has already invested a considerable amount of local authority funding which is scarce enough but with the foresight of the corporation and manager there, they have laid a whole new network of pipelines to be ready for connecting to the natural gas line which passes within two miles of Clonmel town.  Proposals have been made to the Minister's Department in this regard and I hope that he will consider them as a matter of great urgency because of the public control of the distribution, because of the infrastructural investment that we have made already and because of the vital necessity where there is such a network of gas users in the town of Clonmel.</P>
    <P>The town of Tipperary, which has quite a lot of industry, particularly the cooperative movement, could also benefit from a spur from this line which I hope would take off for Limerick city from some place close to Mitchelstown, which also is the home of one of the major cooperatives in this country and which it is technically known can benefit from the extention of natural gas for that type of industry.  I would hope that Mitchelstown and, in the process, Tipperary town on the way to Limerick city, would be benefiaries in the not too distant future of this wonderful amenity that we have discovered off our shores in natural gas.</P>
    <P>There is also a tremendous case being made by Waterford and the Minister will have an opportunity this weekend to talk to people directly in Waterford about this problem.  They also look for the extension there of our natural gas in the future. I hope that in reply the Minister may give some indication to the House when it is likely, now that we have almost completed <Col N="17" /> the work of getting it to Dublin, extensions of natural gas to other areas will be considered.  I would like Dublin people to stop calling it &ldquo;Dublin Gas&rdquo; because it is Irish gas and, to say the least, Cork gas being distributed throughout Dublin.  I hope, now that we have completed that major plan, that we will turn our attention to other areas throughout the country which would benefit equally with the city of Dublin from the distribution of natural gas.  I support the order before the House.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I would like to thank the Members of the Seanad for their assistance in dealing with this order.  Regarding a point made by Senator Lanigan, I appreciate the difficulties which the Senator has experienced, and Senator O'Leary also, in relation to the complexities of an order like this.  I would have to say that no information is being released here today which is not well-known already.  In the course of replies to questions in the Dáil over the last number of weeks, I reiterated the information in relation to the actual funding and the package in relation to Dublin Gas.  I appreciate that Senator Lanigan found himself in a situation something akin to trying to reply to a budget speech, which is virtually impossible given the complexities of a speech like that.  I am obeying the orders and procedures of the House but I appreciate the difficulty and obviously it is the sort of matter which the Committee on Procedure and Privileges might like to deal with and I certainly will pass that on to them.</P>
      <P>Senator Lynch raised the question of having adequate controls over the distribution of the gas.  I am satisfied that we have adequate controls between our directors on the board and in particular in relation to the monitoring committee. The monitoring committee is already in being.  The official from my Department is a very experienced technical person and has been involved in this project from the start.  I am confident that we will prevent overruns and we will make sure that the project is implemented in the best possible terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" /> In relation to the actual funding and the actual cost structure, I have mentioned in relation to the rebates the £42 million in 1981 money terms.  Basically it is a rebate on the price and Senator O'Leary was questioning how do we know the significance of a rebate. Obviously the benefit of a rebate only takes meaning when we know the actual prices involved for the gas.  As in any other commercial field the price of gas is what you will get for it, like the price of any consumer item.  In fact, in the case of Dublin Gas getting, as we are in today's money, a price just under 40p it is a good price by present commercial criteria when you consider that the ESB currently pay in the order of 24p for the equivalent unit of gas.  If you look at the rebates we are talking about, £42 million for the conversion rebate, basically what it amounts to is a grant which is passing through to the consumer.  It is the consumer who is benefiting in relation to the whole Dublin natural gas project.  Also, the second rebate is in relation to a development which is a new link-up for new areas of the city which have not at present a gas distribution facility.  In return for these rebates, which are basically grants to the consumers, the existing town gas consumers and the new consumers &mdash; who are necessary in fact for the viability of this whole project &mdash; the State gets shares in the company and a profit entitlement. I would point out also, that the banks are carrying their share of the risk in this venture by virtue of having £60 million in loans in the whole package.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary mentioned the Cork gas experience.  All in all, the project went well.  There were some difficulties in relation to a number of houses; there were delays as some difficulties arose as to whether new stoves would be put in or the old stoves converted.  But I think the Cork Gas Company made it clear at all times that they would, in fact, convert or put in new stoves.  I believe the difficulties in this area have been sorted out.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris spoke about the situation in relation to the distribution of gas throughout the country and the extension of the project.  This is something which I and my Department are at present examining <Col N="19" /> with a view to having the maximum utilisation of natural gas throughout the country.  I can assure him that I want to see the benefits accruing and being spread right around rural Ireland where there are suitable town systems and commercial systems available for the project.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned the stand-by facility other than capital costs of £6 million.  Basically what it means is that we have to look at the profile of the debt due to any shortfall in cash flow at any particular time and this is not related to capital costs.  We have to ensure that the profile of the debt is maintained. There are predictions and a certain profile set out for this project.  The £6 million stand-by facility from DG is to ensure that this will not bump up at any given time and will not go off the projected line.  From that point of view the State and the banks have committed themselves pound for pound to cover any offset in the debt profile.</P>
    <P>That summarises what I have to say in relation to this motion.  Once again I would like to thank the Members of the Upper House for their co-operation and for facilitating me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the banks have a £60 million input into this and they are carrying the risk.  Could the Minister give us a guarantee that there is a risk to the banks in this, because we have seen in the past that where banks are involved the only people who come out on top in the end are the banks.  I would like a guarantee that the State is not in any way giving a guarantee to the banks that if there is a shortfall that the State will get the banks out of their difficulty. Regarding the shortfall on the debt profile, I am not sure whether the Minister is talking about the initial production stages or about a time when the company are trading and if there is a cash flow shortfall that there is £6 million available.  In other words, if the company do not collect their accounts there will be a cash flow shortfall, and is it in this circumstance that the Minister is saying that the State has a £6 million cushion?</P>

      <P>If I might reply to these two very relevant questions in relation to the whole project, one would have to say that there is a risk involved in this project given the size of the project and the costings involved.  The banks have a risk and they have undertaken a risk in this particular venture and the risk element by the banks is not secured by the State.  In relation to the debt profile, that runs from the time of the signing of the agreement right through to 1986.  The company are not getting an easy ride from the Government in relation to picking up any shortfall in their debt profile.  That goes through to 1986 and ceases then and by 1990 or years later again the company should have reached a solid trading position. At that stage we should be getting our share of the profit, between 70 per cent and 80 per cent, including taxation.</P>

      <P>Consumer Information (Miscellaneous Goods) (Marking) Order, 1984,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on 11th April, 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion arises because of the need to bring our current origin-marking regulations into line with EEC law.  The existing requirements are laid down in a series of merchandise marks restriction orders made under the 1931 Merchandise Marks Act.  These orders cover a wide range of products including footwear, carpets, wooden furniture, men's and boys' outer garments, souvenir jewellery, knitted and crocheted clothing and hosiery.  They lay down that products of the types specified in the individual orders cannot be <Col N="21" /> imported into the State unless they bear an indication of the country of origin or in some cases the words &ldquo;Foreign&rdquo; or &ldquo;Imported&rdquo;.  In addition, the sale of many of these products is prohibited unless they are similarly marked.</P>
      <P>In 1977 the Commission of the European Communities complained to Ireland about the restriction orders which we then had on the importation and sale of souvenir jewellery.  The articles of jewellery affected were those incorporating features suggesting that they were souvenirs of Ireland &mdash; such as an Irish character, event or scene, a wolfhound, round tower, shamrock or other emblems.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the orders was to eliminate the possibility of consumers being misled when buying souvenir jewellery. It was felt that if a consumer, say a tourist, was confronted with an article of jewellery incorporating a distinctly Irish motif he would, in the absence of an indication that it was foreign, be of the impression that the article originated in Ireland.  The Commission, however, regarded the merchandise marks orders as contravening the Treaty of Rome which prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports between member states or measures having an equivalent effect. They considered that a requirement which subjected imported products only to conditions which were different from those for domestic products, constituted a technical barrier to trade.  They asked that the orders be amended to bring them into line with what they regarded as Ireland's Treaty obligations.</P>
      <P>We did not accept the Commission's reasoning and they subsequently initiated legal action in the European Court of Justice.  The ruling of the court was that the jewellery orders were in breach of the Treaty and in January 1984, the Minister made an order bringing our legislation into line with the court ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent to the court judgment however, the EEC Commission complained to us about several of the other restriction orders.  Faced with the possibility of further court cases, which in all probability we would lose, it was decided to adopt a new and more flexible system of origin-marking under the Consumer <Col N="22" /> Information Act.  The new order will be confined to a smaller range of products and follows intensive consultations with the relevant sectors of Irish industry.  The products covered are garments and clothing accessories, wooden furniture, footwear, carpets and souvenir jewellery.</P>
    <P>I believe that consumers have a right to be informed of the origin of the product especially when there is a possibility that the omission of such an indication would be misleading.  Consequently, I propose to make the order which is the subject of this motion &mdash; requiring that products in the affected categories, regardless of where they are manufactured, shall bear an origin mark. Under this order, which I commend to the House, no distinction will be made on the basis of the country of origin.  All items whether made in Ireland or anywhere else would have to be marked.  I would make the point that the onus of marking the goods will be on the retailer and thus, unlike the existing orders, no imposition will be put on manufacturers to mark their products with the country of origin though in practice they may do so.  The retailer will, of course, have to be informed as to the country of origin and this is provided for in the order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the previous order that we discussed, I fully support from the very outset what is involved in this order.  I know that we face many, many problems in the promotion, sale and distribution of our own goods at home.  But one of the inhibiting factors and one of the very serious problems facing Irish manufacturers was the competition from not alone our European partners but from the eastern countries where you have cheap labour producing goods which we cannot compete against.  We were unfortunate to have been actually involved in court proceedings in Europe. The Treaty obligations imposed on us have to a great degree affected our manufacturing industry in this country but then, coupled with that, we have companies that I could only describe as cowboys or get-rich-quick merchants at the expense of the working people in this country, who are importing items mentioned <Col N="23" /> here by the Minister &mdash; clothing and other goods &mdash; produced in and purchased from countries which can produce them very cheaply under almost slave labour conditions and advertising them nationally day after day on radio and television with a special type of label.  I would like the Minister to clarify if this legislation would cover this type of trading whereby a fixed brand label that is nationally known, nationally advertised, with probably a very good Irish flavour to its name, is applied to goods and when this label is removed we find that the goods are perhaps made in Korea, or China or somewhere.  I refer specifically here to garments and, indeed, in many cases to the other goods that are mentioned in the order here in relation to souvenirs.</P>
      <P>The Brian Boru harp or other harps were mentioned, the design of which is associated with Ireland.  Most of these that are on sale and that are bought by tourists and by native Irish people in places as far away as Achill, we find are imported goods.  They are being sold and have been sold as Irish goods.  As a member of the Small Businesses Committee I found that this is one of the very serious problems that have confronted manufacturers in this country.  We have made special recommendations that legislation be introduced to try to kill off these &ldquo;get-rich-quick cowboys&rdquo;.  The serious effects this has had on the workforce in this country over the last number of years has been underestimated.  I think if we had some means whereby even in addition to the order before this House we could alert the public to the extent of the abuse that has taken place over the last ten years especially, it would certainly be a help.  I fully support the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I also fully support this order and although it is brief it goes a long way to help various Irish industries. In fact when you look at the areas covered, garments and clothing accessories, wooden furniture, footwear, carpets, souvenirs and jewellery, they are areas which have a large employment <Col N="24" /> content and I think it would in effect help Irish industry to have an Irish marking on these goods.  For too long too many people who wish to purchase Irish manufactured goods find, when they purchase goods, that in fact they are foreign goods.  The order states that all items whether made in Ireland or anywhere else will be marked.  This would give a benefit especially to the tourist who would wish to help Irish industry.  It would give him or her the benefit of identifying an Irish-manufactured item and therefore naturally he or she would go for an Irish manufactured item.</P>
      <P>I think it is correct to put the emphasis on the retailer and although the emphasis will not be on the manufacturer possibly the retailer will insist that the manufacturer would identify his product and in fact if the manufacturer wishes to sell more Irish goods it would be to his advantage to state on that item that it was Irish made.  Therefore, it gives us a competitive edge on the imported item which, as the previous speaker said, comes from countries which have very cheap labour and therefore there is the possibility of dumping.</P>
      <P>This order identifies very clearly a product made in Ireland or an imported product.  It actually gives the item an identification which was not there before, especially in the clothing area where you have a large employment content.  The clothing business is competing against foreign manufacturers and companies which, as I said before, are inclined to dump their excess produce in this country. So, in that area where you have large employment I think it is important that we give them every help we possibly can. This order helps that particular area.  It helps all through the industry.  I think it is right to cover just a limited number of products as it does and it covers, as I said before, a high labour intensive operation. I welcome this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just a couple of points I want to make on the Bill.  I am disappointed that the onus is being placed on the retailer in this to mark the product. It is ludicrous to expect the onus to be on the retailer again.  If it is an imported <Col N="25" /> product the importer should be the one on whom the onus is to mark the goods, stating quite categorically that this unit or whatever it is, comes from such a place.  It is not specified here, but some items can be marked as being &ldquo;Foreign&rdquo; and some must have the country of origin marked on them; I cannot see the difference as long as the product is marked &ldquo;Foreign&rdquo;.  The onus should be placed on the importer to do the marking.</P>
      <P>Again, I am just wondering what is the situation regarding the huge number of casual traders that are going around the country at present, and for the summer months they seem to come out of the ground, as it were.  I am sure that 90 per cent of the goods that are being sold by these casual traders are foreign goods and I wonder could the Minister say how he will implement this order in the case of casual traders moving from area to area.</P>
      <P>Ninety per cent of the items specified in the order, apart from souvenirs, for example, garments of any material, wooden furniture, footwear, carpets and so on, are the very items that are being sold.  They are dumped on the side of streets, unprotected when it rains. Nobody knows where they come from.  I would like, first, the onus to be placed on the importer to mark the goods as to country of origin and, secondly, a guarantee that the casual traders will be monitored more carefully than the person in a legitimate business who can be monitored on any day of the week.</P>
      <P>Footwear is one of the important items with casual or itinerant traders but, I have never seen a shoe of Irish manufacture on their stands.  I sincerely hope that monitoring will take place so that these people will be brought under the aegis of this overdue order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this motion we are talking mainly of souvenirs and the television programme &ldquo;Hands&rdquo; shows the number and diversity of items being produced here as souvenirs whose quality is magnificent, whose price is not out of order.  The junk that has been sold here over the years as souvenirs with Irish motifs has been of disgraceful quality, although I am not suggesting that when one goes abroad, no matter where, <Col N="26" /> one will not also find junk jewellery and souvenirs.</P>
    <P>Over the last 15 years we have created a craft industry of little workshops throughout the country.  When one talks about employment content, these workshops, in the main, are increasing in number. One very rarely hears of one of them going out of business, but rather of their taking on one or two extra people.  One cannot say that they are doubling their staff, but one hears of some bigger factories doubling their numbers and within a very short time the extra people are being let go.  We must in every way possible try to ensure that people in our craft and every other industry are able to regulate their trade without unfair competition from abroad.</P>
    <P>I would almost disagree with the motion if I thought that the importers were going to be free from the onus that should be on them of marking the goods they are importing as to country of origin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to congratulate the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism for having contested the decision of the Commission in this regard.  Senator Lanigan shares the same concern as I in regard to the kind of activity that has gone on under the Sales of Goods Act particularly in connection with souvenirs.  The use of imported goods has been almost criminal. No one knows that better than the Minister of State who is often confronted with souvenirs allegedly from Killarney but actually made in Taiwan or China. Tourists, particularly from the United States, assume that these are Irish made articles and would not otherwise purchase them.  The whole philosophy behind buying souvenirs is that one likes to buy a souvenir made in the country being visited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We failed to win our case in the European Courts because it was interpreted that making it obligatory to have the country of origin marked on the product somehow interfered with the right of free sale under the Treaty of Rome.  We are now putting an onus, not so much on the importer, but on the retailer, to mark the country of origin.  How will the monitoring <Col N="27" /> of that requirement be carried out? We will be totally dependent on distributors marking on the product the country of origin.  I do not know how that can be done effectively and if it is not done effectively our whole market, particularly among the craft enterprises marking genuine Irish souvenirs, could be subjected to much unfair competition under the Treaty of Rome if many products are allowed in unmarked &mdash; the obligation only involving the distribution side of it. It seems quite a difficult order to implement in the spirit that the Minister wants. He possibly has some thoughts on how it will be done at that level.</P>
    <P>We are faced with a dilemma in that many people here have vested interests in regard to the distribution of goods which are not made in Ireland and that is a tragedy.  That happens in every sector, in horticulture and other areas where the home market is subjected to more stringent regulations.  For instance, in the production of food, people are subjected to all sorts of inspections by health board inspectors, and rightly so.  Certainly, one can see every day on shelves similar goods made abroad and we have no idea whether they are subjected to the same regulations as ours.  The home industry is subjected to much unfair competition from people who have vested interests in bringing in goods which they use as a backload after going abroad with other goods.</P>
    <P>We would need to be careful that there are not vested interests among retailers in this industry, resulting in the stamping of an article as made in Ireland when, in fact, it might not have been made in Ireland at all but nobody could prove that.  The manufacturer now will have no obligation to mark on his product that it was made in any particular country.  I hope that the Minister and his advisers will look at the possibility of abuses in this regard.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for having tried the case in the court.  I felt it was a good case but obviously it was ruled that it interfered with free sale and importation under the Treaty of Rome.  For that reason, we have to make an amending <Col N="28" /> order today.  If it can be implemented fully to safeguard producers of our products, I shall welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelQuealy" hpid="Mr. Quealy Mr. Quealy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quealy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the order.  I agree that the consumer has the right to be protected, but like the previous speaker I am a little worried that the onus is being put on the retailer.  We have many &ldquo;fly by night&rdquo; traders and roadside traders who have no obligations.  As Senator Lanigan said, the onus should be on the importer to mark the country of origin. That would be more effective.</P>

      <P>Could I just ask a question before the Minister replies?  The schedule on carpets includes sample carpets displayed in sample books, carpeting, rugs, mats and matting, other than any such articles made or adapted for installation in a motor vehicle.  Why are carpets for a motor vehicle not subject to this order?  In many cases they are adapted from ordinary carpeting.  If somebody is going to sell car carpets as an accessory, why should the country of origin not be stamped on the motor vehicle carpet as well as on every other carpet?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Senators who contributed.  This order is very necessary in relation to the misleading situation with which a consumer would be presented.  A number of points have been raised that have much validity.  Anxiety was expressed by Senator Lanigan about the onus being put on the retailer rather than the manufacturer with regard to marking the country of origin.  Certain onuses are also placed on the manufacturer, who has to supply the retailer with that information.  Generally, an arrangement will be arrived at between the retailer and manufacturer that in the manufacture of the goods this statutory regulation will be observed.  It rests with the retailer and not with the manufacturer to ensure that the legal situation regarding the consumer is met. This is the point at issue here.  The manufactured article will generally carry the <Col N="29" /> country of origin but the responsibility is placed on the manufacturer to give that information to the retailer.</P>
      <P>These orders have been drafted in full consultation with all the interests involved.  It was necessary in the drafting that we did not impinge further on our Treaty of Rome obligations.  We are satisfied that this is quite in order.</P>
      <P>If the products are covered by the order, when must this be carried out? The origin label will have to be clearly associated with the product.  It cannot be covered by any other writing or covering. This legislation will not present any major problems to the retailer.  I believe there will be co-ordination with the manufacturer and that the manufacturer will see the validity of ensuring that he meets the requirements.  Therefore, the retailer &mdash; who is the person responsible to the consumer &mdash; will have that responsibility removed from him.</P>
      <P>On the points raised by the Senator Lanigan regarding casual traders, I assure him that these are covered by the order.  All their products will have to observe the same regulations as those which the ordinary shopkeeper will have to observe and we all thoroughly agree with that.  This is non-contentious legislation. There have been protracted discussions with the interests involved and they are all quite happy with its implementation. I thank the Senators for their further co-operation today.  I hope that, in the first instance, it will give that degree of information to consumers to which they are entitled and secondly, that as mentioned by Senator Lynch, it will help to demonstrate to the Irish consumer the articles that are manufactured at home and those that are imported. Because of that, it should benefit Irish industry.</P>

      <P>This motion arises because I regard it as necessary to introduce a legal measure to deal with the problem of what may be referred to as &ldquo;disguised business sales&rdquo;.  These sales are ones where someone who is selling in the course of a trade, business or profession poses as a private seller in order to avoid his legal obligations.  The purpose of this order is to ensure that professional, trade or business sellers do not <Col N="31" /> hide their commercial status in advertisements.</P>
      <P>The Principal Act protecting the legal rights of consumers when buying goods from business sellers is the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.  This Act provides that where a seller sells goods in the course of a trade, business or profession a condition is, in general, implied into the contract that the goods are of merchantable quality, that is to say, that they are as fit for the purpose for which goods of that kind are commonly bought and as durable as it is reasonable to expect, having regard to any description applied to them, the price and other relevant circumstances.  In addition, if the buyer specifies a particular purpose for which the goods are being bought, they must be fit for that purpose.</P>
      <P>These conditions do not apply where the consumer buys from a private individual, that is, one who is not selling in the course of a business.  There is, therefore, a temptation for the seller to represent himself as a private individual.  I believe that the problem is particularly acute in the case of motor cars sold through the small advertisement columns of newspapers. Here there seems to be a hard core of traders trying to avoid their legal responsibilities and, unfortunately, succeeding in doing so by hiding their business status.  I would hasten to add that most motor traders indicate their status and, indeed, I am happy to say that the Society of the Irish Motor Industry have given their full support to the present proposal, as indeed have other bodies which have been consulted.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to make it clear that it is only where a reader is likely to be misled as to the status of a business advertiser that an explicit indication of this status is necessary.  The order will require that it must be reasonably clear from the advertisement that the goods are being supplied in the course of a trade, business or profession and thus it will not be necessary to have, in each advertisement, an explicit indication that it is a business advertisement.  This meets the concerns of industry, as expressed to my Department.</P>

      <P>I welcome this order.  My question to the Minister in relation to the previous order has been more or less catered for in this order with regard to motor cars sold through the small advertisement columns in newspapers.  Serious abuses have taken place and are still taking place in this area.  If this is confined solely to advertising, does it affect door-to-door sales people who have a professional approach to selling goods, many of which, however, are of inferior quality?</P>

      <P>I welcome this order, which is a protection for the consumer. It specifies the situation that arises regarding car salesmen who are not registered for VAT or PAYE, who pay no income tax or rates and who can set up a business from rented accommodation in any town by placing small advertisements in the local newspapers.  I know of many such cases.  The order may have been formulated because of this abuse with people making small fortunes dealing in these secondhand cars.  With no restriction, there is no compulsion on the buyer to beware.  When a person finds something wrong in effect he has no comeback.</P>
      <P>I am also particularly pleased to see in this order that if the buyer specifies a particular purpose for which the goods are being bought, they must fit that purpose. In too many cases the seller actually says that they do fit the purpose, conning the consumer into believing that that is the case and the consumer then has no redress.  This order outlines the redress for that individual and I welcome it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this order, particularly as it refers to the fact that its main emphasis is on those people who advertise in the advertisement columns of newspapers in the motor business.  Lest anybody be under any illusions 90 per cent of these advertisements are placed by people who are actually full-time traders in motor cars, even though they might have two or three different phone numbers which they will use.  In all cases they set themselves up as private individuals. In the past it has been virtually impossible <Col N="33" /> to stop this type of business going on.  It has had a tremendously detrimental effect on the legitimate motor trade.  As Senator Conway said, legitimate motor traders have been registered for VAT, PAYE and PRSI.  He mentioned that these other people are making a small fortune.  It should be stated that anybody who went into the motor trade in the last number of years with a small fortune is now coming out bankrupt.  If these people are able to make a small fortune out of it, they should be stopped.</P>
      <P>We are bringing in legislation that is going to affect the trading of these people.  What is the Department doing to ensure that there are enough people in the Department to monitor the situation? As a result of two orders coming in today, it would seem that we must have a number of extra inspectors to go around checking.  Have the Department made provision for an inspectorate?  We have seen too much legislation come in in this country over the last ten years &mdash; particularly consumer legislation &mdash; and there is no full-scale attempt to monitor it.  I have seen attempts being made to monitor it in that two or three officials of a Department go down to a court in Kilkenny and spend two or three days over a court hearing, waiting for somebody to be charged with having put a farthing extra on a pound of sugar, or a halfpenny on a packet of briquettes. There is wasteful monitoring of that type where somebody is overcharging by a minimal amount and the cost to the State of pursuing these people is immense.</P>
      <P>The only people who get anything out of these cases are the solicitors involved and the people from the Department who claim travelling and other expenses for waiting two or three days in court as witnesses in cases where a farthing or a halfpenny is involved.  I totally agree with the sentiments behind this order.  The onus is now on the Department to monitor the situation.  I would have hoped that in regard to people who accept advertisements on a continuous basis from people who claim not to be traders but private individuals, there would be some way of getting at the newspapers for accepting such advertisements.</P>

      <P>In relation to the recurring matter raised by Senator Lanigan, article 2 of the order states:</P>
      <P>Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3) of this Article, a person who supplies goods in the course of a trade, business or profession shall not publish or cause to be published an advertisement in relation to such supply unless it is reasonably clear from the advertisement that the goods are being supplied in the course of a trade, business or profession.</P>
      <P>I believe that for the first offence the newspaper may have a defence on the grounds that they were unaware, but that explanation will not be accepted on a second occasion.  So the newspaper itself is responsible if it publishes a misleading advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Should it not then be written into the order that this is the case?  If it is not in the order, the newspaper would seem to have a defence unless there is a regulation under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act whereby it could be got at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>My interpretation is that if a newspaper puts out an advertisement and they are satisfied that it is within the regulation, then they are responsible.  Unless they are satisfied that the person advertising in the small advertisements section is a private individual, which is the principal factor, they must carry an additional advertisement to show that it is being presented by a person <Col N="35" /> in the trade or profession.  The words &ldquo;shall not publish or cause to be published&rdquo; give the legal authority that makes the paper responsible.</P>

      <P>Is the person who advertises the person who shall not publish?</P>
      <P>...person who supplies goods... shall not publish or cause to be published an advertisement...</P>
      <P>seems to me to place the onus totally on the person who supplies the goods, the onus being on the person placing the advertisement.  There does not seem to be anything there that would protect the consumer from an unscrupulous advertiser.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, Senator, my interpretation is that both the newspaper and the person putting in the advertisement are liable; until such time as the advertisement is properly inserted, the newspaper is also carrying responsibility. There is, I understand, provision that for the first offence in the case of a plea being made of not being fully aware, an exemption could be made, but subsequently that plea would no longer hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I come in quickly on this?  This order tries to protect the consumer and it specifies the secondhand car business. I do not think there is any way that a newspaper can determine when an individual is working from a private address.  If it is pointed out to the newspaper that that is the case and if this order covers it then the newspaper has an obligation to act on that.  The newspaper would only become liable if it is proved that the newspaper, knowingly, puts a misleading advertisement in the paper. The emphasis, therefore, is on the person placing the advertisement with the newspaper. The newspaper and the person taking the advertisement could not know that this individual is carrying on against this particular order but if it is pointed out to the newspaper that that is the case then there is an argument and the newspaper then could be liable.</P>

      <P>Two points were raised.  On door-to-door sellers, if door-to-door traders publish any advertisement or even circulate a notice to householders the nature of these notices would have to be in order and they would have to show that they were traders and not individuals.  On monitoring, the Director of Consumer Affairs will enforce this order and will have the assistance of Department inspectors.  I am satisfied that this should work satisfactorily.  I completely agree that there is no point in introducing an order if the necessary staff and resources are not available to monitor it and implement it.  Section 22 of the Consumer Information Act states that the newspaper shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the order is complied with.  This defence will only work on one occasion.  It is under the Consumer Information Act that this section is covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak briefly on this Bill. I would like to compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Connaughton, for the work and thought he has given to the land question over the last few months.  However, it takes a great deal of research to follow this Bill.  The explanatory memorandum could have been a little fuller.  It <Col N="37" /> is an opportune time for the Government to review landholding and land leasing with a view to introducing a leasing system for some areas.  The Minister's intervention will be generally welcomed if he does not attempt to interfere with the three Fs, which have been a very significant force and have produced a lot of blood, sweat and tears for over 100 years. If the Minister is able to avoid that his work will be successful and the agricultural industry will respond to his efforts.</P>
      <P>I am rather disappointed that provision is not made in this rather comprehensive document for the cut-over bogs in the central plane of Ireland.  Bord na Móna have approximately 5,000 acres of cut-over bog.  This acreage will increase in the next decade to about 80,000 acres. They have altogether a quarter of a million acres.  The greatest proportion of this land was purchased, confiscated, CPO'd or whatever one likes to call it, for sums ranging from half a crown per acre up.  It is a national disgrace that neither the Government nor Bord na Móna have yet come up with a policy to deal with this national resource.  It will be a deplorable situation if this generation allow the creation of a new brown desert in the heart of Ireland towards the end of this century.  While I am aware that an interdepartmental committee have been sitting since 1977 and they have representatives of practically all the interested parties involved, I am disappointed that they have shown a certain lack of progress over the last five years.  It is absolutely unacceptable.  I expected that there would be a provision in this Bill which we have been anticipating for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission have almost gone out of business.  There will be many a dry eye after them.  This agency were set up with the best of intentions.  Their scope for changing the face of Ireland was readily recognised but, because of the never-ending shenanigans they carried on, or they succumbed to interference their demise will not be missed. They are leaving undone the job they were charged with doing.  The Minister, in this Bill, will not be able to bridge that gap.  That is the great disgrace of this century.  In the last quarter of the nineteenth <Col N="38" /> century the people charged with land policy gave a tremendous inheritance to the people who followed them, which we still enjoy today.  Even in this Bill I regret that the Minister is not enhancing the work done by Davitt and Dillon, as well as James Fintan Lalor from my county and that it is of a less beneficial nature.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer the Minister to section 4.  I would like to ask him if I am reading section 4 (1) (b) correctly.  If we take the case of a farmer with a half yearly payment to the Irish Land Commission on foot of his folio of 15 shillings per year, am I to take it that the Minister now has power to waive that?  If his purchase was made under the 1883 land purchase scheme he would be coming to the end of his payments.  Some of them would nearly be up.  Am I reading this correctly, that the Minister now has power to discontinue the collection of those small amounts?  Under subsection (1) (b) will he now have the power to levy his own charge on the tenant?  What exactly does that subsection mean?  I have read it and re-read it and it is quite confusing. Section 4 (1) (a) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture may, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, waive, and shall be deemed always to have had power to waive, the payment of any sum of less than £2 falling due for payment on or after 1st day of November, 1979, being a sum due in respect of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  a purchase annuity,</P>
    <P>(ii)  a land reclamation annuity,</P>
    <P>(iii)  any other annual payment to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I assume that the land reclamation annuity would be from the old B plan of the 1949 land drainage scheme.  That facility where farmers were able to avail of the reclamation scheme continued for a number of years into the fifties.  Tremendous work was achieved by that because it got across to farmers in every county the benefits that existed and the improvement that could be made to land by proper land reclamation procedures and <Col N="39" /> practices carried out under professional supervision.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (1) (b) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture may, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, by order substitute another amount for the amount mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection and that subsection shall apply and have effect in accordance with the provisions of any such order for the time being in force.</P>
    <P>I do not know what that means if it does not mean that the Minister has taken unto himself power to waive annuities that are petering out by virtue of the fact that the Land Purchase Acts were in the last century.  I expect they would be coming to the end of their repayment.  The Land Commission over the years agreed to redemption of many of these small amounts and in other cases have not agreed to people redeeming their annuities. I do not know why that should be. If, as this section would suggest to me, the Government now propose to introduce a new kind of rent or to extend the payment of increased annuities, I am absolutely appalled.  I do not wish to make any further comment on that until we have an opportunity on Committee Stage to hear the Minister explain this.  I am confident that my interpretation of this section is faulty.</P>
    <P>We read in the papers this week that the Government and the Minister for Agriculture propose to introduce a new land purchase tax.  While it does not arise directly under this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">

      <P>The Senator should be careful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about land purchase annuities.  It is possible that it may be connected.  I do not for a moment accept everything that I read in the national media because it is very seldom that Government statements, documents or press releases are published verbatim.  I would like to avail of the opportunity to remind the Minister that, if my memory serves me correctly, in the <Col N="40" /> 1965 Act when the Government of the day introduced a surcharge to deter non-nationals from purchasing land, which was the rage almost 20 years ago, it proved absolutely useless to combat the people who were coming in and buying up the larger farms and estates throughout the country.  The surcharge under that Act was something like 25 per cent.  I am speaking entirely from memory.</P>
      <P>I do not see, if the Government's proposal is as the papers suggest, how it will have the desired effect.  I hope the Minister will give very careful consideration to the proposals he now seems to envisage. I do not think imposing any sort of penal taxation will have any great effect on the transfer of ownership of land.  I know it is quite frustrating for people such as the Minister or the Land Commission to find, in relation to the occasional landlord with many hundreds of acres, some of these people buying up everything that comes on the market, in many cases to the detriment of the small farmer who is trying to eke out a living and whose holding with an additional acreage would prove very beneficial to him and become much more economic.</P>
      <P>That would be a disastrous way for the Government to do this and it would not be a good way of raking in additional taxes.  I found it confusing too, when the Minister in his Second Reading speech advocated the optimum usage for all lands.  Is all the Government land utilised to the optimum advantage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were talking to the Minister for Lands it would be an embarrassing question to ask him because the present embargo policy on recruitment to the public service is having a disastrous effect on the Forestry and Wildlife service. Here we have the only productive sector in the public service where by natural wastage, forestry workers who are retiring are only being replaced one for each three who retire.  It means that the management and the husbandry of our forests is falling into decline.  This is not in the national interest because thousands of acres of forests will not mature as commercial timber but will have to be relegated to either pulp wood or fire wood. <Col N="41" /> If there is a case for derogation from that &mdash; I know it is not exactly the Minister's area of responsibility &mdash; it is important that land under Government ownership should be utilised to the fullest and should be a shining example of top class husbandry because Government lands should have the resources of the State behind them.</P>
    <P>People are not born equal whether we like it or not and some people are able to utilise their property to a much greater degree than others.  We must recognise that.  Some people need much more help. This entire question of land is the most vexed question that one can come across. I am glad that the Minister is moving in this direction.  He should make haste slowly because Land Bills do not come through the Oireachtas that often.</P>
    <P>Another appropriate area that we should look at is the entire farm modernisation scheme which comes under Directive 161 of the Common Agricultural Policy. The Minister here should reintroduce land reclamation grants for all rather than have, as at present, the position where once the modernisation plan is completed, after six years no grants are available. In the farm modernisation scheme there should be at least national grants available for land reclamation because it is something that will be of great advantage to the country as a whole.  Many farmers find, especially since for two-third's of the first six-year plan period, the agricultural industry has been in recession, they have not been able to get around to carrying out all the improvements to their land that probably were envisaged originally.  I ask the Minister to look closely at the question of making it easier for people to reclaim their land and especially to drain their land.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to give a farmer more land so that he will have a more economic holding but if you can improve his economic worth by enabling him to improve his land by reclamation inducements or reduced interest rates on loans for reclamation purposes, it would be better than just leasing land to him.  I hope the Minister will look closely at this and perhaps reintroduce the national land reclamation scheme for those people who have <Col N="42" /> not been able successfully to reclaim all their land during the period of the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    <P>We also have the problem of farmers who are in the other low, and to a lesser extent the other high categories for the farm modernisation scheme.  These people have been unfairly deprived of development grants.  I agree that as far as buildings are concerned it would not be as easy to argue for the retention or extension.  On the land reclamation side it is imperative that the greatest possible acreage should be made available to aim at the utilisation of all our land.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of points I want to pursue on Committee Stage.  I expect that most of the queries I have will be answered by the Minister.  The point that I find most contentious is that there is not a tremendous incentive to move people away from full ownership of the land on which they were born and, in most cases, where generations of their families have been born.  I am sure the difficulties that people endure in order to hold on to their holdings are passed down from father to son, right through the generations. For that reason land is something that people hold on to.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister has not taken account in the Bill of the fact that the farm retirement scheme has not been the great success many of us thought it would be.  The underlying reason for that in my view is not something dealing with the principle of land leasing but the fact that in cases where the acreage is quite small and the pension comes to £20 over the means test for the non-contributory old age pension, the people who opted for the farm retirement scheme are at a complete disadvantage compared with their neighbours who did not avail of that scheme and who applied for and got the old age pension.  That is a problem.  It would not cost the State very much if the fringe benefits that are afforded to people on non-contributory old age pensions were also offered to people on the farm retirement scheme.  Those people are in the autumn of their lives.  They are a category of people who have always paid their way, have always met their commitments and are very conscious of being <Col N="43" /> able to meet their overheads.  That has been the tradition through difficult decades. They must see that it is an economic step for them.  When you are talking about people on an income of £30 or £40 a week then a small concession towards that might have the desired effect and might bring considerably more land into the pool for the Minister to reallocate.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Land Commission will be revamped, that the work they originally undertook will be tackled with greater vigour.  I do not know how the Minister will achieve that but I accept that he has made tremendous progress in the short period he has been in office.  I know that people who do not raise too much dust in their offices always remain very popular.  I am confident that the Minister will face the challenges and endeavour to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>I accept that some of the criticisms I have offered here this evening are not 100 per cent relevant to the Land Bill, 1984.  Nevertheless, there is a tie-up there and if we place ourselves in the shoes of the people whom this Bill is designed to help, encourage and assist in expanding their holdings, we realise that they will be looking at the other angles I have mentioned which will certainly impinge on them.</P>
    <P>With a return on capital of 2½ per cent, the lowest form of return on any investment in this or any other country, agriculture is not in a position to take on additional surcharges, whether on the sale of land or in respect of annuities.  I hope the Government will look long and hard at these press statements to ensure that the effect of this legislation will be positive and will bring about an improvement in the area of land structure.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the counties bordering on the central peat plain, Kildare, Offaly, Laois, Roscommon and parts of Galway, there will be some State or semi-State structure set up in the very near future to re-allocate the great landbank there so that it can be used for productive purposes. I hope that the Ministers concerned and the chief civil servants will go down to the Bord na Móna experimental farm in Clonsast and see the £1,000 <Col N="44" /> two-year-old cattle that have been produced there in two years on what was industrial bog up to a few years ago, and then look at the small farmers who are bordering those areas.  There must be a policy and the first people to benefit from a re-allocation or a division of Bord na Móna lands should be the small farmers who are bordering the bogs.  The size of their holdings should be brought up to an acceptable standard.  The centre of the bog area should be allocated into appropriately sized farms for the kind of soil structure that is there.  Whether it would be viable or feasible for even a whiz-kid young farmer to take on a 100-acre farm from scratch without having any mineral soil land to go with it is a question that has to be scientifically tackled.  We only have the coming decade to decide on that.  This is an area in which the Minister must interest himself.  There are 250,000 acres there which have the potential to carry a great number of farming families. On the other hand we must also see if a portion of that land can be utilised for agri-industrial purposes, because through industrialisation of that landbank we could expect to maintain a high number of the industrial jobs that Bord na Móna have provided in these areas for the last 50 years.  We are entitled to expect a continuation of that service.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and wish it every success.  It is a Bill merely to make it possible to lease land.  To get people to offer the land for leasing and others to take it is another matter.  It will take a lot of talking and a lot of convincing before we will get many of the older people to avail of this.  Younger people will avail of it before older people will do so.  Somehow or another with older people there is a type of stigma &mdash; if you let your land on the 11-month system or lease it you are a broken farmer.  Rather than do that, they are prepared to keep the land.  It is the same as the stigma which attached to the <Col N="45" /> county homes, as they were then known. There is no such thing now as a county home, but the buildings are there still under another name and there are some people who would sooner die on the roadside than go into a building like that. When you went into the county home it meant you did not have money or anything else.  We will come up against this sort of thing.</P>
      <P>I do not expect any Government to give special concessions to those who will lease their land or those who take the land.  I feel that the farming organisations in particular will have to put weight behind this.  I happened to be at a meeting not too long ago at which the Minister was present.  It was a meeting called by Macra na Feirme in Boherlahane at which the people from Macra na Feirme, the IFA, the co-operative movement and so on spoke only about 100-acre farms and 100 cow milk men.  I am interested in the small farmer and he is the man who could gain most from this leasing.  Under the 11-month system that was in operation the small farmer never got a chance of getting that land because when it was put up for public auction the big farmer was there to eat it up and the small farmer had to do without it because he could not pay the price the big farmer could.  The result was that the small farmer stayed small and never got an opportunity to become a bigger farmer unless he would get land from the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>One million acres of land are supposed to be derelict.  All this land is not owned by old people.  Indeed, some of the old people I know are far better farmers than some of the younger farmers.  Much land is not being properly worked to its full advantage.  Some of it is owned by younger farmers and by people with other business interests.  People with big businesses in towns have invested their money by purchasing land in the country. They are not working that land to its full advantage.  I know several farms purchased in that manner and under the previous owners they were far better worked than they are today.  The Land Commission should have a close look at this type of farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> Social welfare has been mentioned.  I have been on old age pensions committees for 30 years but they are about to be abolished.  We had the case coming up time and time again of the small farmer with maybe 20 or 30 acres of land.  He may not have been married or, if he was, he had no family, so therefore he could not make over the land to a son or daughter. It might have been a bit risky to make it over to his first cousin or a niece or nephew.  He would not get the old age pension if he were to let the land, because he would have a few pounds more than would qualify him for the pension.  He just ran his farm low.  He kept a few cattle which kept him occupied and gave him just enough to keep him going.  I always felt very sorry for that type of man because we had the other type of farmer with 300 or 400 acres of very good land in South Tipperary.  He was able to make the farm over to the son or the daughter and he could live in the house, enjoying everything he had before and getting his full pension.  I always thought that there was something very unfair about this.  I felt that social welfare should have some special scheme for the small farmer in this position.  The same applies to income tax.  I know widows and such people who let their land and got a bill from the Revenue Commissioners for income tax on unearned income.  Income from the letting of land was regarded as unearned income.  I never agreed with this because people might be making more out of the land if they were working it themselves than they were by letting it, but this was the only way they could manage at that time because there might be a young family or something like that.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the advantage of leasing as against the 11-month system is that when a person takes land on the 11-month system he is likely to abuse the land.  I am afraid that land will be abused even more under the leasing system because a person will take land for ten years.  He will do a good job on the land for seven or eight years.  If he knows by that time that the lease will not be renewed at the end of the ten years, I am quite sure he will not spend much money on that land for the last two years. <Col N="47" /> He will get what he can out of it without putting anything into it.  How that can be safeguarded against I do not know.  When the land is leased a guarantee should be given that on the expiry of the lease it will be returned to the owner in the same condition.  If the man who leases the land builds it up and doubles his herd of cows he will be a very worried man if he feels that at the end of the ten-year period the lease will not be renewed.  The family who own the land may want to take it over again.  Questions will be asked about such matters and there must be some clarification.</P>
    <P>My chief concern is for the small farmer.  I live in an area where there are a number of small farmers and they will not get much of a chance to lease land or take land under this scheme.  I hope that this leasing scheme is not an excuse for getting rid of the Land Commission because the Land Commission are the only hope that those small farmers have. The Land Commission have been ridiculed and people say from time to time that they have outlived their usefulness. I do not agree.  I know that the Land Commission in their early days did much useful work.  During the thirties and the forties huge estates were divided all over the country and large numbers of landless men and smallholders got land from the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>What has really happened is that the Land Commission have slowed down.  I cannot understand the system they operate. If a farm goes up for sale in an area and the local people think it should be taken over and distributed amongst them, they hold a meeting and go to the Land Commission.  The Land Commission must refer it from the local office to Dublin.  By the time the Land Commission decide to go ahead and buy this farm or place an order on it, the farm is sold. That does not always happen but it happens in many cases.  I cannot understand why they cannot act instantly when it is drawn to their attention that there is a farm for sale in which a number of small farmers are interested.  This would definitely solve many of our land division problems.  When eventually the Land <Col N="48" /> Commission take over a farm for division.  I have known them to hold that farm in their possession for seven or eight years before distributing it.  They let it either for grazing or tillage.  I have seen some of their farms that were let for tillage in County Tipperary for seven and eight years running, with the result that when they were finally divided the land was no use to the farmers for at least three or four years because they had to build it up again.  When one inquires when such a place will be allocated, the reply may be that it will be allocated either in January or February.  The man who gets the farm gets it on his own merits but the man who does not get the farm feels that the blame rests with the politicians.</P>
    <P>Enemies are often made over land division.  I do not believe that politicians ever had much influence over the division of land, but people seem to think they have.  We are told that the land will be divided next spring; then spring arrives and it is not divided and there is no reason given.  Some other applicant must have come into the picture and the facts are investigated again and another year passes by.  Much of this work could be cut out.  I have seen quite a number of Ministers come and go in the Land Commission since I came to this House and before.  They all came in with a great flourish of trumpets thinking that all those things could be done, yet they failed to do it.  If the present Minister is able to do it, he will be a great man.  It is the system in the civil service which must be to blame for all of this.</P>
    <P>In the letting of grazing land by the Land Commission, their greatest concern is that the herd must be free from tuberculosis. One of our greatest problems in regard to bovine TB is that a man who has a herd free from tuberculosis may be joined by two or three other farmers whose herds are not free from tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well with this Bill. He has quite a lot of hard work to do, as have all of us in the different political and farming organisations, to make the Bill a success.</P>
    <Col N="49" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I unreservedly welcome the Bill.  It is the first initiative in the area of land tenure legislation since 1965.  Our Irish land tenure system has its own peculiarities, and one of its most outstanding oddities is the 11-months letting system.  This is an oddity in that, by and large, it deploys the land given to its tenure in a very inefficient manner. Because of its leading feature, which is insecurity of tenure, land farmed under it is badly managed and often abused. This is the natural upshot because the lessor every year in letting the land will look for the highest bidder, while the lessee will always try to get as much as possible out of the land because he knows he may not be there for very long.  It always happens then that the principles of good husbandry like fertiliser use, seeding, weed control, boundary maintenance and so on are all ignored. That is only natural because of the very nature of the system.</P>
      <P>The proper context in which to view this abuse and waste of resources is in relation to the well-compiled statistic that one million acres of agricultural land in the Republic are farmed under this shortterm letting system, about one-twelfth of all the usable land in the State.  God has finished making land in Ireland, as he has finished making it everywhere else, but when we consider the pivotal economic role of agriculture in this country, it would be only mild to describe this as an awful waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill under discussion provides in a very imaginative way for a new set of procedures which should shift land letting in our system to a much more long-term arrangement.  This can be only for the good.  It formalises an arrangement in a legal framework by which the lessee can, by agreement with the lessor, rent the land for an agreed long term of three years, five years, ten years or whatever, with legally guaranteed security of tenure which helps to lead to better management, greater output, better income and a contribution to greater exports which will boost the national income.  The advantages for the lessor, on the other hand, are an agreed arrangement on price over the period of the lease and an <Col N="50" /> almost certain guarantee that the land will appreciate in value over the period to a greater degree than would otherwise happen, because of better husbandry and lack of abuse.  Benefits are the lessor's tenure security and the guarantee that the holding will be handed back on the expiry of the lease with no strings attached.  There can be no legal claims for burdens placed or compensation for disturbance, which can be a feature of our existing renting system.</P>
    <P>The selling of this new but eminently commonsense idea as part of our land tenure system is absolutely crucial.  We, as public representatives, have a very special responsibility to encourage it in the national interest.  Others, too, have a pivotal responsibility &mdash; the farming and the rural organisations, the co-operatives, the agricultural advisory services, people providing agricultural consultancy and people like auctioneers and solicitors who play an extremely important role in advising and arranging such lettings.</P>
    <P>Ranged against the advice and blandishments towards this new departure will be the traditional attitudes more entrenched in the farming side than in any other walk of life in Ireland.  There will be many older landowners who will view entering into a long-term lease as being tantamount to giving away their land.  There will be the general fear that the formula under discussion will lead to the placing of legal burdens or incumbrances, the fear of attracting unfavourable notice from the Land Commission, the fear of what such a contract might do to the eligibility for old age pensions or social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Some will express the fear &mdash; many genuinely, more no doubt mischievously &mdash; that long-term tenancies amount to a new form of landlordism.  Where this fear is genuinely expressed, it is not surprising in that we are only about three generations away from the land war.</P>
    <P>I greatly welcome the Minister's provisions that render most of these fears groundless.  There is an assurance that the Land Commission will not seek to acquire any lands which are the subject of the new lease arrangements and that <Col N="51" /> they will not accept any claims for tenancies in respect of tenancies made recently or from now on.  The amendment of provisions of the old Land Acts which could lead to the placing of legal burdens or other such complications under the new lease as proposed is particularly welcome, to dispel the fear a lessor may have that long-term tenancy might establish a right of at least limited ownership by a person renting the land.</P>
    <P>Most welcome, too, is the fact that the Minister has ensured that the Minister for Social Welfare included in the recent Social Welfare Bill provision for new rules of assessment of means for old age pension and social welfare payments to be brought into effect where land is being leased.  This provision will give a very favourable regime of means testing to an old age pensioner or to a social welfare recipient who would opt to lease his or her land, usually to a much younger person.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone the full distance in his legislative proposals to protect the interests of both parties, as far as that is possible under the law.  The fears that are rooted in attitudes and very often understandable prejudices, must be dispelled by careful explanation and by the united effort of all of us charged with responsibility to give a lead in the interest of progress.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the provision in the Bill which places a special responsibility on officers of the Land Commission who are to be employed in selling the measure and assisting where difficulties arise.  We can only hope that will be followed by similar leads elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the area of future legislation on land structure reform.  I have no doubt that the Minister will, in the near future, bring such legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I will bore nobody if I restate the general situation of land use and its various products in the economy.  Despite problems with the Common Agricultural Policy and surpluses in the highly consumer-oriented affluent society markets <Col N="52" /> to which we sell most of our products, nothing still holds a greater potential for growth or potential to add to, greatly to enhance the national income by export earnings, than the produce of our land.  But our peculiar structural set up and the attitudes built into it are a greater blocking mechanism and an agent for stymieing growth than bad business activity among our farmers, bad husbandry and the lack of the entrepreneurial drive.  Nevertheless, agriculture still accounts for almost one-fifth of the gross national product.  It accounts for at least one-third of all exports.  Twenty per cent of the workforce are directly engaged in farming.  Thousands of people are employed outside the area of primary agriculture in the agri-related areas such as food processing, transportation, engineering and so on.  Against this background of inescapable and central importance to all our livelihoods we have the most immobile and often very peculiar land structure set up.  That is, of course, a natural corollary of our particular land history.</P>
    <P>Amost 95 per cent of all usable land is owner-occupied.  That must be the highest degree of owner occupancy, I would say, in the world.  While this is excellent in itself, it has one major drawback: it leads to poor land mobility from older management to younger people who would like to take up farming.  Twenty five per cent of holdings are still held by people who are 65 years of age.  That is quite remarkable.  The average in EEC countries for holdings being held by people of 65 years or over is approximately 7 per cent.  This has obvious economic social ramifications in that it perpetuates the wrong attitude, which places greater emphasis on ownership rather than usage.  Regarding the size of our farms, even today 30 per cent of farms nationally are under 30 acres.  That figure hides certain provincial variations. For instance, in my own province of Connacht, or even including the three Ulster counties, over 50 per cent of farms are under 30 acres.  This is in an area where land is poorest and the climate is less kind.  That may have been forgotten by the Department of Social Welfare in their <Col N="53" /> recent onslaught on the small farmers' dole in the west.  All of those farms, with a few exceptions, must be seen as uneconomic and not yielding anything close to a comparable income.  Indeed most farms under 50 acres in the State &mdash; they account for 60 per cent of all farms in the country &mdash; must be seen as uneconomic or as nearly so as makes no difference.  One could go on for days enumerating the various deficiencies and problems in our whole land structure.</P>
    <P>We might ask ourselves what has been done in the past or what is being done now about the whole area of land structure reform: indeed might I say until the Minister, Deputy Connaughton, came along very little or almost nothing.  The Irish Land Commission, which is supposed to act as the Government's agent of land structure reform and land redistribution, has been moribund for years. Since the publication of a Government While Paper on land policy by the previous Government in 1980 which found that the traditional role of the commission of acquiring land and redistribution to local congests no longer met current needs &mdash; that recommendation was adopted, at least unofficially, as then Government policy &mdash; the meaningful role of the Land Commission has died.</P>
    <P>I would advise the Minister in the proposals he will be bringing forward, to scrap the Land Commission.  I would urge him to establish a completely new land agency which would promote and carry out a radical reform programme which is what we need.  That would have to be carried out within the constitutional framework which guarantees the rights of private property.  I am sure all sides of the House would agree that the State must have power to regulate the land market especially where the interests of farmers who are below or about the economic margins are concerned and those farmers who have a potential for increased output and who maintain a family in conditions of economic viability. Their interests must be seen as paramount as against the interests of people who wish only to acquire land for social status or for speculation or just as an inflation hedge.  New laws on land tenure <Col N="54" /> must put such purchasers at some financial disadvantage while purchases for genuine family farm expansion or for the establishment of a young competent farmer in business must be put at a positive financial advantage.  I am sure that the Government and the Minister will take a careful look at how best this can be done and bring forward the appropriate legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>The inter-departmental final report on Land Structure Reform published in 1978 is an excellent document with many proposals and options in this area.  I would suggest that careful note be taken of them.  I would urge that on the establishment of a completely new land agency to replace the Land Commission it be given full charge to implement public land policy. I do not believe that entrusting such powers to the Land Commission would work.  The Land Commission, in the past, has been shown to have been dogged by slow procedures, by a legalistic approach that at times almost amounted to a judicial approach.  Such approaches have earned the Land Commission many critics.  If it takes three years on average for the Land Commission to acquire a holding and a further average of three years to redistribute it, whatever the legal or administrative difficulties that lead to that kind of delay it is only natural that a small farmer who has been waiting for many years for an augmentation of his holding cannot readily understand that.</P>
    <P>First, I would urge that a new land agency would retain most of the powers vested in the Land Commission at present but that such an agency would have up-dated powers.  It should have separate and well-staffed sections to deal in an up-to-date and urgent manner with group purchases, with the rearrangement of fragmented holdings, long term leasing as we discussed it here today, with farm retirement and with inter-family farm transfers.  Such an agency must be set apart from politics.  It must be seen to be impartial.  It should have full powers to administer public policy in the land area. It should have an executive at least of people with particular competence.  Such people should be competent or expert in <Col N="55" /> farming, in the agri-business and of course in public administration.</P>
    <P>I do not make any of those suggestions from any standpoint of being anti-Land Commission.  There has been much criticism of the Land Commission during this debate.  I fully agree that during the 100 years of its existence it has done an immense amount of good work.  It has acquired and redistributed many of the great estates in the country.  It has created thousands of viable holdings and indeed it has contributed in a major way to creating one of the most stable rural societies in the world in this country.  It is just that its procedures have become outmoded with the passage of time and its functions no longer meet today's needs.  The very name &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; smacks of the nineteenth century.  Gladstone in England had a marvellous penchant for establishing commissions to look into all kinds of problems and social ills throughout the kingdom and throughout the colonies, and the Irish Land Commission is a product of that age of reform.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, and without engaging in flattery I would like to congratulate the Minister on his public attitude towards land reform, especially in the area of land structure reform.  Unlike most of his predecessors who failed to grasp this nettle, he is the one who has publicly pinned his colours to the mast in stating that he recognises many of the deficiencies in our system.  He has the will and the imagination and he wants to have the power to change much of what is wrong in our total land owning and land structure set-up.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald quoted Fintan Lalor.  In the nineteenth century Fintan Lalor was looking at the land problem in terms of landlordism and the land war and he said: &ldquo;There exists in every Irish cottage a man who will bark for Home Rule but he will bite for land.&rdquo;  We have many powerful people in public life in this country, now and in the past, who were willing to bark about what was wrong with our land system and our land structure but very few of them were willing to bite on the very difficult bullet of what we would need to do to reform it. Without engaging in flattery I believe the <Col N="56" /> Minister has the courage and the imagination to bite on that all-important bullet. He has certainly the support of people like me in that area and in that quest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of many Senators with a rural background I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I want to declare at the outset that my sympathies are totally with the farmers, particularly, as in Senator Willie Ryan's case, with the small farmer.  I welcome the Bill in so far as it helps to deal with the problem of land mobility and I feel it will deal with the problem.  It is a good start.</P>
      <P>Since I spent my youth as a farm worker I feel that I understand fairly fully the trials and tribulations of farmers.  For the same reason I am conscious of the dynamism and magnetism as well as the satisfaction that is attached to the farmer's role.  In my early years I knew of elderly farmers who, on Sundays in summer, went out into the fields and spent hours watching their cattle grazing. One old farmer confided to me that he looked forward to the experience on a Sunday the same way as a GAA enthusiast would look forward to a visit to Croke Park to support his county team in the championship.  I believe that farming is a vocation and a way of life that derives its magnetism from a proximity to nature and its unique dynamism from a necessary instinct to survive.  I have spent day after day in remote fields, alone but never lonely, whereas I have experienced &mdash; like so many more &mdash; the terrible loneliness of the crowded city.  The point I want to make is that farming is a very full life, a very difficult life but a very unique and important one also.</P>
      <P>For those reasons, among others, I believe that the farmer is entitled to special treatment.  Even the Commission of the European Communities, in its publication &ldquo;Relaunching Europe; Agricultural policy target 1988&rdquo; states that all countries in some way or another give agriculture a particular role and special treatment compared with other sectors of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not incline to the view that old or <Col N="57" /> elderly farmers should be put out to grass indiscriminately.  This is particularly so when for most of them it is a pasture poor with greedy weeds.  I join with other members in asking for an attractive new farm retirement scheme which instead of the present unsatisfactory situation would provide pleasant meads.  By these means the dignity of elderly farmers would be respected and their expertise would not be lost.  Needless to say I include farmers' wives here.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to hear the Minister say that he is examining the possibilities for partnership arrangements or phased transfer of management between owner and heir.  This should go some way in contributing to a solution of the problem of late inheritance.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this Bill was preceded with considerable publicity and heralding of trumpets.  The result is that apparently some people are disappointed with the Bill.  They have received it critically and with very little enthusiasm.  For example, an editorial in the <i>Farmers Journal</i> on March 10 of this year states:</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation does little more than remove the legal obstacles to land leasing; it will prevent squatter rights claims and will recognise land leasing as a legitimate form of Irish land tenure.</P>
    <P>The Government proposals, however, do not in the least help to build up a momentum of demand for leaseholds.</P>
    <P>The editorial concludes as follows:</P>
    <P>To sum up, the development of land leasing is nationally desirable.  If leasing is to progress, there must be more than enabling legislation.  We must offer direct leasing incentives to less active farmers.  We must plan establishment grants and interest subsidies to enable young lease-holders establish viable farming operations.</P>
    <P>There is no question that this Bill is a frontal attack on the conacre and 11 months systems of letting.  I believe that both these systems are a feature of the Irish method of letting, conacre in particular. I was interested in the derivation of <Col N="58" /> the word &ldquo;conacre&rdquo;, because it seemed to me that it has possibilities in finding out, for example, who was being conned. It turns out that it is simply a shortening of the words &ldquo;corn acre&rdquo;.  This applies to land that was tilled, but the 11 months system applied mainly to pastureland.  In theory I can see the reasoning in the argument that this is a bad system.  Yet, I feel that over the years there were many people who benefited from this system. Indeed, in my own case, growing up as a young lad, we benefited too with the small allotment of land we had.  Widows and elderly farmers and people who were unable to cultivate or till their land benefited through this system.  With this system the auctioneer, back over the years, was a very important individual and filled a very important role.  He advised the farmer on the value of the land and in other areas as well; for example he advised him on taxation, on the schooling of his children, where they should go and various other areas.  The auctioneer filled a very important social role, and now the position is that the auctioneer is being pushed out, perhaps to make room for lawyers.  I have a copy of the master lease produced by Allied Irish Banks Limited and the Irish Farmers Association with the co-operation of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.  It is a very complicated legal document and is one on which a farmer would need a lawyer's advice on the different clauses therein. Apparently in this regard the lawyer will take over to some extent and the auctioneer will be pushed out to a considerable extent.  I can see a difficulty here in the case of somebody leasing their land in determining what would be a just and proper price to get for it.  Over the short period of one year, it is easy to anticipate what prices will prevail and what to charge for leasing, but over a longer term there will be considerable difficulty.  I am not sure who will fulfil this role.  ACOT and the co-ops are mentioned: I am sure that they will not be able to cater on the broad scale that will be necessary.  Over the years, auctioneers, as well as fulfilling those roles, were really bankers to many people, which is a very important area. <Col N="59" /> Altogether auctioneers filled a very worthwhile role.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what he envisages will be the situation with regard to leasing as I believe the fees which auctioneers received from lettings made up a very large proportion of their income.  I also believe that in regard to the letting of land on the 11-month system, the Land Commission was one of the worst offenders.  In some cases, I understand that land was let for up to ten years. I can understand that there would be problems in the allocation of land in determining who should receive what, but over that period such delays were completely unjustified.</P>
    <P>Over a considerable number of years, 25 years or more, there has been a demand for this legislation.  A book published in 1974 by Des Maguire of the Land Commission &mdash; one which I was interested enough to get at that time &mdash; dealt with this problem with regard to land mobility and made the case for long term leasing of land.  Until recently it was long term leasing of land that was in question.  One of the criticisms which I have of the Bill is that it does not state a minimum period of leasing.  Des Maguire in 1974, it seems to me though he did not state this specifically in this book, was recommending a period of 12 years for a lease.  Also, in his book he dealt with long term leasing in Europe: in countries like Holland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium and Italy.  Apparently, even at that time leasing was popular on the Continent.  There is no reason why it should not be successful here.  In a later book published this year he went into the question of leasing and he stated, as follows, on page 57:</P>
    <P>Term leasing allows freehold ownership to be retained.  It encourages long term planning and development at a relatively low capital cost, when compared with the scale of land purchase and consequential development costs.  It allows the available capital of the farmer to be invested in actual farming development rather than in the heavier commitment of land purchase. <Col N="60" /> It can provide a realistic and secure annual income to the owner through the rent received and the provision for regular rent reviews during the term of the lease.</P>
    <P>The Interdepartmental Committee on Land Structure Reform, in its interim report published in 1977, stated in relation to the system of letting and leasing, on page 16:</P>
    <P>It was submitted to the Committee that in the interests of developing long term leasing in land, the 11-month and conacre systems should be made illegal. We do not consider that such a measure is possible or desirable.  Informal neighbourly arrangements could not be monitored for this purpose. Conacre has been shown to be managed to good husbandry standards &mdash; and to make it illegal might result in even less land becoming available for tillage farming.  We feel that any necessary curbs on these short term lettings can only be implemented indirectly in the context of a more comprehensive set of measures aimed at discouraging the under-utilisation of land.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 27 of the same report says:</P>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing, the Committee recommends that the practice of medium to long term leasing should be actively supported.  Initial emphasis might be on mid- to long-term (six years minimum) leases.  We propose to consider further the incentives that might be offered to encourage this form of leasing.  In any case the agency should provide the necessary legal back-up for a leasing system, this to include model leases.</P>
    <P>In its final report, the Interdepartmental Committee on Land Structure Reform, in May 1978 stated under the heading &ldquo;Long-term Land Leases&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Almost 25 years ago the Commission on Emigration suggested that Irish farming would benefit from a more widespread system of long term leasing. Since then, leasing has been a <Col N="61" /> recurrent theme in land policy discussions.</P>
    <P>In the Four-Year Plan for Agriculture which was published in the last few days, I should like to quote a paragraph on page 125, which deals with leasing:</P>
    <P>Public policy and public discussion should encourage farmers to accept that ownership of land and the use of it do not have to be vested in the same person and that the letting of land for a period can be of positive advantage to both parties.  Leasing for relatively short periods, say five years or so, should be encouraged initially, rather than on insisting on a period of 12 years or more.  A model lease is now available and this will be of assistance to prospective contracting parties.  Both parties to the lease should have adequate appreciation of their respective rights and obligations.  Fear on the part of farmers that their ownership of the land will be infringed in some way if they lease it, is likely to make them reluctant to enter into leases.  It would be important to dispel this fear.  Certainly any dormant legislative provisions which might be seen as a deterrent to leasing should be revoked as early as possible.</P>
    <P>Of course all this has been covered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a kind of vagueness about the length of a proper letting.  I have seen in other circumstances that three years have been suggested as a minimum.  This would be a matter that could be cleared up in the Bill, and a definite period set down.</P>

    <Title>Illegitimacy Status: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with approval the recent report of the Law Reform Commission recommending the abolition of the status of illegitimacy and calls on the Government to introduce legislation removing all existing legal discriminations against children born out of wedlock and providing an integrated support structure for one-parent families.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Robinson).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much to add to what I have already said on this subject, but was trying to draw the comparison between two babies appearing into this vale of tears on the same night in any maternity hospital in this island, one born in wedlock and one born out of wedlock, and to ask Senators whether in fact these two children in relation to the stipulations of the Constitution could possibly expect anything similar by way of expectation as they grow up.  We certainly have moved a long way in Ireland from what I remember as a child, where there were places in small towns known to have children being looked after by dedicated members of religious orders and it was taboo to talk about why they were there, what they were doing there, or what their expectation was.  We have a much more humane and caring society today, but have still a long, long way to go.  Both Senator Robinson in proposing the motion and Senator M. Higgins in seconding it have highlighted the way which we have to travel, the hurdles that we have to cross and the changes in attitude with which we have still to challenge ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context, I would like to remind all the Senators here and the people outside of a man who was perhaps the late President de Valera's most respected English confidante &mdash; a man who helped him through the period of those tense negotiations in 1938 at the time of the External Relations Act, the time of the great contention over the ports, the problems <Col N="63" /> of Irish neutrality and who, more than any other, helped a very conservative English establishment to understand the feelings of the people of this part of Ireland.  That man, whom many of you will remember here, negotiated with the late Seán Lemass, and the late Seán MacEntee and, indeed, the father of one of our respected Senators, was none other then Malcolm McDonald, who was in the English Cabinet at the time.</P>
    <P>Malcolm McDonald was the son of Ramsey McDonald, but Ramsey McDonald, who was the first Socialist Prime Minister of England, was born an illegitimate child in Lossiemouth, in the north of Scotland.  I just wonder if a similar person with similar talents had been born in this part of Ireland whether he might have risen to the position of Taoiseach, especially so many years ago, and I would doubt it.  Ramsey McDonald, in spite of the criticism he received in later life, was a man who, more than any other, should have been seen to have done most to dispel the odium which used to go with illegitimacy, the taboos that went with it and the residual difficulties which people still have, in a very conservative country, in coping with it.</P>
    <P>In the context of Article 40 of the Constitution which cherishes the equal rights of the citizen, it would be well to remind ourselves that in a changing era the old saying that all men are born equal has perhaps come to mean that all men should have an equal opportunity to be the same.  Certainly in relation to the basic needs of life, warmth, shelter, food and care, all men should have this equal opportunity.  But if life is to mean more than that, particularly in this highly centralised age with its emphasis on uniformity, do we not also have to consider that all men should have an equal right to be different, all men different, each unique.</P>
    <P>The question I put before the House here tonight is: Do we not have a moral duty to find, develop and liberate the uniqueness that is the inheritance of each one born into this world, particularly on the island of Ireland?  We will never be able to do that if we cannot start right at <Col N="64" /> the beginning.  We will never do that if we continue to make a distinction between children born in wedlock and therefore permitted to have certain privileges for development and those born out of wedlock without such privileges.</P>
    <P>Apart from privileges we might also talk about opportunity and emotional development.  It is in the whole area of emotional development that health and wholeness in the developing child and the mature adult come into being.  Unless there is warmth, confidence and the support of the extended family freely given and the support from the network of community agencies and activities to which the particular child can relate, then we will have stunted growth and an impoverished person &mdash; and do not let us forget that we have seen plenty of instances of it in our sad country.</P>
    <P>Attitudes are the other side of the equation to actions.  Where there have been impoverishment and bitterness and where attitudes relate to such impoverishment and bitterness, then actions all too often become violent.  We are in the process of trying to reverse that trend, to create a caring and loving society in which, indeed, all the children can grow up with equal expectation to develop uniquely the talent which they have inherited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of addressing the Seanad on what I regard as one of the more important social issues of our day.  I have listened with interest to the contributions to the debate so far, and look forward to hearing what other Senators may have to say this evening.  I can assure the House that all the points made will be carefully considered in connection with the proposals for amendment of the law on illegitimacy which are at present being prepared in the Department of Justice.  This work is being given top priority, and I expect to have a Bill ready for presentation to the Oireachtas by the end of the year.  I should like to stress here that there is no question of hesitation or ambivalence on the part of the Government in regard to these proposals, as <Col N="65" /> Senator Robinson suggested in her opening remarks.</P>
      <P>What I find particularly gratifying is the element of consensus which has emerged as to the principal features of the proposed legislation.  My impression from the debate is that there is broad agreement on all sides as to the approach to be adopted to the problem.</P>
      <P>As I said in my statement of 24 October last, announcing the Government's decision to reform the law in this area, it is intended to concentrate on removing those provisions in our law which discriminate against children born outside marriage. The terms &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; and &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; will be avoided in the proposed legislation.</P>
      <P>As regards parental rights, the legislation will provide a means whereby the fathers of children born outside marriage can obtain parental rights in appropriate cases, the guiding principle being what is in the best interests of the child in each case.</P>
      <P>In relation to succession rights, the Government have accepted generally the Law Reform Commission's recommendation that children born outside marriage should have the same succession rights as other children on the intestacies of their fathers and mothers and of relatives of their fathers and mothers.  As mentioned by Senator Robinson, under existing law a child born out of marriage has no succession rights on the intestacy of its father, but may benefit on the intestacy of its mother if she leaves no legitimate issue.  People, of course, are free to provide by will for their children born outside marriage, subject only to the legal right of a spouse to a certain share of the estate.</P>
      <P>The Government have also accepted the recommendations of the commission that the present rule of construction, under which words such as &ldquo;children&rdquo; and &ldquo;issue&rdquo; when used in wills, deeds or other instruments are presumed to refer <i>prima facie</i> to children born within marriage, should be set aside.  It should be borne in mind, incidentally, that when speaking of &ldquo;children&rdquo; in the context of succession, we are referring in practice, in many cases, to mature adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> Other matters that will be dealt with in the proposed legislation are actions to prove parenthood, blood testing as an aid to proof of paternity, the registration of the births and maintenance of children born outside marriage.  Senators will appreciate that the issues involved in these changes are complex and time-consuming. Proposals being worked on at present are of a very tentative nature and I am not in a position, as yet, to say what solutions are likely to be proposed in particular areas.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I think I should say that, on the basis on which Senator Robinson proposed and Senator Higgins seconded this motion and the explanations given by them for bringing the matter before this House, I am happy to accept it.  However, I should like to take issue with one point that appears to me to be important in clarifying the issue.</P>
    <P>In proposing the motion, Senator Robinson spoke of the need to abolish illegitimacy.  Other Senators in their contributions also used this expression.  In the development of her argument, however, it seemed to me that Senator Robinson's thinking on how the problem should be tackled was much closer to the Government's approach than might have appeared from her opening remarks.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, the idea of abolishing illegitimacy altogether has an attractive simplicity about it.  It has, indeed, been welcomed not only by several Senators but by a number of people and organisations as the proper formula for reform. The problem with this formula, however, is that while it probably is usually seen as relating to children only, it does have implications in relation to the parents of these children, some of which are unacceptable to most people.  It is clear from her remarks that Senator Robinson also finds such implications unacceptable.</P>
    <P>In practical terms, the abolition of the status of illegitimacy would mean that every father of a child born outside marriage, however fleeting his relationship with the mother, or however little actual interest he took in the child, would automatically have the same parental rights over the child and the same succession <Col N="67" /> rights to the child's estate as a married parent has in relation to a child.  If the father died, his relatives, claiming through him, would have the same succession rights on the child's intestacy as if the father had been married.  The Law Reform Commission, in their Report on Illegitimacy of September 1982, at paragraph 202, accepted that the logical effect of their proposal to remove the status of illegitimacy from our law would be that, and I quote from the report:</P>
    <P>The legal relationship between parent and child will arise without discrimination between children on account of the marital status of their parents.  The Commission consider that there should be no condition precedent in our law which must be fulfilled before this legal relationship arises between parent and child.  Such an approach would offend against the principle of equality on which our proposals are based.</P>
    <P>Further on in their report, at paragraph 353, when dealing with guardianship and custody, the commission in accepting that their basic proposal entailed that the fathers of all children born outside marriage would automatically become joint guardians with the mothers, state, and I quote from the report:</P>
    <P>In favour of this change it can be argued that, if the abolition of the concept of illegitimacy is to be meaningful rather than cosmetic, such a consequence must follow.  To preserve a distinction as to guardianship based on the marital status of parents discriminates against the child as well as the parent since guardianship may be regarded as being in the child's interest as well as a right of the parent.</P>
    <P>The commission then went on to cite arguments against this proposal, including some mentioned by Senator Robinson. These arguments did not sway them to alter their own view and, in paragraph 358 of their report which has been quoted by Senator Robinson, they recommended that both parents should be joint guardians whether the children are born <Col N="68" /> within or outside marriage.  The only concession envisaged by the commission was that a mother who would not wish the father to have guardianship rights should be entitled to apply to a court to have the father's rights set aside.  The court might make an order to this effect when it was satisfied that it would be in the best interests of the child and proper to do so, having regard to the rights and interests of all other persons concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson points to the difficulties such a situation would create for many unmarried mothers and to the concern about it felt by several organisations catering for single parents.  She makes some positive and helpful suggestions for dealing with this problem.  While I welcome these suggestions and shall have them carefully considered, I should like to point out that to give effect to them would necessarily involve differentiating between the parental rights of fathers, depending on whether their children were born within or outside marriage.</P>
    <P>The Government were also unhappy about this situation, and it is for that reason that they decided, as I have already indicated, that the proposed legislation would not, as recommended by the commission, automatically give the fathers of children born outside marriage the same rights as married fathers enjoy.  However, it has to be accepted that once it is decided to differentiate between fathers on this basis, even though it be in the interests of the children, one cannot speak of abolishing illegitimacy entirely.  One could, of course, use another term, but the difference would remain.  The Government, in adopting this approach to the question of parental rights had regard to views received from representative organisations to the effect that the automatic granting of such rights in all cases could be detrimental to the interests of children.</P>
    <P>For instance, one of the major points to emerge from the public seminar which I organised in February 1983, to discuss the implications of the Law Reform Commission's report, was that many people involved in this area were very concerned about the consequences of the radical <Col N="69" /> change proposed by the Law Reform Commission.  It is interesting to note that the English Law Commission, in a working paper of July 1979, proposed provisionally that the status of illegitimacy be abolished entirely.  Public reaction &mdash; including submission from the National Council of Women of Great Britain &mdash; to this working paper was such that, in their final report published in December 1982, this proposal was dropped.  Instead, they recommended that an unmarried father should not be given parental rights in any case, unless he applied successfully to the court for such rights.</P>
    <P>In this country, the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their Children undertook a survey in 1983 of their member organisations, seeking their views on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  I might mention that the federation include in their membership most, if not all, agencies working in this field.  The proposal that all fathers should automatically have full guardianship and succession rights in relation to their children born outside marriage was overwhelmingly rejected. The survey also showed that there is a widely held view that there should be a means whereby, in appropriate cases, the father of a non-marital child should be able to acquire such rights.</P>
    <P>Senator M. Higgins spoke of correspondence which he received on this subject being &ldquo;property-oriented&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;child-oriented&rdquo;.  He pointed out that the child born outside marriage is likely to be at a disadvantage in society from the moment of conception.</P>
    <P>The law can be, and will be, changed so as to remove discrimination against illegitimate children, but no matter what changes are made in the law, the element of social stigma which still attaches, regrettably and unjustly, to the child whose parents are not married to each other will not diminish unless there is a fundamental change in social attitudes. We are all aware, too, of the social handicaps facing a woman who finds herself in the predicament of being pregnant and unmarried.  These are things which cannot be legislated out of existence, <Col N="70" /> although legislation can assist in setting the tone for change in attitude.</P>
    <P>I wish now to turn to the question of a support structure for one parent families. There are many voluntary bodies working in this field whose aim it is to help and support such parents and their children. What the State can do, and is doing, is to make financial support available to these bodies, in a small way from the Office of Women's Affairs but to a greater degree from the Department of Social Welfare, or through the health boards.  The idea of an integrated support structure for one parent families, as suggested in the motion, is worth considering.  This part of the motion is not, of course, confined to unmarried mothers and their children, as single parent status can arise from many causes, such as death, desertion, or separation.</P>
    <P>There are a number of ways in which the health services are giving positive support to one parent families.  The most important areas of support are their social work services and in helping to provide and encourage the development of day care facilities for children generally. Boards also financially assist a number of organisations who represent, support, advise and counsel one parent families and in some cases represent their interests at national level.</P>
    <P>The policy generally in the health services with regard to day care centres for children is to help in their development and operation especially in deprived areas and for children at risk. Health boards do not themselves get involved in providing the services, but rather facilitate their provision by the voluntary organisations to ensure maximum involvement by the local communities. In certain cases where day care centres are catering for deprived children or children at risk, boards will actually provide funding.</P>
    <P>The number of children in 1983 being catered for by centres funded by health boards was about 6,000 and the number of assisted centres has risen from 87 in 1981 to 175 by 1982 &mdash; the latest available figures.</P>
    <P>There is at present a problem with regard to regulation of day care facilities <Col N="71" /> in that no statutory regulation exists. However, a new Children Bill which is being prepared by the Minister for Health will provide for the regulation and control of day care services by health boards.  This legislation will provide for the registration of centres and for the setting down of standards for the operation of day care centres and play groups.</P>
    <P>Of particular relevance to one parent families is the proposed EEC second programme to combat poverty.  A seminar will be held in Copenhagen in June to discuss the problems faced by one parent families, and it is hoped that concrete proposals for research and action relating to those problems will emerge and form part of the second EEC programme.</P>
    <P>Adoption is a matter of considerable relevance to single parents and the organisations representing them.  Over a year ago the Government transferred the functions in relation to adoption to the Minister for Health, who has the main responsibility for child care services.  He has since established a Review Committee on Adoption Services.  This committee have received submissions from a number of organisations representing one parent families, and the issues raised by them will be dealt with in the committee's report which will be submitted to the Minister for Health in the very near future.</P>
    <P>In August 1983, the Government set up the Commission on Social Welfare to review and report on the social welfare system and related services, and to make recommendations for their development, having regard to the needs of modern Irish society.  In the course of their deliberations, the commission will no doubt be examining the needs of one parent families &mdash; and, indeed, of all families &mdash; in this context.  The commission are expected to issue their report in the autumn of 1985.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to point out for the record that, contrary to what Senator Robinson and some other Senators have said, the Programme for Government of the present Government did not contain a reference to the subject of illegitimacy.  The proposal which the <Col N="72" /> Senators appear to have in mind was included under the heading Law Reform in the programme of the previous Coalition Government drawn up in the summer of 1981.  When the present Government came into power, the Law Reform Commission's report had just been published and was clearly of such a nature as to require careful and detailed consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to avail of this opportunity to state that I am in full agreement with the motion, as all the other speakers are, and, in fact, to say that it is long overdue.</P>
      <P>From the quarterly report on births, deaths and marriages published by the Central Statistics Office, I note that for the year 1979 under births, the total includes 3,331 illegitimate births, which is equivalent to 4.6 per cent of all births registered.  In the year 1980 the total includes 3,691 illegitimate births, equivalent to 5 per cent of all births registered. For the year 1981 the total includes 3,911 illegitimate births, equivalent to 5.4 per cent of all births registered.  The latest figures available are for the year 1982 when the total includes 4,351 illegitimate births, equivalent to 6.1 per cent of all births registered.  There is no question that this is a very big and growing problem.</P>
      <P>In this discussion we might take in the area of sexual morality, but in the short time at our disposal it would be impossible to go into this in any great detail.  I can only say that there has never been a consistently fixed datum line for sexual morality.  If I were dealing with this area, I would have to take that into account. There has been a stigma attached to illegitimacy. This may have been a protective measure for society.  The best environment in which to rear children is in a home with a loving father and mother.  In many cases perhaps a one-parent family would have been more successful but nevertheless, in general, everybody would agree that a loving father and mother are desirable.  For that reason, society attached this stigma to children born outside marriage and, indeed, to the mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> With regard to unmarried mothers, there is widespread sympathy for them but not by any means total sympathy.  I spoke on two occasions at meetings in favour of getting better financial assistance for unmarried mothers and more care of them in the way of housing and in other areas.  On each occasion a young girl came to me and said that I was wrong and that she did not agree.  I was rather disturbed at that attitude in the young.</P>
    <P>It would be desirable to avoid the offical use of the terms &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; and &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo;.  I agree with the 68 recommendations in the report by the Law Reform Commission and note that the commission make no recommendations relating to AID or the amendment of the law of adoption consequent on the abolition of the status of illegitimacy.  The report states:</P>
    <P>These are, in the Commission's view, essentially matters of social policy and, as such, more properly matters for termination by the Oireachtas...</P>
    <P>This is a pity, particularly with regard to the adoption of legitimate children.  I have a copy of a submission made to the Government in relation to reforms in the adoption system by the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their Children, the Central Council of Catholic Adoption Societies, Children First, Adoptive Parents' Association of Ireland, CARE and CHERISH.  This states on page 14, with regard to the adoption of legitimate children:</P>
    <P>The participating Organisations have previously stated and are agreed that a child should be eligible for adoption irrespective of the marital status of his natural parents, and that the law and if necessary the Constitution should be changed to permit this.</P>
    <P>They take this view on the basis that a child not merely ought to have a normal family life, but that he has a right to such a family life within a permanently functioning and caring family.</P>
    <P>The right arises from his psychological and physical need for such... <Col N="74" /> By not allowing the adoption of a legitimate child, the law effectively deprives some legitimate children of access to such an environment and so discriminates against them.  Accordingly, any child should become eligible for adoption when it has been established to the satisfaction of the Court that his parents are unable and/or unwilling to filfil their parental obligations towards him, and that it is probable that this state of affairs will continue for the foreseeable future.  The recommendations relating to consent to adoption and to dispensation with consent, contained in section 3 of this document, should apply to adoptions of all children.  There appear to be legal and constitutional uncertainties which might hinder making the reform just described.  The main uncertainties seem to be: (i) does the Constitution adequately guarantee the right of a child to a normal family life and (ii) even if the Constitution so guarantees what is the situation when the child's right conflicts with the rights of the family, effectively of the parents, guaranteed by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Adoptive Parents' Association of Ireland in a policy document in 1981 stated with regard to the adoption of legitimate children:</P>
    <P>There has recently (1980) been apparent an upsurge of opinion amongst professionals working the field of child care that, in principle, legitimate children, subject to safeguards, should be eligible for adoption. The APAI is in favour of this principle. The criterion of eligibility for adoption should be, not illegitimacy, but the child's need for the active support of a caring family combined with the lack of such a family.</P>
    <P>The Irish Council for Civil Liberties made a number of comments on the proposed legislation on illegitimacy and referred to the report of the Law Reform Commission.  They stated, as I have already said, that they would welcome the proposal that the official use of the terms legitimate and illegitimate should <Col N="75" /> be avoided in the amending legislation. They also welcomed the proposal that a child born out of marriage should have the same succession rights as other children on the intestacies of their fathers and mothers and the relatives of their fathers and mothers.  However, they noted that the proposal does not mention the rights of fathers to inherit property of their illegitimate children on intestacy. They recommended that such a right be introduced in legislation along the lines of section 117 of the Succession Act allowing fathers to claim a share in the estates of their illegitimate offsping but only on intestacy and only if the father has carried out his moral obligations in relation to the child.</P>
    <P>They welcome the fact that the Government have accepted the Law Reform Commission's recommendation that the present rule of construction under which words such as &ldquo;children&rdquo; and &ldquo;issue&rdquo; when used in wills, deeds or other documents are presumed to refer to children born within marriage should be set aside.  They did, however, feel that the implications for trust law and the taxation implications ought to be clarified in the legislation as these matters are not dealt with in any detail in the commission's report and could lead to enormous difficulties for administrators of trusts at a later stage.  They welcome the giving of parental rights to the unmarried father in certain circumstances.  Such rights, they said, however, should not be automatic and should only be available to the unmarried father on his application to a court, such application to be drafted at the discretion of the court.  They felt that any provision giving rights to the unmarried father should be very clearly set out in view of the complications this could lead to in adoption situations and applications for guardianship.  They felt this would be an ideal time for the Minister to incorporate in the Bill a general Bill of children's rights which they feel is very much overdue.  They feel that the legislation should amend the law in relation to children who are rendered illegitimate by virtue of a decree of nullity in relation to the marriage of their parents, and in <Col N="76" /> view of the law of nullity in recent years an increasing number of people will be able to avail of nullity as a remedy.  In the light of this situation they said children of all such marriages should be protected by new legislation and legitimacy should be preserved.  They welcome the proposal that the legislation will deal with actions to prove parenthood, blood testing as an aid to proof of paternity, registration of births and maintenance of children born out of marriage in accordance with the principles set out in the Law Reform Commission Report.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the journal AIM in which it is stated on page 7 of the current issue for spring and summer of this year:</P>
    <P>One important area that the LRC did not deal with is that of retrospection. Would an existing affiliation order or the fact of a father's name on a birth certificate give rise to a presumption of paternity under the new legislation?</P>
    <P>It concluded:</P>
    <P>Despite Cherish's reservations about the LRC Report we regard it as an excellent document that deserves widespread and enthusiastic support. The one question which remains is, do the legislators have the will to implement its recommendations?</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to hear the Minister of State say there is no problem in this regard.  I note that she says that no matter what changes are made in the law the element of social stigma which still attaches, regrettably and unjustly, to the child whose parents are not married to each other will not diminish unless there is a fundamental change in social attitudes. I believe there has been that fundamental change.  We know of people who in spite of not having a father to look after them have done very well and reached top positions in professions and other areas.  I feel that like the stigma that was attached to poverty which I am well aware of &mdash; as the song says: &ldquo;Don't ask me how I know&rdquo;&mdash; in the enlightened <Col N="77" /> society in which we live, these stigmas will soon be things of the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like generally to welcome the Minister's statements that this would be given top priority and that a Bill would be before the House by the end of the year.  I would also like to welcome the statement that the terms &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; and &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; will be avoided in the proposed legislation and in relation to the succession rights that the Government have accepted generally the Law Reform Commission's recommendations that children born outside marriage should have the same succession rights as other children.  The word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; is a word that could mean an awful lot, so we will have to see what the Government actually mean by the word &ldquo;generally&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In her statement she said &mdash; this is very welcome &mdash; that the new Children Bill is being prepared by the Minister for Health.  That is overdue.  I agree with what Senator Robb had to say on this subject when he talked about the caring society we have which in effect has moved a long way from the time when unmarried mothers were treated like animals and when their children were ostracised in the community.</P>
      <P>This motion is one of the most important issues in the country today because of the rights of our children under the Constitution.  Our laws discriminate against children solely on the ground of the relationship those children have with their parents.  We talked about this in the long debate we had on constitutional reform.  Article 40 states clearly that all of the children in this country should be treated equally.  This was brought before the Seanad some years ago.  We can see, in effect, very little has happened since the Constitution was written.  Children born out of wedlock are discriminated against and have no succession rights to their father's property, no family relationship. The stigma of illegitimacy is a terrible stigma which a child has to carry all the days of his life.  In fact, children of unmarried parents are in a sense second class citizens in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Law Reform Commission <Col N="78" /> which recommended the abolition of the concept of illegitimacy and the Minister pointing out that it was included under the heading of law reform in the programme of the previous Coalition Government drawn up in the summer of 1981.  The programme which was drawn up at that particular time is still the programme between both parties.  I welcome the section in this report which calls for the abolition of the concept of illegitimacy. In order to change the attitude of the public our legislators will have to change our laws.  The only way we can bring people around is to reform the law and put it down quite clearly that we abolish the word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; and we recognise that all children have an equal right in our society.</P>
    <P>I am a member of Naas Urban District Council and Kildare County Council.  It was encouraging in the last five years to see that they are a little more progressive than they were in the past in their attitude towards unmarried mothers.  When we allocate houses now they are allocated on the basis of the family as a unit.  We have a priority list and houses are given on the basis of the need for housing and not on the stigma that an unmarried mother and her children had to dwell in a caravan for the rest of her days.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Robinson that we have still a long way to go.  When we looked at PAYE taxation and we made a move in the right direction when we looked at widows and widowers and treated them as couples, giving them marital status.  The same thing should apply to the unmarried mother with her children.  That is one area that could be reformed.  It is only a very short time ago when children born out of wedlock attracted the wrath of the community. I have seen many mothers going to England.  At that time they were sent there for a holiday and they never brought their children back.  The children never knew their identity or their parents. They were left in England.  They had no right to any of the rights of the legitimate children.  That time of ignorance has, we hope, passed but we still have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>There is a growing tide of people, who, <Col N="79" /> for one reason or another, through education and, naturally, through their own experience, have a better approach to marriage.  They have a better approach to divorce, contraception, single parents and children born out of wedlock.  They have signified on many occasions that they would favour the removal of the ban on divorce.  The evidence is also that they would favour the removal of the stigma of illegitimacy.  For that reason, I support the motion put down by our party.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased indeed to have the opportunity to add my few words to this motion.  I am gratified to see the Minister of State here this evening because her commitment to the abolition of the status of illegitimacy and to raising the whole issue is in no doubt. In fact she organised and hosted a most successful seminar in the spring of last year, when she allowed individuals and interested representative groups to have an input into the formation of legislation and to have their voices heard in this area, which is one that touches Irish society in a very special way.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear my colleague in Opposition, Senator Fitzsimons, state that he felt there had been a fundamental change in social attitudes in this country. I wish I could share his equanimity.  I am not sure that Irish society has undergone the fundamental changes which he seems to suggest.  Daily we are getting examples from scattered hamlets in various parts of the country and indeed in the city that all is not well in the area of social change and reform and that in many pockets of our country we are in the dark ages in the area of values and attitudes towards human sexuality and the expression of human sexuality.  It is all very well to say that in urban areas and, perhaps, in fairly sophisticated milieu Irish society is coming around and undergoing change and there is a greater acceptance of sexual variation and that recognition of children, no matter what their parentage is, is without reproach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel, based on my observation and on various incidents which we all are aware of over the past while that all is not well. <Col N="80" /> Although there is acceptance in this House of the motion on the abolition of the status of illegitimacy, I feel that when the discussion reaches the wider context of the general public there will be a great deal of scaremongering about property, people's fears will be played on and there will be a whipping-up of all that kind of feeling which is a little dormant, but not so very dormant.  In fact in a newspaper over the last week one of the main proponents of the Pro-life Amendment Campaign, to my way of thinking, certainly if this person was correctly quoted, made very disturbing sounds which underscore the fact that all is not well in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Law Reform Commission document and their recommendations. The main recommendations are that the concept of illegitimacy should be abolished, that all children born in or out of wedlock should have equal succession rights to their parents, that natural fathers have equal guardianship rights with mothers to their children regardless of marital status.  The former in relation to succession rights appears to find acceptance with the Government though I question the use of the word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; in the Minister's speech.  Presumably that is an area which will be explored fully in the legislation when it comes before us.</P>
    <P>It is in the area of equal guardianship of natural fathers that there seems to be a difficulty.  I gather that the over-riding factor will be the needs of the individual child.  That seems to me, to be a fairly fair criterion on which to proceed.  In Irish terms, the Law Reform Commission recommendations are fairly radical and are likely to be controversial when this debate reaches the wider forum of the general public.</P>
    <P>The arguments against such change, such as the question of threat to the constitutional protection of the family unit and the objections of unmarried mothers to according automatic rights to fathers, were rigorously examined by the Law Reform Commission.  None of these arguments was considered strong enough to disturb the principles of equity which are involved.  Basically, this is about equity and about giving expression <Col N="81" /> in our legislation to what we like to clap ourselves on the back about so regularly and routinely, our Christian values.</P>
    <P>There is another school of thought, which, while welcoming the abolition of the concept of illegitimacy, contends that some of the proposals on extending guardianship to natural fathers could be held to be unconstitutional.  Certainly it is fair to say that many mothers fear unwarranted interference by the fathers. The law should be reformed in such a way as to encourage the mother to identify the father.  It is not unreasonable to suggest that there is public interest in establishing paternity especially when the mother and child are in receipt of the single mother's social welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate so far has centred around the type of child who is illegitimate because the mother is single, but it is true to say that in the area of High Court decrees and Catholic church annulments there is an area which throws many children into illegitimacy through no fault of theirs.  It is true to say that if the constitutional ban on divorce was lifted as many as a quarter of the illegitimate children in the country would be legitimated as a result.  That is something we should not lose sight of in this discussion and in the discussion yet to come in the area of marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that there is overall unmistakable and extensive discrimination in the area of succession rights between the position of legitimate and illegitimate children.  I am pleased to see that that does not appear to be an area of contention and that it will be cleared up by the legislation which I am pleased to hear will come before us by the end of 1984.  It certainly points up how slow the wheels of Government in general move when we consider that in 1974 Senator Mary Robinson, then an Independent, brought her Bill before this House and it was debated.  It makes very interesting reading in the light of the last ten years, so it is not before time that something is done about this.  By and large, apart from certain elements in our society, I sincerely hope that it will find general acceptance.</P>
    <P>I would like to make some comments <Col N="82" /> on the EEC and illegitimacy.  It is rather disturbing to realise that we have been condemned by the European Parliament because of our illegitimacy laws.  They have been strongly criticised in a report adopted by the European Parliament in 1983.  This is very interesting.  It is not that we should reform our laws because somebody else criticises them.  It may be the necessary spur, but we should do so because it is correct to do so.  Our Government, following that report of the European Parliament, were called upon to sign and ratify the European convention on the legal status of children born outside wedlock.  Ireland, Belgium, Greece and Spain grant fewer rights to the natural child than to the legitimate child in respect of both parents.  For a child born outside marriage parenthood is not established automatically.  Such children are entitled only to maintenance and are not legally considered to be members of the family of either natural parent.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament also found that, as a direct result of the discrimination against illegitimate children, further discrimination exists between single mothers and married mothers in their relationship to their children.  Such discrimination should be considered harmful to individual rights and unacceptable to any civilised conscience.  The laws of the member states differ considerably in regard to affiliation, the passing on of the parents' name, nationality, rights of inheritance, rights of parental authority and the obligation to provide maintenance for children.  The parliamentary report found that society is particularly unjust because it penalises people who are not responsible for their situation and, in addition, it does not protect them sufficiently.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament wants the European Commission to tackle the problem of discrimination against children and to consider introducing binding measures against member states.  I hope that our legislation will have come on the stocks before we are put in that embarrassing position.  Much of our legislation in the area of social reform has been forced upon us by decisions of our courts <Col N="83" /> and by decisions of the European Parliament. I contend that a sovereign independent state should not put itself in that position and that our legislators should take the initiative and introduce legislation because it is necessary and a matter of equity and justice.  In the area of illegitimate children, how can anybody deny the justice of their case?</P>
    <P>The European Parliament goes on to say in a resolution adopted in February 1983 that illegitimacy is in contradiction with the general objectives of the Community and is unacceptable.  Parliament objects to discrimination between rights granted automatically to legitimate children but withheld from natural children. Single mothers generally pass on their own name to natural children whereas legitimate children receive the name of the father or, in some cases, a name chosen by both parents.  Natural children receive the nationality of the single mother whereas the legitimate child gets the nationality of the father.  Among EEC member states, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Denmark and France apply the same laws with regard to parental authority, the right to maintenance for children, family allowances and inheritance.  The second category includes West Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands where affiliation with the mother is automatic but must be established through a specific act for the father.  Ireland, Spain, Greece and Belgium are the worst cases in regard to discrimination.  That is nothing to be proud of.  Belgian law was successfully challenged in the past.  I hope that our legislation arrives before us before we find that kind of action adopted.</P>
    <P>Reference is made in the resolution to an integrated support structure for one parent families.  I would like to pay a compliment to the many organisations working in the field who have stepped in and who have helped with finance, encouragement, premises and counselling the many young women who find themselves in that situation.  They are to be commended and publicly thanked for their endeavours in this area.</P>
    <Col N="84" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>My brief remarks will be made not from any legal viewpoint, because I am not an expert on law, but from the very human point as illegitimacy affects children in the social class.  Those of us who deal with children will have experience of being in embarrassing situations. Twice in my career as a teacher I found myself &mdash; in my early days when I was inexperienced &mdash; walking into a situation where I am sure I caused embarrassment to the children involved.  One such situation was when a football team were objecting to one of my players. They knew the history and I did not. Luckily someone tipped me off before it became too awkward.  The other situation was when we were preparing &mdash; of all times &mdash; for Confirmation and names began to clash when I began to write out details that were necessary.  That experience for me meant that the whole question of illegitimacy was far too serious for the children.</P>
      <P>Much of the discussion here in the Seanad has been based on the legal rights of the father, whether he can have access to the child, whether the mother can have a withdrawal of all the rights and the rights to succession.  Whatever happens in those circumstances a child should not be handicapped by human beings.  A child has absolutely no say in being born. It is wrong that we as a society can put a label on a child and that he or she, for no reason whatsoever, can have a millstone around his or her neck for a lifetime.  This has been held, even by the church, to handicap them further.</P>
      <P>I welcome this move.  I do not care what reaction there will be as far as property is concerned.  Maybe it will add a sense of responsibility to the many fathers who manage to get away very lightly in comparison to the single girl.  Sometimes their property might be more important to them than the future of their illegitimate child, as he or she is called now.  The single girl carries the burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing is a problem we all come across in public life.  The single mother certainly has difficulty in getting housing. It has nothing to do with the fact that she is an unmarried mother.  It is basically that there are only two in the family and <Col N="85" /> invariably housing has got to the stage where those with two or three children are a priority because you are automatically housing three or four people.  I do not go along with the idea that if you give houses to unmarried mothers you are only encouraging them.  It is very easy to sit in judgment on people who have perhaps made a mistake in their life.  We should not try to pretend that they should be punished further.  If we had houses I would have pleasure in giving them a house but unfortunately it does not work that way.  It works on numbers, as everybody is aware.</P>
    <P>From another point of view we must end the stigma of illegitimacy.  We have passed a pro-life amendment.  If we want to protect life we must make sure that those who are born are not given any extra burden by society.  It is we in society who play the role of giving that millstone to be carried throughout life.</P>
    <P>I am not dealing with legal claims, simply on the basis that children have enough of a handicap facing life.  Some of them may be born with silver spoons but many of them are not.  If we add further to their handicaps it is to our discredit.  I will welcome this move.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the wording of the motion, which is in two very important parts.  It calls on the Government to introduce legislation to remove all existing legal discriminations against children born out of wedlock and to provide an integrated support structure for one-parent families.  It also refers to the most excellent Law Reform Commission report on this very subject.  The movers of the motion dealt with many of the legal problems involved in the question of illegitimacy and rights to inheritance and property.  They have adequately covered it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like my colleague, Senator Browne, I want to deal with the human aspect of it, from two points of view.  Firstly I do not think any State, any Government or any registration authority have the right to determine that a child is illegitimate. Nothing could be further from the truth. If a child is conceived and born it is a legitimate child.  Any legislation or any <Col N="86" /> lack of legislation that puts some other tag on that wonderful thing which is a child in calling it illegitimate is certainly discriminating against a small human being who had no control whatsoever about its birthright, how it was born or who its father was.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the problems that are created, particularly for the mother of the child.  In any legislation the mother must be the one to maintain the legal responsibility in some way for the child, and every assistance should be given to her by way of law, property rights and otherwise.  The mother is the link between that and her child.  Senator Browne said that many absent fathers have managed to get away with an awful lot for a long number of years without having to answer to the call.  It is the unfortunate mothers who have to bear the stigma that attaches to them in the eyes of the public and in the eyes of the law of producing an illegitimate child. That is an inhuman attitude to adopt, and I am totally against it.  Any regulations to ensure that birth certificates would not indicate to these children that they are in some way inferior to any other children would be a welcome step, but I would prefer the proper legislation.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion deals with providing integrated support structures for the one-parent family.  In my county it did take some time to instil this into the minds of housing officers and people dealing with applications.  Thankfully, we have housed unmarried mothers who have a family to look after and we have treated them as a family unit.  That is only correct, because if there is more than one person in a family then that is a family unit and we are not housing single people.  I am glad to say that my own council have housed single parent families on that basis.  They qualify on the basis of overcrowding or some other means that can be used under the existing code for letting houses to people in need.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that there is a social attitude to the concept of what a child's rights are.  If we did something to condition the public attitude in this area we would do an awful lot more to stop the tragedy of the abortion trail, which still <Col N="87" /> goes on in spite of referenda and otherwise, simply because of the stigma the public perceive as attaching to this situation. When we look at the beautiful thing which a child is, then any legislation to ensure that that child has the same rights as any other child, born in similar circumstances but without the privilege of having two parents available to look after it, would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House. The proposer and seconder have made an excellent case under all the issues which pertain to this problem.  I am fully in support of it.  No doubt when Senator Robinson is replying to the debate she will refer to some of the excellent contributions from all sides of the House.  I am sure that the Minister of State who has responsibility in this area will take note of all that has been said in this very sensitive and humane area of the children of tomorrow and ensuring that they are not discriminated against either by society or by legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been greatly encouraged by this debate.  There has been a clear acceptance by Senators on all sides of the House of the basic values to be realised by removing all legal discriminations against children merely on the basis of their birth.  There has been a sense of urgency and of deep commitment by every Senator who has contributed to this debate, a sense that we lag behind the social reforms introduced in a number of other countries.</P>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia referred to the fact that we have incurred criticism from the European Parliament and from other commentators outside the country on this score.  It is a pity, because I believe that we have a very real and deep concern for children; it is simply that we have not addressed the issue and devoted sufficient legislative time and attention to this area to ensure that we bring through the necessary reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost all contributors to the debate referred not just in a narrow sense to the legal discriminations but, as Senator Browne among others emphasised, focussed on the social implications, on <Col N="88" /> the stigma which attaches to the status of illegitimacy.  This was dealt with at considerable length by Senator Higgins in seconding the motion when he rightly and very thoughtfully described it as a damaged status.  He teased out in some detail the impact on the individual, the effect for a child of finding him or herself characterised in this way, the self-image which the child begins with and goes through life with, and the sheer indecency of having that approach and concept in our law.</P>
    <P>When moving this motion I expressed some concern about what I felt to be some hesitancy in the scope of the commitment of the Government, in particular as expressed by the Minister of State who has participated in the debate.  I should like to make it clear that it is not hesitancy about her commitment; indeed I commend her for the obvious importance and priority that she places on introducing legislation in this area.  This is not at all in doubt, and the Minister has used opportunities, as Senator Bulbulia has mentioned, through seminars and through other methods, to advance thinking and to seek ideas and suggestions in this area.  What I was pointing to was hesitancy in the vital area, which the Minister referred to in her speech, of the position and the exercise of parental rights by the natural father.  I still note and see that hesitancy in her speech.  I hope that this is a matter to which she will give extremely careful thought as I believe it is a fundamental issue.  It is fundamental not just as to how we remove the legal discriminations, it is also absolutely crucial to ensuring that we change our social attitudes.  Therefore, I should like to begin my contribution in reply by focussing on this problem and placing on record some clarification of my concern in this area, also seeking to urge on the Minister that her language in the matter and her manner of communicating what she is doing are vital to ensuring that we will achieve the values and objectives which are so widely shared by Senators.</P>
    <P>In her contribution to the debate, the Minister referred to the question of parental rights.  She stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> As regards parental rights, the legislation will provide a means whereby the fathers of children born outside marriage can obtain parental rights in appropriate cases, the guiding principle being what is in the best interests of the child in each case.</P>
    <P>This does not appear to go as far as it is possible for us as a society to go in ensuring that the values of the participation in a parental role of the natural father, the value for the child of recognising the role of the father and the value of encouraging natural fathers in our society, are fully underpinned and guaranteed in the legislation. In other words, it would not be satisfactory to devise means by which a natural father could require parental rights.  What we should be seeking to do is to carve out the circumstances in which natural fathers would automatically have parental rights and then to balance that with a proper concern for the apprehensions and for the reality of the position of the unmarried mother in our society.</P>
    <P>I suggested the adoption of the approach which was put forward by William Duncan, a well-recognised expert in family law in Ireland.  He suggested that the balance could be struck and very carefully and sensitively drawn by providing that in circumstances where parentage had been presumed &mdash; and this would have to be clarified in the legislation &mdash; or where proceedings had been taken to establish parantage, a natural father would be a guardian entitled to act as such in a wide range of circumstances where he would be presumed to be the father, save where the mother objected, in which case the onus would be on the father to seek a court order to enable him to exercise his rights as a parent.</P>
    <P>This is the reverse of the approach recommended by the Law Reform Commission. The Law Reform Commission approached the question, as the Minister has said, somewhat simplistically by asserting that there would have to be automatic full equal rights of guardianship, then placing on the natural mother the burden of being the party who would have to apply to court to seek to deprive a natural father, in certain circumstances, <Col N="90" /> of the right to exercise full guardianship rights if this was in the interests of the child.</P>
    <P>I went into this in some detail when moving the motion.  I reaffirm the importance of it.  It is important from a legal point of view and it is extremely important from a social point of view.  It is vital that we recognise the importance of the value of ensuring that we have as broad a circumstance for the automatic exercise of parental rights by the natural father as we can devise, given the need for concern in certain areas, concern for the possible apprehensions of the unmarried mother and that she, ultimately, is not the party who would have to move into court and apply for a court order if there was a conflict in the exercise of rights between herself and the natural father. The natural father would have that onus and would have to establish positively that it was in the interests of the child if she did not agree to the exercise by the natural father of parenting rights.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the second issue, and I believe it is fundamental to the kind of change we are going to make in this area. We have come very late in the day to an acceptance of the need for this important measure of social reform.  It is vital that we do not do it in a half-baked way, that we do not move too little at this late stage to achieve the social values which have been so clearly identified in this debate. Therefore I differ from the Minister in her estimate of whether you can abolish the status of illegitimacy while still leaving some distinction in the exercise of parental rights by the natural father.  It is totally and completely possible to abolish the status of illegitimacy and still leave some differences in the exercise of parental rights which are seen to be in the interests of the child.  This has been very well argued and very well stated by William Duncan in a passage from the article which I quoted earlier in the Dublin University Law Review on the abolition of the status of illegitimacy where he referred to the approach adopted by the English Law Reform Commission and to its conclusion, which he quotes, that:</P>
    <P>The advantages of abolishing the status <Col N="91" /> of illegitimacy are not sufficient to compensate for the possible danger involved in an automatic extension of parental rights to fathers of non-marital children.</P>
    <P>He continues:</P>
    <P>The logic behind this statement is that, because of a distinction between marital and non-marital children will remain as regards their father's rights, the &ldquo;status of illegitimacy&rdquo; cannot be abolished.  This seems to involve a massive <i>non-sequitur.</i> It is certainly true that non-marital children would continue to have one special set of rules (relating to paternal rights) applied to them as a class.  Whether it would be correct, in view of the limited scope of the differential rules, to describe that class as having a &ldquo;status&rdquo; is debatable. But, if it is a status, it is certainly a perversion of language to apply to it the title of &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;illegitimacy&rdquo; is associated, historically at least, with notions of inferiority and invidious discrimination; it is ludicrous to retain the word to describe a distinction which is based, in large part, on the principle of promoting the welfare of the child.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has made it clear that the word &ldquo;illegitimacy&rdquo; will not be included in the legislation, and that is an important step in that direction.  Nor should she have any equivocation at all about what she is doing.  If she brings in the legislation on the broad terms that have been outlined, then she is &mdash; and should state so confidently &mdash; abolishing the status of illegitimacy.  That has not just important legal implications; it has absolutely vital social implications.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly reasonable, proper and sensitive to the reality on the ground to make some provision in the interests of the child in relation to the exercise by a natural father of parental rights.  I am, in that context, advocating that these be as generous as possible, that we try as a society to carve out the broadest degree of automatic assumption of parental rights by a natural father, but that we <Col N="92" /> give the mother the protection that if there is a conflict between her and the father in an unmarried situation the burden would be on the father to go to court to assert and establish that the exercise by him of his guardianship rights, his parental rights, would be in the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>I believe as a society we must affirm very positively the parental role of fathers and the importance to children of that parental role.  We must realise that where children have the opportunity of being brought up by both parents, one-third of all children establish the primary bond with their father, something that is not properly appreciated in Irish society. We tend to be role conditioned and to assume that the parental functions are somehow 95 per cent a matter for the mother and 5 per cent a matter for the benign interest of a caring father.  That is not the case.  It is a total aberration of what nature intended, and therefore it is very important when we move in this matter that we have a real concern for the values that we are seeking to establish.</P>
    <P>This has been a very useful debate because it has given us an opportunity to look at the issues which the Minister must have concern for in bringing forward the legislation.  I hope she has taken great support and confidence in moving from this debate and that it will encourage her to move the bureaucratic process of Government to as speedy a conclusion as possible in having a Bill before us at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer also to the second part of this motion in regard to the importance of ensuring that there are proper support services for single parents and their children.  This recognises that a very significant proportion of situations, even if we change the law on the matter, will involve the unmarried mother and her child.  I do agree with the Minister who in referring to this part of the motion made it clear that we are also in this context talking about other single parents, about widows, widowers, deserted wives, prisoners' wives, the whole range of single parents.  If we look at the kind of integrated supports and services that <Col N="93" /> exist in other countries, that exist in Northern Ireland in a very large measure, we have to admit that we have not given sufficient thought to the cumulative problems of single parent families.</P>
    <P>We know from the reports of the NESC and other studies that single parent families are economically more disadvantaged. In particular, in the case of the unmarried mother and child in Irish society there are enormous problems in relation to housing.  It it true to say, as Senator Conway and Senator Ferris emphasised, that local authorities are increasingly making significant changes in recognising the single parent and child in this context as a family and taking very important steps in making provision for the housing in appropriate units of single mothers and their children.  But it is in the private sector that there is very real victimisation of the single mother and her child, and organisations such as Cherish cope daily with the problem of landlords either refusing a tenancy or indeed evicting, as they are entitled to do, without any protection to the single mother.  They simply do not want to have the inconvenience of there being a child or a young baby on the premises.  There is a whole pattern of daily discrimination and of enormous problems in this area.</P>
    <P>There is also an absence of proper child care services right across the board.  This is broader than simply the situation of the single mother and child, but we must recognise that there are in volume terms a striking number of single mothers who are bringing up their children and who should have available to them the kinds of support services that we are talking about.</P>
    <P>As Senator Fitzsimons pointed out, illegitimate births now comprise over 6 per cent of total births and we must, in all honesty, put into that equation the fact that the illegitimacy rate roughly parallels the rate of women going for abortions to various cities in Britain, the termination of the unwanted pregnancies. Not all of those women are unmarried. Somewhere in the region of up to 20 per cent are married, 15 to 20 per cent.  That is the society we are seeking to change, to bring about positive social <Col N="94" /> reforms in.  It might well be said that some very positive measures in this area would be a lot more of pro-life than an abstract amendment to the Constitution. Certainly it is something on which there is a clear commitment on all sides of this House to move on.</P>
    <P>I believe it would be of great value if the Minister could bring out a White Paper on support services for the single parent and do it in the broader context which she mentioned, do it in relation to the broad category of single parents in Irish society who are coping with the multiple problems which can be much more difficult for the single parent and in that context it would be appropriate to join with Senator Bulbulia &mdash; and I will conclude on this, a Leas-Chathaoirligh &mdash; in commending very warmly the voluntary bodies and agencies such as Cherish, Ally and the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their Children and local voluntary agencies who have provided the substantial services that exist in counselling and information and back-up services for the unmarried mother and her child.  But this is not in fact a substitute for a proper State assumption of responsibility and an overall State-integrated structure.  That would be something that would complement the work of voluntary agencies but it should be a priority for us and would be helped by being the subject of a White Paper which would clarify the services that exist and promote the values which have been inherent in this debate.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed.  I did not have time to refer to each of the individual contributions but, as I said at the outset, I found it an extremely encouraging debate and undoubtedly as far as the attitude of this House goes there has been very remarkable progress in the decade since we last discussed the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would wish to thank the Chair and the Minister for the opportunity to discuss the situation of Rosslare Harbour and the totally inadequate level of State funding to date for this harbour. I am motivated to raise this question by the growing concern and anger in County Wexford at the apparent abandonment of this national resource by this and by former Governments.  It is my intention, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, this evening to be as constructive and positive as I can be in what I have to say.  It is my ambition to underline the case for Rosslare as forcefully and as clearly as I can.  As a preamble I might say that this Government came to power on a platform of honesty and integrity, to put an end to white elephants and political strokes; no more doling out, I thought, of scarce State resources to buy votes.  Instead, every project was to be analysed and costed and investment made on the basis of sound economics having due regard, of course, to the social consequences.  To this end I and the people of County Wexford were led to believe that the development of ports throughout this country was subject to the drafting of a national ports policy which I understood was in the process of being prepared at that moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This strategy was perfectly acceptable to all of us in County Wexford, confident as we were and are in the case for Rosslare. Let me at this stage put some concrete facts before the House to underline Rosslare Harbour's strategic importance. In the period 1973-81 the port of Rosslare advanced from fifth position to third position in terms of ship arrivals.  This improvement occurred at a steady rate with a slight downturn in 1979.  Only Waterford and Dún Laoghaire experienced growth in this period.  The total through all ports fell significantly through this period.  The performance <Col N="96" /> therefore of Rosslare is particularly impressive.  May I quote the relevant figures for the year 1973?  The number of ship arrivals at Rosslare port was 808.  In 1981 this figure had risen to 1,453.  The implication is more clearly shown by growth in percentage terms in comparison with other ports.  For Dublin there was a decrease over this period of 44.5 per cent.  For Cork there was an increase of 1.5 per cent; for Dún Laoghaire an increase of 3.7 per cent, for Waterford, a decline of 23.2 per cent and for Rosslare Harbour an increase of 74.6 per cent. This again bears out the development in net registered tonnage for the same period 1973 to 1983.  The figures for Rosslare are in 1973, 1,117,000 tons to 4,258,000 tons in 1983.  The same increase is registered in passenger numbers from 237,389 in 1973 to 861,900 last year.</P>
    <P>The comparison for growth in net tonnage is similar, a staggering increase of 239.3 per cent for the period 1973 to 1981 for Rosslare compared with a decline of 21.3 per cent for Dublin, a decline of 28.4 per cent for Cork, an increase of 59.7 per cent for Dún Laoghaire and a decline of 15.2 per cent for Waterford.  Again, in terms of tourist traffic the numbers are equally impressive, an increase from 60,942 in 1973 to a 142,854 in 1983.  The number of tourist cars passing through Irish ports has almost doubled in the period 1973 to 1981 and Rosslare's share has increased from 23 per cent of the total to 33 per cent of the total in that period. Again, in freight traffic in ro-ro units the number of units increased from the 1973 figure of 10,602 to a 1983 figure of 41,900. Because of its close proximity to Europe and the growth in roll-on, roll-off transport freight traffic through Rosslare Harbour we have seen a dramatic increase from the period 1973 to 1983.  Ro-ro units have increased in fact, as I said, fourfold, while trade cars have increased almost threefold and Rosslare now accounts for more than 50 per cent of all trade cars imported into this country.</P>
    <P>I have set out those facts to underline the success of Rosslare Harbour over the last decade, success, may I say, brought about because of its strategic position making it the terminal for the shortest <Col N="97" /> continental crossing and consequently, in fuel terms, the cheapest.  This success was brought about, may I add, despite the miserable response in development terms from central Government.  In March 1978 the Rosslare Harbour Development Committee made a submission to the Minister for Transport and he authorised a development scheme for Rosslare Harbour to be undertaken by CIE as the harbour authority.  This decision was made following protracted negotiations, planning and research.  The development scheme incorporated the provision of a second berth to cater for the ever-increasing additional ferry services.  The cost of the development scheme was estimated at that time to be £3.75 million and an Exchequer grant of £1.125 million, representing 30 per cent of the estimated cost, was allocated, the balance to be raised by the harbour authority itself.  Six years have passed and the development scheme still remains incomplete.  The second berth has been constructed but the essential ancilliary services vital to a port catering for passenger cars and roll-on, roll-off freight has not been provided.</P>
    <P>The actual cost of the work undertaken is approximately £7 million and the harbour authority had been obliged to raise the additional finance required in excess of the additional estimate, with meagre Exchequer assistance.  The stage has now been reached when the harbour authority is unable to complete the development scheme due to lack of capital finance.  A ludicrous situation exists where the new second berth which is utilised by B&amp;I Ferry Services has no gangway facilities whatsoever for its passengers; foot passengers have to enter and leave the vessel through stern doors in conjunction with cars and freight, which is a dreadful situation and highly dangerous.  The provision of capital finance is urgently necessary to provide the essential support facilities required for the port of Rosslare.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware that we have repeatedly requested that finance for this sound capital project which we know would produce great returns to the State be invested in this area.  Earlier this year <Col N="98" /> we put a submission to the Minister requesting £1 million from the 1984 public capital programme to be spent on &mdash; and I shall quote from our submission:</P>
    <P>(1) the provision of a proper gangway at the second berth.</P>
    <P>(2) the provision of a hydraulically operated gangway at the original berth to replace the existing fixed gangway which under certain tidal conditions becomes extremely steep and dangerous for passengers.</P>
    <P>(3) the proper surfacing of the holding compound area in the centre of the port and the access road to the second berth.</P>
    <P>(4) the replacement of the existent ancient bus with a modern type coach as befits a port of this size, together with shelters at pick-up points.</P>
    <P>May I add this latter point has been acceded to in the last number of weeks.</P>
    <P>(5) improvement at the original berth to cater for the throughput of passengers embarking and disembarking;</P>
    <P>(6) provision of improved and additional accommodation for customs clearance and immigration services;</P>
    <P>(7) completion of a storm wall to protect passengers in rough weather and</P>
    <P>(8) improvement and extension of freight compound and marshalling areas.</P>
    <P>&mdash; a modest, urgently-needed programme costing £1 million estimated. The State response was that £300,000 was given, a most inadequate and meagre response.  We were told at that stage that that was all that could be allocated because the cupboard was bare.  In the light of the subsequent allocation to Ringaskiddy the cupboard apparently is bare only as far as Rosslare Harbour is concerned.  It was not my intention to put forward an argument that if they get it we must get it.  On the contrary, I want to state emphatically that we should expend <Col N="99" /> State funds in the interest of the State, for the benefit of the State, regardless of local lobbying and local pressuring and local political advantage.  That, however, has not happened.  We have repeatedly witnessed stroke politics and <i>ad hoc</i> measures to the detriment of good planning and sound investments.  I think inevitably comparisons must be made.  I would refer to the State grant for Ringaskiddy port in Cork.  The original estimated cost for the development of Rosslare Harbour was £3.75 million for which the Exchequer grant was to be £1.125 million &mdash; these are 1978 estimates for the second berth &mdash; representing 30 per cent of the total. The actual cost is £7.025 million of which the State grant was £1.125 million, 16 per cent of the total cost; 16 per cent compared with Cork, where the overall cost of a harbour development scheme was £17.9 million and Exchequer grants represented £15.8 million or 88 per cent of the total cost.  The cost of a new Cork ferry terminal was £8.25 million: the Exchequer grant to Cork £6.6 million, or 80 per cent of the total cost.</P>
    <P>I come now to the most recent announcement, that is of a free port status for Ringaskiddy, a concept advanced for Rosslare Harbour two years ago.  I quote from a letter sent to the chairman of the Rosslare Harbour Development Board by the Minister for Finance on 9 April 1984:</P>
    <P>In relation to the idea of designating Rosslare Harbour as a free port the Minister has asked me to say that his initial reaction to this proposal is that he is not convinced that it would give rise to a significant benefit at Rosslare or anywhere else at this stage.</P>
    <P>This was four weeks before an announcement was made designating Ringaskiddy a free port.  The concluding paragraph of this letter, signed by the Minister's private secretary, says:</P>
    <P>However, the Minister has asked me to inform you that a full review of the free port concept is being carried out by this Department and that a further <Col N="100" /> letter will be sent to you on this subject as soon as that review is completed.</P>
    <P>Four weeks before the announcement of a free port for Ringaskiddy was made the Minister for Finance stated that in his view no benefit would accrue to anywhere by being made a free port and that the whole matter was being reviewed in a national context.  Four weeks later &mdash; no plan, no survey, no review, just more <i>ad hoc</i> measures and political adventurism.</P>
    <P>In summary, I contend simply this: the case for the development of Rosslare Harbour is logical and undeniable.  The people of Wexford and indeed of the whole South-East region will depend on it for the development of that region.  The people of Ireland look to it as a resource to benefit this whole nation.  We have asked simply for a planned and costed approach to port development in this country in which we believe Rosslare's case would be clearly made and would stand convincingly on its own merits. With respect, Minister, our logic has been trumped with political expediency and our patience answered with apparent contempt.  The people of Wexford as a whole feel bitterly deprived by more stroke politics.</P>
    <P>We have come to expect more from this Government.  This Government were elected to put the affairs of this nation into good order.  That was their paramount objective.  The husbanding of the scarce resources of this State must rank high on that agenda.  I beg you, Minister, and through you, the Minister for Communications and the Minister for Finance immediately to redress the situation with a capital allocation for Rosslare Harbour which would allow it to become the springboard for the resuscitation of a region which is economically on its knees. Contrary to reports, it is on the east coast of this country that the trend of unemployment is greatest.</P>
    <P>People occasionally view an area like Wexford as being an industrialised area, not in need of the sort of support that goes to other regions.  That is no longer the case.  The unemployment situation in Wexford is among the blackest in the country, and the call from the public representatives <Col N="101" /> and indeed the people of Wexford is not for charity, is not for hand-outs, is not for grants and dole; it is for a proper development programme, taking the whole island into the picture. What we ask, Minister, is what we were faithfully promised in the past &mdash; a coordinated approach to port planning which would allow all our natural resources to be utilised to their fullest potential for the benefit of all the people of this nation, and an end to the politics of the stroke and the politics of expediency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Communications?  He is abroad at an international conference and he has asked me to stand in for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened with interest to Senator Howlin.  The case he makes is not a new one with regard to Rosslare Habour, because his constituency colleagues, Deputies Yates and Doyle in particular, have been stressing the same case with vigour in recent times.  The recent announcements for Cork have acted as a spur to all the anxieties in the Wexford area concerning Rosslare Harbour.  I have to say that if a stranger who had never heard of Rosslare Harbour came in here and listened to Senator Howlin he would form an impression that Rosslare Harbour was at best on its knees, or at worst going rapidly backwards, suffering from a lack of business and heading possibly for closure and that the state in which it found itself was due to a lack of investment or a lack of interest on the part of the authorities.  In a sense, Senator Howlin has contradicted his own case by virtue of the very heartening traffic statistics he has given us concerning Rosslare Harbour.  Rosslare Harbour is a booming harbour and is a success harbour in the Irish context.  The traffic growth to which he has referred in terms of ship arrivals, which was the main criterion he was relying on, has been spectacular. That, of course, is due principally to its prime geographic position.  It has also been due to the fact that the facilities in Rosslare Harbour have been improved steadily over the years.  I can well understand <Col N="102" /> that people in the area would like to see more dramatic improvement and even greater investment in Rosslare Harbour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>We are calling for simple justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened patiently.  The position is that there has been steady investment in Rosslare over the years and the proof of the success of that is the high volume of traffic now coming in through Rosslare.  It is not a question that the Government have forgotten Rosslare or are not aware, as are CIE, of the need to ensure that investment in Rosslare is continued. This year, £300,000 has been made available for capital expenditure in Rosslare to do the specific works to which he refers and which were part of the development plan from 1979, to provide two mobile gangways, a covered passenger accessway on the new berth and an extension to the customs building.  We hope those works will be got under way this year and they will go a long way towards meeting the immediate problems of passenger comfort and enable the port to become even more attractive as a passenger ferry and as a ro-ro port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to get into the area &mdash; and I know Deputy Howlin did not like to get into it though he felt he had to get into it &mdash; of comparing what is done for one area with another area, because that is a rather pointless exercise, as we could get thousands of examples up and down the country in all areas of commerce and social life where people in one area might say: &ldquo;We are unfairly prejudiced by virtue of expenditure in another area; we are more deserving than another area.&rdquo; That is a matter of assessment and has to be made by people who, we hope, are objective and in a position to take an overall national view.  For better or worse in our democratic system the people who are put in that position are the Government of the day and they have to make the best judgment they can as between the competing demands on scarce resources.  I do not apologise or in any way excuse or try to explain away the expenditure in Cork.  Cork suffered a disastrous <Col N="103" /> series of blows to its confidence and to its commercial life.  If Cork in proportion had the prosperity from its port that Rosslare has from Rosslare it would be a swinging place commercially and economically.  It needed urgent investment and urgent lift.  It was not a question of <i>ad hoc</i> politics; it is a Government's duty to respond when an area finds itself in a dire economic situation as Cork found itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The ports plan has been talked about for a number of years, but I have every confidence in my colleague, the Minister for Communications, that he, a vigorous, active and energetic man will bring forward a ports plan.  At the moment, it is under consideration and we all look forward to seeing it and how it is going to reconcile the competing demands of Waterford around the corner from Rosslare, which is possibly the most successful and biggest cargo terminal in the country, with the competing demands of other east coast ports, Drogheda and Dublin in particular, not to speak of New Ross and Wexford which are even closer to Rosslare.  Again, it is going to be difficult to provide for the demands of the <Col N="104" /> people in those areas out of a limited public purse.</P>
      <P>What I want to assure the Deputy is that there is no lack of consideration for the importance of Rosslare.  Rosslare is a boom port in Irish terms; there is no doubt about that and the Senator's figures have shown that.  What we want to ensure is that it will continue to grow and continue to advance, and one of the ways in which that can be done is by a continued level of appropriate investment; appropriate in regard to the size of the public purse, appropriate having regard to the needs of the port.  I would say very positively to the Senator and to the House that an investment of £300,000 this year in Rosslare port specifically to provide the outstanding items from the development plan is good planning and is a fair treatment of Rosslare port.</P>
      <P>I have every confidence that Rosslare will continue to advance.  Equally I have every confidence that should there be any real neglect of Rosslare port that will be highlighted very cogently and eloquently by the Oireachtas Members from that area.</P>
