      <P>I have notice from Senator Jack Fitzsimons that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The serious threat posed to the employment of 500 Irish workers at Kingscourt, County Cavan, by the dumping of Spanish gypsum plaster products on the Irish market.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>If we sit tomorrow what business will we take?  Could we have an indication as to when the motion No. 9 will be resumed?  I think at this stage when there is an election for the European Parliament pending it would be an opportune time to give Members of this House the opportunity to continue on this motion.  It is an extremely important <Col N="216" /> one and I would like to get an indication from the Leader of the House as to when that motion will be taken.</P>

      <P>At the risk of being accused of being a disruptive Member of the House, as some of the Independent Senators were last week, I am opposing the Order of Business.  I have consistently asked that motion No. 18, for a debate on the Forum, should be taken in either the Seanad or the Dáil.  The Government have consistently refused to hold a debate on the Forum which is as important an event as we have had in this country for many years.  I am proposing that today we take motion No. 18 in the names of Senator Catherine McGuinness and myself so that the Seanad or at least one Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas can be allowed to discuss the Forum.</P>

      <P>I ask that the House would note the comments of a judge in Belfast yesterday in the Crown Court.  I recognise that perhaps I am out of order in saying this but I take a serious view that a judge would say what he said.  The erosion of confidence in the Judiciary that I talked about recently in this House is now a collapse of confidence and I think it is a serious matter for the country as a whole that this should happen.</P>

      <P>In regard to the business tomorrow, it is proposed that we should continue on with whatever of today's business is not completed.  Realistically this means that we will be taking Second Stage of the Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 1984, and Second Stage of the Land Bill, 1984.  It had been my intention also to order tomorrow item No. 5 but in view of what the Leader of the Opposition has said about motion No. 9, and I agree with what he says in that regard, I will inquire in the course of the afternoon whether it could be ordered also for tomorrow.  In this connection, Senators will note that the report covering the second half of 1983 in regard to developments in the EEC has now been published. <Col N="217" /> We now have both official reports covering the period which is the subject of this motion.  It is suitable that it should be taken up and this is the only opportunity we have to take it up before polling day in the European election.</P>
      <P>In regard to item No. 18, which is a Private Member's motion, it will in due course be the turn of the Independent group in this House to occupy Private Members' Time or two successive Wednesdays and that motion can be brought forward then.  It is not intended to set down a Government motion in this House in regard to the New Ireland Forum at the moment.  If at any time it is thought that the tabling of such a motion and its debate by the House here would help the objective of the Forum, then the motion will be put down.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister &mdash; this is something we discussed last week &mdash; to explain about the power of the council to borrow.

      <P>The section is an all-encompassing section.  For capital and current purposes, the council, subject to conditions which I am in a position to lay down under the Act, may borrow such moneys.  That is an enabling power and it is a very useful and necessary one to have because it will be of particular benefit to the council, particularly with regard to borrowings which have to be approved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was sought by the Dental Board.  Under the provisions of subsection (2) the Dental Council may, again subject to my consent, allocate any surplus funds at their disposal to dental education, research or to any public purpose connected with the profession of dentistry.  The board made the case that the amount likely to be spent in this way would be quite small: under a similar power in the 1928 Act, the board had spent some £15,000 in the past five years.  The fund would not come from the public purse but from fees charged by the council for registration <Col N="219" /> services.  The manner in which the funds can be allocated is clearly laid down and the annual audited accounts will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas when published.  The board also pointed out that speedy decisions sometimes had to be made in regard to the application for financial support for scientific meetings and so on and that having to obtain the prior consent of the Minister could cause delay.  I accept the merit in the observations made by the board and, accordingly, I propose to delete the necessity for my consent in this regard. Accordingly, I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>We should thank the Minister in this regard.  We find legislation spattered with consents of Ministers these days, and with Ministers having to get the consent of other Ministers.  In this regard the Minister has done the correct thing in removing that requirement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for this amendment.  It seems to me to be an opportunity to eliminate in many ways the question of getting consent, which is happening all over the place.  I think the council would welcome control of their own destiny as much as possible and this is why deletion of the words &ldquo;consent of the Minister&rdquo; is a further help.  I welcome it and I thank the Minister.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing his amendment the Minister said that it had been indicated to him that the amounts at the disposal of the Dental Council would be liable to be small and that it was not a matter of expenditure of large, amounts of money.  If we look at the Bill, if we look at the additional functions that are being laid by the Oireachtas on the new Dental Council we will realise that we are proposing a degree of activity which was not there before.  We must face the fact that if there are to be surpluses and if deficiencies are to be <Col N="220" /> avoided the level of fees which will have to be charged may become extremely high.  Extra functions mean extra funds. I ask the Minister if he could give us any indication of what attitude he might take if, after the operation of two or three years, it is clear that there are funding difficulties in the case of the new Dental Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be quite sympathetic in terms of getting the council off the ground in the first instance.  Equally, I am preoccupied on the education front that where particular schemes are introduced every possible assistance be given.  In so far as this Bill is concerned it is an enabling Bill.  There are no Exchequer funds committed within the general framework of the Bill but that does not preclude the Department, in their ordinary day-to-day work, from applying to the Minister for Finance to give occasional grant-in-aid moneys to particular bodies to enable them to get off the ground.  However, I want to make it quite clear that at this point I have no proposals as such to put before the Department of Finance, nor indeed have I any consent at present.</P>

      <P>We have a very important section here in regard to the establishment of the register.  I do not want to anticipate a discussion that might come afterwards when we will be discussing the question of a specialist register. It seems to me that if the Minister is going to hold to the Bill as drafted and have a specialist register that it will detract in some way from this main register. I want to say no more than that at the moment.  It seems that as a consequence of whatever decision is made in regard to the specialist register it might be necessary to return to section 26 on <Col N="221" /> Report Stage.  I make that intervention now, lest in attempting to return to it on Report Stage the Chair would point out that section 26 had not been mentioned on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (2), line 22, to delete &ldquo;section 28&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;sections 28 and 65&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may, I will take amendment No. 9 and ask the House to consider amendment No. 33 with it because there is a substantial degree of inter-relationship between those two amendments.  These are proposed as a result of discussions with the Dental Board.  The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that persons registered in the Commonwealth and foreign lists of the British dental register do not continue to have entitlement to registration in this country.  It has been a difficult section, as the Leader of the House is aware, to get into a correct legislative framework.  In brief, section 27 (1) of the Dentists Act, 1928, gives entitlement to registration in this country to persons on the British <Col N="222" /> dental register which would include persons in the Commonwealth and foreign lists of that register.  This arrangement forms part of an agreement entered into with the UK under the 1928 Act, termination of which is provided for in section 65 of this Bill.  It was the intention when drawing up the heads of the Bill in our Department that persons in the Commonwealth and foreign lists of the British register would no longer be entitled to registration here.  That was the reason for the provision in section 65 (3).  It now seems, however, that this provision does not cover the situation fully.  Section 27 (2) (a) gives entitlement to entry on the new register to any person who immediately before its establishment was entitled to be registered in accordance with the Dentists Act, 1928, and was not so registered.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the provision is to cover persons who hold a qualification issued by the RCSI but are not registered here when the new register is established.  The RCSI ceased to train undergraduates in dentistry in 1977 and, accordingly, provision must be made for holders of the RCSI qualification who, for one reason or another &mdash; mainly because they are working abroad &mdash; are not registered here when the new register will be set up. That may appear to be a rather complicated explanation but that is the particular import of amendments Nos. 9 and 33.  Section 27 (2) (a) could also be construed as going further than it was intended.  Among those entitled to registration here under the 1928 Act, immediately before the new register is established, are persons on the British register.  This includes those on the Commonwealth and foreign lists.  It appears, therefore, that although future entrants to those lists will be excluded here it can be held that anyone entering on those lists when our new register is set up will continue to have entitlements to entry on it.  Section 65 (3) would not operate to preclude this.  Accordingly, it is necessary to amend sections 27 (2) and 65 (3) to redress the situation.  These are the main points in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may impose again on the House I <Col N="223" /> will speak at some length at this stage because we are grouping amendments Nos. 10 and 11 together.  Amendment No. 10 is a drafting issue.  It inserts the word &ldquo;for&rdquo; where it was inadvertently omitted in drafting.  Amendment No. 11 deals with section 30 of the Dentists Act, 1928.  It gives the Dental Board power to register a dentist from any &ldquo;British possession, self-governing dominion or foreign country&rdquo; which the board recognises for that purpose on the basis of reciprocity. In drawing up proposals for the Bill, it was considered that provision should be made for the continuation of any existing agreements made by the board but that the new Dental Council would not be given power to enter into fresh ones. This is the reason for the provision in section 27 (2) (e) of the Bill.  The Dental Board pointed out, however, that no formal agreements have ever been entered into with other countries and that the power given under section 30 of the 1928 Act has never, in fact, been used to register any person here.  The board considers that there is no good reason for the provision in section 27 (2) (e) of the Bill and that any application for registration from a national of a country outside the EEC could be dealt with adequately under section 27 (2) (d) of the Bill.  I have accepted the view of the board in that regard and, accordingly, the amendments are tabled.</P>
    <P>I think I had better finish at this stage, a Chathaoirligh, because we could suffer from legislative indigestion if we do not get that much clarified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made it clear that the degree of grouping we have in these three amendments is enough for us to be going on with.  I regret that a confusion in my own notes made me bring forward a suggestion to enlarge the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister has done in amendments Nos. 9 and 11 &mdash; amendment No. 10 is a drafting amendment &mdash; has properly brought the position of our agreement with the British Government, or indeed the agreement between the dental registers of the two countries, up to date. What was appropriate in 1928 in regard <Col N="224" /> to mutual recognition is not appropriate at present after the long lapse of the intervening years.  There is no need to re-enact in full all the provisions in the 1928 Act.  I welcome amendment No. 9 and amendment No. 11.  I welcome amendment No. 11 not only for its content, but, of course, I also welcome it from the point of view of format because this was the one blemish which I criticised the Minister for when I was talking on Second Stage.  It was the one section of the Bill where there was reference to other legislation.  I am glad that it has now gone because if it had not gone on the basis that its content was not required I would have sought to amend it on the basis of format.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 12 is an alternative to amendment No. 11a on which amendments Nos. 18a, 18b, 18c, 18d and 18e are consequential. Amendments Nos. 11a, 12, 18a, 18b, 18c, 18d and 18e should be discussed together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 11a:</P>
      <P>In page 15, lines 5 to 13, to delete subsection (5), and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  A person to whom a decision under subsection (3) of this section relates may, within the period of two months, beginning on the date of the decision, apply to the High Court for cancellation of the decision and, if he so applies, the High Court, on the hearing of the application, may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  declare that it was proper for the Council to make the decision, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  cancel the decision and direct the <Col N="225" /> Council to register the name of the person making the application, or</P>
    <P>(c)  cancel the decision and&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  direct the Council to make a new decision, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  give such other directions to the Council as the Court thinks proper.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should indicate here that acceptance of amendments Nos. 11a, 18a, 18b, 18c, 18d and 18e would mean the withdrawal of amendment No. 12 in the names of Senator Dooge and Senator Ferris.  Effectively, amendments Nos. 11a, 18a, 18b, 18c, 18d and 18e are Government amendments. They arise as a result of amendment No. 12 and this seeks to add to the powers of the High Court under section 27 (5), in consideration of an appeal against a refusal of the Dental Council to register a person on the grounds of the unfitness of that person to engage in the practice of dentistry.  As section 27 (5) stands, the court can (a) uphold the decision or (b) can cancel it and direct the council to register the person concerned.  The amendment of Senators Dooge and Ferris is designed to broaden the restrictive nature of these powers by providing the court with a third alternative of giving any other direction it thinks proper. Section 27 (5) is one of the six instances in the Bill where the High Court is given an appeals function in relation to decisions of the council on registration and disciplinary matters.  The others are sections 30 (5), 32 (6), 39 (3), 40 (3) and 42 (3).  They are all based on similar provisions in the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, which were specially drafted with the Constitution in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, I made the point earlier on in consultations and discussions. Because of this the Attorney General was consulted about the amendment proposed by the Senators in section 27 (5) and he is of the view that the section would be improved by the amendment but that for the sake of consistency similar amendments should be made in the other five sections involving the High Court.  He advised that the parliamentary <Col N="226" /> draftsman should be consulted about the wording of the amendment as there would be some minor grammatical error in section 27 (5) if amended as proposed since it would read that the court could &ldquo;either or&rdquo; with three choices existing. Also the wording of the amendment to section 27 (5) would not necessarily be appropriate for the other five sections and, therefore, I have had that particular amendment prepared and the six amendments proposed.  Acceptance of them will, of course, mean the withdrawal of No. 12.  My only hope is that Senator Dooge has not raised a hare which might be chased for many a year in terms of the capacity of the High Court to have a number of options open to it.  The only consolation is that if the hare is going to be chased the Senator and I will not be the hunters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the way in which he has met the point which I raised on Second Stage. That point was that the powers of the High Court in the section as originally drafted merely to uphold a particular refusal to register or to direct a registration was unduly restrictive of the High Court.  I think, in principle, when we are legislating on matters like this we should not tie the hands of the court.  My worry was that if we had enacted the section as originally introduced, we would leave the High Court in a position that it could not on appeal direct a new trial.  I thought that was a substantial point and I am happy that the Attorney General agrees with me.</P>

    <P>In regard to the question of the type or form of amendment between No. 11a and the consequential amendments Nos. 18a to 18c, in fact of course the form proposed by the Minister and the completeness of the amendment by the Minister is far preferable.  The amendment put down by Senator Ferris and myself was merely put down in order that we could discuss the principle on Committee Stage.  I looked at the sections and felt that we should discuss one of them and if we agreed in principle we could always follow up on Report Stage.  The Minister has come more than half way to meet us <Col N="227" /> by not only accepting the principle but doing as it were the Committee Stage and Report Stage work together.  This Bill will now have sections concerned with the appeal from a disciplinary body to the High Court which is far preferable to what was there before and I think, indeed, the form that was there before has been used in other cases and I think at a convenient time the case of the other disciplinary bodies should be amended here also.  The more we try to tie the hands of the High Court in these questions of disciplinary matters the more danger we court in regard to the constitutionality of enactments such as we are making now. I am grateful to the Minister for meeting the point that was raised and for doing it so positively.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 15, to insert before section 29, a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;29.&mdash;(1)  If the Dental Council are of opinion that any branch of dentistry has become so distinctive that it would be for the convenience of the public or of the dental profession that registered dentists qualified to practise, or practising, in that branch of dentistry should use a distinctive title, they may by regulations prescribed appropriate titles and conditions under which they may be used; and the use of a prescribed title under the prescribed conditions shall not constitute a contravention of section 50 (2) of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The Council shall in regard to any speciality in respect of which regulations have been made under subsection (1) of this section maintain a <Col N="228" /> list of registered dentists who are qualified under such regulations to use such distinctive title.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, I am putting forward this amendment, not as an ideal wording but as the basis on which we could have a discussion of a matter of principle in regard to this section.  The proposal in the section, that is section 29 of the original Bill, was that there should be a register of dental specialists. The Minister in replying to the anxieties expressed by Members on all sides of the House during Second Stage indicated that, in fact, this was not a mandatory section and the power given under section 29 to establish a register of dental specialists did allow for the discretion of the council.  On the other hand, the Minister has powers which we shall be discussing in due course in regard to requiring the council to act even on their discretionary functions.  This must give us pause.  We must ask ourselves if this is the best way to act.</P>
    <P>A part of the argument that the Minister used was that in many countries of the European Community there were such registers and that it could well be that a directive would be drawn up in harmonisation of the dental profession which would require us to establish such a register under such a convention.  Of course, if that were the only reason why we wanted to consider a specialist register, then I think that could be done elsewhere in the Bill where the question of EEC directives is dealt with.  I think we must look at section 29 from the point of view not of what might happen under an EEC directive but on the basis of our present situation.  While it is true that some of our partners in the EEC have what can best be termed as registers of dental specialists, in the United Kingdom, with which our dental register and dental profession are closely linked, they do not have a register of specialists.  We have, on the other hand, a list of specialists and the main purpose of this amendment is to raise the point of principle as to whether we should have a register of dental specialists or a list of dental specialists.  The thrust of amendment No. 13 is, in fact, the same as the <Col N="229" /> thrust of amendments Nos. 14 to 18 which have been put down in the name of Senator Fallon and this is the point we need to determine in this House.</P>
    <P>My fear is that by establishing under section 26 a register of dentists and then establishing under section 29 a register of dental specialists, we devalue the general register in section 26.  I feel that if you say, right, in this section of this Bill we establish a register of dentists, and three sections later we establish a register of dental specialists, then this register of dental specialists appears to be a far more important thing from the point of view of the proper organisation of the profession of dentistry than the general register.  It sounds better.  At the very least it is being given equal status.  I am not convinced that, in fact, this register of dental specialists is something that is of equal importance to the register established under section 26 which is a continuation, of course, of the register established under the 1928 Act.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I think it would be more appropriate if in compiling any list of dental specialists &mdash; it may be advantageous to do this &mdash; it would be better described simply as a list so that it could perform, in the absence of an EEC directive, exactly the same function as under section 29 of the Bill if it were called a list and it would not appear to be more important or more pretentious than it need be.  If it comes to the case of harmonisation, if it comes to the case where a directive uses the word &ldquo;register&rdquo; then we would have no option.</P>
    <P>I do not think I should say anything about the wording of this amendment.  It was drafted and set down here to raise this point of principle, whether in fact under section 29 we need to call the lists which are to be established registers and thereby raise comparisons with the vitally important register of section 26.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Although we have amendments of our own on this section we accept the basic principle of this amendment and that it would follow on our amendments.  Indeed, all the amendments would meet our aspirations in this <Col N="230" /> regard.  The previous speaker has given his thoughts on this section and the practical situation that he saw and I support his views.  If a list rather than a register were the order of the day it would almost certainly be for the benefit of the overall community and would allow our dental professions to move forward almost independently. It is important to know that at least six out of ten countries of the EEC have no register as such.  I know that in Britain they were very careful and moved very slowly on that.  In fact, they have not a register of specialists.  I support the amendment.  The EEC directives do not make it mandatory to establish a specialist register.  The whole idea of a list would be far preferable to the profession that we know has done great work here since the 1928 Act.</P>
      <P>We all know that the training of a specialist in Italy, for example, takes something like three years.  The same training for a specialist in Ireland is a period of eight years.  It does not seem fair that that situation should be allowed to develop.  We should have a list rather than a register for the many reasons that I and the previous speaker have given.  I support the amendment in the knowledge that it meets our aspirations for the subsequent amendments that we put forward. I will ask the Minister to accept it in the good spirit that prevails on all sides of the House.  It seems to be a logical, practical amendment and one I think that would meet the wishes of the Senators on both sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to follow up on what the previous Senators have said on this section.  I should like to stress my reservations about the whole idea of a specialist register.  The two factors that must be closely examined are the legal factor and the cost factor.  I should like to refer to the cost factor.  A specialist register, would, in my view, lead to an increase in the overall expense of dental treatment in the country.  It is easy to foresee these specialists doing work that at the moment is being done by less well trained and cheaper practitioners both in the public and private sectors.  I fear that because of the legal implications involved <Col N="231" /> the general practitioner could opt out of treating any complicated cases with the result that these will be referred to the specialist.  I should like to give an example of costs involved at the moment. A general practitioner or a health board dental surgeon will cost the State about £5 for an examination.  A specialist at present charges the minimum of £22 and this can increase to £25 in the State or public sectors, depending on the specialist involved.  A general practitioner or health board dental surgeon could treat a simple orthodontic case for as little as £20 per year at the moment whereas a specialist will charge a minimum of £121. A specialist charge on the health board is roughly about £32 per hour and a dental surgeon's rate can vary from £10 to £11 per hour.  I should also like to point out that specialists in all professions are far more expensive than their colleagues in general practice.  As regard the medico-legal difficulties, there is a danger that primary care workers will refer even the simplest cases to specialists to avoid legal problems.  In the State sector particularly they will opt out to avoid complaints. The parallel in medicine is a GP sending everyone to hospital consultants and the Minister is now trying to reverse this.  Professional insurance protection societies will probably advise members to refer more patients to specialists.</P>
      <P>The third danger I see is that patients will always want to go to a specialist whether they need one or not because &mdash; and probably it is a fault with most of us &mdash; they wrongly consider that they will get a superior level of service.  I am concerned that the general public, given a chance, will want a consultant surgeon or physician to attend to all their complaints.  This will be difficult to overcome if the register is maintained and is freely available to the general public. Finally, there could be a danger that the Department of Health will opt out of continued education for the cheaper primary care workers.  They have done this for decades in the medical area.  This is essential to utilise our limited resources effectively and efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To conclude, there seems to be no logical reason for the Minister to introduce <Col N="232" /> a specialist register.  I favour, as the amendment suggests, the introduction of a specialist list system and even if the Minister will not concede an amendment now may be in the Dáil he will introduce his own amendment that would overcome this difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Dooge and the amendment of my colleague, Senator Fallon.  By the time the Minister leaves the House with this Bill as amended, it will bear very little resemblence to the original Bill.  That in itself might prove that the Seanad has a role to play in legislation which is something we are often accused of not having.  If one did not read the explanatory note on section 29, and the Minister's introductory speech here on Second Stage very closely, and perhaps a few times, one would think that this practice is acceptable in Europe.  Of course, the Minister, as well as the rest of us, knows that is not so.  I understand that in the EEC of the ten member states there are only three that have specialists registered.</P>
      <P>I wonder why does the Minister think this is necessary at the present time.  I would like to ask him a direct question and hope that he will give me a clear answer.  What will this register do for the people in the west of Ireland, for example, in Clare, to provide a better service on the ground?  That is what legislation is all about.  There is no use talking about enabling Bills and words and drafting of what matters is how it will affect the people and the service.  To single out a particular branch for specialist recognition could lead to the general dental practitioners effectively being debarred from doing work for which they are trained. Such action surely would not be in the interests of the public, either in the short or the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister what this so-called register of dental specialists will do?  Will it give us a better service? Will it cost a lot more?  The major point is that the community would be best served by the development of the service available from the primary care dentists, the family dentist and the health board dentist supported by dental auxiliaries <Col N="233" /> who would provide educational and preventive services.  The family dentists and the health board dentists would then be further supported by fully trained consultants.</P>
    <P>If the register of specialists was introduced, would we have to have new facilities made available to allow Irish graduates to become entitled to have their names on such a register?  What effects will this have on the role of the family dentist, on the health board dental surgeons &mdash; the few we have &mdash; the Defence Forces dentists and dentists working in any teaching or other hospital?  What will this list of registered dental specialists do for the people I have referred to?  If it is true that the World Health Organisation has already favoured the list rather than the register, I do not know why we must opt for something that may be just wrong for this nation.</P>
    <P>There are many figures I would like to quote but while I have very strong views on the matter I would be told by the Cathaoirleach that I should have included them in my Second Stage speech.  We should have a better service, for example, in the orthodontic field where there is really no service.  We have 250 people waiting for two years.  We are talking here of a register of dental specialists &mdash; it is time that we got our priorities right for once.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Dooge in this amendment.  Maybe some of my colleagues who do not spend too much time in this House, will at least see that some of us are trying to have an input into legislation that is going to affect every house in this nation.  This is very important legislation and perhaps too many politicians may take it too lightly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, I would support the thrust of this amendment.  Many of the arguments for it have already been adequately put on the record.  It seems to me that amendments have to be examined in the context of the trends and developments that have taken place in dental care in Ireland.  That is the essential point, that we have seen a dramatic change particularly in the parts of the <Col N="234" /> country where you have had fluoridation of water supplies for a substantial period. The pattern of primary care has changed and will continue to change very dramatically. This places a strong emphasis on the need to look at both manpower needs and training of manpower in providing the kind of dental service which will really address itself to and meet the needs of the future and do it, as has been emphasised in a number of the contributions, in the most cost-effective and reasonable manner.</P>
      <P>It is really against that background that it appears to be clear that the family dentist and the health board provision of dental care will have to be on a more specialist level because there will be the demand for that care from the general practitioner dentist in Ireland in the coming years.  It is here, in further opportunities for retraining and in the development of the training of dentists, that we should place our emphasis to ensure that the standards are ones which can meet the particular needs of the population and that we are providing a broadly based, acceptable and adequate degree of dental care at that level.  It seems, as has already been stated, a departure from that to create a specialist register that would have all the counter indications already mentioned and the cost disadvantages and the possibility of an opting out by the dental profession who are not on the specialist register from the various types of treatment which would be and should be within their range in providing dental care and that it would not provide an accessible and high standard care for the population of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a sense, I am still not entirely sure whether it would be necessary to have lists, as proposed by the amendment &mdash; it may be in a sense a compromise amendment, I am not sure &mdash; but it enables that to happen if the Dental Council so recommends. For that reason, I would strongly urge the Minister to look very closely at it.  He has already heard representations from both sides of the House as to the approach and practice in other countries and recommended by the World Health Organisation.  My primary reason for supporting this amendment is <Col N="235" /> because of the developments that have already taken place on the ground in Ireland in relation to dental care, the trends that are there and our future manpower needs.  It is in such contexts that I support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it is a matter of old age or not but I have been around for the last 20 years in the trade union world and I have become reasonably experienced in smelling special pleading and this case reeks of a degree of special pleading.  It reminds me of the mid-sixties when I was around in the trade union world and was secretary of the demarcation committee of the ICTU. We used to have some esoteric arguments about the difference between the sheet metal craftsman and the sheet metal pre-fabricator, and as to whether a person should be called a stationary engine driver or a crane driver.  Quite frankly, this should be kept in perspective. Section 29 is an enabling section: it is no more and no less than an enabling provision. It enables the council, who may, with the consent of the Minister....; it &ldquo;may&rdquo; prepare and it &ldquo;may&rdquo; establish the register to be known as a register of dental specialists.  It &ldquo;may&rdquo; contain therein a division in respect of each dental speciality from time to time &mdash; I would again stress, quoting the section &mdash;&ldquo;recognised by the council under section 37 of this Act.&rdquo;  There is no imposition whatsoever on the council to introduce a register: it may do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an enabling provision which is only prudent within the context of the profession. God knows, if I were to take to heart some of the arguments here I would be going back and wearing my hat as the Minister for Social Welfare saying that I will have to revise the fees paid to some specialities within the profession.  I would have to indulge in some &ldquo;queer hawk&rdquo; activity relating to consultant orthodontists and oral surgeons throughout the country.  I really think that the special pleading which I have been subjected to in relation to this section does not stand up.  In fact, I may suspect that some of the special pleading comes from those who may not necessarily hold specialities <Col N="236" /> themselves.  To that extent I want to say that the difference between the list as proposed and the register as is proposed within the section is eminently discernible because it is not adequate simply to devolve on the Dental Council the casual convenience of setting up a list and casual titles of designation and so on.  If I personally decided to become a dental specialist I would take great umbrage at my professional body having such a casual devolution prescribed for them under law.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the council should be given power, if they wish to exercise the power, to make the regulations prescribing the specialities, registering the specialities and then it would have a proper formal statutory base.  It would specify the requirements for entitlement to registration which, after all, is quite different from somebody having a list in his back pocket as a dentist.  Let us respect the profession.  Let us give people the registered speciality that they are entitled to.  Equally, it is very important since this Bill contains substantial set regulatory provisions relating to appeals to the High Court for registration and removal from the register, which indeed is the tripartite disciplinary procedure proposed quite eloquently to us by Senator Dooge.  All these powers devolve in the context of registration as distinct from setting up this concept of a list.  Because the UK has a list there is no particular reason why we should not have a far better Act which is likely to stand the test ot time in the profession to the end of this century.  That is basically the initial thrust of my argument here.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 and 30 provide a means for the establishment by the council of a register of dental specialists at some future date.  It does not specify when, but it is at some future date.  There are EEC directives in that regard.  We tend to forget in this country that since 1978 we have been obliged to adhere to directives.  It is true that the Community recognises a number of specialities.  It is equally true that a number of EEC member states have specialist registration.  It is reasonable to assume that the practice would tend to develop over the years and on <Col N="237" /> that basis this Bill should anticipate a degree of specialist registration by the council.  It is a prudent provision in this Bill to meet that eventuality and to avoid a need to bring in amending legislation.</P>
    <P>The arguments that have been adduced have been very adroit.  They have been put forward by Senator Dooge with customary dexterity but in his heart of hearts, as a distinguished academic he would agree perhaps we should not have a list of specialists in heavy water to be listed by the academic authorities.  These men would take grave umbrage at such listings.  Indeed, I would suggest that the arguments in relation to the other issues raised, such as the development of posts of dental consultants, are not valid.  It has been suggested to me that with such a registration system the posts might be damaged.  I do not accept that at all. I had lengthy arguments, in fact quite excessive arguments, about this issue. There was very special pleading.  I do not accept for one minute that the post of dental consultant would be damaged by such a provision.  In Britain, for example, the requirements for a consultant post are a higher degree which normally takes four years, plus four years in a training pathway &mdash; usually in a registrar post. We have adopted requirements of that nature for the only consultant posts which we have created so far in the health board services here &mdash; those of consultant orthodontist.  I only wish we had enough money to employ more of them: I respect the contribution they have made.</P>
    <P>It is equally true that there is no prospect of additional cost arising here.  I do not see it arising.  I do not see people rushing off to dental specialists.  The generality of dentists in this country have very high expertise.  Certainly their role is not likely to be diluted.  There is an argument of fear being generated within the profession.  It is a self-regulatory profession.  The dental profession will have a majority virtually within the council.  They will not allow their colleagues to flood them out of ordinary conventional work and have specialists take over and dilute their role.  That is <Col N="238" /> not likely.  All these inferences keep coming to me and therefore they say, &ldquo;Ah, well, we shall have a list.  We will run that list&rdquo;.  I do not share the simplicity of that argument at all.</P>
    <P>Equally, and finally, we have the situation within the European Community. I do not believe that the Community would accept the kind of concept of lists proposed here.  I do not believe they would accept that would be an adequate recognition of minimum qualifications laid down in existing directives.  I do not think that they would accept that.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister telling us that there is in existence at the moment a directive which would compel us to have a register of specialists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect, what I am saying is that if a directive were to make specialist registration necessary it would be necessary to bring our registration into line and while I would bow to more assured awareness of EEC directives, any experience I have had is that they tend to go for the formal statutory registration of particular specialities and that the devolution of more casual powers to a council would, in my opinion, and from the detailed advice I have had within the Department of Health, not be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, there are a number of amendments proposed by Senator Fallon to which I shall briefly refer because they are all germane to our discussions.  They are to some extent on the lines of amendment No. 13 of Senator Dooge and Senator Ferris, to replace the register of specialists with a specialist list.  They do not go as far as amendment No. 13 since they would only change the general terminology. They would leave the other provisions there.  Apart from a change of name, I do not think the amendments would have any real, practical effect because they would only change the title, leaving all the other provisions relating to the register to apply to the list, namely those with an entitlement to registration, the right of the council to refuse registration, to erase names and so on and appeals to the High Court.  All those provisions <Col N="239" /> would still remain even if amendments Nos. 14 to 20 were accepted.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that if these amendments were accepted it would require consequential amendments to sections 37 and 39(1).  I am prepared to argue this issue with our colleagues in the Seanad.  I feel that it is in the best interests of the profession.  I have spoken to quite a number of specialists who are all in favour of this provision.  I have spoken to a large number of dentists who tell me and assure me that I should not be too convinced by individual special pleading. They say it is a sane and sensible measure to bring in and it is one which will not damage the profession and will enhance the general role of specialists within the profession itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister opened his remarks by saying he was not convinced by the arguments made.  I hasten to return the compliment.  I feel that the Minister has done nothing to rebut the points that were brought forward.  He reached back into his experience and said it reminded him of demarcation disputes. May I ask him frankly, if we pass section 29 are we going to have more or less demarcation disputes?  It seems to me that this is a section setting the stage for demarcation disputes as to who is or is not a specialist in a particular area.  Not only are we doing that but we are involving the High Court in the determination of such disputes, something that I think is completely unnecessary.  The Minister said in his closing remarks that he has spoken to many specialists who were in favour of this.  Of course they are, just like the metal workers that he remembered who were in favour of nobody else doing their own special thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to assure the Minister that there is a deep anxiety among general practitioners in dentistry in regard to this. Whatever the outcome of our debate today, I think that it is unfortunate that in going into this relaunching of the organisation of the dental profession in Ireland the Minister is out of sympathy with that deeply-held anxiety.  The Minister suggested that what is proposed here is a question of casual title, that there is <Col N="240" /> something not right about this.  I do not think so, it is quite clear from this amendment. I do not claim that the wording is perfect but I think the wording is quite adequate in this regard.  I think that we must remember here what is the main purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister in some of his <i>ad hominem</i> remarks referred to my own specialisation. I am a chartered engineer. There is the single qualification.  There was a movement indeed for many years for registration of engineers in defence of the public interest.  That was turned down by successive Governments on the grounds that it had not been proved beyond doubt that there was a damage to the public interest in such a lack of registration.  I suggest that was reasonable. There would be a damage to the public interest if we did not have the general register of section 26, no question about that.  What damage is there to the public interest if we do not have the specialist register of section 29?  What benefit to the public interest?  Leave aside the benefit to individual specialists, where is the benefit to the public interest?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that we should anticipate what might come in a directive. There are no directives at the moment. We should not anticipate what might come in a directive.  We should not anticipate in fact that even though a minority of states at the moment have such registers that that would be a form of a directive. Even if that were so &mdash; and I grant him this &mdash; there is no need for us to anticipate that day.  There is no need for us to have section 29 in order to carry out that directive because section 60 of this Bill is adequate in order to carry into effect in Ireland any directive which insists that Ireland as well as the other nine members must have a register of specialists. In this regard, the Minister has indicated that he finds the amendments of Senator Fallon less objectionable than he does amendment No. 13 put down by Senator Ferris and myself.  If the Minister could now assure me that he is prepared to accept Senator Fallon's amendments I would certainly withdraw amendment No. 13 in favour of amendment No. 14 and the consequential amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one qualification which Cork people have it is that when they become obdurate they become wholly obdurate and there is no way that I will accept Senator Fallon's amendments either, in that regard.  I am not in the least bit out of sympathy with the needs and the aspirations of the profession.  I am trying to reflect them in an enchanced way.  I do not believe that a list system as such gives what I call parity of registration as between the general profession and the specialists within the profession.  I want to give them a mutuality of regard and that is why I think they, too, should be registered.  A mere listing system would be a devaluation, the very word used by Senator Dooge initially in his first contribution.  If I may take the word and apply it in a different context, I think it would value the general role.  I am acutely aware, and I have been trying to prepare for it in recent months, that Ireland is taking over the Presidency of the European Community for the next six months, and I find in reading through any of the literature on the social side the concept of registration is well and truly established rather than the list.  There is, I think, a bit of professional semantics going on here.  We are afraid of people being registered because they are specialists, that they may take over work which we normally do.  There is a fear of that and as a consequence we will merely list them because they will have an enhanced professional status if they are on a register of specialists. That is pure semantics: it is pure internal professional preoccupation and indeed it is a particular paranoia which is relevant to all professions.  In the dental profession there has been a slight outbreak but we will cure it by the end of this Bill with great help from the profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To that extent I do not see the logic of a specialist list.  I want to give the general profession a prospect of registration of their own specialists.  The absurd has been suggested: the man in the street might be confused if we go ahead with this provision.  That is a difficult one to accept.  A specialist register would be of <Col N="242" /> some assistance to the public and, indeed, to the Department.  If persons are in need of specialist treatment they will at least be able to establish that the specialist they were attending was not on a particular list, that he was a suitably qualified, registered person accepted by the council, and that he would not have been registered if he did not have that qualification.  Therefore the man in the street is not likely to be confused.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson and Senator Dooge go back to the old days when all three of us served on the Joint Committee on EEC Legislation.  We would adhere to the directives of the Community if we were formally bound to adhere to them. There would be the prospect of the council being given an opportunity to have a phased implementation of such directives.  That is open to the council.  I had difficulty in convincing some of the advocates of this list system that since 1978 we have been obliged to recognise nationals of the European Community who possess qualifications specified in various directives and allow them to practise as specialists in this country.</P>
    <P>The prospect of more control by the profession on a self-regulating basis, having its own specialists properly registered, is better than chasing after the UK list system.  If the UK had no list system I do not think the issue would ever have been brought up.  Resort to that ploy does not stand up.</P>
    <P>There is not much more I can say on the matter.  I will be attending a dinner in the College of Physicians tonight given by the Faculty of Community Medicine. Ten or 15 years ago the same argument was used in the medical profession: we will not have a Faculty of Community Medicine.  I will be at a conferring where specialists will receive their qualifications in community medicine.  That is an advance within the medical profession. They have not destroyed the GMS and they will not destroy the generality of the medical profession.  They are respected persons within their profession.</P>
    <P>I have to leave the House to make special arrangements to be there for the <Col N="243" /> second conferring in that faculty.  That is done by the medical profession, by the College of Physicians.  It is done without pressure from us and within the framework of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, not within that precise framework. There is provision in the 1978 Act for speciality registration.  In fact, the medical profession have not found it necessary to exercise that power under the 1978 Act, but they have an enabling provision. I cannot accept the proposals here.  I have examined them very closely and I have argued them out with our own senior professional staff in the Department.  I am comforted by the sane and sensible advice which they have been giving me on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister rightly paid tribute to the dental profession in his Second Stage speech, as we all did.  I am asking the Minister to comment on the fact that our dental profession have prided themselves on the qualifications and the training they give to their dentists. If such a register was set up it would be mandatory to include every qualified person from other EEC member states who would not have half the training and qualifications of Irish dentists.  Having regard to what the Irish dental people have put into their training and the pride they take in it, does the Minister not think it would be most unfair that somebody could come in from another member state with half the qualifications and half the training and find himself on a par with his Irish counterparts?  I personally think there is a degree of unfairness in that.  That is my principal objection to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to appreciate some of the background to this.  The enabling power devolves on the profession. The two persons nominated by UCC may have a particular dental speciality. Seven fully registered dentists resident in the State may be appointed by election among the dental profession.  The two persons appointed by the Medical Council may have preconceptions and wishes relating to dental registration of specialists, and so on.  If they all combine <Col N="244" /> together and, in the wisdom of a self-regulating profession, assisted by the person appointed by the Minister for Education, who may or may not be a specialist, decide to open up a register for specialisation and register specialists, they will have the power to do that.  It is no more and no less than an enabling provision.</P>
      <P>The dental profession would be doing themselves a disservice if they delete the section and have no prospect of registration, or decide to have a contrived system as proposed in the amendment.  That does not wash with me because I want to divest myself of control and registration domination over the council.  I do not want to have that control.  I am prepared to devolve it.  If I were recalcitrant and totally difficult as a Minister I would say, &ldquo;You can register yourself as a dentist and I will register the specialists&rdquo;.  I am not saying that.  The road which some of the devotees of the list system want to go down might be a rather undesirable road. Ultimately we could finish by not even paying a consultant orthodontist the type of salary he is entitled to be paid because everything would be determined by the Minister of the day.  On balance registration is eminently fair and reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am becoming somewhat confused by listening to this debate. It is important to tease out the issue a little further.  I should like to refer to a comment made by the Minister in his earlier reply to the contributions made, when he said he got a strong smell of special pleading.  It is certainly true, as is very usual with a Bill of this kind, that Members of the Seanad have received a number of representations.  Speaking for myself, I have had both written representations and some oral representations from different members of the dental profession.  Our role here is to devise legislation which is clearly in the public interest and which provides us with the best dental service, as broadly accessible and as cost effective as we can devise.  It is in that spirit that I am making my contributions, and not in any sense as a pleader for any person.  If I am a pleader for anybody, it is the ordinary <Col N="245" /> member of the public who wants access to the best standard of dental care that we can provide.</P>
      <P>I am not as yet persuaded by the arguments which the Minister has advanced for the register.  It is clearly something that he has thought a great deal about and that he has had to consider very carefully.  Also earlier I commended the Minister &mdash; and this is one of the clearest features of the way he has presented this Bill &mdash; on his openness and his willingness to listen to this House.  I take very seriously the fact that he has obviously got weighty objections to the amendment put forward by Senator Dooge.  It has to become clearer.</P>
      <P>As I said when supporting the amendment, I did so because of the changing pattern in dental care in Ireland.  I would welcome the Minister's views on the examination of the pattern which is clearly emerging and which has consequences for manpower.  This is really what we are talking about here when we are talking about a possible register of specialists.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to a paper on Dental Manpower Needs delivered by David Barmes at a recent conference in Ireland.  I have already referred to an earlier part of that paper where Dr. Barmes had looked at the changing levels of oral health care and the differences this would make to the primary health care where the large emphasis would be on health education and prevention and the role of auxiliary dentists in this area. He then turns to a consideration of the level of referral which he would envisage in the area of dentistry.  On page 4 of the paper he says:</P>
      <P>In contrast, there is an ultimate level of referral for high technology procedures in surgical, periodontal, prosthetic, orthodontic and general medicine procedures related to oral health which require very high level training but for a diminishing operator to population ratio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have often said, I have had doubts and still retain them, that even today's dental graduates are being <Col N="246" /> adequately prepared for this level of performance.  There is thus the danger of the profession falling between two stools, over-trained for moderate technology and under-prepared for high technology over a broad spectrum of what are now regarded as dental specialties and for a type of practice which will be very different in age structure and in the needs of each age group from what is seen as traditional.  You can see by that statement that I believe there will be no room for specialty groups in dentistry in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not know &mdash; and I would welcome some comments from the Minister on it &mdash; whether that is special pleading in a narrow, professional sense which we should be wary of, and which we should not accept on the face of it, or whether it is a genuine assessment of the kind of care that will be needed over the coming years.  Is it the case that there will be a need for more highly trained general practitioners, because the kind of dental practice which they will be engaged in will be different, because the pattern of the need for dental care has changed, and that there will be a relatively very small number of further specialists?  Therefore it would be illogical and not cost effective to move in the direction of having a register of dental specialists which envisaged a fair number of specialties in this area to which a great deal of emphasis, cost, training, and so on, would be diverted.</P>
    <P>That is my genuine dilemma.  It seems that the trends in dentistry support the arguments advanced for the amendment. Yet it is clearly something the Minister has had to consider very carefully and he clearly has a strong resistance to it.  I should like to hear his comments on that assessment of the trends in dental care and the manpower needs which will flow from that in the future: whether it is narrow, specialist pleading which we should be wary of and look at in a broader context, or whether it is a genuine assessment of the needs which would be relevant to the kind of dental services and the training for that which we would like to see.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a comment on <Col N="247" /> the EEC dimension to this.  As has been stated and confirmed, there is at the moment no directive requiring a register. It seems to be a sort of red herring to bring it in at this stage.  If, in the future, it were to be the approach at Community level that there would be a directive requiring a register of specialist dentists in each of the member states, then the authority to do that &mdash; it is referred to adequately in section 60 of this Bill &mdash; is in section 3 of the European Communities Act, 1972.  The Minister has power by regulations to amend, adapt, repeal, any Act of the Oireachtas in order to comply with our obligations under the European Community.  We do not need it for that reason.  It is really a bit of a red herring.  Since there is no directive requiring it and since, as I understand it, a minority of member states of the EEC at present have a register of dental specialists, we are better off looking at the situation on the ground in Ireland and assessing the future needs of this country and the way in which we can meet those needs.  I would be grateful if the Minister would comment on that aspect.</P>

      <P>I am not entirely enamoured of the powers for regulation in section 3 of the 1972 Act.  This beloved House has been as jealously guarding its prerogative as the Upper House.  If I were simply to insert sections of that nature into legislation and gaily avail of them the House might take a very different view.  It is not an argument that I favour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point I wish to get back to is a point of reconciliation at the end of this discussion.  A careful examination of section 30 indicates the care with which we have approached this provision.  Those who would be entitled to registration in the register of dental specialists would be dentists who have had initial registration, who, in the opinion of the council, have completed their training in a speciality recognised by the council.  Under section 37 (1) the council with the consent of the <Col N="248" /> Minister determine the dental specialities to be recognised for specialist dental registration purposes.  Likewise the council have to be satisfied that the person has completed a programme of training in specialised dentistry of a standard considered by the council to be adequate.</P>
      <P>The general provision of that training comes from a body recognised by the council under section 37 (3) of the Bill. That enables the council to specify the specialist training body which they recognise. The activities of those bodies are monitored by the Post-Graduate, Medical and Dental Board established under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.  I cannot go any further in giving the council such enhancement of self-determination to decide this issue themselves. In five years time the council may say. &ldquo;This idea of dental specialisation is a lot of hooey and we do not propose to register anybody&rdquo;.  They have absolute power not to do so.  If they are proposing to do so admittedly they have to have my consent.  I am not likely to withhold consent lightly.  I have access to post-graduate bodies and to the Minister for Education and I can readily cross-check.  That power is devolved to the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one other objection to the amendment.  Admittedly it is a drafting objection but it has equal validity.  It says here that the council &ldquo;may by regulations prescribe appropriate titles and conditions under which they may be used ...&rdquo; I have always had objections to statutory bodies having statutory power to decide statutory regulations.  The only people who should have statutory power to draft, prescribe and have statutory regulations annulled, if necessary, are the Minister of the day and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We do not devolve statutory powers as such.  We devolve powers of registration subject to the constitutional right of a person to appeal against deregistration. That is one danger in having a registration list defined by regulation. I would be quite unhappy about that, but that is not germane to the main thrust of my argument here.  We had lengthy discussions with the Irish Dental Association on this matter.  Because I tend to be excessively confrontational in my approach <Col N="249" /> to these issues, I want to reassure the medical profession that nothing underhand is envisaged in this regard.  If the Minister for Finance had his way I would not be advocating this course at all because of the prospect that there might be some cost involved in the payment of specialists.  There might be, but I would like to be able to spend much more money on employing an additional quota of consultant orthodontists who are badly needed in our health board structure.</P>
    <P>With reference to Senator Robinson's observations, I see considerable structural changes.  For example, we could see within the dental profession specialities in terms of dental education.  The education of the population at large in dental care, dental hygiene and oral care is at a very low ebb.  There has been a considerable improvement in the past ten or 15 years and one of the first things I would say to the new council is to consider that. Some of the millions of pounds which we spend on expensive oral surgery arise out of the neglect which my generation suffered. My experience of dental care was related to the war years.  I was born in 1935.  My dental care consisted of rather rudimentary treatment in the City Hall in Cork under a local dental officer who did his best but had a very attenuated role. Things have changed in that regard.  I see the practice of dentistry and the specialities relating to it concentrating on education, training and care.  That, in itself, is work of enormous benefit to the community, related to diet, to nutrition and to people's primary care of their health. It may be that we will have specialisation in that area in the future.</P>
    <P>I plead with the House not to press me on the amendments in the context of being no more and no less than a layman, a politician who has to make a value judgment of a highly subjective nature about the merits of amendments advanced to him.  In the heel of the hunt I do not get any pleasure from saying I will not accept an amendment.  If I saw merit in it I would accept it.  I do not see merit of a compelling nature in these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Just a further point of clarification on an aspect which has not been touched on yet.  I was going to raise this in the context of section 30 but the Minister strayed to section 30 and, with your indulgence, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, the point is a question of interpreting sections 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister emphasised that the provisions of section 29 are enabling, and that the council may decide to establish a register of dental specialists and it would need the consent of the Minister. On the face of it, the wording does appear to be enabling.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used and there is &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;.  But when you look at section 30 it is not quite so clear that it is just enabling.  Section 30 provides an entitlement to be placed on the register.  Section 30 (1) says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act, the following persons who comply with the conditions specified in subsection (2) of this section, shall be entitled to be registered in the Register of Dental Specialists...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was going to suggest when we came to section 30 that it might be better to clarify that, if it is genuinely going to be enabling, by the addition of some such phrase as &ldquo;should such register be compiled&rdquo; to make it perfectly clear that the entitlement is a conditional entitlement only if such register were to be recommended by the Dental Council.  Otherwise a person who satisfied the conditions of the further subsections, who was qualified in that way could say, &ldquo;I am entitled to be on this register of specialist dentists. I require the council to come forward with this register of specialist dentists.  I am going to court and will look for a <i>mandamus</i> on it.&rdquo;  The answer would be that the wording is &ldquo;may&rdquo; but we have had a number of cases where &ldquo;may&rdquo; in a statute is interpreted in the context of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It is not a clear case of that here, because there is the additional requirement of the consent of the Minister, but the Minister has made it clear that he would be willing to consent to the establishment of such a register.  Therefore it would be necessary, if it is to be a genuinely <Col N="251" /> enabling provision, that there be some qualification to section 30 to make it clear that the entitlement is only dependent on the Dental Council with the consent of the Minister for the time being, having decided that it would be in the best interests of the profession or of dental care that there be such a register. That would require some amendment to section 30.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow Senator Robinson on that point and perhaps narrow down this discussion to the question of the degree of autonomy.  I might say in relation to the Minister's remarks about the making of regulations by the council, I completely agree with him that the drafting is clumsy and quite inappropriate in that regard.  The Minister said in his last intervention that in regard to this matter the council have, and I quote him, &ldquo;an absolute power not to do so&rdquo;.  I join with Senator Robinson in questioning whether under the Bill that is the true legal position.  Not only is there the problem of possible appeals to the courts under section 30 but there is, of course, the general power of the Minister under section 15.  Whereas it can be said no Minister is likely to use this power, it is quite clear from section 15 that no power of the council, no discretion of the council is absolute.  This gives rise to a certain degree of worry.  In this regard I would join Senator Robinson in asking the Minister to look at section 30 between now and Report Stage and remove all danger of this circumstance whereby the Oireachtas having put &ldquo;may&rdquo; into a statute with the clear intention of it being discretionary that the courts then interpret it as being without discretion.  If the Minister could, at the same time, tell us here that it would be beyond the wildest dreams of his ministerial imagination that any of his successors would use section 15 to compel the council to act under section 29, he would remove some, though not all, of the misgivings that we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bear in mind the two points made by Senator Robinson and Senator Dooge in that regard. <Col N="252" /> The essential point I would make about section 30 is, of course, that it is applicable on a post-registration decision.  The register has to be set up in the first instance.  Under section 29 the council have to establish a register.  Following the establishment of the register, then the question of entitlement comes into play. Section 30 may be slightly ambiguous.  I will be prepared to have a look at that because it has the general preamble &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act...&rdquo; It may be that to allay any fears I could consider &ldquo;Subject to section 29&rdquo; if one wanted to be quite specific or &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of section 29&rdquo;.  I will have a word with the parliamentary draftsman and my advisers in the Department of Health regarding section 30 so that that is explicitly clear between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This is an important section in so far as it deals with the general power in regard to education and training.  It is written in very much more general terms than sections 38 to 44 of the 1928 Act which deal with the same function.  I would like to ask the Minister how will the Dental Council operate in regard to education and training.  Will they operate completely through the mandatory committee under section 13 (2) or will they exercise certain functions other than through the committee on education and training?  Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister what change will there be in regard to education and training?  There are now dental boards of some type which have a concern here - I forget their names for the moment.  I would like to know, in practice, what will be the change?  My third question is, what will be the relationship of the Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Board which exists under another statute in relation to the Dental Council and the mandatory committee on education and training of the Dental Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view of the Leader of the House that this is an important section in the Bill.  It specifically obliges the council to satisfy themselves that all the courses of dental education and training are adequate and suitable.  There is a retention power, of course, given to the council, the council having the overriding power of determiregistration <Col N="255" /> nation of the work of the committees and that is important.  The other major change in this section is that it transfers the educational function in dentistry to the Dental Council from the Medical Council, who exercise that function under the Dentists Act, 1928.  Therefore, if we pass this today, it will make dentistry a self-governing profession here as it became in the UK in 1957.  That is of considerable importance in relation to this section.  With regard to the other questions Senator Dooge asked, I have not an immediate answer to them at this stage, but I will bear them in mind for Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if, in fact, these things should well be left to the new educational and training committee.  We have now boards of examiners in regard to dentistry which are statutory.  These will be no longer statutory and I would like to know if, in fact, any decisions have been made with regard to whether the new educational and training committee set up under section 13 (2) will act directly with the internal examining boards of the training authorities.  Have there been any discussions on that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if this new Bill will make provision for the introduction of dental hygiene in the schools?  If that is the case very definite standards of treatment should be agreed and an agreed training course of three to four years should be undertaken before any licence is granted.  This would be essential in order to ensure that from the start a high standard of quality of service is provided.  The training of dental hygienists is important because it will be their duty to give a dental health education programme to the community who must be made aware of the prevention of disease rather than trying to deal with it afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is a very important one even though we may have put a lot of emphasis on other sections.  The Minister told us his age and spoke of the service he had in Cork in his growing years.  It is our business now to see that attention is given to the prevention of disease and <Col N="256" /> perhaps in the years ahead we may not need specialists, consultants or dentists.</P>
    <P>This is a most important section.  Perhaps in looking at the Bill many of us did not put the emphasis on it that we should have put on it.  I do not think the people who made representations to me put sufficient emphasis on that section either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point made by Senator Honan.  In fact, there was not a great deal of discussion about this section in the various discussions we had.  In reply to Senator Honan and Senator Dooge, the council have a very clear power devolved on them in relation to total control by the council of the practical knowledge requirements and the clinical experience required at examinations for the primary qualification. Equally, on the post-graduate side they have major powers.  They must as a council be fully satisfied.  They will, admittedly, transfer on a subsidiary but holding basis the work to the training education committee but at all times they will have power to run that show and I have no doubt that they will do so effectively. That power under section 34 is very considerable and is all-embracing and the section was a very difficult one to frame.  It is the best the parliamentary draftsman could do, in my view, because of the general nature of the role and functions of this section.</P>

      <P>The point I should like to raise here has regard to post-graduate education.  It is probably quite inadequate to mention mere post-graduate education in this particular context. Post-graduate education is not defined in the definition section of the Bill.  It could be interpreted in two ways.  There is a narrow meaning for post-graduate education: where it is formal post-graduate education, taken relatively soon after primary qualification.  There is also the other form of post-graduate education known widely as continuing education which does not come within the narrow meaning and is only included if we interpret post-graduate education in a broad way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these days of rapidly changing technology, continuing education has become <Col N="257" /> of vital importance.  This mid-career retraining, this type of training in which people in professional practice come back in order to study a new development, must, of course, be a vital factor in the educational training of our professional workforce in dentistry.  As I say, it may well be that we could accept that continuing education is covered in the term &ldquo;post-graduate education&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister, in view of the great importance of continuing education for the upgrading of the dental workforce as developments go on, whether it would not be appropriate that we should put it beyond all question, as it were, and lay emphasis on continuing education, either by inserting here in section 34 or else in the definition section, a phrase that would read &ldquo;post-graduate including continuing education&rdquo; or &ldquo;post-graduate and continuing education&rdquo;.  I think it would help to remove all possible doubt on this point and, equally, it would be flagging the importance of continuing education which is something we can never emphasise too much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider the matter on Report Stage.  I think I will have much difficulty in so doing because I am rather loath to cut across the functions of the Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Board established under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.  These functions are pretty specifically defined as, in section 40 (a), &ldquo;to promote development of post-graduate, medical and dental education and training and to co-ordinate such developments.&rdquo;  I would be reluctant to embroil myself in cutting across that specific function.  Admittedly the board have entitlement under that section to advise me on all matters relating to the development and co-ordination of post-graduate medical and dental education training.  I suppose section 37 should really be read in conjunction with section 37 (3).  It enables the council to specify the specialist training body which the council will recognise, that is, for the purpose of completion of satisfactory specialist training.  I will consider on Report Stage the point made by Senator <Col N="258" /> Dooge in relation to continuing education and training, but at this Stage I probably would find myself in some considerable difficulty lending a definition to that concept at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulty the Minister would have here. That leads me on to the next, and possibly the final point, I have on this section. That is the question of the Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Board set up under section 40 of the Medical Practitioners Act.  I raise the question whether in fact, when this Bill is being enacted which makes the Dental Council independent of the Medical Council, the position of this particular board should not be taken account of?  We have a board set up here under that Act which sets up the Medical Council.  If we are to act in the post-graduate and continuing dental education field through this Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Board set up under the umbrella of the Medical Council, I wonder if there should not essentially be an amendment here so that this board should either be a board appointed jointly by the Medical Council established under the 1978 Act and the Dental Council set up under this Bill or whether there should be a separate post-graduate dental board set up under this Bill.  It seems there is a bit of the umbilical cord which has not been taken away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Not having any professional awareness of that situation, far be it for me to interfere with the umbilical cord and find myself in dire trouble.  I hold the view that the council inevitably should have powers relating to post-graduate as well as graduate training. That would be the broad thrust of my response because subsection (3) of section 37 relating to specialist registration states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council shall from time to time determine, in relation to each speciality recognised by it, the body or bodies which the Council shall recognise in the State for the purpose of granting <Col N="259" /> evidence of satisfactory completion of specialist training.</P>
    <P>The council have an enabling power to specify the qualifications granted in the State for registration.  I will consider the point raised by Senator Dooge on Report Stage.  I am rather reluctant to get embroiled in the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.  There are considerable problems there of cross-reference. It is a difficult one at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and indeed I suggest to the Minister that it is a matter of such complexity that it might be looked at between now and the discussion of the Bill in the Dáil rather than have a hurried examination of the matter now.  I would like to stress that we should look at section 40 of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.  There is interweaving here.  For example, we have the Bill here which attempts to give autonomy to the dental profession and yet it is a body established by the Medical Council who have the function of promoting the development of post-graduate dental education. They have the function of co-ordinating such development.  The coordination of post-graduate dental education is in the hands of a body which is subsidiary to the Medical Council and established under the same statue.  It seems to me that there is a degree of interpenetration here which may be inevitable, and I suggest that the Minister should look at it.  If he can solve it between now and Report Stage in this House all to the good, but he should look at it before the Bill is dealt with on Committee Stage in another place.  We can only hope that the remainder of this separation process does not take us the 56 years it took us to go from the 1928 Act to the 1984 Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by the Senator.  It is true to say that in Chapter II of the Medical Practitioners Act the life and functions of the post-graduate medical and dental board seems to be put into it on a separate basis.  The functions of the Medical Council are quite separately dealt with in Chapter I. <Col N="260" /> I will have a sharp look at Chapter II and see if there could be one encompassing new provision, if necessary, to do the interlocking and keep that umbilical cord intact.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 38.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 38 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 38 is another key section.  It is the primary section of Part V which is in regard to the fitness to practise.  It has already been discussed fairly well on Second Stage.  I will merely summarise now by welcoming the development that any person can take an initiative in regard to this, the careful procedures laid down here, the <i>prima facie</i> examination by the Fitness to Practise Committee, the report of the council and the provision of the appeal to the High Court which is now being made more flexible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, there is just once specific point I would like to raise.  I hope the Minister will forgive me in this if once again I draw a parallel with the UK legislation. I think it is always useful to look at UK legislation but I am no advocate of slavishly following it.  They make specific statutory provision for the appointment of a legal assessor whereas we content ourselves with giving authority to the Dental Council or to the Fitness to Practice Committee to take such advice, including legal advice, as it may think fit. There is a difference between these two, namely under the British system, the legal assessor is not only legal adviser to one side.  They have the provision whereby there can be a legal assessor to examine the legal position in regard to a particular point whose findings are made known to both sides.  I would like to ask the Minister whether the institution of such an assistant of the court was considered. It may well have been considered and rejected for a good reason.  If it has not been considered in depth, is the Minister <Col N="261" /> prepared to examine it between now and the final Stages of this legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very concerned if I were to amend the provisions in that respect or even to contemplate the question, although it is raised appropriately enough by the Leader of the House.  Essentially it is a transposing of the sections of the 1978 Act, and that particular fitness to practise procedure has been the subject of detailed High Court analysis and decision.  I would hold the view that as against the UK position, &mdash; I am speaking here from memory &mdash; our High Court would regard it as the definitive assessing authority and, as such, would regard itself as having the definitive authority to advise the parties. The requirement of the legal assessor in that setting would be offensive to the prerogatives of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not have described properly the functions of this legal assessor.  Far from complicating the position and far from taking in any way from the High Court, he would operate in the same way as in the United Kingdom, by the useful function of avoiding a mistrial at the disciplinary hearing.  In other words, his main function would be in regard to rules of procedures, to avoid difficulty.</P>
      <P>We must be rather careful here when we are dealing with the case of an individual on trial for his professional life. Special precautions are taken in the criminal law in regard to murder cases when people are on trial for their lives. Equally, too, every care must be taken when a person is on trial before a professional tribunal for his professional life.  It seems to me that person is entitled to every advantage, to see that the procedures are correct and that full advantage is given to him.</P>
      <P>I would just like to ask the Minister if he would take a look at section 28 of the Dentists Act, 1957.  It may well be that it would add nothing to the smooth running of the disciplinary procedures under the present Bill and it may well be that it is not precluded under this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My essential and instinctive reaction when the point was made by the Leader of the House was that there may well be &mdash; and I would be very surprised if there would not be &mdash; a considerable rebuttal of such a prospective procedure being intruded at a preliminary stage into the Act by the High Court.  As I recall, the 1957 UK Act does not contain the ultimate prospect of formal court proceedings.  On preliminary statement of case, and, to use a layman's phrase, at the point of the production of the book of evidence and the procedures contained in the statement of offence, it would be facilitating if there were a legal assessor available to both sides.  Effectively, he would have to be an officer of the court.  Under our judicial system and under the High Court appeal system we had within the Act that the court would regard that as an intrusion into that ultimate section.  That is the original point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not correct in saying there is no appeal.  There is an appeal to the Privy Council in Britain and ultimately I suppose to the House of Lords.  The position is that if such an assessor was to be appointed I would envisage that he would be appointed by the President of the High Court so that it would not be a detraction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Privy Council role in regard to the UK situation, but I am conscious that that particular fitness to practise structure and that disciplinary procedure have been the subject of enormous extensive pleadings in the High Court and indeed in the Supreme Court over a number of years relating to the medical profession.  In the case of law reports on it, that particular procedure was never suggested by the High Court as being a possible procedure. Perhaps it would be a useful system. It might declare some redundancy among the plethora of junior and senior counsel who work on both sides of the cases in those instances.  It would be illuminating to know how many fees one <Col N="263" /> would save on the pleadings of such cases.</P>

      <P>It is an area fraught with enormous constitutional danger.  I am rather reluctant to get embroiled in it.  The power unquestionably is there. Perhaps Senator Dooge may recall, I do not, the constitutionality of that section being challenged.  When I was a trade union officer I used to examine the rules of trade unions who had power to fine their members and the constitutionality thereof was frequently called into question with good cause in the context of the rights of natural justice.  I therefore do not wish to open that particular can of worms but it is something to which the Senator has correctly drawn the attention of the House and one which ultimately on a test case would have to be decided. I have the assurance of the parliamentary draftsman that it is in order and I readily transfer legislative responsibility to him for the time being in that regard, but it is a very open question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is somewhat out of tandem with section 38 in its manner of dealing with the issue which it raises.  The power to determine under this section appears to lie exclusively with the council without reference to the Fitness to Practise Committee.  I wonder would it not be better if the power to deal with breaches of the criminal code, which this section appears to deal with, were not included as a further subsection under section 38?  It seems to be a rather cumbersome way of dealing with breaches of the criminal code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second thing that worries me about this section is that it refers merely to offences which can be tried on indictment, in other words, indictable offences. It does not deal with summary offences.  There are many offences which could conceivably be committed by a practising dentist which could be far more serious than an indictable offence.  Take, for instance, the offence of having excess alcohol in the blood when driving or a repeat of that particular offence, or an offence of being cruel to an animal, which again can be dealt with and tried summarily <Col N="266" /> without the necessity for trial before a judge and jury.  I should like the Minister's response to those two points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Admittedly, nobody would wish to have the spectacle of a dentist being subjected to a series of summary convictions, for example, for drunken driving.  But the imposition on the dental profession should be no greater than the imposition on the citizenry at large.  Therefore, that particular section relates quite clearly to conviction by the courts on indictable offences on a jury basis.  The general acceptance is that for the ordinary summary convictions, that particular section would not apply.  That is only fair and reasonable.  Technically speaking, an unfortunate dentist could find himself in dire trouble on a series of convictions for parking offences or any other offences.  I do not think they are as unworthy a profession as to merit that kind of stringency.  Accordingly, there is a clear restriction to indictable offences. This section again, has been the subject of considerable litigation and had the intensive scrutiny of the High Court.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise a matter which is not dissimilar.  I am amazed that the Minister did not decide to provide for a continuing offence in respect of the matter referred to in section 51.  A fine is for the commission of an offence as such.  The would-be wisdom in providing, as is provided in certain sections of various Acts creating offences, that there should be a fine for a continuing offence for each particular day that the offence continues to be committed would be particularly appropriate by virtue of the nature of the offence which subsection (2) of section 51 creates.</P>

      <P>There is one further question which arises under section 52 (4). This subsection exempts the time for the institution of summary proceedings in respect of an offence committed under this section.  I am wondering why in this particular case the Minister extended it to two years, bearing in mind that the time limit has not been extended under other sections of the Bill which would appear to be more appropriate for extension. For instance, in section 67 the time limit for the institution of summary proceedings has not been extended.  Why has the time limit been extended to two years under this section?</P>

      <P>The Dental Board made representations to me that very often more than six months have elapsed between the committing of an offence <Col N="269" /> and the matter being brought to the attention of the board.  The section enables proceedings to be instituted within two years, as the Senator has rightly pointed out.  The Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act would normally permit proceedings to be instituted within only six months from the commission of the offence. Therefore, the two year limit is inserted here and it seems that we are entirely within our rights in so doing.</P>

    <P>That Seanad Éireann rejects the proposal to close in whole or in part 14 power stations and demands the Government to give priority to indigenous fuel in its National Energy Policy in the Midlands and the West to ensure that the ESB's peat fuel stations are kept fully operative.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;endorses the action of the Government in setting up the Inquiry to investigate systematically the reasons for the high cost of electricity, notes that the ESB prepared a five-year Strategic Plan and calls on the Government to have due regard to the social, regional and strategic implications of the use of indigenous fuel in national energy policy when considering this plan.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, the reason given for the proposed closing down of the turf stations by the ESB would appear to be the uncompetitive cost of peat fire stations as compared with oil and coal.  However, if one reads pages 22 and 23 of the ESB Annual Report for 1983 it is quite obvious that this argument does not hold up.  When one looks at the performances of the different fuel plants for the year ended 31 March 1983 and when we compare the plant load factor plus the fuel cost per unit sent out it is quite obvious that the plant load factor has a big bearing on the final cost of the unit of power.  The unit of electricity costs the housewife approximately 7.3 pence. It can be argued that the average cost of a unit as it leaves the station is approximately as follows: for sod peat generating stations, 3.8 pence; for oil fired stations, 3.7 pence; for milled peat stations, 3.5 pence.  These all exclude the distribution costs.  The major factor in all this question would appear to be the plant load factor, and if we take the plant performances for the year ended 31 March 1983 for Ringsend where the plant load factor was 4 per cent the fuel cost per unit sent out was 6.2 pence and the works cost per unit sent out was 14.1 pence.  In the Poolbeg station in Dublin city, another oil fired station where the plant load factor was only 30 per cent, the fuel cost per unit sent out was 3.5 pence and the works cost per unit sent out was 4.2 pence.  If we compare these figures with Rhode, in <Col N="271" /> County Offaly, which is a milled peat station which had a 57 per cent plant load factor, the fuel cost per unit sent out was 3.2 pence and the works cost per unit sent out was 4.2 pence.  Allenwood in County Kildare, which is a sod peat station, with a plant load factor of 34 per cent incurred fuel costs per unit of 3.5 pence and a works cost per unit sent out of 5 pence.</P>
      <P>In reading through the ESB's annual reports for the last couple of years it is quite clear that the ESB's problems are not solely the cost of fuel or the calorific value of the peat but the very low plant load factors in so many of the board's generating stations.  From those figures it is quite clear that the ESB cannot lightly discontinue the generating of electricity from peat, which has proved a valuable natural resource over a long number of years.  It is quite clear that the problem lies in the efficiency of the generating stations in which the energy is generated. Of course the appearance of oil and gas as indigenous fuels to a great extent will change the emphasis, and our planners must adapt our order of priority.  I believe that this would indicate that the experiments that have been carried out on alternative sources of energy such as short rotation forestry do not warrant the same priority as they did in 1974.  Nevertheless, I believe that that experimentation should continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one underlying thing in all this, and that is that the Government must not sacrifice midland peat jobs for oil.  With that background, it is therefore a great source of pleasure to me that the Government, after their exhaustive studies, have in the announcement made by the Tánaiste and Minister for Energy on 1 June come to a very solid decision to utilise the national resources.  I want to compliment the Minister for Energy for giving the problem such deep study and for coming out and firmly pinning the Government policy to the mast.  This policy is going to be not just of specific value in regard to job opportunities in the midland counties: it is based on sound national policy to utilise the natural resources to the full.  Because of the obvious implications for the continued <Col N="272" /> operations of Bord na Móna I think the Government are right to insist that the two boards should have got together and jointly considered the ESB's proposals. I am very happy that the Minister has now announced a modified proposal which must give great encouragement to people who are employed in either skilled or semi-skilled or professional jobs in Bord na Móna and the ESB.</P>
    <P>The Minister said on Friday, I quote:</P>
    <P>The sod peat stations at Portarlington and Allenwood would continue in operation until the Bord na Móna bogs supplying them run out.  This is expected to occur in 1986 or 1987 for Portarlington and over the years 1988 to 1990 for Allenwood.  The A unit in the milled peat stations at Ferbane and Rhode will continue in operation at reduced load factors.  The ESB has pointed out that those are old stations and that the objective of the lower load factors is to prolong the lives of the plant without the necessity of incurring large investment.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister for Energy has now clearly stated Government policy, and every person working in both of these important areas, the employees of Bord na Móna and the ESB can now settle down and concentrate on their work and on making their industries more competitive if that is possible.  I would hope that the board of Bord na Móna, in costing the price of milled peat, would look not at the abstract figure, relating their end product to the cost of the calorific value compared with the imported oil, but that they would produce the milled peat at an economic cost to the board.  I would also hope that the officials of Bord na Móna would take a wider view rather than adopt the &ldquo;I'm all right Jack&rdquo; policy because their own positions are quite secure.  It is important that the Government should urgently produce policies on energy jobs for the next quarter of a century.  We need policies on the utilisation of our peat resources and we certainly need a policy as a matter of urgency on the future uses of the cutover bogs.  It is of the utmost importance that all the people involved in a very large area <Col N="273" /> of the centre of this country should know exactly what the policy is and what the future holds, because over the last 30 or 40 years these two semi-State organisations have played such a significant role in the economic lives of very many families in the midland counties, and it is important that the workers and their families should be able to look forward in the future to a continuation of the valuable and highly-prized employment that those two industries have offered.</P>
    <P>I think also that Bord na Móna should be seeking to diversify so as to maintain their status as top-class employers.  I think that a job in Bord na Móna for a skilled person over a number of decades has been almost a gilt-edged job.  They give very valuable and worthwhile employment and the high technical skills that their workers had reflected the success of the board in designing, to a great extent, their own machines and the technology that many countries in the world have followed.  I wish those two organisations success and I hope that the workers will continue with that very high service and output that they have had over the years.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the Government's policy as announced by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, on 1 June last. I think that it clears the air and reassures thousands of workers and many hundreds of families in the midland counties of Offaly, Laois, Westmeath and Kildare who for months past were living under a cloud of uncertainty.  I think that the clear statement of Government policy now allows all those people involved to settle down to put their best into their industries to ensure that industry in general will have energy at the most competitive prices and hopefully the board of the ESB will be able to reduce the cost of electricity to the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion enthusiastically.  I am firmly convinced that the need for a strong, coherent and workable national energy policy is of paramount importance to us, and I do not believe that the statement of the Tánaiste in the last few days is going to <Col N="274" /> have any long term effect on the essential problem of how best to use our indigenous fuels, whether coal, turf or the lignite that is available from sources under Lough Neagh.  I do not feel that there is a national energy policy being pursued and I feel that the Moneypoint situation, where we have fuel being imported from countries such as the United States and Poland, is an indication of this because the add-on effect of that importation is going to be horrific.</P>
      <P>In the light of the fact that we do not have an energy policy it is essential that none of the power stations at present being operated by the ESB be closed. To me it seems that modern technological developments could ensure that even if some of these units were not to use peat as the main source of energy their operation could be maintained by using a mixture of peat and crow coal or even lignite, because there is absolutely no doubt that in the last number of years furnaces have improved and methods of burning have improved.  In the west of Ireland we now see, from the fact that a company is now setting up a plant to produce briquettes from a mixture of coal and turf, that the technology is there, and therefore I do not think we should be closing down these plants in any circumstances. In the long term, they can be kept viable.</P>
      <P>We have vast resources of indigenous fuels available in this country which were not considered until recently to be a viable source of economic energy, but the ever-increasing cost of oil and the uncertainty of the sources of this oil has caused many people to spend quite large sums of money in research and development on fuel alternatives, and I consider that any precipitate action in closing power stations which use indigenous fuels would have disastrous effects in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad to see the conflicts which are emerging between Government, ESB and Bord na Móna as to how best to produce energy at a cost to the consumer which would not be excessive for industry or householders and which would take into account the role that can be played in our energy needs by the use of native fuels.  It is interesting to note that in 1950 <Col N="275" /> coal met 75 per cent of the energy needs in Europe and oil approximately 16 per cent.  The position changed drastically during the sixties when oil became very cheap in comparison to other fuel and it seemed that the supply of oil would continue at a cheap rate and be available at a price which made the use of our indigenous fuels and indeed the solid fuels right throughout the world uneconomic. Between 1958 and 1973 the amount of community energy derived from coal dropped from 50 per cent to about 23 per cent and the use of oil rose to more than 70 per cent.  In Ireland, during the same period the amount of energy derived from solid fuels, coal and peat, dropped from 62 per cent to 26 per cent.  The high cost of oil has made alternative sources of energy such as coal and peat competitive once more.</P>
    <P>In my own county of Kilkenny and in the adjoining counties of Laois, Offaly and Tipperary we have seen the total rundown of the solid fuel supplies.  It is heartening, however, to see that Ballingarry colleries are once again in production, and I feel Ballingarry colleries will play a major part in supplementing the imported fuel that we are using at present. Indeed in that area which was run down economically it is possibly the only source of jobs, apart from the nearby briquette factory which was not so long ago opened at Littleton.  If we had kept the mines in the Kilkenny, Tipperary, Carlow and Laois area open, even on a care-and-maintainance basis, from the 1960s to now, the cost of maintaining them would not have been high in any way, and with the increase in the price of oil I think that they would be now economically viable.  It might appear that by stressing what has happened in the coal mining industry I am going away from the broad thrust of the motion, but I feel that it is essential to point out the mistakes which were made in the closing of the mines and suggest that the closing of ESB plants using indigenous fuels would have quantifiable long term cost to our economy.</P>
    <P>The present Iran-Iraq conflict which has blown up in a major way in the last couple of days shows how volatile that <Col N="276" /> area is and that the prospects of getting oil out of there can be stopped overnight if the Strait of Hormuz is blocked.  It is heartening to hear from sources on the international scene that it is highly unlikely that this will happen and that it is fairly certain that the Strait will not be closed and that despite the increasing cost of insurance nobody has refused to go into the Gulf to take oil out over the past few weeks since the bombing of ships has taken place on a fairly regular basis.  One sincerely hopes that that conflict which is causing tremendous hardship to people on both sides will be resolved and that we will not have a problem in getting oil from that region.</P>
    <P>Our energy advisers need to provide a renewed stimulus for the accelerated development of alternative sources of energy because of these problems in the Middle East.  Meetings of Energy Ministers have taken place in the EEC over the past few years, and in Copenhagen in 1982 the basis for the Community solid fuel policy was established.  The solid fuel policy was basically directed towards investment in coal production but, following a joint approach by Ireland and Greece at Commission level and in the Council of Ministers it was agreed that peat and lignite provided a secure and economic source of energy for power stations and the household heating market and that they were very important for the energy supplies of both Ireland and Greece.  Therefore, it was decided to include peat and lignite, or brown coal, in a balanced and coherent solid fuel Community programme.</P>
    <P>It would appear to me that it would be complete madness to close down ESB stations using peat when we know that there are vast recoverable quantities available and that equally new technology has ensured that peat can be burned mixed either with coal and or with lignite. It is a fact that we have about 23 million tonnes of recoverable coal in Ireland. The British Mining Company did a survery in 1982 and the 23 million tonnes that they have said is recoverable is recoverable at an economic cost.  There is an unquantifiable amount of coal which could become economically viable if oil <Col N="277" /> prices continue to rise.  That report has not been very widely read.  From what I can gather there is only one copy of that report left in the Department of Energy and it is extremely difficult to get a copy of it.</P>
    <P>I feel that when we are talking about indigenous fuel it is atrocious to think that that report is not widely available. There is no copy of it in the Library here. When one looks for it in the Department of Energy one finds that because of the cost it is not readily available.  I sincerely hope that something will be done by the Minister to ensure that at least the Members of this House can get that report and whether it be the Connacht coalfield, the Munster coalfield or the Leinster coalfield, we can find out exactly what the experts have said is available, the type, quantity, calorific values and so forth.</P>
    <P>We have found that there is a major source of lignite available under Lough Neagh.  Even though this is across the Border, that lignite could be used mixed with turf.  It is probably a better product than coal for mixing with turf because it is a wetter product and both turf and lignite would be extremely close in their state of development when one considers the age of both deposits.  It is possible that this lignite mixed with coal available from the Connacht coalfields or with peat could provide Arigna with an ESB station using the flouride bed method of energy conversion that not alone would be efficient but would be cost-efficient.  It would probably be feasible to use a mixture of bonded peat and coal in the plant.</P>
    <P>When we look at our fuel resources we see that at present we have approximately 1 million hectares of peatland with Bord na Móna having acquired some 80,000 hectares of bogland and with 23 works at various locations.  In 1982 total production of turf was of the order of 3 million tonnes equivalent to 1 million tonnes of oil.  We must agree that this has enormously helped to keep down our foreign energy source cost.  This is one of the things that we must look at very carefully. When we are bringing in fuel from abroad, whether for use in power plants <Col N="278" /> or in industry or for domestic purposes, quite a large proportion of the fuel that we are bringing in is from America, and we are paying for currency in a lot of cases.  We are buying currency and then, with that currency we are buying fuel, so that we cannot accept the fact that even though the Irish fuel source might seem on the surface to be a little bit dearer, when one considers the fact that one has to buy dollars to purchase the fuel the economic variance is not as great as it would appear at first sight.  Oil has not gone up at all in the last four or five years but the price of the dollar has gone up, and we in this country must look for an alternative source of energy for use in our power plants other than oil or fuel that has to be bought with dearly-earned foreign currency.</P>
    <P>We must keep the stations which use indigenous fuels open.  When we look to Europe we see that the Community has earmarked in 1984 300 million ECUs to support investment, to promote productive investment to modernise and rationalise Community production of hard coal, brown coal and peat, ultimately leading to an increase in Community mining productivity and harvesting.  It is interesting to note that the Department of Energy has not issued one mining licence in Ireland in the last two years.  It is a shame to think that nobody is interested at present in extending the research into our possible fuel sources.</P>
    <P>The Community supports to the limit of 25 per cent eligible investment costs between 1984 and 1988.  We must ensure that we can benefit from these incentives. I am apprehensive about the ESB's long-term plans which will ensure a dependence on imported oil but will use imported coal from, amongst other places, the United States to the detriment of employment prospects for our people and a very bad drain on our Exchequer in terms of the huge amount of money going abroad, not to purchase coal but to purchase foreign currencies which will then be used to purchase coal.  Not enough research has gone into the prospects of blending the semi-bituminous fuels available in Arigna and Ballingarry with foreign fuels.  The Government and <Col N="279" /> the ESB jointly should carry out research and development programmes to evaluate the use to which the mixtures of coal and peat could be put.  I believe, as does the EEC Commission, that peat is a secure and economically viable energy source in Ireland especially for power stations and that reserves are considerable and can be utilised for long periods. This argument must be carefully considered before any station is closed down, particularly in view of the heavy investment by Bord na Móna in its third development programme and the availability of Community aid for modernising the production of peat.  We must bear in mind that every extra three tons of peat produced means one ton less of oil imported. This is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>Peat resources are important in their own right and as instruments for viable regional development purposes. The value of having indigenous fuels available should not be under-estimated. I hope that before any further hard-andfast decisions are made which could have such catastrophic effects on huge areas of our country &mdash; effects of an economic and social nature which are too horrific even to contemplate &mdash; we must not under-estimate the fact that the areas in which peat production is greatest are areas into which up to now industry has not gone and the only industries that have been provided in these areas are of a peat-oriented nature.  To close down a factory just because the source of energy is not available exactly on the spot does not bear thinking about.</P>
    <P>Considering closing down Portarlington and Allenwood when the peat available in the neighbourhood is run down is not on when one realises that the ESB are importing fuel from the United States, Poland, possibly from the USSR and South Africa.  It would be ludicrous to think that on the one hand we are bringing in fuels, paying carriage on them, and buying them with hard-earned foreign currency and at the same time saying that we cannot draw materials from within our own country to the power stations that are to be run down, not because of economic factors but because of the fact that the fuel to support them <Col N="280" /> is not available locally.  The cost of bringing fuel to these plants must surely be a lot less than the cost of bringing fuel into Moneypoint.  Where plants are run down, old or might need major capital investment to bring them up to an economic standard I can see an argument for possibly closing them but there should be no talk about closing a plant because the peat is not available next door.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a cohesive national energy policy.  There is a need for research and development into our energy needs.  Until there is a comprehensive plan we should in no circumstances close any of the plants that are currently using native fuels whether it be peat or coal.  The motion was put down before the Minister for Energy made his announcement.  I presume the announcement was not made taking the Laois-Offaly by-election into account.  I accept that the statement was made because a long and hard look had been taken at it.</P>
    <P>Having said that I am delighted that the Minister has at least given some hope that the plants will be kept open until after the by-election. I sincerely hope that when the by-election is over the Minister will adopt a national energy policy which will provide substantial jobs in deprived areas, and that we will be able to use a mix of the indigenous fuels that we have available to us.  Even though lignite does not seem to be available as yet south of the Border, the Lough Neagh deposit mixed with Arigna fuels would seem to me to have great prospects for continuing use.  In East Germany about 60 per cent of the energy used for electricity production comes from lignite, so it is not a fuel that people do not know about.  It is not a fuel that cannot be used.  Economically it can be better used by mixing it with peat.  I sincerely hope that in the future we will see in conjunction with our friends across the Border a research and development project set up which will ensure that peat and lignite can be used to provide energy at a cost that is economically and commercially viable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that I am sure <Col N="281" /> Senator Lanigan knows my efforts in relation to the timing of my announcement last week.  If it had any bearing or any significance in relation to the by-election in the Laois-Offaly constituency, I can assure him I would have found a better time to do it than on the day before President Reagan arrived at Shannon Airport.  The decision was made after many months of examination in my Department.  I welcome the opportunity to expand on the statement here in the Seanad and I thank the Seanad for giving me that opportunity.</P>
      <P>The House is no doubt aware that the Government, at their meeting on 30 May 1984 decided that, following consideration of the ESB's strategic plan, the generation of electricity from peat-fired stations is to continue with little change, in accordance with revised arrangements between the ESB and Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>Earlier proposals by the ESB would have involved the closure of certain old peat-fired generating stations, and would have had a serious impact on the volume of peat production by Bord na Móna, on its employment, its financial viability, and indeed its continued existence.</P>
      <P>These proposals arose because of the difficulties facing the ESB at present.  To tackle these difficulties the ESB in 1983 drew up a five year strategic plan, 1983-88, having as its primary objective, regarded as very commendable by the Government, the achievement of substantial improvement in the economics of its operations.  This plan was drawn up by the board and management of the ESB on their own initiative and responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the case that the ESB now has substantial excess generating capacity. There are many reasons for this, for example, a sharp cut back in demand for electricity mainly due to the recession; the high cost of electricity, as indeed of all energy; generating capacity provided to burn Kinsale gas and the provision of the Moneypoint generating capacity to come on stream over the next three to five years as a measure to reduce dependence on oil.  This new plant programme will add further to capacity; the cost of servicing this capital will overhang the <Col N="282" /> board's finances for years.  It is likely that the years of continued vigorous expansion by the ESB are at an end and that for a considerable period the paramount need is to deal with the over-capacity and over-manned situations and to achieve cost reduction.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that the ESB in 1983 drew up the five year strategic plan.  Its status is that it was transmitted to the Minister for Energy but it was later the agreed understanding that for proposals in it which directly or indirectly had implications for matters relating to areas of Government policy, the approval of the Minister and Government would be required.  The plan is based on a number of assumptions, one being that recovery from the recession will be slow and consequently growth in electricity demand will also be slow.  The plan set out the measures proposed by the ESB to accelerate the transition of the board from a high growth expansionist organisation to a low growth stable one.</P>
    <P>In brief, the measures are to reduce costs by way of reduced staff numbers, improvements in administration and accounting procedures and greater control of overheads generally.  It envisaged the de-commissioning of older generating stations both oil and peat and the old Arigna coal station.  These stations included two sod peat stations and three milled peat stations, all supplied by Bord na Móna, four small 5MW stations supplied by private producers, three oil fired stations &mdash; one completely and two partially &mdash; and one small gas fired station. Later, revision of certain of these closure proposals was submitted.</P>
    <P>The plan envisages greater efficiency in operation of the generating system with a view to achieving economies. When the present generating programme has been completed no further generation projects will be needed until well into the next decade.  It also proposes strict economies in premises construction. No further head office or headquarters development is envisaged before 1990 and other premises development will be limited to absolute priority cases.</P>
    <P>In the area of distribution the plan <Col N="283" /> proposes greater efficiency to reduce distribution system losses and reduction of stockholding costs.  A reduction of staffing by 5 per cent per annum through better organisation, planning and work methods is also proposed.  The plan also foresees scope for further investment in consultancy activities.</P>
    <P>In the marketing area the plan envisages the maintenance of a strong presence for electricity in the energy market, the development of new uses for electricity as well as shaping and increasing loads to give a satisfactory financial contribution. The development of tariff structures which achieve financial objectives and which support load shaping and load building is also proposed.  The plan emphasises the strategic importance to the organisation of special arrangements with the suppliers of native energies to assist price moderation and stability.</P>
    <P>The ESB's proposals on peat generation closures and on use of Bord na Móna production, and the price for it, were the subject of extensive re-examination by the two boards at the request of the Minister for Energy.  Over the past few months the ESB and Bord Na Móna have, accordingly, examined the whole area of turf usage for electricity generation and the important matters of volume take and prices to be paid for supplies. In addition, a full review of the case for and against completion of the 3rd 300 MW unit at Moneypoint has been carried out.  This was to test the merits of proceeding with this unit or to see if, by deferral, significant capital cost savings could be made.  It was not because Moneypoint 3 was a cause of the proposed peat closures.  I am glad to say that the review of the third Moneypoint unit has been concluded, and I expect to be putting the outcome of the review to the Government shortly.</P>
    <P>The original strategic plan included proposals to close 733 MW of generating capacity in 14 stations which the ESB maintains are high-cost and low merit.</P>
    <P>Because of the obvious implications for the continued operations of Bord na Móna, the Government insisted that the two boards should get together and jointly consider the ESB proposals.  Following <Col N="284" /> protracted negotiations the following modified proposals emerged: the sod peat stations at Portarlington and Allenwood will continue in operation until the Bord na Móna bogs supplying them run out.  This is expected to occur in 1986-87 for Portarlington and over the years 1988 to 1990 for Allenwood; the A units in the milled peat stations at Ferbane and Rhode will continue in operation at reduced load factors.  The ESB has pointed out that these are old stations and that the objectives of the lower load factors is to prolong the lives of the plants without the necessity to incur large capital investment; the milled peat station at Bellacorick will continue in operation subject to plant availability.</P>
    <P>The ESB also put forward modified proposals relating to the four small 5 MW sod peat stations and the 15 MW coal fired station.  The stations at Gweedore and Cahirciveen would continue in operation and the stations at Miltown Malbay and Screebe would close, as proposed originally.  The ESB pointed out that the load factors at Miltown Malbay and Screebe have been low for many years due to the unsatisfactory level of sod peat deliveries.  The cost of a unit of electricity sent out from the stations is also very high.  The stations at Gweedore and Cahirciveen have a better unit cost.</P>
    <P>The ESB also stated that the anticipated delivery levels of sod peat at these two stations have generally been maintained over the years and reasonable load factors were attainable.  In regard to the 15 MW coal-fired station, which is located at Arigna and is supplied by local colleries, the ESB plans to keep that station in operation as long as no major investment becomes necessary at the generating plant and suitable coal continues to be available from local sources at economic rates.</P>
    <P>There is no change in the original proposals, as set out in the ESB strategic plan, to reduce capacity at Tarbert, Great Island and Marina and to close Ringsend. The proposals relating to Tarbert, Great Island and Marina are only for part closure. There will still remain a substantial generating capacity of 500 MW at Tarbert, 120 MW at Great Island and 145 <Col N="285" /> MW at Marina.  These and the other proposals in the strategic plan do not directly affect the future of Bord na Móna, and decisions relating to them come within the management responsibilities of the ESB.</P>
    <P>The impact of the ESB proposals, which I outlined earlier, on the price which consumers have to pay for their electricity had been very significant.  This is a matter for continuing representations to me and my colleagues in Government, particularly by industry which fears the effects these high prices will have, ultimately, on their competitiveness and in turn on employment.  I, therefore, welcome the wide-ranging measures in the ESB's strategic plan to contain or reduce costs.</P>
    <P>It was against this background also that an inquiry group of personnel from the Departments of Energy, Finance and Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism with a representative from Irish industry was set up to carry out a detailed review of ESB prices for electricity.  The group is chaired by an independent chairman who is managing director of a major electricity utility in Denmark.  Its main terms of reference are to identify costs which are higher in Ireland compared with other countries, to identify and analyse the reasons for these higher costs and to make recommendations to achieve lower prices in the short and long terms.  The group held its first meeting early in September 1983 and submitted an interim report in November 1983 on those factors which in their view were susceptible to speedy quantification.  The final report of the Inquiry Group will be due in about six to eight weeks.</P>
    <P>The ESB is a fundamental service organisation which brings an essential commodity to industry and society at large.  It is highly thought of in general by the public and regarded as having done an excellent job in the past: its record of achievement stretches from the Shannon scheme of the twenties to the modern gas-fired plant of the eighties, and no element of prejudicial thinking against this State-owned and operated utility lies <Col N="286" /> behind the inquiry to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>The ESB is a very large and pervasive institution; it was recently ranked as Ireland's number one company in an independent survey; it has over one million customers, operates under largely monopoly powers but it has some rival energy marketers; it provides integrated services from fuel input to electricity at the consumer's meter, and is one of the largest and most important borrowing and investment institutions apart from the State itself, borrowing as it does against the credit of the State.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising, therefore, that at regular intervals its operations should come under close external scrutiny because the Government have a clear responsibility to ensure that everything which can reasonably be done to mitigate cost pressures on electricity prices is, in fact, being done.  I am not unmindful that with long lead times on projects such as Moneypoint, major changes on the very volatile energy scene can occur and that phasing for such changes is often not a matter of total freedom.</P>
    <P>The principal elements of cost in an integrated electricity undertaking, such as the ESB, arise from the cost of fuel, the cost of the money used to buy generation plant and distribution lines, and the cost of paying for the employees and the materials they need to do their job. I do not have to remind Senators that fuel costs have outstripped inflation over the past decade, and have dragged inflation upwards.  The fuels used by ESB have significantly increased in price, reaching nearly 50 per cent of the cost of a unit of electricity at one stage before being moderated by the introduction of native natural gas.  In fact, native fuels &mdash; peat, gas and hydropower &mdash; supply most of ESB's fuel requirements at the moment.  The situation will change as the ESB moves to cheaper coal when the Moneypoint stations begin generation.</P>
    <P>It has been the policy of successive Governments to increase the prices charged for native fuels towards an international market level.  Like all policies on sensitive and important matters, it requires careful evaluation.  Certainly, <Col N="287" /> there are two points of view here which are in apparent conflict.  One is that the State should ameliorate the damage caused by high fuel prices by selling the resources it controls at lower than market clearing prices, difficult as that would be to arrive at in certain cases.  The opposite contention is that the Government should not give away the State's natural resources but should secure a fair price for what they sell and that this fair price is struck by as close adherence to the marketplace as possible.  The money obtained is then available to the State for its general expenditure.</P>
    <P>The present policy, as it relates to natural resources of gas and peat, does not immediately require parity with world prices, so that the the shock of abrupt changes in prices is cushioned to some extent for the user.  It tries to adjust the price to world market levels so that the State gets a fair return for depleting and non-renewable resources.  It avoids causing a major swing to one energy source as opposed to another, due to price advantage, unless and until such a long term policy were seen as warranted.  To maintain the prices of native resources at low levels would have two additional disadvantages worth noting.  First, it attracts investment into projects based on the supposition of cheaper than market level energy supplies; as a country which is a large net importer of energy, such projects are inappropriate to our situation.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it divides the benefit which could otherwise be gained from market pricing among classes of users who are not necessarily the most needy or deserving in the community.  It would deprive the Government of that last choice.  We are all, in a sense, conscious of financial pressures on businesses and indeed on family finances.  But this makes it all the more necessary that any benefits which are to be distributed for reasons of social policy should be applied directly, and effectively, to those in most need of assistance.</P>
    <P>In milled peat, we have an indigenous resource, for which successive Governments affirmed it as their policy that it should be developed.  That policy was not and is not determined solely by reference <Col N="288" /> to the competitiveness of peat with all other ESB fuels on an international basis. But I believe the price should be one which puts no unfair burden on the ESB. I believe that an ongoing future can be secured for milled peat use in power generation at a price for Bord na Móna which allows it to carry through its production programme as Government policy requires, always granted an acceptable level of efficiency.</P>
    <P>On the question of a secure future for milled peat use I must say that one of the most unhelpful suggestions made over the past few months was the one claiming that the completion of Moneypoint 3 threatened the viability of milled peat stations.  In fact, at present demand growth rates, after completion of Moneypoint 3, one half of the country's electricity will be fuelled from coal.  Another one-quarter or less will be provided by hydro and by present production levels of milled peat.</P>
    <P>The last quarter must be provided either from gas, imported oil, or further developments which would use coal.  It is not <i>per se</i> the existence of new facilities which would curtail the use of milled peat.  In fact, it was the higher cost of producing electricity from milled peat than from an increase in production at oil-fuelled generating stations which led the ESB in its first proposals to wish to turn away from milled peat in the near term.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the ESB and Bord na Móna have been reviewing the important matters of volume take and prices to be paid for turf supplies.  I am pleased to say that, arising from this review, the prices of turf supplies to ESB power stations have been settled at levels which are fair to Bord na Móna and impose no unfair burden on the ESB.</P>
    <P>In addition, the ESB is also required to enter into a commitment to take an agreed volume of peat each year from Bord na Móna.  This coupled with the new price structure will ensure the future continued operations of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Under the original ESB proposals, the effect on Bord na Móna would have been to pose a serious threat to the continued employment of some 2,500 people.  With <Col N="289" /> the revised arrangements there should not be any significant effect on Bord na Móna employment on the bogs supplying the generating stations involved.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by saying I believe it is in the best interests of the ESB consumers and its suppliers of indigenous fuels for the Government to continue their policy of national assessment of the critical elements in the generation of electricity and that the revised proposals under the ESB's strategic plan which are being implemented will ensure the continued operation of peat fuelled generating stations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister's speech will give much hope to many of the people concerned in Bord na Móna or the ESB.  It is a statement of nothing. In it the Minister tried to avoid the crucial issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The crucial issues at the moment are the jobs of the employees of Bord na Móna, the jobs of the miners of Arigna, which is one of the stations concerned, and the jobs of the people employed by the ESB.  Those are the three elements as far as policy is concerned. The Minister said that no further ESB head office or headquarter development is envisaged before 1990.  If, as we are told, the demand for electricity is static or diminishing the ESB will not need this development before 1990 or before the year 2000.  They are in a reducing market mainly due to their charges and also due to the fact that many industries and industrial users are seeking to use generators for the creation of their own power.  Recently I was in a processing plant where the owner has decided to put in a generator because he cannot afford the charges imposed by the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB have become inefficient. What is proposed for the future development of the ESB will leave them in a more vulnerable position.  We are throwing our supply position totally open to the American coal market.  When we look at the development at Moneypoint <Col N="290" /> we see that we are going into an outside coal market and we are not able to rely on native resources.  At least when we had the turf fired stations and the milled peat stations we supplied our own power and energy.</P>
    <P>When the Moneypoint project was proposed in the mid-seventies the ratio of the dollar was approximately $2.50 to the Irish pound.  Today the ratio is $1.14 to the Irish pound.  The price of American coal to be burned in Moneypoint is now over twice what it was originally expected to be.  No doubt the Minister is well aware of this.  Should we not have developed our natural resources &mdash; gas, coal and turf-burning stations?  We have the Cork plant which is using natural gas. The Minister stated indirectly that this is our cheapest source of electrical power.</P>
    <P>Would it not be more beneficial it we were to develop our natural resources rather than allowing the ESB to continue to develop at Moneypoint which will be a millstone around the necks of the consumers of this nation, the ESB consumers, when we consider the amount of money being put into it and the amount of money proposed to be put into it by the ESB in the years ahead.  We are told by the Government that, due to the number of contracts that have been placed, it is unlikely that they could stop the Moneypoint project if they wished to do so.  I am sure the Minister agrees that is the position.  We are now committed to Moneypoint which means committing ourselves to the international coal market on which we will be forced to buy coal. We know what will happen if a war situation develops anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>Indeed, one of the Minister's predecessors, a member of his own party prior to jumping the fence, in his last days as Minister for Energy, sanctioned the building of a second coal burning power station at Arigna.  I worry when I look at what the Minister said about the 15 Mw coal fired station located at Arigna and supplied by local collieries.  The ESB plan to keep that station in operation as long as no major investment becomes necessary at the generating plant and suitable coal continues to be available from local sources at economic rates.  If anything <Col N="291" /> goes wrong within that power station in the morning it will be closed.  It is obvious from the Minister's speech that the ESB are not committed to putting any money into the development and the improvement of the coal burning station at Arigna.  In a vast change of policy what was proposed approximately two years ago by the then Minister, Deputy O'Leary, a second power station at Arigna, has now been thrown out of the window.</P>
    <P>The number of Bord na Móna employees affected was mentioned.  The Minister did not tell us the number of mining employees who would lose their jobs if Arigna power station were closed.  He probably does not regard that number as being significant enough to affect him or his Government.  I suggest to the Minister that, rather than going ahead with Moneypoint, he should commit the finances proposed to be allocated for the further development of Moneypoint to the development of the second crow coal burning station at Arigna.  In doing so he would safeguard the jobs of 300 miners. He would safeguard the livelihoods of 300 families in that area.  Should the ESB decide that Arigna is no longer a viable proposition and that they will not spend any further money on keeping it open, the ESB employees who live in the area will be forced by the ESB to leave the area.  We have all heard about the depressed areas and about Government commitment to helping less developed areas.  Here is a case where the Government and ESB combined could make a positive contribution towards the development of that area.</P>
    <P>There have been some wild and funny suggestions that the coal from Arigna might be taken down to Moneypoint.  The first suggestion was that it would be taken by road, and the latest suggestion is that it will be taken by sea from Sligo to Moneypoint.  The cost of an exercise like that and the cost of freight would ensure that it would not be a viable proposition for the ESB.  The Minister said the ESB have a programme from 1983 until 1988. That programme is now a year and a half old, which means there are only three and a half years left.  We all know that <Col N="292" /> three and half years is not long in the context of an ESB or any other development. For the building of a power station we are talking in terms of four to five years.</P>
    <P>In other words, the ESB are wasting time preparing documents and surveys and justifying their existence.  If they decided to produce a national energy plan for the next ten years there might be some sense in it, but they are talking in terms of a plan from 1983 to 1988. What changes will be made in the next three and a half years?  They will not be in a position to make any changes.  They may decide that by importing some guru or some great white hope from Denmark to supervise their activites they will be in a position to produce further plans.  From what I can see of this whole exercise and the Minister's statements last week this is a typical election gimmick.  He did not give us a commitment with regard to how many years' life are left in the stations, excluding the stations he mentioned at Allenwood, Galway, west Clare and Portarlington.</P>
    <P>Indeed the Minister for Energy might as well have come out and said that it is the ESB's intention, as was originally planned, to close the 14 stations concerned by the back-door method.  We should ask the Minister and the Government are they going to allow our own natural resources to remain underground and underdeveloped while they import coal and oil to generate power within this country.</P>
    <P>We have heard much about the cost of the production of electricity.  At the moment, in many cases it is costing us twice what it is costing our competitors to produce.  Some of our competitors have not got any natural resources of their own and yet they are still in a position to provide cheaper power for their consumers.  The Minister should look to the development of the turf industry and also, in conjunction with Bord na Móna, he should say to them that where there are problems &mdash; and we are not saying there are not any problems anywhere &mdash; Bord na Móna and the ESB should come together and reach a compromise which will safeguard the jobs not alone of Bord <Col N="293" /> na Móna workers but of the ESB workers also.</P>
    <P>With regard to Moneypoint, I say to the Minister to pull down the shutter on it now before it becomes the biggest monstrosity in this country, before it ensures that ESB costs will be double that of our competitors.  Let us remember that all this is creating problems for our industries because they are non-competitive as far as our competitors in foreign markets are concerned.</P>
    <P>The ESB, has not been and is not, in my opinion, committed to the development of our natural resources.  It would be very simple for the ESB to have a large generating station at Moneypoint, with just one station to look after to serve this country.  As I said at the start, the statement by the Minister offers nothing to the people threatened by the closure of the power stations and the Bord na Móna workers.  Indeed, we see in the Ministers' statement that the final report of the inquiry group will be out in about eight weeks.  By that time, the by-elections will be well over.  It will be a nice time in the summer recess to tell us that the inquiry said that the power stations concerned should be closed and that we should develop Moneypoint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion in the names of the Fianna Fáil Senators. Never in the history of this country was there such need to put into effect the demands outlined in this motion, that the Government in their national energy policy would give priority to indigenous fuel in the midlands and the west to ensure that the ESB's peat fuel stations are kept fully operative and reject any proposal to close in whole or in part 14 power stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To contemplate any closure at this point would be an act of criminal lunacy by our Government and will not be tolerated by the Bord na Móna workforce or indeed by anybody interested in the development of our natural resources.  At a time when there are approximately 220,000 people unemployed in our country, creating as they do such serious demands on the Exchequer to pay the <Col N="294" /> social benefits they are entitled to, surely the Government should be seen to encourage the creation of employment in our bogs rather than impeding progress therein as they have been doing for the past 12 months under the guise of feasibility studies which were being carried out.</P>
    <P>It is five years today since the Ballyforan project was first approved by the then Fianna Fáil Government with the prospect of a massive economic boom for that area.  A massive amount of money, reputed to be in the region of £20 million, has been spent in preparing the site for the proposed briquette factory, purchasing machinery, development of the bogs and so on.  Because of the Government decision to defer the Ballyforan project, the jobs of 155 workers are put in jeopardy and another 300 to 400 jobs have been lost in an area that could truthfully be described as severely disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The social implication of this decision is frightening.  What is the future now for the young families who have got mortgages to build their houses in the locality on the strength of the jobs being created at Derryfadda works?  Can those young people have any faith in a Government that would put their future in jeopardy and create so many social problems for them by deferring the commencement of work on this project?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Connaughton, Deputy Naughten and Senator Connor at a recent meeting in Ballyforan stated publicly that the final decision would be made by the Government. There is no point now in blaming Bord na Móna.  I am sure those three representatives made a strong case on behalf of Ballyforan but it seems to me the present Government are so biased against the west that they are not prepared to listen to any reasoned argument for the development of the west.</P>
    <P>In the review carried out by the Government I wonder if they considered the loss to the Exchequer of PRSI and the PAYE payments by the workforce at Derryfadda and added those to the huge amount of social welfare payments due <Col N="295" /> to those workers on the termination of their employment?  If they did I imagine they would find justification for proceeding with the completion of the briquette factory.</P>
    <P>If the Government cannot see any justification for developing our bogs and creating jobs, how then can they hope to attract foreign industrialists and justify the grants and other concessions being offered to those people?  Even if the Government had to subsidise Bord na Móna they were better doing that in the long-term because they were giving valuable employment.  They were developing <Col N="296" /> our bogs and giving hope to a community that had been deprived for generations because of their geographical situation.  The present Government stand condemned by the people of the west because of their failure to develop the natural resources of the west, namely, our bogs and their failure to complete the building of the briquette factory at Ballyforan, a project to which this party had committed themselves and will most certainly proceed with on return to Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, I should like to allow some of my time to Senator Lynch who is concerned with this matter and who has close associations with Kingscourt.</P>
      <P>First of all, I want to say that Gypsum Industries Limited is one of the big success stories of Irish industry, having started in 1936 with ten men and less than 10,000 tons of quarried rock, to 500 employees this year and 380,000 tons of rock processed.</P>
      <P>Foreign imports of plasterboard are a serious threat to GIL employment.  If, for example, imports gain 20 per cent of the Irish market, at least 200 jobs at GIL could be put at risk.</P>
      <P>The present threat comes mainly from Spain, with French and East German board currently in the background. Ireland has the highest <i>per capita</i> consumption of plasterboard in western Europe, Spain among the lowest.  The Spanish domestic market's annual demand is 2,500,000 square metres.  The Epysa factory in Spain has a capacity of around 12,000,000 square metres.  The Epysa factory is owned by Lafarge of France, National Gypsum of USA, and Uralita, a Spanish company.</P>
      <P>The Spanish Government operate a subsidy system to encourage exports. This amounts to just under 10 per cent of full value, including agents' fees.  Spain also maintains import duties of 24 per cent approx. to protect its home market from any counter-trading.</P>
      <P>Epysa is represented in Ireland by the Iberian Trading Company, whose principal is Senor Vincente Alonso Vicedo. This man has also been involved in other business ventures in Ireland.  The company deals in a range of products, including imported chipboard, hardboard and bricks.  These come in through Wicklow harbour on a regular shipping run from Spain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Spaniards have adopted a price cutting technique for penetrating the Irish domestic market in plasterboard. <Col N="298" /> Their current offer is GIL's list price less 15 per cent, plus one-quarter of all plasterboard purchased free.  This is an effective discount of 40 per cent on GIL's list price.</P>
    <P>The Spaniards have also adopted other tactics.  When the board was first introduced into Ireland, it was bound with yellow tape and prominently displayed the maker's name and country of origin. Now the Spanish board is being sold unmarked with a green stripe and a plain tape.  No manufacturer's name or country of origin is specified and, in that context, the green stripe is particularly effective.</P>
    <P>Information that Iberian Trading's representatives are making this offer has been confirmed by individual merchants throughout the Republic, including the following areas: Dublin city; Dublin county; Cork; Galway; Wexford; Clare; Kerry; Limerick; Laois; Carlow and Kilkenny.  The same information has been received from trading organisations representing 46 builders' providers in 20 counties.  Some have already purchased Spanish board, others are thinking about it.  In a shrinking, recession-hit market, merchants are vulnerable to such tactics.</P>
    <P>GIL board is subject to price control and all increases for the last five years have been approved by the Prices Commission as fully justified against rising costs.  GIL is the sole manufacturer of plasterboard on this island, and has been primarily responsible for the development of the large-scale usage of gypsum products in Ireland.  However, despite energy and electricity prices significantly higher than in the rest of Europe, gyptex board is not expensive when compared with the prices currently obtaining in other European countries.  For example, the domestic prices in sterling equivalent per 100 square metres apply to the following countries: Germany, 97.68; Holland, 93.15; France, 88.60; UK, 89.59; Republic of Ireland, 91.82; Spain, 85.30; Spanish board on offer in Ireland 61.21.</P>
    <P>The Spanish domestic price is slightly cheaper than average European price levels.  This may be due to the artificial nature of the Epysa plant, with its mainly export orientation.  For example, a low Spanish domestic price could considerably <Col N="299" /> complicate any claims of dumping against that country.  However, from the forementioned table it can be seen that the Spanish board on offer in Dublin is a full 30 per cent cheaper than the equivalent Spanish domestic price.  This, by the EEC definition, is dumping.</P>
    <P>GIL has invested millions of pounds in equipment in the last decade, and currently intends to maintain this programme. Planning permission is being sought for a new open cast mine, which should guarantee gypsum reserves beyond the end of the century.  Other major multi-million pound investments are currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>The real nub of the matter is that the Republic of Ireland has home demand which, for many industries, roughly equates to the output of one medium-sized, efficient, manufacturing plant.</P>
    <P>Due to the deepening recession in the Republic, the situation is now finely balanced but, currently, GIL can still maintain a three-shift, five-day week, with full employment for its labour force at optimum efficiency levels, by supplying the Republic's domestic market and exporting to the North.  Therefore it can be seen that even a small erosion in market share could lead to reductions in manpower and/or shifts.  There would be a corresponding rise in production unit costs, and this would reduce export competitiveness, with consequent fall in sales, leading to further lay-offs, and so on.  This spiral is difficult to reverse once in motion and would almost certainly have an adverse effect on future investment intentions.</P>
    <P>The home market holds the key to competitiveness and, therefore, to a stable and properous future for any company. Gypsum supplies the cement industries north and south of the Border.  The dumping to which I have referred is well orchestrated and not a haphazard approach.</P>
    <P>There is a serious danger that the price structure will be destabilised, which would result in a serious loss of employment.  In one year Gypsum Industries Limited pay approximately £1 million for electricity, £2.4 million for PRSI &amp; PAYE, and <Col N="300" /> a further £6.4 million in wages.  Gypsum Industries are concerned with this situation. They ask for, and are entitled to, parity and fair play, but to get this it is vital that the Government would act in this matter and act now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Fitzsimons in supporting this motion.  I am more than delighted and appreciate very much that a Minister from our own constituency, Deputy Bruton, has come in to listen to our discussion here and I am more than hopeful that he will be able to help in this regard.  Gypsum Industries Limited, Kingscourt, have a problem at the moment because of dumping of plaster products which is a serious threat to the 500 workers who are employed on a regular basis there.  I know that the Minister, more than anybody else here, appreciates the tremendous effect that Gypsum Industries have especially in the north Meath area as well as Cavan.  Kilmainham Wood, Carrigleck and Nobber have made tremendous progress over the years due to the fact that many families who might have had to work in Dublin or emigrate have stayed at home and secured permanent pensionable employment with Gypsum Industries.  They have, with the aid of State grants, built their own homes and there has been a tremendous amount of building of new houses and development in that area, all due to the fact that good steady employment was available through the good offices of Gypsum Industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time of recession, especially in the building industry, positive action should be taken to try to help Gypsum Industries. I know that we had a similar problem which raised its ugly head in 1982 with the dumping of cement on the Irish market and to a great extent that problem has been alleviated.  GIL have made tremendous progress since they started in 1936 and steady employment has been given to people in north east Cavan and north Meath.  They are the only large industry in that area; other industries are comparatively very small.  Industrial development as we know it in other areas in this country did not expand to any degree in the north Meath-north east <Col N="301" /> Cavan area or in Kingscourt but Gypsum Industries have provided a sense of security for the people in that area.  Coupled with that, the industrial relations in GIL and the quality of the product produced there are not just on a par with but far exceed anything here or in any other country.  We are very concerned that large scale dumping is taking place, and we are afraid that if it escalates it will lead to many redundancies and a fall off in the balance of payments.  The repercussions, as I am sure the Minister is aware, will be catastrophic for north Meath and Cavan.  I appeal to the Minister to accede to a request to do whatever he can, and I am more than hopeful that he will do so.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to have this opportunity to speak on the first occasion in this Seanad on a motion raised by my two county men in regard to a matter about which I share their concern.  I am well aware of the very high level of employment which is given by Gypsum Industries in the north Meath area, which would be in many ways an economic and social desert were it not for the very major injection to the economy made by the employment in the mines.  I am very alert to anything which could adversely affect Gypsum.  I met the managing director and a number of directors in the company quite recently to discuss the subject that the two Senators have raised.  I gave them certain advice as to how to proceed and indicated to them how I would hope to co-operate with them in achieving our joint objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Senators would not expect me to go into great detail on what is clearly a matter of commercial secrecy to some extent.  However, I can say that the possibility of initiating remedial action against people who are dumping in the Irish market no longer rests with the Irish authorities.  Since 1973, when we entered the EEC, we undertook to allow these matters to be dealt with by the European Community authorities rather than by our own national Government. <Col N="302" /> This clearly restrains the unilateral action that I could take.</P>
    <P>A number of complaints have been made about how the firm referred to by the Senators is able to achieve their price reductions.  Reference is made, for instance, to the system of taxation applying in Spain in regard to exports and imports, and the suggestion is made that this system would not survive in the EEC where fair trading is a basic principle. However, the procedures which would have to be undertaken to bring this to an end are quite cumbersome, and Spain is already engaged in negotiations with us with a view to becoming a member of the EEC.  It is probable that by the time those procedures would be concluded Spain would have to have got rid of these provisions anyway.  One would not be able to achieve anything that would not happen anyway.  There is also the fact that in practice anti-dumping measures have tended to be taken only where it is felt that the entire Community market is the subject of dumping rather than the idea of one region within the Community as a whole being subject to dumping.  Clearly, this idea of having to require the entire market to be the subject of dumping rather than part of it makes a lot of sense when one is talking about the possibility of dumping, say, in Belgium.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to envisage someone dumping in Belgium and not dumping in the Netherlands or Luxembourg as well. Unfortunately this rule tends to operate a bit to the disadvantage of a country like Ireland which is essentially an isolated and discrete market.  It is possible for dumping to take place in Ireland without any flow-over effects into Britain or the continent of Europe.  This practice tends to restrict anti-dumping measures dealing with dumping that is affecting the Community as a whole rather than a regional market, and could operate to the disadvantage of a country like Ireland.  These are the obstacles that we face in getting the Community to take action against any dumping that there might be into the Irish market, if indeed this is dumping. Until procedures have been gone through we cannot prejudge this case and I would not wish to do so.  However, I would like <Col N="303" /> to assure the Senators that I am very interested in the matter.  I have met the directors concerned and I have indicated to them that I will do everything in my power to assist them.  I expect that they will be in touch with me in the next week or so on my invitation on the occasion of my last meeting with them to see what further action can be taken.  At the moment I am awaiting a response from them rather than the other way around.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons made a very interesting speech and, obviously, had given a great deal of preparation and thought to what he had to say.  In a way, it is regrettable that he should have mentioned the name of any individual.  I feel <Col N="304" /> there is some question of propriety here in regard to naming individuals in any context.  However, I think it is a matter for the Seanad to decide what practices they should have in this regard, but I think it is better not to name individuals in this context, however one may feel about the effects of what they are doing. I am concerned about the matter and I am keeping closely in touch with it.  I am awaiting further submissions from them and will be taking the matter from there.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 June 1984.</P>
