      <P>I have notice from Senator John Ellis that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The position with regard to the questioning of people at Monaghan Garda station under the Offences Against the State Act and also the method of house searching being adopted by the Garda in County Leitrim in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>I would like to confirm that as the business is planned at the moment it is proposed to take item No. 6 &mdash; the motion on the EEC &mdash; next week.  Senators will note that the motion has been redrafted in order to cover the whole of 1983.  I have done this because there has been a continued delay in regard to the 22nd Report.  That report is now with the printers.  It is hoped that it will come back fairly quickly from the printers and be very quickly approved by the Government.  But in case the report does not become available I have put the motion in this form which, any way, would be what the Seanad would debate if we were debating the original motion.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second point about whether the motion would be concluded next week, this motion is not a Private Member's motion; it is a Government motion and therefore there is no limitation on the length of speeches or on the length of debate.  My own feeling would be that it would be the wish of the House that this should be a substantial debate and, accordingly, I would not anticipate that it would be finished on the next sitting day.  Certainly I do not want to do anything to limit Senators in regard to the discussion of this important matter.</P>

    <Title>Joint Committee on Building Land: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the orders of reference of the Joint Committee on Building Land constituted pursuant to the Order of Dáil Éireann of 3rd March, 1983 and the Order of Seanad Éireann of 9th March, 1983, be amended as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The insertion in paragraph (2) after &lsquo;records&rsquo; of the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" />&lsquo;and, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, the Joint Committee shall have power to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House, we made that decision on 1 February following consideration of written submissions and many discussions that we had with various interested bodies.  The committee were greatly influenced in their decision to seek this extension to Standing Orders by the complexity of the written submissions received from many professional and technical bodies having an interest in building land.</P>
    <P>For the record of the House, the committee have received 63 separate submissions. The members of the committee do not consider that they possess the expertise necessary to sift and evaluate correctly the massive amount of technical material before them, given that the committee wish to produce a detailed and properly thought-out report.</P>
    <P>In the interests of bringing a proper level of skill and expertise to the consideration of the policy options open to them, the committee decided that outside assistance of a technical and specialised nature would be required.  In making this decision to request specialist assistance the committee were aware of the commitment given by the former Minister, Deputy Raphael Burke, in July 1982 &mdash; and endorsed by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment &mdash; that the services of all Departments would be available to the committee. The committee wish to acknowledge the generous assistance and co-operation they have received at all times from the Department of the Environment.  Nevertheless, the committee are concerned to maintain their independence of thought and action in the matter and have concluded that it would serve the best interests of the orders of reference if they were capable of drawing, when necessary, on a wide range of specialist, technical and professional expertise.</P>
    <P>Therefore, at a meeting of the committee on 8 February, they decided they <Col N="198" /> should seek the services, on a part-time basis, of An Foras Forbartha, a specialist public agency with expertise in the area of building land, to assist the committee in the examination and evaluation of the documentation submitted to them and to assist in the completion of their final report.  An Foras Forbartha have indicated informally to the committee that they would be pleased and willing to assist them in this matter.</P>
    <P>The question of cost has not yet been examined in detail but there is provision already, in the Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas, under the subhead for Expenditure on Consultancy Services for Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is on that basis that the committee are seeking the permission of this House for the addition to their terms of reference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion proposed by Senator Ferris.  As a member of that committee it has become painfully obvious to me that we require the services of specialist or technical personnel. Looking back, one could argue that perhaps we should have done it at the beginning. But we did not and now it is required.  It is right and proper that we agree to the motion proposed by Senator Ferris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that the committee should be afforded the expertise that they have requested in amending their terms of reference to include the possibility of looking for this specialist help.  Apart from the kind of expertise to which Senator Ferris has referred &mdash; the assistance of An Foras Forbartha &mdash; it is clear that this important committee, on the control of building land, will also have to tackle very difficult and indeed fundamental constitutional and legal problems. I was concerned some time ago to read a report in the media of an attempt by the committee to obtain the full opinion which the Attorney General had submitted to the Government on this issue. It appears that the opinion, in full, was not available to the committee.  I wondered whether, in looking for the additional expertise, the committee had considered <Col N="199" /> the possibility of obtaining further legal expertise for the committee. I say that because, apart from the opinion of the Attorney General on an issue such as this &mdash; which would obviously carry very real weight &mdash; it is such a difficult and complex issue, one which is not just a straightforward legal issue, it has also social implications and it is an area where legal opinions can differ, where there can be different views as to what the constitutional position would be.  I would have thought that just as the committee, quite properly, require expert assistance in the technical areas to examine, understand and develop their thinking in the light of the submissions made to them, they should also have the capacity to look for the necessary legal expertise and to seek, if necessary, for the committee itself, its own opinion from senior counsel on the constitutional legal issues which arise.  I should like to know, first of all, whether that has been considered and if that is intended to be furthered by this motion.</P>
      <P>The other question I wished to ask is whether there is any danger that the need for this expertise will delay the report of the committee.  The time for submitting the report has been extended &mdash; we extended it quite recently.  Because of the gravity and importance of the subject matter, and the urgent necessity to control building land, it is vital that the committee act now within the time which has been further granted to them and that there be no further delay.  I should like clarification of that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Senator Robinson's last point first.  Particularly because of the time constraint on this committee they saw the necessity for having their terms of reference extended so that they could make the fullest use of the expertise that would be necessary to try to comply with the derogation of time that this House gave them to submit their report. It is for that very reason that we are looking for this technical assistance from An Foras Forbartha.  The actual wording used in extending their terms of reference does not, in fact, rule out the committee &mdash; if they decide by consensus that they <Col N="200" /> need any other specialist or professional expertise &mdash; from availing of such even if it is of a legal nature.</P>
      <P>I did say in my earlier remarks that we acknowledged already the generous assistance and co-operation we have received from the Department of the Environment.  I want to put it on record that they have made legal opinion available to the committee.  If the committee feel that they require any other legal opinion, naturally that would be a matter for them.  This extension of their terms of reference would not rule out legal expertise as well as technical expertise.  As a committee we have requested certain opinions from the Attorney General.  We recognise that his brief is to advise the Government and not sub-committees or Joint Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We feel that these revised terms of reference will give us the permission of this House to seek such legal opinions if so required.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Dairy Produce (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 1984    [Certified Money Bill]:    Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for the amendment and extension of the Dairy Produce (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1973.  Essentially, the Bill involves the continuance of the guarantee which, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, I may give in respect of loans obtained by An Bord Bainne Co-operative Ltd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Bord Bainne Co-operative Ltd. was established by the Irish dairy industry in 1972 and took over from the semi-State body, An Bord Bainne.  The essential purpose of the board is the purchase and centralised marketing of dairy products produced by its members.  Due to the seasonality of the production of milk and dairy products in Ireland and the fact that sales by the board are effected on a fairly <Col N="201" /> even pattern throughout the year, it is obliged to borrow heavily to enable it to purchase its members' production during the peak production period.  The board's assets &mdash; in spite of the fact that they have shown commendable growth in recent years &mdash; are not yet sufficient to enable it to borrow to the very substantial extent necessary and it was to assist the board in borrowing that the State guarantee was provided by the 1973 Act and enlarged and extended in 1976, 1977 and 1979.</P>
    <P>The initial State guarantee in 1973 provided coverage for borrowings by the board up to a maximum at any one time of £20 million.  This figure was increased to £40 million in 1976 and to £90 million in 1979.  The purpose of the Bill before the House is to extend the application of the guarantee &mdash; which, in fact, expired at the end of last year &mdash; for a six-year period to 31 December 1989 and to broaden the guarantee's scope to cover a range of borrowings, thereby bringing it more into line with the actual pattern of Bord Bainne's credit needs.  Previously, the guarantee covered only &ldquo;loans&rdquo;, as strictly defined and it is felt that the amendment proposed now will increase the flexibility and usefulness of the guarantee to the board.  Also, the additional six years will afford the board a reasonable opportunity to accelerate the build-up of its own resources and so become less reliant on State backing for a proportion of its borrowings.  The maximum amount of the guarantee is to be retained at the level of £90 million.</P>
    <P>The dairy industry is the backbone of much of our agricultural industry.  Its continued expansion is of immense importance for the economic and social development of our country, but its continued prosperity is greatly dependent on maximising efficiency in processing and marketing. Centralised marketing of dairy products has a major role to play by enabling us to develop and exploit markets in a planned and economical way and by earning and maintaining an internationally respected position for Irish dairy products.</P>
    <P>Since we joined the Community Irish milk deliveries have increased by about <Col N="202" /> 72 per cent.  The value of the milk intake of creameries and other processing plants has increased by almost 100 per cent in the same period.  Marketing this extra production has, of course, been a major task and one which has been accomplished with success and, until recently, little reliance on intervention.  That this is so, is an indication of the role played by Bord Bainne which has successfully sold an expanding range of Irish dairy products in an increasing number of international markets.  By 1982 the total value of Irish dairy exports was £710 million per year, or about 12 per cent of the value of all our exports.</P>
    <P>We are at present facing an extremely difficult situation both within the EEC itself and in the international market place.  We face proposals from Brussels aimed at restricting Community milk production to the 1981 levels and at reducing the cost for the Community budget of support for the milk sector.  These proposals will continue to be the subject of negotiation in the Council of Ministers in the coming weeks, as will the Commission's parallel farm price proposals for the 1984-85 season.  For milk, while formally a freeze has been proposed, related technical changes would in fact result in a price reduction.  The Government are not under any illusion that the task facing us will be an easy one but we are fully determined to secure agreement for arrangements which are fair and balanced and which take due account of our special situation in regard to milk.</P>
    <P>Our primary objective is to ensure that our dairy industry can face the future with confidence.  But it is obvious that now more than ever before, efficiency in production, processing and marketing will be of crucial importance to us. Indeed if we ever could afford the luxury of running our dairy industry at less than optimum efficiency we certainly cannot afford it from now on.  The central importance of dairying to the agricultural industry in Ireland and to the national economy as a whole is understood now as never before.  All who work in its must do their utmost to see that we maximise the contribution it can make to our overall prosperity.  Bord Bainne's pivotal role <Col N="203" /> in all this involves an increasing challenge in the future.</P>
    <P>It is now clearly essential that we make an all-out effort to reduce our present heavy dependence upon intervention. Because of the limited size of our domestic market and increasingly difficult trading conditions in our major traditional market, the United Kingdom, this means that henceforth we must make more efforts than we have ever made before to sell competitively on other markets.  Of course, this will call for diversification, for greater effort by the co-operative societies to develop new products and new processes and not to be over-reliant on traditional products, such as butter, cheddar, milk powder and so on.  We will really have to take on the French and the others at their own game.</P>
    <P>Not alone must we increase sales of existing products in present and new markets, we must also develop new products and identify new market opportunities. New product development is, however, a slow and expensive process requiring heavy investment over a long number of years.  Yet if we are to market successfully our anticipated increasing milk output in the years ahead, product development and diversification are areas in which we cannot afford not to get involved.  I am greatly heartened that Bord Bainne have definite proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>In extending the State guarantee as now proposed, we shall be giving tangible support to the board and recognition that the board's ability to obtain the finance necessary for their operations, as easily and economically as possible, is clearly of vital importance.  As I have already stated, the backing of a State guarantee is still necessary for the present if the board are to discharge their essential function in the best and most efficient way.  Hence, my proposal to extend the guarantee for six years and to make it more responsive to the board's actual borrowing needs.</P>
    <P>The existence of the State guarantee has up to the present enabled An Bord Bainne Co-operative Limited to obtain adequate borrowing facilities to meet their funding requirements.  No claims <Col N="204" /> have ever been made under the State guarantee and no question of expenditure by the Exchequer has arisen up to now.  Neither is any such claim likely to arise in the future.  The present Bill, therefore, affords the House a timely opportunity to demonstrate our confidence both in An Bord Bainne and in the future success of Irish dairying.</P>
    <P>Here I should like to endorse that point and to make the observation that this Bill is in itself a formal vote of confidence by the Government in the Irish dairy industry. I have also to make the point that I would regard Bord Bainne as a household name in Ireland today.  We must remember the people who had the courage and willingness to come together at that time, submerging their personal and localised co-operative interests, even foregoing some marketing opportunities in order to be able to face the market place with the sort of large quantities of a product then required in the market place.  That took a lot of courage and foresight on the part of people at that time and I do not think we should forget that.  Bord Bainne were one of our great success stories.  Around the world today the name &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; is synonomous with Irish dairy produce, a high quality dairy produce.  That is why I am so happy to be introducing this Bill today for the House's approval.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend politicians of all shades of opinion for their support of the Government on matters relating to the super-levy.  Our recent debate in the Dáil was very heartening.  As I said in the Dáil, if we seem to be wrangling amongst ourselves about the terms of reference for the super-levy then we are making a case against the country in Brussels.  It should be remembered that the media reports are received in Brussels on the same evening.  If we seem to be hesitant, if we are not of one strong voice then we are weakening our case.  Our case is simple and straightforward.  We accept that there is a problem of over-supply.  We are worried about that.  We are concerned about efficiency.  The fiscal problems of the Community are also our problems, but at the same time we claim that we were not the country that caused these <Col N="205" /> problems and that we will contribute to their solution to the same degree.  As our contribution to their creation has been minimal so we contend that our contribution to their solution should be minimal.</P>
    <P>I will leave it at that because it does not relate directly to what I am saying. Nevertheless it is important that that should be said and repeated because I have heard some Senators from the Fianna Fáil benches speak in public on the super-levy and I thank them and, indeed, members of the Labour Party and Independents for supporting the Government on this issue.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I trust Senators will readily approve of its terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill.  It is very necessary and it is only right that Bord Bainne should get the borrowing power necessary to enable them to carry out the work they have been doing over the years in promoting the sale of our dairy products on the world market.  They have certainly done a very good job. They have advanced the cause of Ireland in many new markets.  They have helped our farmers to get a better price for their milk, butter and cheese.  I certainly hope they will continue in these difficult times to expand on those markets and to find new markets and new ways of diversifying and selling those products on the world market.  We on this side of the House support the Minister in his appeal today for an extension of this guarantee facility which is normal practice.</P>
      <P>There is only one matter I would like to question.  When replying, perhaps the Minister would elaborate somewhat on it.  In his introductory remarks the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill before the House is to extend the application of the guarantee &mdash; which, in fact, expired at the end of last year &mdash; for a six-year period to 31 December 1989 and to broaden the guarantee's scope...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am wondering what the Minister has in mind there?  Is this a departure from the traditional facility given to An Bord <Col N="206" /> Bainne?  Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us when replying.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, it is very important that we have agencies like Bord Bainne to promote our dairy products.  If you like, Bord Bainne have been one of the bright lights in the Irish export scene and have successfully pioneered the sale of Irish dairy products in many parts of the world.  At present we have 1,000 million gallons of milk for processing each year.  That figure clearly illustrates the need for diversification. There are no longer markets for the traditional products.  We all know that the sales of butter are declining somewhat. People are being advised that butter is bad for them.  Perhaps we could counteract that claim because there is no proof to substantiate it.  I know that people trying to sell margarine and other products will tell one that butter is bad for one, that there is too much fat in it. Perhaps the Department or Bord Bainne could undertake some kind of research into that matter.  We were told some years ago that potatoes were bad for us. Yet that was contradicted recently by an expert who told us that potatoes are definitely not bad for us.  Therefore, perhaps the same is the case with butter.</P>
    <P>Over 80 per cent of all milk going into creameries is converted into butter.  Bord Bainne cannot find outlets for all that butter so eventually it ends up in intervention. That is a pity and should not be the situation.</P>
    <P>Another commodity of which we have a surplus is skim milk powder.  I understand there are about one million tonnes of it in intervention at present and the Community are finding it very difficult to get rid of it.  Bord Bainne's initiative in promoting research and development is to be commended.  Where we have a surplus product it is important to find out what the consumers want and then to deliver the goods.  As far as I am aware, no effort has been made to promote the use of milk.  Even the school milk programme has been a failure because co-operation was not sought from the school authorities or the Department of Education.  In many cases <Col N="207" /> the milk was allowed to go sour before being used.  Surely it should be possible to find a flavour that would be acceptable to children and produce a product accordingly.  We all know that if it was coke or orange that was being provided all of it would be consumed and there would be very little wastage.  Many children do not like the taste of raw milk but if it were flavoured they would drink it. Surely it should be possible for our dairies to produce an acceptable product.  In a small way this would show that we were making an effort to reduce our milk and butter surpluses.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that we import in the region of £40 million worth of dairy products each year into a country that has everything going for it as far as climatic conditions, quality of soil and so on are concerned, for the production of those items.  We know that individual dairies in this country have made great progress as far as diversification is concerned. They did their research and found very remunerative products &mdash; cream liqueurs is one of those products &mdash;&mdash; that have made an impact on the world market.  Cheese has been another such product.  There are many kinds of cheese and they are selling very well in the foreign markets but I think the liqueur is probably one of the items that has hit the headlines in many parts of the world.  The processors who manufacture those products are to be praised and commended for the contribution they are making to our dairy industry.</P>
    <P>It is things like this that we need to look for because we can see the problems that are created in Europe at present because of the over-supply of milk and butter.  We know we are only contributing in a very small way to that butter mountain but nevertheless as we are part of the European Economic Community we must accept our share of responsibility. Even though our contributions to the butter and milk mountains have been minimal, nevertheless when the cutbacks come they are bound to affect us in the same way as the big countries who are actually creating the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department officials <Col N="208" /> should be fighting those factory farms &mdash; if you like to call them that &mdash; that are producing huge quantities of milk and butter.  The people who feed their cattle cheaply on tapioca, soya beans and so on are the people who are really responsible for the huge milk mountain that is creating the problem for us at present.  The Minister and his officials should avail of every opportunity to highlight that fact.  We are only a very small country.  Dairying is a very important source of income for our farmers and I think nobody knows that better than the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, who comes from a dairying county. Indeed, years ago before we had any talk about the problem of the EEC, Cork was envied, particularly in the west of Ireland, because of the fine dairy herds they had and their high output of milk.  I know the Minister certainly realises the problems that are facing this industry now.</P>
    <P>It is particularly sad for us in the west because we had hoped that the dairy industry would continue to expand.  In the small fragmented farms we have in the west the income from the creamery was very valuable.  We were really only at the beginning.  We did not have the same expertise, we did not have the same advantage that our counterparts in the midlands or southern parts of Ireland had, and it was only in the last few years that we were really beginning to develop the industry in the west.  It is unfortunate that at a time when we thought we were going to make some progress there should be so much talk about the imposition of a super-levy that is going to cripple not just the individual farmers but the whole country.  I hope the Government will fight this to the bitter end.  Even if it is necessary to use the power of veto in the EEC, that should be done because of the importance of the dairy industry to our country.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said this afternoon that this was a time when we should not be hesitant and I certainly agree with him.  However, at the beginning the Minister for Agriculture gave the impression to our farmers that he was a little hesitant and that he was frightened to go in and <Col N="209" /> fight the case for the Irish farmers.  It was unfortunate that he gave that impression. Perhaps it was because he was new at the negotiating table: he had many, many problems to surmount and he was dealing with experienced negotiators, but the Minister was assured at all times that he had not just the support of the other political parties but also the support of every farmer.  Unfortunately, it only became obvious late in the day that this was of interest not only to the farmers but also to industry because when one looks at the number of jobs involved in the dairy industry one realises the significant contribution it makes to the national economy.  For that reason it is important, not just for farmers and for agriculture, but also for industry and business, that this super-levy be opposed and that it be defeated.  Certainly as far as we on this side of the House are concerned we will support any effort the Minister makes to get rid of it and that includes the veto which he has the power to use if he thinks it necessary.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill.  I hope Bord Bainne will continue to flourish, that they will continue to explore the markets that are available to this country and continue to sell our products.  I appeal to our processors and our dairies to explore the possibility of diversification.  Traditional products may not be selling as well as they did and for that reason it is important that our dairies spend some money on research into the possibilities of developing new products.  If they do that they will be able to sell them.  Bord Bainne are an excellent agency who established themselves on the world markets and will continue to support and help the dairy industry in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the Bill, which I very gladly do, I would like to commence by asking people to reflect on the performance of Bord Bainne, not alone from the time they became a co-operative society in 1972 in accordance with legislation of the EEC and as required by the EEC at that time, but right from their very beginning.  Bord Bainne have a track record and a performance that stands up extremely well <Col N="210" /> in comparative terms or on any other terms.  In fact, their performance has been quite unique as a marketing board at all stages and it is only in relatively recent times that they had to resort to the use of intervention as a means of disposal of surplus stocks.  In other words, they have consistently and very determinedly and on a very planned basis gone into the market place and sold their products there at good prices.  Right through the board's existence from the early sixties they deserve the fullest praise and support that can be given to them.  It is true to say that things have changed and unfortunately the board have to resort to intervention for butter and skimmed powder.  That is one of the harsh realities at present.</P>
      <P>We are talking about the dairy industry which represents approximately 9 per cent of our gross national product.  That is a very substantial percentage.  Our support of this Bill &mdash; I am glad to see the Bill getting support from the other side of the House &mdash; is a firm indication that we believe Bord Bainne have done valuable work over the years.  Our support for this Bill, which proposes that £90 million be underwritten for the next six years until 1990, shows that we believe and have confidence in the board and in those who operate and run the board's affairs.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that centralised marketing is a very essential ingredient for this country and this applies to agriculture and to other areas of production. We have had it in the dairying sector to great advantage.  Perhaps we could benefit a great deal if we could centralise marketing in the area of beef and other areas as well; otherwise there will be a lot of fragmentation and duplication where efforts are not harnessed in the best possible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the problems created for Bord Bainne by the seasonal nature of the production of milk in this country.  Unfortunately, a very high percentage of the milk in this country is produced from February until November or December and then we have a very slack period for a few months.  In fact, approximately 25 per cent of cows do not <Col N="211" /> commence lactation until after 1 April and if these cows commenced their lactation on 1 February we would have approximately 60 million gallons more. One might say that this is only adding to our surplus but I emphatically stress that while our present level of production is approximately 1,000 million gallons we could have a considerably higher figure than that in order to make the best use of our processing facilities which at the moment are totally and utterly underutilised. We have excess facilities in most of our major processing plants at present and we have a situation where we do not have enough milk for the other facilities available.  We must strive for a situation that will enable us to have more milk and make certain that we can maximise on the facilities that are there and add to them as far as possible.</P>
    <P>In 1972 the present organisation became a co-operative society, as I indicated earlier, in accordance with EEC legislation and I believe that since that time they have done an extremely good job.  In 1973 &mdash; and reference was made by the Minister to this &mdash; there was a guarantee of £20 million to Bord Bainne and that, in fact, was increased in 1976 to £40 million.  In 1979 that figure was adjusted to £90 million and today the proposal from the Minister is that we reaffirm this £90 million to the board or underwrite it for the next six years until 1990.</P>
    <P>We should realise that we have had a very significant increase in milk production since becoming a member of the EEC.  We have had in excess of a 70 per cent increase in milk deliveries and in some instances we had over a 100 per cent increase in the intake of milk at many of our manufacturing points.  While being a very welcome development, it has led to major problems in the disposal of milk and milk products.  For a number of years we have traditionally relied on butter and skim milk powder, products which are complementary to each other, for the utilisation of our milk. We now clearly see a situation where we have to diversify very significantly.  There is no way that we can continue producing <Col N="212" /> butter and skim powder at the current level.  Emphasis must be put a great deal more on the non-fat and non-skim milk powder products.</P>
    <P>It is not often realised that 87 per cent of milk is made up of water so it is a question of our making the best use of the 12 or 13 per cent of solids in the milk. We have to explore every avenue to make certain that we produce what the consumer wants.  There is no point in our continuing to produce something and trying to sell it.  One mistake we have made in our whole marketing scene up to now has been that we have produced goods of one sort or another, we have gone into the market place and we have expected the consumers to buy those goods.  As I have stated previously, it is essential that we do an in-depth examination into what the consumer requires and that we go back from the consumer, through the marketing processing stages right down to the production line at farmer level, and make certain we produce what the consumer wants.  In other words, we should produce for the market place rather than, as we have been doing up to now, marketing what we produce. This has been one of the big weaknesses in our whole system in relation to agriculture and in our attitude towards it, and for that reason an overall, in-depth examination of, and research and study into diversification and into consumer demands is required very urgently.</P>
    <P>The point must be stressed that by 1982 the total value of our dairy products was £710 million which represented 12 per cent of our total exports.  Putting that into perspective, we must clearly see and understand the absolute importance of the whole dairying industry.  Apart from its own contribution to exports and employment, it is the basis of our cattle trade.  In fact, about three-quarters of our beef herd originate from the dairy industry and when we link this with employment &mdash; I am talking of off-farm employment, excluding farmers &mdash; there are approximately 11,000 persons employed in the milk processing sector and about 7,000 employed in the beef processing sector.  That brings home to us the <Col N="213" /> extreme importance of the whole area of milk production and without it our economy would be in dire straits.</P>
    <P>Even more important, milk production is the one area of agricultural development in which many of our people are bound to engage for economic and other reasons.  By that I mean the return from dairying is the only way many smallholders can survive economically and can make a living for themselves.  Much of the land that is used for dairy production, which will become a matter for consideration by Bord Bainne in their selling practices at a later stage, has no other use. There is no choice except the production of milk.  This is very important and it cannot be overstated.  Many of our farms are in the 40 or 50-acre bracket or less than that.  There is no other line of agriculture that will yield a return comparable with what can be got from the dairying side.</P>
    <P>While the super-levy is not directly part of what we are talking about here, I do not think that one could speak on a Bill of this sort without stressing the absolute seriousness of the proposed super-levy for this country and I stress &ldquo;the proposed super-levy&rdquo;.  I share the view that there is a very substantial surplus of milk and milk products in Europe and I also share the view that there is need for a super-levy but for a number of very justifiable and valid reasons that super-levy must not and cannot apply to the producers of milk in this country.  This is a point that the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Finance, Agriculture and others have been emphasising and re-emphasising in recent months.  I do not think it could get too much support or too much emphasis.  What the Minister stated is extremely relevant, that the support of all parties is essential if we are to achieve the result we need.  That result can be nothing short of total derogation for this country.  While we acknowledge, as I have said, that there is a major surplus problem we have contributed very little to that problem.  In fact, at present we are producing only approximately 4½ per cent of the total milk production in Europe.  There are three countries, and this needs to be stressed again and again, <Col N="214" /> the United Kingdom, Germany and Holland and between them they produce more than 50 per cent of the milk in Europe.  These three countries enjoy very cheap cereal substitutes.  Of the 17 million tonnes of cereal substitutes imported into the Community, approximately 70 per cent is taken up by these three countries. One recognises that because of GATT agreements and arrangements and other factors it is difficult to break that situation but nevertheless one has to recognise that the production that has arisen because of these cheap cereal substitutes is causing a problem.</P>
    <P>While it is very difficult to quantify precisely what arises from this cheap cereal substitute production content, it certainly has aggravated our surplus and without it the surplus would probably be non-existent or very little.  Added to that we have the situation that we are an island off the mainland of Europe and we are very dependent on agriculture, the most dependent of the Ten with the exception, perhaps, of Greece and parts of southern Italy.  This dependence revolves very much on the dairying industry. For that reason we have an irrefutable case for total and complete derogation from the super-levy.  With the super-levy operating in Europe, and as was proposed at the Athens meeting, with a review of that situation after four years, I believe the problem would take care of itself.</P>
    <P>With other political colleagues from all parties, I was recently in Brussels and Strasbourg.  We had a number of meetings with people from the Commission and people in the European Parliament and we saw that we have a very difficult task ahead of us if we are to achieve our objective, which is total derogation from the super-levy.  There is absolute acceptance in Europe at Commission level, and other levels too, that we have a special problem but it is question of converting that sort of acceptance of our special difficulties into policy formulation that would be steered in our direction.  As one very high ranking person put it to us last week in Europe, there is an acceptance of the Irish case and now it is a matter of the degree of acceptance.  We say, quite <Col N="215" /> categorically and quite firmly, that we will settle for nothing short of total and complete derogation for this country.</P>
    <P>While the super-levy is not directly related to what we are talking about, if we fail to get derogation the whole marketing of our dairy products and the effectiveness of the industry will be seriously distorted.  One would like to believe that we will get this derogation but one also recognises that it is not going to be got too easily or too lightly.  It will be a continuous, difficult battle on the part of everybody concerned, particularly the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Finance, Agriculture and Foreign Affairs.  It will require the united efforts of all political parties and members of farming organisations. There is now, as never before, an acceptance among the non-farming public of the importance of agriculture, and dairying in particular, because of the publicity the whole matter has received. Linked to the super-levy question we have a serious position confronting the whole Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>Though the super-levy is of extreme importance to us, there are other aspects also of extreme importance to us, for example the calf premium scheme, export refunds and many other matters. In my view it is essential that we concentrate on the most important issues, but we must keep all the other matters fully in mind.  Closely aligned to that is the fact that the EEC Common Agricultural Fund is fast running out.  Unless there is an increase in the level of VAT paid by members of the European Economic Community there will not be a continuance of the Community's ability to pay us money for a longer period.</P>
    <P>We should give consideration to the establishment of a national development agricultural authority that would embrace all the facets involved in agricultural production, processing and marketing. Combined studies of all agencies involved should be used to evolve a policy that would lead to a position when we could diversify to the extent which I stressed as necessary earlier.  Because employment is such a very critical factor we must leave no stone unturned to <Col N="216" /> ensure that wherever there will be the possibility of securing employment in agriculture directly, or on the periphery of the industry, we must chase after it.</P>
    <P>In the area of added value on agricultural products in general, there is a substantial potential for job creation. Another area which offers potential for employment is that of food imports.  A substantial amount of the goods we import can be produced here.  I have stressed on many occasions that we should produce products which the markets will buy from us.</P>
    <P>Bord Bainne deserve our support. Agreeing to the Bill as presented in the Seanad is an indication of our absolute trust and confidence in the future handling by An Bord Bainne of the products they have been engaged in selling.  I am confident that all Members of this House will support the Bill enthusiastically and wholeheartedly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Bill will be read by the agricultural community, in particular the dairy sector, as an almost formal vote of confidence in the sector.  Such a vote of confidence is very necessary because of the trauma the dairy sector are undergoing at present due to the threat of the super-levy.  It is imperative for us as a House of the Oireachtas to indicate our confidence in the sector by way of additional support for the marketing agency responsible for not alone the marketing of the products but new product development and diversification of existing products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, unlike the previous guarantee which only covered loans, will give a certain amount of flexibility which may be very useful to An Bord Bainne.  I hope they will use that flexibility for the betterment of the industry as a whole, particularly product development.  Our party, which is a small party, but involved in Government, want to put on record the importance we place on the agricultural sector as part of our national economy. Regarding the dairy sector and what has arisen from the whole discussion on the proposed super-levy, I want to deal with a few specifics which will put my party's attitude to such proposals in proper perspective. <Col N="217" /> The agricultural community as a whole can be reassured of our concern about this valuable area of production.  I should like to quote from the Bulletin of the European Communities, Supplement 4/83 &mdash; the Adjustment of the Common Agricultural Policy, which deals specifically with milk on page 11, section 39:</P>
    <P>The market imbalance, already grave when the guaranteed threshold was first introduced in 1982, has deteriorated further.  World market prospects do not indicate the possibility of further significant increases in the Community's exports.  The cost of subsidised disposal on the Community's own markets has reached very high levels.  Community consumption of milk products shows significant signs of stagnation.  The Community is therefore faced with the need for radical action to correct the situation.</P>
    <P>That could be the nucleus.  We can go back to 1981 to various proposals that emerged from various sub-committees of the Commission.  Obviously the Community has financial and marketing problems. I want categorically to state that in spite of the fact that employment has been falling dramatically in the industry in the past 20 years, from 17 million in 1960 to 8 million in 1983, there are still considerable numbers of people, small farmers particularly, directly employed in the industry.  The spin-off effects in the processing sector, particularly relevant to dairying, is quite significant.  As a party we recognise the central importance of the dairying sector to the Irish economy and for that reason, we have stated categorically to the EEC Commission our attitude in regard to the proposed super-levy.</P>
    <P>The dairy sector underpins our entire agricultural economy.  There are still approximately 70,000 Irish farmers who derive their incomes mainly from dairying. There are a further 13,000 people directly employed in dairy processing. That is, therefore, a total of 83,000 people employed directly in dairy farming and in the by-products of dairying.  It is equivalent to the total number of IDA-assisted jobs in new industries since <Col N="218" /> they started their programme of industrial development.  The total export value last year of our dairy products amounted to £725 million.  In addition to those 70,000 farmers and 13,000 people directly employed, there are, of course, their families.  There are approximately a quarter of a million people dependent on the dairy sector.</P>
    <P>For us, the Labour Party, it is a very important segment of our community, and we must have regard for it and understand the plight they would be faced with if the super-levy, in any form were implemented. The industry has experienced consistent growth over the past ten years. This has served to strengthen existing dairy farmer units.  It has provided additional employement in the processing and the farm input sectors.  Of course, it provides an outlet for home produced cereals. It also provides the nucleus stocks for the beef herd.  It contributes significantly to the rural construction industry. Taking all these together, one can imagine how important the dairy sector is to Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is a clear national commitment to the continuing development of this sector in the next five years.  This has been indicated on numerous occasions by this and previous Governments and by the present Minister for Agriculture and his Ministers of State in part of the negotiations that have gone on, and in the comments made in this country before the discussions began.  There is no doubt about the clear commitment from all sides of the House to the dairy sector.  It is essential that any agreement achieved at EEC level must protect the current and future development patterns of this industry.  Therefore, it is vital that the present lack of progress in the negotiations which appears to have taken place within the Council of Ministers be resolved.  We all seem now to be looking forward to the next heads of state meeting. We hope lack of progress will not jeopardise the already agreed agricultural prices of 1983.  They are trying to put us into a Catch 22 situation by holding up payments which are legitimately and rightfully ours pending the forcing of our hand on the 1984 super-levy proposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> It is essential that the Irish position during the negotiations would be based firmly on our national plans and targets for this sector and the potential for the sector to contribute to the growth of the other farming sectors and the food industry, as I have outlined.  It is on this basis that the Labour Party are fully in support of the Minister for Agriculture in his current negotiations.  It is imperative that any Minister of any Government would have the full support of all the political parties here while negotiations are going on.  It is important that the rug is not pulled from under anybody's feet while the tricky negotiations are going on &mdash; I think everybody realises that those discussions are tricky.</P>
    <P>As Senator Hourigan said, a derogation is vital for us.  I contend that it is absolutely essential that there will be a derogation for us on these proposals.  It must be achieved on a basis which will allow sufficient scope for dairy farmers with the most potential for development, for example, the small and medium sized family farm units, to expand and develop production to at least the average level within the EEC.  I do not think it is too much to ask from our colleagues in Europe that we would be allowed time on a production derogation.  A compelling case can be made for this on the basis that in spite of our increased production we are still relatively underdeveloped and undercapitalised in the dairying industry.  The central importance of the dairy sector cannot be over-emphasised as part of these negotations.  The fact that the average production levels in Ireland in dairying are so far below what have been achieved by other EEC countries, particularly in terms of milk yield per cow, must be stressed.</P>
    <P>It is vital, therefore, that we have a derogation, that those dairy farmers with the most potential to expand and are in need of increased income will get primary consideration in any decisions that are reached.  We require a dairying industry which will allow scope for development and will contribute to the maximum number of family farms being retained in the country.  We, as a member state, certainly <Col N="220" /> do not want an industry which might be maximised for the benefit of a small number of dairy or factory farmers who use cheap imported feeds to gain these high levels of milk production.  The Labour Party do not hold a brief for any of those factory farmers, whether they are in Ireland or in Europe.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the 85 per cent of Irish dairy farmers who have 30 or fewer cows, those people who will suffer as a result of policies that might be initiated when the factory farmers of Europe make use of imported cereals and have not shown any recognition whatsoever of Community preference or indeed of solidarity and are not apparently prepared to pay the price of political unity in Europe which is part of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Part of our reason for joining Europe was to benefit from such a policy.  We are not afraid to say it as a small party.  Of course, the CAP will have to be looked at and must be reviewed.  If it had been looked at and reviewed three, four or five years ago, the Commission would not be in the dilemma it is in now when it is fast running out of money.  In the review of CAP our special position as a developing nation must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>It might be worth stating, particularly approaching the European elections which are important for all of us, that the Labour Party have given special significance to agriculture.  I would refer back to our special delegate conference in Limerick in 1982 when we decided to go into Government.  We had a clear commitment to agriculture, first of all by controlling inflation, which we have helped in Government to contribute to.  It was creating a major problem for Irish agriculture because of the cost-price squeeze that farmers found themselves in.  That was tackled and I am glad to say that in the first period of this Government's life, in 12 months, they have halved the inflation rate.  Farming will benefit, and last year it did so significantly from that kind of cost-price inflation control that has taken place.</P>
    <P>I foresee this as quite a difficult year for farming.  It will be particularly difficult because of the situation we find ourselves <Col N="221" /> in now.  This Bill is a vote of confidence in what we feel An Bord Bainne Limited can be doing and what An Bord Bainne are doing.  They produced a newsletter in January 1984 in which they referred to a development fund for themselves and the concept of making a fresh start in the area of product diversification which has been under discussion for some time.  That is fundamental to the success of any marketing agency the Government try to assist by way of legislation.  They must tackle existing markets and go out with a dynamic policy of selling on them and look for new markets elsewhere.  We are dealing with a commodity that does not stay fresh very long.  They have a major task on their hands.  It is frightening to see that the traditional market in the UK is now almost self-sufficient in milk and milk products.  About 85 per cent is home produced in Britain and the balance is imported.  That leaves very little chance for us to go into the traditional market of the UK.</P>
    <P>It is also frightening to see in this document produced by An Bord Bainne that the total tonnage of butter in intervention in Europe is now reaching a crisis point. For the first time since 1979 &mdash; when it was almost 300,000 tonnes &mdash; it is now more than 700,000 tonnes.  That means we are now at a crisis situation.  That is why the Community are talking about super-levies.  We have not contributed to this problem and it is only in recent times that the figure for intervention for butter has soared to such a staggering level as 700,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>Irish milk production has also gone up, according to this graph.  I hope this graph does not leave Ireland and go to Europe because the European Community and the Commission could produce evidence like this against us and point to our little green island with its massive growth of milk supplies from 600,000 gallons in 1973 to 1,000 million gallons, which is an astronomical increase.  1981, which is the year the Community have chosen as the base year, was one of our lowest years because we had gone through the process of an accelerated programme for the eradication of brucellosis in our dairy herd.  Our milk production that year was <Col N="222" /> at one of its lowest levels.  It is a pity that year was chosen &mdash; perhaps that was why they chose that year.  Since then we have got back on the road to increasing our production, and these figures are spectacular for a small country, but we still produce only 4½ per cent of total EEC milk.  So I contend that we are not creating the problem.  I hope the dairy sector will accept that this Bill gives a certain amount of confidence to them, which they require.  It gives the board the flexibility they need for new product development.</P>
    <P>I would refer Members of the House to the document, <i>Dairy News,</i> 9 January 1984, which concisely sets down the programme the board have for tackling the problem of product development and getting into a dynamic sales area.  I hope they accept this Bill in the spirit in which it is given to them.  It gives them powers to raise additional funds over a period of six years or more and gives them the flexibility which was not there, in fact, in previous Acts.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister enjoys the unanimous support of the House in presenting this Bill which guarantees the borrowing of An Bord Bainne for the next six years.  However, he comes in here at a time when agriculture in general is in a cloud of uncertainty and the proposals to reform the Common Agricultural Policy grimly hang over the country. It is a time, too, when all of us &mdash; those who are engaged in the agricultural industry and at this level &mdash; should be as united as possible in our efforts to wrestle in the further negotiations for the best possible deal in what are admittedly difficult circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are only too well aware of the budgetary position with regard to the Common Agricultural Policy should the growth in milk production continue at recent levels.  We are only too well aware of the massive damage that would be done to our own economy, so uniquely depending on agriculture, and that sector so dependent on dairying, if the proposals with regard to the super-levy were to be implemented.  Pegged as they are at <Col N="223" /> the 1981 levels of production, plus 1 per cent, these would have devastating effects on our whole economy.</P>
    <P>We support the Minister and the Government in all the efforts that have been made and we hope are being made and will be made in the course of the next few weeks, through their officials and through their subsequent personal involvement in the final stages.  If we were to fail in not getting some room for growth in this industry, at this underdeveloped stage of agriculture, we would have done irreparable damage to the agricultural industry and indeed to the community as a whole.  We have in many ways a unique opportunity because, possibly for the first time, we have had a tremendous degree of co-operation between what would previously have been considered competing sectors in the economy.  All are at one, both in the trade union movement and in the agribusiness generally, in accepting that we cannot and must not accept this super-levy, and we have to ensure that at least we will be allowed to grow to levels comparable with those of our partners in Europe.  Most of us do not want to consider the implications of failure to do that because they would be so horrific for the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>That said, we have to recognise that this achievement will be difficult enough to bring about.  We have said, and most of us agree, that a stop has to be put to the growth of milk production as a whole in Europe.  Whether we are talking about the import of cereals or about factory farming, the simple fact of life is that we are unable to dispose of the surplus which is now developing.  I am told that in a very short time we will run out of storage space in this country for our butter and skim milk powder surplus.  The position is similar in other parts of Europe.  These pictures indicate that the Community as a whole must come up with a solution which will stop the massive growth in milk production but at the same time will come up with an equitable solution, one which will not hurt the smaller countries and those countries that have been and are traditionally dependent on this source <Col N="224" /> of income and where it is, in the main, produced from basic raw materials from within the Community.</P>
    <P>We have not been importing cereal substitutes, we have not enjoyed higher MCAs, and we are much more dependent on the dairy sector in the economy as a whole than most of the countries that are.  There are other proposals which will be equally difficult for the dairy sector. Consideration is being given to changing the ratio between skim and butter.  This would give an advantage, in terms of reducing the subsidies on butter, and perhaps improve butter sales.  Those, admittedly are quite difficult.  Any solution to the butter problem should not necessarily aggravate the position regarding skim milk powder for which the markets have substantially dried up.  Any proposals from the Commission which seem to be lopsided in that sense must be equally fought because they do not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Since this is probably the last opportunity that we will have to discuss matters of this kind prior to the finalisation of these negotiations, I would like to ask the Minister here whether the Government have considered a devaluation of the green rate.  It seems that proposals already in hand effectively reduce the price of milk at farm gate level where we still have high interest rates and inputs are still rising resulting in a fairly substantial reduction in farm incomes.  Many farmers who are at a middle-way stage in their development programme are in arrears with their repayments to the ACC and the commercial banks and any further erosion of their incomes obviously very seriously aggravates an already problematic situation.  Have the Government any proposals in this regard, taking into account that the price rise this year appears to be practically negligible and could be brought about only by some consideration of the question of the changing of the green rate?  We have fought fairly consistently for the elimination of the MCAs and it is high time that the member countries, particularly the Germans, were forced into the situation which would enable us to solve this <Col N="225" /> problem, which obviously will not be eliminated overnight.  It could be eliminated over a number of stages in a few years.</P>
    <P>To digress for a few moments, I regard the super-levy as a central issue which calls for the greatest unity of purpose amongst parliamentarians supporting at all levels a terrier-like attitude in EEC negotiations.  At the same time, I must record some disappointment that in the management of our agriculture we have made decisions over the past year which, to say the least of it, have not helped our position.  We have made changes in intervention payments.  We tried to fight off EEC proposals when we were proposing to do the same thing at home.  The Minister of State representing, as he does, a very strong farming constituency, must be very concerned, as I am, about the restoration of the grants for the farm modernisation scheme when within two weeks after the restoration of this very important development aegis with so much downstream employment in it and which is so necessary for underdeveloped agriculture, we are told that proposals in the EEC eliminate a section of that development as they devolve around the dairy industry.  As most people who are involved in this area know, a middle band of farmers have not been able to afford or avail of the grants up to now and are in desperate need of the provision of in-winter facilities and some reasonable kind of dairying and silage yards for their small cow herds.  It seems incredible &mdash; maybe I am dense &mdash; that you could come up with a proposal to restore a scheme which had been fought through these Houses over the previous 12 months which we saw as so important and at the same time some section within the EEC were bringing forward proposals which would render that restoration impossible in so far as it affects the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister when replying to give me some assurance that we will be able to provide some aid to the groups of farmers who are now the least able to provide these facilities without grant aid. Most of the bigger, better off farmers in times when it was easier to borrow money carried out these developments with the <Col N="226" /> help of grant aid.  Can the Minister now justify depriving a farmer with very limited resources of grant aid which supported his neighbour who was four or five times stronger than he was when he was carrying out that job?  There is another aspect to that.  Pierces in Wexford, Keenans in Bagenalstown, Kellys in Portlaoise and many other industries are threatened with closure because for over 60 per cent of their output they depend on farm development.  Sand, gravel, hardware facilities, timber, slates, galvanising, cement and everything else that goes into farm development we all readily accept are all home produced.</P>
    <P>The scheme is designed by officials. You pay no money to any farmer until those officials are satisfied that this scheme is carried out and totally completed to the prescription of those officials, with whom I had the privilege to work for so brief a period.  I do not want to lose confidence totally in that system or in those individuals.  Transport of our meat can be stopped in France and the customs officials in Italy can take whatever action they like.  The bold Mrs. Thatcher can manipulate the Milk Marketing Board.  She can import New Zealand butter.  She can look for a budgetary refund at the same time as she aggravates that problem quite deliberately because of her colonial history.  Can we not in this country, small as it is, contemplate some ingenuity which would allow us to cater for this very fundamental problem as it affects our own agriculture today?  I want to hear from the Minister in his reply some positive statement which will indicate that he too is concerned and will find a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude on the matter of diversification which is trotted out from Bord Bainne and will be trotted out here as the solution.  A couple of years ago I was at the Green Week in Berlin and I was very proud to see Irish dairy or dairy-related products on sale there.  One of those products, Bailey's Cream, has been a phenomenal success.  However, difficulty is involved in diversification. Half our increase in milk production last year over the 1982 level &mdash; not our total level of production of 1,000 million gallons <Col N="227" />&mdash; was used by Baileys in the production of their well marketed product which is synonymous with the best that goes in Irish business, workmanship and so on.  The scope for diversification is enormous.  We depend too much on butter and skim milk powder.  The percentage of our gross national product or total agricultural produce that we invest in research and new product development is infinitesimal and I cannot say how it can be increased.  I recognise that the solution is not as simple as it is said to be.  Out of the volume of milk that is produced the small amounts that can be trailed into these kinds of products, however good and important they are, barely touches the perimeter.  Whether it be proprietary cheeses or whatever else, I recognise that we must head out in the direction of real diversification.  I do not see a solution to that problem for many years to come but I urge Bord Bainne to continue on that road as far as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity of speaking in support of this Bill.  It is good to know that the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and the Government have confidence in the dairying industry, in the dairying sector.  I should like to take this opportunity of complimenting Bord <Col N="228" /> Bainne Co-operative Limited for their continuing efforts which no doubt have contributed to the significant expansion of our dairying industry.  As a farmer I am extremely lucky to be living almost adjacent to one of our top co-operatives, Avonmore.  From close quarters it is easy to see the tremendous contribution that that well-managed and very extensive co-operative make, not only to the industry as a whole but through employment to a significant number of employees drawn from two if not three counties.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Bord Bainne Co-operative Limited be in a position to continue their excellent work.  It is reassuring that in this Bill the Minister for Agriculture is demonstrating his confidence not only in the Bord Bainne Co-operative Limited but in the dairying industry as a whole.</P>
      <P>It is important that there be continued development.  Sometimes when talking about development Government Ministers or people addressing themselves to the problems of agriculture are inclined to stress the need for greater efficiency. I suppose most farmers would accept that point.  But when one looks at the position of the ordinary farmer &mdash; whether it be somebody trying to survice on 45 acres on a Land Commission holding or somebody on a 50 or 100 acre farm &mdash; when he is trying to balance his books to prove that he is not in the tax category it is not much good to him to hear the pleas that he should be more efficient and increase production in order to pay his way.  Our farmers and agricultural industry will continue to have difficulties until some new mechanism is devised whereby the cost of farm inputs tie in in some way with the increases in farm production at the other end.  Already this year we hear that there is going to be an increase in milk or agricultural prices that that increase will not exceed 3 per cent.  For those farmers who are thinking of putting on early nitrogen, or manures of one kind or another, the cost of fertilisers compared with last year have gone up by 19 or 20 per cent.  This is where farmers are literally being squeezed out of existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I support the Government and admire the progress that they are making, <Col N="229" /> I do not think that the seriousness of the plight of such a high proportion of our farmers has yet been realised by them. This year, at least in some midland counties, many farmers experienced difficulty in getting their annual working capital allocation from the commercial banks. This has meant that there are quite a number of silage pits in more than one county that have not been utilised this year mainly because the banks' advisers &mdash; who graduated from being farmers' advisers &mdash; say that there is no money to be had from fattening cattle this year. Therefore, they have refused to extend the finance that farmers sought successfully annually to stock their farmyards.</P>
    <P>At least it is good to see that the Government have confidence in the continuation of the industry.  My greatest disappointment is in regard to the policy pursued by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The legislation setting up that corporation stated that they were to assist the development of agriculture.  I do not know where the board members are drawn from, but certainly it can be contended they are not doing so.  I know that there are difficulties encountered by them.  I know there are farmers who have not been fair in regard to their repayments or whatever.  Nevertheless, if the Government are saying now that they have confidence in the dairying sector as one very important sector and are proposing to guarantee any State loans that An Bord Bainne Co-operative Limited may wish to draw on, then I think there should be a follow-up.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank last weekend issued a new policy statement.  I have not read in the newspapers to date what that is going to mean to the ordinary debtor or customer of one of the commercial banks or the ACC.  I do not know whether there is going to be an easing up of the credit restrictions.  At the same time the message should be got across that, with the diminishing returns on capital invested in agriculture &mdash; whether it is in dairying, which is covered by this Bill, or any other of the agricultural husbandries &mdash; it is not possible to service loans at 15.75 or 16 per cent when the return on capital invested in farming last year was down to <Col N="230" /> single figures, to 3 or 4 per cent, or whatever was the figure.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation must assist in the development of agriculture and of the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Smith in his contribution dealt with the difficulties that the EEC have imposed by overruling our Government's decision to reintroduce the farm modernisation scheme.  I can appreciate the difficulties that the Government find themselves in.  I would hope they would continue to look at that proposal to ascertain if there can be a breakthrough.  The contention that the only way for farmers to expand is by greater efficiency is not valid while the people servicing agriculture and processing agricultural produce have an open cheque to increase their prices, securing their margins, at the expense of the ordinary farmer.</P>
    <P>Many years ago the advisory services &mdash; which must be in the spotlight at all times &mdash; dealt with agriculture and the farmyard enterprises.  Some years ago milk and butter-making formed part of the farmyard enterprise, being in the domain of the housewife rather than that of the farmer himself.  That was before the dairying industry expanded universally to its present state.</P>
    <P>With hindsight we made a mistake in eliminating the poultry-keeper and butter-maker from that type of service. I am not contending now that there is need for a professional adviser to assist with poultry-keeping and butter-making, for the simple reason that those two activities have been removed from the farmyard enterprise as we knew them.  The latest change has meant that this service has been done away with completely.  A direct effect was that last year this country imported over £14 million worth of fruit and vegetables.  The Department of Agriculture must keep track of ACOT activities.  While ACOT is an autonomous body, nevertheless the Minister has an obligation to keep an eye on their general guidelines and ensure that the service more or less caters for the kind of agricultural developments that will be of most benefit to our country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I regret the passing of the farm home economic advisers.  There was a grey area <Col N="231" /> between the vocational education committees and the domestic economy service in which they should be operating and the demise of that service is to be deplored.  I would hope that ACOT would have a second look at it even at this very late stage.  Their move overnight some months ago, transforming every agricultural adviser into a specialist in one of the lines of farming husbandry, was not a great idea.  I hope their move will be successful and that they are proven right.  But I am still very sceptical because I see the adviser becoming further removed from the problems of agriculture and those of the small individual farmer.</P>
    <P>It is important to remind people of the importance of the dairying industry.  The latest figures for 1982 show that our exports totalled over £700 million or, approximately, 12 or 13 per cent of our total exports and that the processing industry employs some 11,000 or 12,000 people.  These are very important sectors. We must remember that there are not very many other areas with those kinds of statistics.  Therefore general policy must be of greatest importance to our economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>An area that has not received the same support as other sectors of the dairying industry is that of liquid milk production. In replying perhaps the Minister would confirm that the liquid milk producer will not be subject to any super-levy that may be introduced.  I have noticed of late that the co-operatives are inclined to cut in on the liquid milk market.  They are entitled to do so.  Nevertheless the liquid milk market has always been a very specialist area.  The farmers who opt to supply liquid milk for human consumption are subjected to very rigorous and high standards of hygiene proficiency, with veterinary inspections several times per year.  This is not the case with people who are producing for manufactured milk whether that be butter, skim milk powder or whatever.</P>
    <P>If we are to continue to produce high standard and high quality milk for human consumption we should expect that those supplying the domestic market would be <Col N="232" /> able to continue those traditional high standards.  That is the reason the price of liquid milk always was that bit better for the producer than to those supplying the creameries or the manufacturing industry. Since those people employed in the production of liquid milk have never been involved in any way with the European Economic Community, the common agricultural policy or whatever, I do not see how anybody could suggest that they be subjected to a levy.  That has not been spelled out.  I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity of allaying my fears that these people who have produced milk under contract, during the most expensive period of the winter to keep the liquid milk trade supplied will be looked after.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a very special plea to teachers, especially national school teachers and to the boards of management of schools to organise the distribution of the generously subsidised EEC school milk scheme, which is of direct benefit to children.  It is unfortunate that it is not universally accepted. There are some children who will not drink milk.  But if it were available and attractively presented it would be of significant benefit to a lot of children whose families might not otherwise be able to afford to provide it for them at the ordinary commercial rates.</P>
    <P>I compliment the National Dairy Council on their initiatives in trying to improve the presentation of milk and their approach to modern sales techniques. The Minister and the Department should give some thought to providing refrigerated dispensers for national schools so that milk is dispensed to children at its optimum quality and palatability.  Surely it would not be beyond the scope of ordinary national school management boards to provide a refrigerted dispenser.  Perhaps some dairies would provide special school cartons which would make milk more attractive for small children for whom it is highly desirable and who should be afforded this very nourishing food.  Driving around the country especially in summertime it is quite usual to see a school's supply of milk on the wall outside in the sun.  That <Col N="233" /> is a shame.  I would hope that the national teachers &mdash; who over the years have shown that they cared for all of the children in their care &mdash; would make a special effort to provide such a service.  I am aware it would cause some extra work but it would be well worth while.  Perhaps the boards of management would ascertain how best that can be done.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to speak on a Bill such as this without giving thought to the number one bugbear in the entire agriculture industry at present, that is the proposed super-levy on milk.  I take this opportunity of complimenting the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture on the excellent manner in which they have defended our national interests to date against last year's proposal for the introdcution of a super-levy.</P>
    <P>Looking at the overall figures for the Community, it would seem that we have not yet reached the stage at which we have record stocks of either powdered milk or butter in the Community.  I would be inclined to lay the blame fairly and squarely on the Heads of State for the present impase in the Community.  It is not just the Common Agricultural Policy that is causing the problem at present.  It is the nationalistic stances of the Heads of State who have not the guts to take the necessary decisions to increase the Community budget from the 1 per cent of VAT levied on the entire Community set some ten or 11 years ago.</P>
    <P>Many new policies have been introduced and many others expanded in the Community.  But the contention seems to be that they all must be implemented at the expense of the Common Agricultural Policy, which is probably the best developed policy of all the Community's policies.  The unfairness of the original super-levy proposals <i>vis-à-vis</i> Ireland is quite plain.  I would hope our Ministers will succeed in getting a full derogation from those harsh proposals.  It is difficult to understand how the Commission should have agreed to the inclusion of Ireland even after the first draft.  The proposed 70p levy per gallon, while it represents 100 per cent of the price paid to Irish farmers, constitutes less than 80 per cent of the price paid to our main <Col N="234" /> competitors in the milk producing areas of Europe, those who have caused the problem; those people who over the years have benefited from the Common Agricultural Policy having obtained their present high standards of output and production as a result of the generous aid they received over the past 25 or 26 years since the establishment of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Therefore it is very unfair that Ireland is cut away midstream as it were.</P>
    <P>I hope our Ministers will resist any proposal which does not guarantee our producers the rights guaranteed to us under the Treaty of Rome through our Treaty of Accession.  In tackling the Community's budgetary problems it is unfortunate that the Heads of State have failed to demonstrate the European spirit the founding fathers obviously had when drafting the Treaty of Rome and which holds out such hope for the improvement of the living and working conditions of our people.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain the situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the proposed super-levy should the worst come to the worst for those people engaged in liquid milk production.  I would also ask the Minister what is the situation regarding the continued up-dating of the agricultural advisory services.  It is very important that we have an advisory service which will highlight the best possible ways of improving our competitiveness under present conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is true to say that everything that can be said has already been said.  But I want to add my voice on a few points which strike me forcibly as a farmer, as somebody who has been very much involved in the agriculture scene for a long time.  I welcome the Bill, which extends the duration of the State guarantee for borowing by An Bord Bainne Co-operative Limited some years which is very welcome.  I am sure I speak on behalf of many farmers outside the House today, when I say that naturally I dislike the move afoot by the EEC to squeeze or kill off many of our farmers. It would be true to say that many of them are in serious difficulties.  Of course, their <Col N="235" /> main worry is the proposed super-levy on milk.  The Minister may not be in a position to state just exactly what our chances are regarding the super-levy.  I would like to compliment the Minister and the Taoiseach on their efforts to ensure that we get the best deal possible.  Many farmers are very worried about the outcome. They have had an uphill battle for a long time and it was only in the 1970s that farming improved.  It goes without saying that the Minister and the Government will do their utmost to ensure that the best possible deal is got for this country, not only in the interests of the farming community but in the interest of Ireland as a whole.</P>
      <P>The effects of the levy on the farming community would be considerable and many other people also are going to suffer if we do not get the deal we are hoping for from the EEC.  It appears to many people at the moment that the big decisions now are made in Brussels.  I am quite happy that the Government will take the necessary steps if the decisions in Brussels are not to their liking or are to the detriment of the farmers.  I have the utmost confidence in the Government that they will ensure that the Irish farmer does not fall by the wayside.</P>
      <P>Most people and the Government of the day believed that when we joined the Common Market it was for the common good of all the nations but we may have been forced to change our minds on that. The position now is that it is a case of every country getting what they can for themselves by hook or by crook no matter who is going to suffer as a result.  If the decision does not go well in Brussels, then we will have to rely on the Government to take the necessary steps.</P>
      <P>The effects are going to be felt by more people than the farming community and some people do not realise that.  There will be a considerable effect on the unemployment situation.  If the deal we get in Brussels is right, it is going to help.  It may not necessarily create more employment but at least it will ensure that there is not more unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people involved in the <Col N="236" /> cattle industry who are very concerned about the outcome.  If the super-levy goes ahead the effect on the whole cattle industry will be catastrophic.  The beef industry depends to a large extent on the dairying industry to produce calves.  One is totally dependent on the other.  If a super-levy is introduced it will have effects across the board for everybody. We have been trying to increase our cattle numbers over the past few years as they had fallen in the seventies.  It is our greatest industry.  At this juncture I welcome the deals made with third countries in relation to the cattle trade.  The cattle trade at the moment needed a little shot in the arm, and it got that.  There were fears that because of the economic situation cattle prices might fall.  The margin of profit is very low in the cattle industry compared to the dairying industry and I welcome any deals because this will bring back confidence in the cattle trade.</P>
    <P>The grain growers in this country are dependent on the dairying and beef industries to use the grain.  It is true that there were some warnings about the super-levy the past few years.  We have read about the mountains of butter and skim milk and cheese.  That was not the fault of the Irish farmer.  He responded to the call to increase production when he was asked to do so and it cost money.  Nobody would dispute that. It could not be said that the Irish farmer is responsible for the glut that exists at the moment.  It is some of the other countries which are responsible in this case. For example, in Holland farmers can produce as much as 1,100 gallons for an average yield, and that country has the advantage of cheap cereals.  It is not something that is enjoyed by the farmer in this country.</P>
    <P>The farmer in this country was asked to increase production and this cost him a considerable amount of money.  To get into dairying costs a large amount of money.  In the Seventies when they were responding to the call, they were lucky that many of the leading agencies in this country, for example, the banks, the ACC and so on, had an open door in relation to the borrowing of money.  It may be true that some of our farmers <Col N="237" /> borrowed too much.  Others did not borrow too much, but unfortunately they had to cope with the problems of inflation and the doubling of interest.  It must be said that there are many farmers in serious financial difficulties.  A survey was carried out by ACOT two years ago and it mentioned a large number of farmers who were in serious financial difficulties. I was a member of the board at the time and expressed the view that the figure given in the survey represented perhaps only about half the number of farmers who were in serious trouble.  The survey was carried out among farmers who were working closely with the advisory service. However, there would be a great number of farmers who were not working with the advisory service and they would be very slow in coming forward to disclose their financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>No matter what the decisions may be in Brussels, I am hopeful and confident that the Government of the day will ensure that the farmers get sufficient money, from whatever source, to continue in business.  We cannot afford to allow farming to run down.  It is our greatest industry, and we have to accept that. A small injection of money into agriculture can ensure that farmers can continue to produce and continue to live on their farms.  We have no place for these people outside farming; we do not want them to leave their homes where they were born and reared and where they are now bringing up their families.  We must ensure that a small injection of money is given to agriculture.  It costs something in the region of £15,000 to produce a job in industry; a much smaller amount of money would ensure that farmers could continue on their farms and enjoy a decent living.</P>
    <P>It has always been difficult for farmers to survive.  In the seventies farmers enjoyed a reasonably good time.  Some farmers made money then but any of them who made money spent it as fast as they made it, and not foolishly.  Very few farmers spend money foolishly.  They had to ensure that they did drainage work, build sheds and all things that were necessary, and by doing that everybody reaped the benfit.  They spent the money <Col N="238" /> and it created more employment and we can never lose sight of this fact.  I know the farming community perhaps better than anybody else and I would say that in those years when farmers were making money they went out and spent it just as quickly.  For that reason it would be foolish for anybody to think that the farmers were millionaires in those days.</P>
    <P>Farmers responded to the call to produce more and we must admire them for doing that.  We hear about butter and cheese mountains now, and all the rest, but it is not the farmers' fault.  Perhaps we were not the best people in the world to look for other markets in those times. We relied too much on intervention, and while intervention was there it was looked upon as a dumping ground.  The Irish farmer was not to blame for that. The people who were making the deals and working in the interests of the farmers, trying to ensure that they had a market for their produce, should have warned the farmers in relation to producing certain products or the over-production of certain items.  The farmer cannot change his way of farming.  Some counties such as Meath have land that is suitable for dairying or beef production while counties like Monaghan and Cavan are the home of the small farmers.  Farmers cannot change, they have to live with the system.  They cannot change to mixed farming or grain and perhaps it would be dangerous to do that.  The great danger would be if people were forced to cut back on the numbers of cows, which would reduce the number of cattle.  We cannot afford to let that situation arise. We must ensure, no matter what is the decision in Brussels, that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald spoke about encouraging people to drink more milk, for example, in schools and other places. The Senators is quite right in this: we must encourage people to drink milk.  This was started here in Leinster House a few weeks ago by some members of the Government.  On an occasion recently I bought a glass of milk and paid an enormous price for it.  Something should be done about this matter.  I have seen in my local newspapers a report of a small <Col N="239" /> family grocer who was taken to court for overcharging a halfpenny on a particular item, yet a person could be charged up to 50p for one half pint of milk.  There is something wrong with this, and it must be examined.  We will not encourage people to drink more milk if they are charged at the rate of 50p for one half pint: they will drink the pint of porter instead.</P>
    <P>I want to speak about the cattle industry and the problems that existed for the farmers when building up their herds over the past few years.  The Government and the Minister are well aware of the problem of disease that some dairy farmers have run into through the year.  Some farmers who have suffered because of outbreaks of brucellosis and TB in their herds are still in a bad financial state. This happened many farmers, and they are not out of the wood yet.  This matter has to be examined by the Government.</P>
    <P>In relation to the calf subsidy, there are fears that this subsidy may be withdrawn. That would be another serious blow to the dairy farming community whose income has fallen over the past 12 months.  While the calf subsidy in the first instance was introduced to encourage people to rear more calves, the benefit was eroded because as soon as the subsidy of £22 for calves went on the price of calves was raised in the market by perhaps £30 to £35 per head.  However, as long as some farmers enjoyed the benefits we will not complain about it.  If the calf subsidy is withdrawn it will be a further blow to the dairy man.</P>
    <P>We have to congratulate the Irish farmer for responding to the call to produce more.  His life is not an easy one; it is a very difficult one.  Many people would not change places with a dairy farmer for love or money, and certainly not for money, because there is none in it at the moment.  The dairy farmer works 365 days a year and it is a fight for survival. Anyone who is prepared to work 365 days a year must surely be entitled to whatever reward there is at the end of the day.  There are not many people who are prepared to do this but the people <Col N="240" /> who are doing it must be encouraged and there must be some reward for them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the credit restrictions at the moment, to which I referred earlier when I spoke about the survey that was carried out on the number of farmers who are in financial difficulties, it saddens me to read in the papers of the number of farmers who are under pressure from some lending institutions.  I do not think that any farmer is happy to owe thousands of pounds.  Every farmer, with a few exceptions, tries his utmost to repay the money he has borrowed.  For any lending agency, be it the ACC or the banks, that puts pressure on these people from Monday morning to Saturday night to get them to pay the money that they freely gave them at a particular time, is not adopting a good policy.  It is difficult enough to work at the best of times. Those pressures will not help any farmer to repay his money, but it will have the opposite effect.  For that reason we must plead with the banks and others who are putting pressure on farmers to lay off. The farming community in Ireland are a decent race of people.  They got that money at the time; in fact, some banks were competing with one another as to the amount of money they would lend them.  I congratulate the banks for handing out the money, because for far too long their doors were closed, but when the farmers found themselves in difficulties they then put on this type of pressure which can do nothing but harm.  For that reason we must and should appeal to all lending institutions to relax a little.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged by the fight the Minister and the Government are making in relation to our case in Brussels.  I have the utmost confidence in them that the result will be what we are looking for but if the result is not as good as we would like it, I ask the Minister today to carry the message back to the Government that more money will have to be spent from our own Exchequer to ensure that the farming community do not suffer from lack of cash.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate and I support the guarantee to An Bord Bainne <Col N="241" /> for a further six years.  As Senator Lennon has said, almost everything that could be said in this debate has probably been said today.  I know that the Minister is anxious to reply to the debate so I will not detain him too long.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate An Bord Bainne for the wonderful work they have done in the past 20 years since they were founded in the early sixties and since they were reconstituted as a co-op in 1972.  By 1982 the total value of Irish dairy produce was £710 million.  However, the board in recent years has been facing very stiff opposition both within the EEC and in third countries; by third countries I mean the countries outside the EEC and particularly the United States.  There has also been a milk surplus problem in the United States and, as a result, we have had to face stiff marketing competition from them.  One of the most lucrative markets we had in the past was the Mexican market, but we have recently lost this market to the United States because they undercut us in price.</P>
      <P>Now we have 1,000 million gallons of milk to process each year.  My belief is that we are too dependent on the traditional products such as butter, cheese and skimmed milk powder.  We need more diversification into other areas.  It is very difficult to understand why we as a dairying country import £40 million worth of dairy products each year and the Minister in his reply might make reference to that point.</P>
      <P>I urge the co-ops to get more involved in product development.  I believe there are a number of grant incentives from the IDA for this development.  It has always puzzled me that while we have a surplus of food and milk products in the EEC there is starvation in other parts of the world.  I find it difficult to understand why we cannot send more of our dairy produce such as skim milk powder or whole milk powder to Third World countries where there are people dying of starvation day after day and yet we in the EEC have a surplus which is costing us a fortune in cold storage and intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as our own country is concerned, we have an excellent record of trying to sell our produce on the open market.  I <Col N="242" /> was involved in the dairy industry in a managerial capacity for ten years both in the creamery industry and with the Department of Agriculture.  I remember in the mid-seventies when all other countries were selling their produce into intervention Ireland was one of the countries which was successfully selling their dairy produce on the world market, and the Mexican market is one of the areas to which I was referring.  At one stage I remember a boatload of skim milk powder leaving Cork harbour with a capacity of 5,000 tonnes for the Mexican market at a time when there was controversy about the butter mountain and the skim milk powder mountain in Europe.  It can be safely said that Bord Bainne did an excellent marketing job during the sixties and seventies.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a brief reference to the threat to this country from the super-levy It has been accepted that it would cost our country at least £150 million if this levy were imposed.  When we joined the EEC in 1972 our farming was not taken seriously.  We were down in production in relation to our counterparts within the EEC.  Our national yield per cow at the time was 480 gallons while the national yield in Europe was about 1,000 gallons.  With a lot of hard work and valuable input from the advisory service and a lot of dedication our farming community has turned our farming scene into a business-type operation.  Our national yield per cow has increased to about 700 gallons but we are way behind our European counterparts.  There is no denying that there is a surplus in the EEC, but I want to point out &mdash; this has probably been said already &mdash; that our contribution accounts for only 4 per cent of this surplus.  If you compare that figure with that of France you will find that their contribution to surplus is 24 per cent, Germany accounts for 23 per cent and the UK accounts for 15 per cent of the overall surplus in the EEC.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to make a small comparison from our country's point of view on the importance of agriculture, and dairy produce particularly, to our economy.  Dairy products alone account for 9.6 per cent of our gross <Col N="243" /> national product compared with Germany whose dairy products account for only .79 per cent.  I am pointing this out because you can have situations developing in the EEC which will not affect the other countries as much as ours.  We are basically an agricultural country and Germany and other countries could be regarded as strong industrial states.  So there is a huge difference between the two types of state.  A small change of opinion in Europe would have vast implications from our point of view.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about how An Bord Bainne did an excellent job in our marketing. During those years all the other countries were taking the easy way out, they were selling their dairy produce into intervention, something we avoided for many years.  At that time there was also a surplus of grain in the EEC, yet you had countries like Holland importing cheap cereals, producing factory type milk.  In other words they had it both ways: they had the cheapest possible inputs for milk production, they were a grain growing country yet they made no effort to sell their grain on the world market.  They took the easy way out. They sold their grain into intervention. Thye did not use their grain for milk production because it was too costly. Thye would get a better price by selling it into intervention, yet they used their ports and harbours as facilities to import cheap cereals.  I will make one other point.  While they have a surplus in the EEC, I find it very hard to understand why we have New Zealand butter on the UK market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>While we have a surplus of dairy produce in the EEC I fail to understand why we allow, or why the EEC allows, the importation of New Zealand butter to the UK market.  In 1974 they accounted for 25 per cent of the UK market; in 1983 this had risen to 34 per cent and I am aware of the discussions that took place recently between our Minister for Agriculture and the Prime Minister of New Zealand in relation <Col N="245" /> to that matter.  I do not understand why we should be making a bad situation worse by allowing this importation to take place.</P>
      <P>Ireland is an agricultural country and as such it needs special attention from the EEC.  Eighty-five per cent of all of our farms are milking fewer than 30 cows.  If this super-levy was to be introduced it would put 14 to 15 per cent of our producers out of business.  As a result it would contribute further to unemployment.</P>
      <P>I will finish by commending the Taoiseach for the excellent work he has done in relation to the super-levy.  I also commend the Minister for Agriculture, but particularly the Taoiseach, for his commitment and dedication and for his trips to the capitals of the EEC.  We cannot afford to have this super-levy introduced. I wish our Minister for Agriculture well in his negotiations during the coming months.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an mBille seo.  I would like to welcome this Bill and more especially the confidence it has given to An Bord Bainne to carry on their very vigorous and aggressive marketing campaign of Irish dairy products around the world. Now, more than ever, we need this type of aggressive marketing if we are to compete with our EEC partners, America and other developed countries.  Notwithstanding the constraints of the intervention system, An Bord Bainne made considerable progress in recent years.  They have developed a market that is very successful for a wide range of branded products.  We must all appreciate the fact that Kerrygold is now a familiar name in the United Kingdom, in Europe and in many parts of the world.  This is due mainly to the very aggressive, expert type of marketing carried out by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal remains to be done with the dairy industry.  In this regard there are two matters which are of particular concern to all of us.  The first one is the undeniable potential of our dairying industry to develop in the years ahead, and the second and more important one <Col N="246" /> is the pressure to change the CAP policy because of the problem of surpluses.  In 1983, 15 per cent of all the milk that was produced on Community farms was surplus. Because of this there will be pressure to change the CAP.  This will have far reaching consequences not only for Irish farmers but for the board, because if the board are to expand and obtain more markets they need milk.  If a super-levy is imposed &mdash; as previous speakers have pointed out &mdash; we will not have enough milk in order to be competitive.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to my own area, which is Kerry, and especially to Kerry Co-Op, and to point out the major disadvantage that a super-levy would have, if imposed, on a co-op like Kerry Co-Op.  From 1972 to 1978 Kerry Co-Op experienced an enormous growth of milk intake, and this was mostly from the Kerry region, which is not renowned for high quality land.  In 1978 it reached 88 million gallons.  A few factors stemmed this growth.  Some factors were natural, the very poor weather conditions we had in the summers of 1979, 1980 and 1981, and the announcement in 1978 by the then Minister, Mr. Jim Gibbons, that Kerry was designated an area for disease eradication.  This had a far-reaching effect on the amount of milk that was produced in Kerry from that period onwards, with the result that in a period of three years milk production by 1981 in Kerry had fallen to 72 million gallons from 88 million gallons, and this had a very stemming effect on future growth of Kerry Co-Op.  Being such a good company, they offset this disadvantage by diversifying into other products.</P>
    <P>Since then Kerry Co-Op have been picking up again, and last year they took in 82 million gallons.  This is still short 6 million gallons on the 1978 peak.  I would like to point out here that if a super-levy is imposed, taking the 1981 figure of 72 million gallons, it will have disastrous effects for the Kerry Co-Op and for the Kerry region that it has served so well. Besides, I think that marketing as a whole has assumed new importance, and if we are to remain competitive on the world <Col N="247" /> trade market we have to market and produce goods properly.</P>
    <P>That is why An Bord Bainne have been so successful with the marketing of its products, through Kerrygold.  I would just like to point out as well that An Bord Bainne marketed butter and butter oil from Kerry Co-Op, to the tune of some £35 million last year, and for that the people of Kerry are very much indebted to them.  I would like to conclude by saying that the future of this country is very much dependent on the future development of agriculture, and any measures that will be taken to stem the growth of agriculture will no doubt affect very much all our futures.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Senators on their wide ranging contributions. Some of them may not have been directly related to the Bill, but important nevertheless.  I appreciate that Senators do not get too many opportunities to discuss some of these very serious problems.  I was pleased that the Chair was lenient with Senators and allowed a fairly wide ranging discussion.</P>
      <P>With regard to the points raised by Senator Hussey about the widening of the scope of the borrowing, it is to include promissory notes and bills of exchange. That came, incidently, at the request of An Bord Bainne.  As well, of course, there are loans which are indeed very well defined.  Senator Smith made the point about the green rate.  The devaluation of that can only take place when the value of the Irish pound changes within the EMS.  Devaluation of the Irish pound, as he knows very well, would have fairly far reaching consequences in the whole economy.  It is a question wider than that of a green pound.  As the Senator knows, a member state is not free to change its green rate: only the Council of Ministers can do this on a proposal from the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the CAP, the system will only permit a green rate change when the central rate of the currency is changed. With regard to the MCAs, I quite agree with the Senator that we support moves <Col N="248" /> to have these dismantled, because positive MCAs in the case of Germany, the UK and other countries have had the effect of distorting the trade in agricultural goods and consequently on growth of our agricultural sales.  I share his views also with regard to the Farm Modernisation Scheme in leaving out the dairy side.  At the EEC Council yesterday there was a proposal to continue the Farm Modernisation Scheme excluding the dairy sector and our Minister voted against this because it was contrary to our views in an expanding dairy industry.</P>
    <P>The super-levy was discussed and, as I said initially, we did not cause the problem, and though we are concerned about the surpluses, our contribution to that problem was minimal.  Our gallonage is comparatively low when you compare it with any of our EEC partners, and we believe that our contribution to the solution should be minimal.  I agree that while winter milk is pretty demanding, there is no particular case made for winter milk when it comes to talking about a levy.</P>
    <P>We had many references to the National Dairy Council.  Some very good points were made with regard to school milk, something we should ask the National Dairy Council to look at.  There is the question of presenting milk in a manner that might make it more palatable. Obviously, if the milk is left sitting out on school walls it could not be good drinking after a short while.  Maybe we should ask them to look at the possibility of refrigeration.  That suggestion is an excellent one.  Flavouring of milk should be possible, and even products such as yogurt &mdash; anything to make the thing more attractive.  We are only taking up something like 1.6 million gallons against a possible 6 million gallons that are available to us.  That is something I would be keen on investigating.  The success story of another type of flavoured milk was referred to, Bailey's Cream.  This has been one of our great success stories. When it comes to diversification, whoever thought up that one did us a good turn, because practically every co-op is in on it and doing extraordinarily well.</P>
    <P>The same could be said of the various <Col N="249" /> cheeses &mdash; we should and could be developing them.  Imports were referred to there by Senator Kelleher.  The figures would not be quite as bad as he said &mdash; the £40 million in fact involves some £20 million, part of which relates to butter coming in from the North and reexported through Southern ports.  Even so, there is a £10 million import that we should not be happy with, and I certainly am not happy with it.  Much of it involves rather sophisticated cheeses, and here I see a lot of room for the major co-ops farming out some of this type of operation to small operators.  The type of cheese in question would be basically work for small groups of people who would have an interest in that and in a specialised type of cheese.  We have had some good and bad experiences with the diversification of cheese, but basically the amount and the quantities sometimes are so small as to make it very difficult to operate in the context of a big co-op.  In a hotel you pay for the comfort of the hotel, and that is all built into the price of the pint of milk, but I think it is something which should be looked at.  I agree that if we could offer milk at 20p a pint there is absolutely no good reason why they should be charging more for it.  We might appeal to them to go a bit easy on the price.</P>
    <P>The important thing is that we support this measure from all sides and the comments, as I said already, fall into three categories: one, the general climate for investment, two, the need for diversification and three, the super-levy.  I have always said that a prerequisite for success in any enterprise would be that the Government should bring inflation under control.  We have the evidence at the moment that we are succeeding in this. Borrowing was referred to here this evening. I fully appreciate that farm borrowing is a very serious problem, but the point is that the greatest gift we could offer to farmers at the moment would be to bring our inflation down and our banks rates down, consequently, to an acceptable level.</P>
    <P>On the proposals before the EEC Council of Ministers, they are the consequence of failure over many years to <Col N="250" /> increase the Community's resources on the one hand and to confront and to overcome the problem facing the CAP on the other.  Until this is done we will continue to face the unpleasantness of somewhat random measures aimed at making short-term budgetary savings. This is why a satisfactory outcome of the discussions on the super-levy and other issues is so very necessary.</P>
    <P>I am happy that everybody in the House has spoken this evening in support of the Government's efforts, and without further ado I thank Senators for their support of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Report on Penal System: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the MacBride Commission Report on the Penal System and calls on the Government to establish a commission to report on all aspects of crime, its sources and prevention, the treatment of offenders within the legal system, the operation of the prison system, alternatives to custodial treatment and the establishment of comprehensive schemes for rehabilitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say how appropriate it is that this motion would be proposed by a member of the Labour Party.  In so doing I have in mind the request of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the 1940s to the Parliament of the day that they would visit the prison in Portlaoise and the resultant publication of a report under the secretaryship of James Larkin, Junior, entitled <i>Prisons and Prisoners.</i>  That is an appropriate commencement to what <Col N="251" /> I have to say, because that visit in 1946 resulted in the establishment of the prison rules of 1947 and it has not been succeeded by visits of Members of the Oireachtas to Irish prisons.</P>
    <P>The motion before the Seanad makes reference to the MacBride Commission. I will, before I finish, make reference to the explicit recommendation of that commission. The motion reads:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann notes that MacBride Commission Report on the Penal System and calls on the Government to establish a commission to report on all aspects of crime, its sources and prevention, the treatment of offenders within the legal system, the operation of the prison system, alternatives to custodial treatment and the establishment of comprehensive schemes for rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>It was placed on the Order Paper by Senator Robinson, me and other colleagues in the Labour Party before the formation of the Whitaker Committee which was established to report on conditions in relation to prison administration. Let me make a preliminary remark in this regard.  I hope that people who are interested in this debate will be interested in extending the question of prison administration beyond industrial relations.  The press coverage of Dr. Whitaker's appointment as chairperson of the Committee to report on conditions in prisons &mdash; Mountjoy in particular &mdash; seemed to stress the industrial relations concept.  I want to emphasise that the purpose of Senator Robinson, myself and others in signing this motion is to seek an investigation of all aspects of the criminal justice system.  We are not interested simply in a resolution, within the criminal justice system, of a management problem that might be reduced to industrial relations.</P>
    <P>It is very rarely that I ask the concession of the Seanad, but I for nearly 20 years have been practising as a sociologist in the area of crime and I am disappointed that the professional people who have obstructed investigation in relation to criminological matters and matters of <Col N="252" /> justice are not present this evening to advise the Minister of State who is present on the serious matters I will be speaking about.</P>
    <P>This motion in the names of all the Labour Senators appears when there is a great deal of public reaction to the problem of crime without a great deal of commitment to understanding the nature and causes of crime.  That is a matter of the greatest importance, because when this debate is over we will be invited to a debate on a Criminal Justice Bill which strikes at the core of many principles that are held dear in relation to freedom, for example.</P>
    <P>We have a reaction in which people not willing to understand the changing nature of crime in society, the nature of the crime management problem, the nature of supervision of crime and so forth, point their fingers without any objection to the criminal justice system itself.  We here in both Houses of the Oireachtas are the people who at the end of the day have to answer the question as to the quality of justice that prevails.  We are not governed by the <i>Evening Herald,</i> we are not governed by the <i>Irish Independent</i> and we are not governed by any external source.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the question, do we know what the crime rate is?  Do we know who is involved in crime?  Do we know how the crime rate has changed between rural and urban areas?  Do we know how it has changed year by year?  Does the quality of our statistics tell us how it has changed between crimes against property and crimes involving life?  What is the connection between unemployment and crime?  What is the connection between local authority decision making in relation to the segregation of classes in local authority areas, and crime?  What are the variations on sentencing policy?  What in relation to the different layers of the criminal jurisdictional process are the variations involved?</P>
    <P>We are discussing this motion after people have decided in advance &mdash; in anticipation of the value that is to be got from it in these unfortunate reactionary times &mdash; that we will reform the criminal justice system as a reaction to the problem <Col N="253" /> of crime.  This is one of the few places where one can speak about such matters. I believe that our attitudes on crime are based on ignorance and on reaction.  I will now discuss systematically the principles of our motion.</P>
    <P>The MacBride Commission, which was formed at the invitation of the Prisoners' Rights Organisation, has been derided by a predecessor of the Minister for Justice as being self-appointed.  Why were we self-appointed?  I was a member of that commission.  We were appointed because the Department of Justice in Ireland, who have had responsibility for prisoners and crime since 1928, have been one of the most closed systems of investigation in all of this century.  I, as an academic, would have been willing to serve on any State-induced investigation, but this was not sponsored.  I ask you, Sir, to provoke in the Seanad the question as to whether anybody in this country can question the Department of Justice.  I want to make economic use of my time, but there are many things that must be questioned.</P>
    <P>This country at present is being inundated with pleas for more prisons, prison incarceration.  I ask you to bear in mind what use has been made of prisons.  We live in this country under an unrevised Children Act under which children can still be ordered to be whipped under force from the courts.  I ask the House to address itself to the history of prisons. Prison has a strange historical location. Michael Ignatieff in his book <i>A Just Measure of Pain.  The Penitentiary in the Industrial Revolution 1750-1850</i> tells about</P>
    <P>William Towens, 12 years of age; 4'5½&rdquo;, brown eyes, brown hair, born in Richmond, unmarried, no visible distinguishing marks, Place of Residence, 9 Botron's Place, New Richmond. Convicted at Richmond Summary Sessions, 20 December 1872, of simple larceny of two live tame rabbits.  Sentence 1 month hard labour, Wandsworth Prison, Wandsworth Prisoners Register, 1872.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that I did not have to invite people in a parliamentary assembly in Ireland to the vicissitudes of the <Col N="254" /> prison system, but apparently in 1984 there are people who go around the place saying that we need more prisons and the mechanisms for sending people faster to prison.  There is a literature on this subject. The most honourable of groups, The Quakers, believed in the Philadelphia system, the importance of solitary confinement where a man could make his peace with God.  They believed in secluding the proved evil-possessed prisoners. They have had the courage and the tremendous integrity to say that they have revised previous views Quakers had held on the prison system.  Here we are not willing to ask why we have people in prison, why we have prisons of the kind we have, what prison accomplishes. What are important to us are more prisons, speedier laws, speedier criminal processes through which people can be speeded to prison.</P>
    <P>I must recover myself, Sir, lest people suggest that my arguments are emotional. I repeat that my experience is that I have been lecturing in this country longer than anybody on deviance, law and society and I have found our Department of Justice to be the most unreceptive group of people that I can possibly think of in relation to thinking about crime, punishment, punitive treatments and their alternatives.  I will now be explicit.  I note that there is nobody present in this House to answer these detailed questions.  Is anybody present to answer the question about the true rate of crime? There is the true rate of crime and there is the <i>Evening Herald</i> rate of crime. Which do we believe should be a foundation for policy?</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that the gathering of statistics in relation to Irish crime is primitive in every aspect.  For example, the sources of statistics that are available to us through the Garda Síochána make it impossible to differentiate between the number of crimes attributable to any individual and particularly the number of crimes attributable to different socio-economic groups.  There is an absence of research that cannot be sustained.  Different people have asked that we have access, for example, to the prison process, to the whole experience of prison.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> There is not in existence a study, other than novelistic accounts of the experience of prison.  I thought seriously about this and I considered whether I should, for example, after nearly 20 years, invite the Seanad to consider statistics in detail.  I ended up with a decision of my own that I would speak about incarceration.  We have had a disgraceful drawing of a curtain over a period of institutionalisation. When I was a member of the MacBride Commission evidence was admitted to me of a boy of the age of seven sentenced to Clonmel.  He said:</P>
    <P>When I was seven I was sent to Clonmel school by Justice Kennedy.  I was in it for nine years.  The brothers and priests were very nice to me on my first day.  A few months went by and things began to get rough.  At that time I had a habit of wetting the bed.  Myself and a few lads were told if we wet the bed we would be put into girls dresses.  It happened that myself and my brother and a few of the lads wet the bed and were put into dresses and told to go to school in them.  We had no choice or else we would get slapped with a leather strap.  This kept going on for a while and we couldn't stop wetting the bed so they started putting us to bed at 6 o'clock in the evening as well as being slapped.  We got no pocket money at the end of the week.</P>
    <P>I mention this evidence because I believe it is a function of people like myself to speak on behalf of all of those people who have been incarcerated.  I raised a whole series of questions as to what we are about in the Department of Justice.  I feel very angry that the Minister for Justice is not here to reply to questions that I asked many years ago to which I did not receive very satisfactory replies.  One asked what procedures are afoot to amend the gathering of statistics to know what the true crime rate is so that the people who are interested in the operation of the criminal justice system will be even able to observe the criminal statistics.</P>
    <P>I would remind this House that we are not speaking of expenditure.  We will in <Col N="256" /> this year spend £300 million on the operation of the Department of Justice.  I ask this House, particularly Members opposite, to consider that unexamined the crime rate, unexamined the social and economic background to it, unexamined the connection between the youth unemployment rate and the crime rate, the other House have waved on the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
    <P>Do you realise, Sir, what this means? Unwilling to ask the nature of the causes of crime, unwilling to pose the question about the operation of the criminal justice system, this House is likely in a few months to be asked to vote for a new Bill which will acknowledge all the faults of the system that we have refused to acknowledge.  This is a monstrous abdication of responsibility.</P>
    <P>There are different elements in our motion.  I want to dispose of a few of them in the time that is left to me.  I was a member of the MacBride Commission. We succinctly summarised our report.

      <P>I want to rise on a point of order.  Firstly, I remind the Senator that it is out of order to refer either to the absence or the presence of anyone in this House.  If necessary, I can explain that the Minister for Justice is engaged in another place dealing also with the question of a Private Members' Motion.  The Minister is prepared to take part in this debate at a later stage.  He is not ignoring the motion and he is not ignoring what is being said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much on the subject.  I have repeated it more than once to different Ministers, I can assure you.  We need information on the true crime rate.  There is very clear evidence that the real crime rate is not what the media portray it to be.  This means that the media are operating on a principle of fear.  The principle of fear seeds in turn a political reaction which is perceived by people who want to justify reactions that would not otherwise be sustainable as reforms of the criminal justice system.  I repeat my demand for evidence of what the true crime rate is as between urban and rural areas, socio-economic classes and so forth.</P>
      <P>I want to raise the question of the operation of the legal system.  In any democracy one must ask what chances one has before the law.  I must, as a practising sociologist, ask the Leader of the Seanad if, as a member of the university community, he would state where the studies of the experience of the poorer sections of the community within the legal system have been carried out. The answer is that they hardly exist and the reason is that the Irish Department of Justice is one of the most obstructive in Europe.  I said this in the other House and I repeat it in this House.  After 20 years asking for answers, can we not have some more forthcoming gestures from them?  I will go on from that.  I must be specific about these matters.  What information have we on sentencing policy? The answer is scarcely none, because people imagine that sentencing is almost above scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have very little time available to me but I want to answer a question that will be raised, in advance.  No doubt there will be those who will say that in approaching the problem of crime you have a choice between the soft liberals who believe that environment is everything and those who believe: will the little 90 year old woman with the handbag from whom three shillings and fourpence was robbed be the defining characteristic? I want to give the lie to this.  There are those of us in the institutions who have <Col N="258" /> wanted research for 20 years, who were within days of establishing an institute for criminological research, who were obstructed by the Department of Justice. There is left hanging over this debate questions like this: what is the true crime rate?  What are the differences between the crime rate in urban and rural areas? What are the different experiences between alternatives within the prison system?  What are the experiences of people in court?  May I end by saying the best and most practical example is to put yourself in the position of a new person involved in the crime statistics?  We have had adult crime statistics and we have had juvenile crime statistics.  But everybody knows that the youth unemployment figures will and do affect the crime rate.  What procedures, what institutions, what mechanisms exist even what statistical mechanisms exist to handle the young adult crime statistic?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it like this &mdash; in one minute &mdash; we have chosen not to know about crime and we have indulged in prejudices.  We have no mechanisms for handling the contribution of the new expanding youth unemployment statistics to the crime rate.  I have one minute left to speak about the degradation of imprisonment.  May I say, Sir, I have spent two decades studying prisons?  I have been interested to know what people have hung on to in the prison system.  It was a visit by the Labour Party in 1946 that produced a change in the prison regulations for the prison regulations of 1947.  But there is something in the concept of prison that everybody concerned in this debate appears to be missing, that is the justification of prison.  In this country in the last century we did not have prisons for the first half: we mutilated people; we exported people to the different new colonial countries and Tasmania. And when we had prisons we never asked the question: why do we want prisons?  I believe that prisons are a degradation of humanity.  There is available to commentators in Ireland that <Col N="259" /> they have ignored the position about prisons, that you remove somebody away from their normal conditions of privacy.</P>

      <P>I believe we have not come to terms with the concept of imprisonment. I want to invite the thoughts of Members of the Seanad to the process of the potting out in the morning.  Most prison systems have insisted on this, that one remove the pot into which one's urine had been excreted, that one parade with it.  This is not something we should brush aside.  It has been regarded as central in the prison system.  Do we want to hang on to this?</P>
      <P>I end by making this suggestion &mdash; the evolution of the prison system is coincidental with the industrial system.  When the consort of the monarch and the different industrialists came and celebrated the opening of Pentonville and said a hallelujah because of the way you could order so many bodies in space and time, my argument is this: here we are in 1984; how shabby we are, no options beyond prison; they are not in practice; members of the Department of Justice not very interested even in being in attendance. My view is this: failure in detection, failure in the management of crime, failure in any philosophy of contention.  What then do we turn to?  &mdash; towards addressing the very basis of the criminal justice system itself.</P>

      <P>I have great pleasure in seconding this motion because it enables me to join with my colleague, Senator M. Higgins, in drawing the attention of the House to the importance of the subject we are debating.  It is one of the most important social areas, it is one of the most compelling areas, because, in this particular area, we as a community deprive others of their freedom and also because it concerns the protection of sections of the community.  Therefore, it is an extremely important area.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of the Labour Party motion which was tabled was to invite the Seanad to look at the subject broadly. That has been the theme that has run through the speech of the proposer of the motion.  We invite Members to look in a broad context at the whole area, not just of penal law or prison reform, but of the criminal justice system and of the context of crime itself.  I share with Senator M. Higgins a conviction that we are sadly lacking in proper priorities in this area, in empirical research, in sheer knowledge of the whole area we are examining.  As a result, there has not been a proper monitoring of or attention paid to this area.  Therefore we must welcome an opportunity in this House to look at it within the time limits of a motion in the Seanad and within the very limited contribution that any individual can make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion refers to the report of the MacBride Commission which was compiled in 1980, published in paperback in 1982 and which hopefully Members of the Seanad have an opportunity of examining. It was a voluntary effort because, at the time, there was no desire at the official level to look into this area.  There was no political will to divert public resources into carrying out this examination. So it was voluntary and, if the term is to be used let it be used, self-appointed. What is wrong with voluntary, self-appointed interest in a most <Col N="261" /> vital area of the social framework of our society?</P>
    <P>The motion notes the recommendations of that report and calls for a very broad examination, calls on the Government to establish a commission to report on all aspects of crime, its sources and prevention, treatment of offenders within the legal system, the operation of the prison system, alternative custodial treatment and the establishment of comprehensive schemes for rehabilitation. Since that motion was tabled, many months ago now, there has been a step taken.  In its way it is a welcome step because it is the first step of this kind that has taken place &mdash; the establishment of the Government inquiry to be chaired by Dr. Whitaker, a very distinguished former Member of this House.</P>
    <P>I am concerned &mdash; and Senator M. Higgins has already expressed his concern &mdash; about what we read to be the terms of reference and the scope of this inquiry.  Obviously one important benefit of having this debate is to invite the Minister, in making his contribution and responding to the debate, to give the House further details of what he envisages to be the scope of the inquiry.  The terms of reference were published in the newspapers on 1 February this year, the decision to establish the inquiry having been announced on 31 January, 1984. The terms of reference are as follows:</P>
    <P>To examine the law in regard to imprisonment and related areas with a view to establishing whether (1) a reduction in the number of persons being committed and (2) a shortening of the periods of committal generally and /or the period served can be achieved.</P>
    <P>To evaluate the adequacy in capacity and range of the existing accommodation for prisoners, particularly for female prisoners and juvenile detainees and the planned additions and improvements to it.</P>
    <P>To examine all aspects of the regimes observed in the institutions and the facilities available to prisoners and detainees on their release from custody.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> To consider (a) the number and deployment of prison officer staff; (b) the management structure relating to the operation of the institutions; (c) the recruitment and training of Prison Service staff; (d) Staff Management relations in the prison system; (e) to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Committee should have regard in particular to the increase in the number of persons being committed to the prisons and places of detention and to the escalating costs of providing and maintaining those institutions.</P>
    <P>As I read those terms of reference, they seem to me to be a kind of cost-effective study, on industrial relations exercise. How do we, simply by looking at it in a very myopic limited way, ascertain if we can cut down the cost?  Indeed the thrust of what the Minister appears to have said in the press statement when the terms of reference of this inquiry were published is very much related to the cost.  He points out &mdash; and it is very significant &mdash; that the average cost of keeping any person in custody is £443 per day.  That would be per day of a 365-day year; that would be how that average would be worked out. That is an enormous cost to the taxpayer and to the community.  That is certainly worth paying attention to.</P>
    <P>Apart from the burden, in money terms, of spending £443 per day to keep a person in custody, I am convinced, Senator M. Higgins is convinced and the proposers of this motion are convinced that we keep too many people in custody, that we unnecessarily deprive people of their liberty at £443 per day.  That is not to say that we are not prepared to look at the nature of crime, the extent of crime, the control of crime and the protection of vulnerable sections of our society.  That is a related but different part of the problem. What we are concerned about is to ensure that the way in which the problem is approached by society is a properly balanced and appropriate way of coping with a problem.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the present system is so unsatisfactory is that, as a society, we have not looked at the problem, we have not carried out the proper evaluation <Col N="263" /> from which to draw the conclusions which would lead to a proper approach to the system.  But we do know &mdash; and it is worth putting it on record &mdash; that the problem manifests itself very seriously. Again I will use the Minister's own figures in his description of the scope of the problem.  In the press coverage of what the Minister said in announcing the inquiry, he recalled that in 1970, there were 264 prison officers looking after an average of 749 prisoners, whereas in 1983, there were 1,560 prison officers looking after an average 1,418 prisoners, that is 1,418 prisoners at a cost, per person in custody, of £443 per day.  Therefore the overall cost of the prison system went up from £4.37 million in 1973 to £46 million in 1984.  It jumped by that quantum leap from £4.37 million to £46 million in just over a decade.  That is something we must look at.  We are not getting value for our money.  We may be paying a great deal of money but, it is not the right kind of expenditure and is not for proper social reasons.  But it is a very significant expenditure.</P>
    <P>When the annual prison population figures were published by the Department for 1982 there was an accompanying statement pointing out that the prison population had risen by 17 per cent in 1983 over the 1982 figures.  Therefore, we have a problem of a rise in our prison population, of those in custodial care. We have also got increasing evidence of overcrowding which is leading to the necessity for releases from jails.  The person I am quoting on this is the Minister for Justice, Mr. Noonan, from a report in <i>The Irish Times</i>, 5 May 1983 when he referred to the fact that jails in the Republic are now so full that 1,200 prisoners had to be released in the previous year without completing their sentences, solely to make room for offenders convicted of more serious crimes, that sometimes they had to be released within days of being sentenced to prison.  So the system is working very badly.  It is not an efficient system, it is a very costly system, and, we will attempt to explain, it is a system which has evolved without any proper evaluation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> I would like to refer to the approach suggested in a paper delivered to a social study conference in Galway in 1980 at which there were a number of papers on the subject of the offender and the community, another example of voluntary study and examination of this area in the absence of any official-based or official-backed examination and study of it.  The papers presented at that Galway conference have since been published under the title &ldquo;The Offender and the Community.&rdquo; Certainly I would suggest to any Senators who have a particular interest in this area that those papers are very well worth studying.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to and indeed adopt the approach suggested by Professor C. Kevin Boyle of the Law Faculty of University College, Galway of how we should approach crime and devise a criminal justice system and a custodial system, where necessary, and other ways of combating the social problem of crime. To begin with, we must look at the problem properly.  He makes a very good point in opening which I would like to refer to.  He says on page 13 under the heading &ldquo;The Legal Framework of Penal Practice and Policy&rdquo; of this publication and I quote:</P>
    <P>Discussions about crime, like discussions about most subjects, tend, first of all, to reflect the standpoint of the speakers taking part.  Crime touches to a greater or lesser degree the whole community, and it is not surprising that there should be many different responses to it.  But the separate perspectives that are to be found on how to explain crime and how to deal with it often fail to allow any overall approach to emerge.</P>
    <P>We need to develop a more integrated perspective on the subject of crime as a whole.  The atomising of practice, research and experience, particularly among the agencies responding to crime, has led to incoherence over objectives and a failure to consider at a more inclusive level how adequate and how acceptable is our approach to crime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Professor Boyle then goes on, in his paper, to show that lawyers look at crime from one sort of perspective &mdash; the prosecution of crime, what happens before a court, what happens if the offender pleads guilty or what happens if there is an actual trial.  They are not concerned about what happens afterwards.  Nor are judges particularly concerned about what happens afterwards whereas the prison service are only concerned about what happens when the person lands on their door and so on.</P>
      <P>Professor C. Kevin Boyle is critical of our system.  I share his criticism.  He is critical to a very substantial degree.  For example on page 18 of that publication he says:</P>
      <P>The penal system and the criminal justice system in the Republic of Ireland can best be likened to a legal museum in which the Victorian room is the largest and most prominent.  What would the Irish revolutionaries who suffered the ignominy of penal servitude in English prisons think of the fact that 60 years on, in an independent Irish state, we still retain that concept and impose it on our courts?  Our laws are archaic and full of anomalies.  They are intelligible, if at all, only to lawyers.  In a democracy, law, and particularly the criminal law, should be comprehensible to the ordinary citizen.  We fail on that test of democracy.  We have achieved very little by way of localising our law and instead continue to work through outdated codes and concepts long discarded in the country where they originated, Britain.</P>

Senator Robinson put forward many very valid points in her seconding of this motion which certainly need to be looked into.  I hope we have advanced somewhat from the Charles Dickens era to which Senator M. Higgins referred when he quoted passages concerning the treatment of prisoners.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly hope that the whipping of children, in prison or anywhere else, would be illegal and morally wrong.</P>
      <P>This is a very broad motion, calling on the Government to establish a commission to report on all aspects of crime. Crime in itself is the major problem, leading to the problems we encounter in prisons. These are difficult problems for this or any Government, any system, any police force or army to cope with.  If we were to examine the alternatives to custodial treatment and the establishment of schemes for rehabilitation that would certainly take more than 15 minutes, under the terms of the motion as it stands. Nevertheless we should all welcome the opportunity to voice our opinions and perhaps put forward suggestions as to what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike Senator M. Higgins I am not sufficiently familiar with the MacBride Commission Report on this penal system but I see many dark, many grey areas we should examine.  We must look at the reason for crime.  We all know the old adage: prevention is better than cure.  We must face the fact that we have major problems in this country.  They are interrelated with the crime problems obtaining <Col N="267" /> today.  I firmly believe that the system we have with regard to crime prevention must be examined, it must get a new injection of life and be geared towards a different area than that at which it is at present geared.  Youth unemployment, social deprivation, these are the causes of the crime problems obtaining in the country today.  Not alone is there youth unemployment but there is also adult unemployment.  We must ask ourselves: what value are we getting for the expenditure of £300 million by the Department of Justice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We must examine the role we give the Garda.  For instance, is it right that the Garda must check dog licences, car taxes, the local publican to ensure that he closes his premises at a specified time while, at the same time, having no authority to walk into private clubs where people can enjoy various luxuries until all hours of the morning?  It must be remembered that at the same time in many urban areas, indeed in many rural isolated areas, vandals and thugs are robbing and plundering old people, indeed, in some cases, even murdering them.</P>
      <P>I am sure everyone will agree with me that our legal system is a very fair one, that we live in a great democratic society. Yet I firmly believe it is tied up to such a degree that it is very hard to move it, and, when it does move, it does so very slowly.  That is one very grey area that warrants examination.  It is one area that could certainly become more cost-effective.</P>
      <P>I am sure many Senators will have many things to say with regard to the alternatives to custodial treatment.  Many people have suggested that people convicted of serious crime should be rehabilitated through remedial environmental work and so on.  As we are aware the prison system has been under stress recently through overcrowding, with conditions which some people say have improved tremendously but which others contend warrant much improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> I cannot but observe how the crime rate has grown in this country since I was a young boy, when times were tough and people had to work for a living, when the social services were almost nil.  The most important thing in rural Ireland where I was reared, and I am sure this applied also to the urban areas, was to ensure that one had enough to eat, and could clothe oneself but to my knowledge the crime rate was very low.  The prison system then was definitely worse than it is now but the crime rate was very, very low.  Any major crime at that period would be talked about for weeks, months and perhaps years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to express a viewpoint on this most important motion which is put down in the names of the members of the Labour Party.  It seeks to encourage the Government to establish a commission to report on a number of things which I will deal with later, and also suggests that Seanad Éireann should take note of the MacBride Commission Report on the penal system.</P>
      <P>First and foremost, I think the groundwork has been properly laid by the proposer of the motion, indicating the nature of the MacBride Commission and the nature of the conclusions which they drew.  It is appropriate that Seanad Éireann should consider the problems associated with crime and the resources of crime and its prevention.  It is a little too glib to suggest that crime is in some way automatically associated with the political troubles in Ireland or that all our problems are associated with political violence.  There is what appears to be quite independently of that growing up a point of view and an ethos in society which is indicative of a view that the rules within society do not need to be kept. There does not seem to be much evidence so far that imprisoning people encourages them not to commit the crime in the first place or encourages them not to repeat that crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we should underestimate the fact that irrespective of how enlightened our system is or irrespective of whether or not we put people to prison, in the long run as long as people have freedom of action and have the freedom which is associated with a democratic society there will be some people who <Col N="270" /> will either throughout their lives or at some time during their lives make the choice that obeying the rules of society is not attractive to them at that time.  Therefore, no matter how enlightened our system is, we are not going to do away with crime or the necessity for considering the way in which those who offend against the law of the land should be dealt with. Ultimately every person is faced every day and every week of their lives with the decision that they will obey the law or they will not.  While the social conditions which we create may encourage people to obey the law, they certainly cannot guarantee that, and there will always be crime.  Therefore, we must recognise the need for a system of dealing with that crime.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for an examination by a commission of the sources and prevention of crime and that is appropriate.  With regard to the recently announced inquiry into the prison service, it is also appropriate at this time to consider whether it has a part to play in this or whether the terms of reference could be expanded to include and to move along towards this objective which I think most of us would share.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a very important point.  The terms of reference which the Government have laid out &mdash; I am indebted to my colleague, Senator Robinson, for having made it available to me &mdash; appear to be restricted.  They suggest certain areas should be examined and, it is right that they should be examined. No serious objection could be made to the decision to have these areas examined, but this commission, or some other commission, should expand the consideration to include a much more fundamental examination of the method by which offenders should be treated whether inside or outside prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have asked the inquiry to examine the law in relation to imprisonment with a view to establishing whether a reduction in the number of people being committed and a shortening <Col N="271" /> of the periods of committal generally and of the periods served can be achieved.  It is that area of the terms of reference which can be expanded by the commission itself on the suggestion of the Government to include a fundamental examination of the use of prisons and punishment such as imprisonment in our penal system.  That is capable of expansion without any formal change in the terms of reference but I think some indication from the Minister along those lines would be helpful.  It then carries on to talk about the adequacy of capacity and means of existing accommodation.  That really is almost a mechanical thing and I do not think it is worthy of a commission headed by such a distinguished man that the consideration of these matters should be restricted to the mere capacity to contain people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that most comments have been that more prisons are the reaction to more crime, which is an unsustainable suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of Senator Higgins' view in that regard, and it is a view I share.  I look forward to the opportunity of working with him along those lines in due course.  In so far as these terms of reference are concerned, it appears to me that in this portion the terms of reference are very narrowly defined.  I do not think it is worthy of the general terms of reference which are outlined in the first part, which I have already mentioned.</P>
      <P>It also seeks to examine all aspects of the régime observed in the institutions and the facilities available to prisoners and detainees on their release from custody. I think that particular paragraph is well capable of being expanded to include the most fundamental reassesment of the prison régime and the way in which prisoners are rehabilitated or, alternatively, are not rehabilitated by their stay in prison.  That, again, is a very positive and helpful aspect of the terms of reference, and I think we should encourage the Minister to encourage those who are involved in this inquiry to spend a long time on that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> The next portion is to examine the number and redeployment of prison officers. That has more in common with the second portion, which really deals only with the mechanical organisation of the prison and, as such, is not worthy of a commission headed by such a distinguished man.  No doubt it could be examined, but the other matters are more fundamental and more important. Therefore, what is requested in this motion, the seeds of the examination which is requested in this motion, are contained in the terms of reference which the Minister has recently given to this inquiry.  I hope that the Minister in responding would consider for our information how these terms of reference face into the very desirable objective set out in the motion which is before us.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention a few things which struck me on the MacBride Commission Report, which I read in full, but unfortunately we do not have the opportunity of reading it in full here and reading it into the record tonight.  One aspect was central to the whole discussion and the whole case, and that is contained in chapter 4 which deals with alternatives to Prisons and the Rehabilitation of Prisoners. In that chapter is summarised what is necessary for the rehabilitation of prisoners in the view of the people involved there, and I think, while not obviously restricting itself to those particular headings, any examination of the penal system must consider the various points mentioned within Chapter 4 of that report and, in particular, the four categories contained in the heading under Main Conditions of Rehabilitation on page 73 of that report.</P>
    <P>That is the kernel of the matter.  It talks about continuous social and personal contact with family and friends in so far as it is possible to reduce the social isolation of the prisoner while in prison. Here we have to examine why a person is in prison.  It does not make much sense to put a person into prison as a punishment and in addition to putting him into a prison as a punishment to inflict a further punishment on him while he is in prison.  Cutting a person off from social contact is giving him two forms of punishment; <Col N="273" /> one is the punishment of being there in the first place, and the second is the punishment of losing contact with his niche in society.</P>

      <P>Would the Senator allow a point of order or a point raised in relation to what he is saying, because we passed in July last a Bill that took another alternative approach to that, the Criminal Justice Community Service Act, and this is not being brought in?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the full opportunity of developing this I would go on from an examination of the condition of those who are detained within the prison system.</P>

      <P>Is that before or after the interruptions?  I would hate to be lying on the floor after having been knocked out in the boxing ring and you counting ten seconds.  Yes, I am on injury time, I understand.</P>
      <P>If I had the opportunity of developing it I would go along from the examination purely of the penal system itself to the examination of the point raised by Senator Robinson, that there are alternative systems which certainly cannot be exclusively used but can be implemented.  That is very important, and certainly an explanation by the Minister in that regard would be most helpful.  The social and personal contact is very important and it is brought out in this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>And the justification for prison?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is even more fundamental, but I am assuming for the <Col N="274" /> moment at this point of my discussion that there is some justification in some cases and at some time for prison.  There is also the examination of living conditions which is reasonable.  Unless people are living in reasonable conditions there will be a reaction that will be both negative in terms of the organisation of the system itself and in terms of the rehabilitation of the offender.</P>
      <P>In the first category comes the very important point of the consideration which should be given to the sexual needs of married/unmarried people in prison. That is an area of great sensitivity and an area in which a further important examination should be made in the Irish context. I think people who are separated from their family and spouses for a long period of time are entitled to expect that the ordinary social contact should have added to it the contact which is exclusive and peculiar to the status of matrimony.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, there is a letter in the appendix to the report which is quoting the Minister for Justice of the day which denies the representativeness of the people who were the authors of the report, and in the reply the Minister should advert to that fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that I have only three minutes and five seconds left and the difficulty of the Chair in that regard, but I think these are some of the points which need to be considered, not only by the Seanad this evening and in the Adjournment debate, whenever that might be, but also to be considered by the Minister in his contribution to the debate.  They should also be considered in the wider context by whatever commission or inquiry the Government should give the task of examining both the matters contained in the inquiry they have set up and also the expanded and improved terms which could be read into or added to those by the incorporation of at least some of these items contained in the excellent motion which is before us this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in total agreement <Col N="275" /> with the motion.  However, I feel that we will have more time to go into those aspects in greater depth when the Criminal Justice Bill comes before this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disciplining anybody or reflecting on anybody.  I simply want to say that I believe that on this motion we are restricted as regards time and I do not think there is any possibility of going into any of these problems in any great depth.  We will have that opportunity when the Criminal Justice Bill comes before this House.</P>
      <P>Senator Higgins stated in his eloquent contribution that what we needed was an investigation into all aspects of the criminal justice system, and this possibility will be given to us when we get an opportunity of discussing the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
      <P>I will quote from page nine of &ldquo;Crime and Punishment&rdquo; which was edited by Seán MacBride where he states:</P>
      <P>Neither the moral decadence of the age nor the climate of violence in which we live could excuse our failure to scrutinise the effectiveness or otherwise of our existing penal system.  Leaving aside questions of Christian morality relating to justice and charity, there are many practical reasons which necessitate an objective review of our penal system.  Our prison population, standing at 1,200 prisoners with another 1,600 persons on probation, represents a 200 per cent increase in our prison population since 1960.  In 1970-1971 we spent £603,028 on our prison system.  In 1979 we spent £13,125,906 on our prison system excluding the Curragh prison and Loughan House.  This represents an increase of some 600 per cent.  We are planning to spend between £10 and £20 million on building additional prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> Is this vast expenditure serving any useful purpose or is it merely perpetuating a system which breeds recidivism? In 1978 out of a total expenditure of £9,489,948 on our prison system only £35,819 was spent on prison educational services.  Does this represent an acceptable level of educational endeavour necessary for the integration into society of the most educationally deprived segment of our population?</P>
    <P>I believe education is most important and as I said in the House before, adult education is very important.  The vocational education system is providing a very good service in the area of adult education.  In County Meath, where I am familiar with the system and the progress that is being made, much is being done in this area. Members of the travelling community can attend adult education classes free of charge; unemployed people can attend the adult education classes at a nominal fee and this is done in a way that is not degrading as far as those people are concerned. To make the adult education system work better more finance must be made available.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to make greater progress without more finance, because while within the system it is possible to provide these services it can only be done at the expense of something else.  While I want to pay tribute to adult education &mdash; particularly the adult educational officer in County Meath, Jim Marsden, for the work he has done in his marvellous report on providing employment for the unemployed &mdash; I think that without more finance not much more can be done.  I strongly recommend that, if possible, more finance should be given in this area.</P>
    <P>As I said before, two of the greatest problems with which we have to deal are unemployment and housing and, as I also stated before, and I will not go into it again, I believe that by marrying the two problems together in a large measure we would solve both.  More time should be spent examining this possibility on the lines that I suggested.  I am devoting more time to examination of this problem and to making more suggestions myself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> With regard to unemployment, statistics mean very little.  When we talk or speak of 200,000 unemployed I do not think it registers in the way it would if we walk into a house and see two or three young men unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Or women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to refer to women.  I have gone into houses and seen young men walking around unshaved and unwashed with nothing to work for and nothing to look forward to.  I have seen young girls who are unemployed also, and it is a sorry situation.  This picture strikes at our heart more than reading about the large number unemployed.  It is a tragedy, and something will have to be done about it very soon.</P>
      <P>With regard to housing, we also have a major problem.  In my capacity as a councillor people come to me asking me to do something about getting housing for them from the county council or the urban district council.  While on many occasions I say that there is nothing I can do, often, I do not have the heart to say that.  This is especially so in cases where a mother comes pleading for her son who is married and has one or two children. Unemployment and housing will have to be dealt with very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, as Senator Higgins said, the prison systems are a degradation.  Again, in statistical form they do not strike us as much as when we are dealing with some of these people on a personal basis.  I had occasion to preside as a peace commissioner at a court where I had to sign a form committing a young man to prison. I told him that I had no alternative but to do my duty, and he understood.  But we came out on the landing and he met his wife and children and his little girl threw her arms around his neck and said &ldquo;Daddy, don't leave me&rdquo; and my heart bled for that man, that child and that family, and it still bleeds.  I certainly do not believe that prisons are the answer, particularly for young people.  There are so many young people released from prison after a short period of time not because of the system but because there <Col N="278" /> is no accommodation for them in the prisons.  While I have the greatest sympathy for all of these people, I also want to look at the other end where, for example, in County Meath we have had robberies in a number of towns.  In Athboy the local people had to form a group to patrol the town at night and if they saw anything suspicious they reported the matter to the Garda.  They are not vigilantes but they found it necessary to do this to protect their property.</P>
    <P>In Kells we have many robberies.  We had a robbery in one shop and the people were apprehended and neighbours were telling them to get away but they stayed and they filled their van with clothing. They got away, but luckily they were apprehended before they got to Dublin. We have the same problem in Athy where people who were spotted persisted in completing the robbery and getting away with the spoils.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest compassion and understanding and patience for those people, and this is necessary as well as material help.  I remember on one occasion hearing an elderly man speaking about young miscreants and saying that they should be whipped to within an inch of their lives, but somebody else in the company said that is very well until they happen to be your own children.  This is the way we all should look at the problem. It is hard to understand why in this Christian country where the driving force in Christian doctrine is the mystical body of Christ, we do not do more for those people.  We are taught, but we do not put into practice, that we should see the person of Our Saviour in each individual we meet, whoever that person may be.  I recall from my schooldays verses from the poem &ldquo;She is somebody's mother, boys, you know, although she is feeble, old and slow&rdquo;.  I think the same applies to young people, they are somebody's sons or somebody's daughters.  They all have somebody who cares for them or cares for them at some time.  Every human being is entitled to a minimum standard of human comfort and dignity, not simply as a charity but as a basic right.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that in human <Col N="279" /> terms no one is hopeless.  I strongly support the motion and look forward to dealing with all the different aspects in detail when the Criminal Justice Bill will come before us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I raise this matter is not so much that I feel the Garda are stepping beyond the lines of their role, but that a small number of gardaí are going beyond the role they have to play. This small section are about to bring ill-repute on the rest of the Garda which they should not have laid on them.  It was not to create nuisance or such that I tried to raise this matter last week.</P>
      <P>I tried to raise it because I believe that the rights of the citizens are being put at risk by the actions of some of these individuals. As I said at the start, I am not blaming 99 per cent of the Garda.  In my opinion they are the finest men who walk our streets, but there is that section who have crept into it and who are going beyond their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two items to which I wish to refer are, the questioning of two people from Leitrim in Monaghan Garda station <Col N="280" /> inside the past fortnight and a number of house searches which have taken place in South Leitrim inside the past month or six weeks.  The manner of arrest of the people who were questioned in Monaghan, in my opinion, leaves a lot to be desired.  Both people were arrested while they were going about their lawful business.  Not alone that, but one of them was arrested by two gardaí who were in an unmarked car.  What annoys me about that is that we know that out there in the streets there are at least 13 or 14 Garda uniforms which were taken in the past six months.  How were the persons concerned to know that the two gardaí responsible for the arrest were strictly gardaí?</P>
    <P>If they wished to arrest one of the individuals concerned they could have continued to tail her to her home and then arrest her.  Rather than do that, they decided that they should arrest her along the side of the road and take her to the local Garda station.  From there not alone did they take her from Carrick-on-Shannon Garda station to Monaghan but they took her from the Sligo division to the Cavan-Monaghan division of the Garda. I am beginning to wonder if Monaghan Garda station is about to be made the Castlereagh of the South, because we all know what goes on in Castlereagh in the North.  I would hope that what I have to say today will not be taken personally by any of the Garda, because there is no doubt they were acting under orders.</P>
    <P>One of the people taken to Monaghan Garda station was on an errand for her family.  She was arrested early in the morning but her family were not informed until 5 o'clock that evening. Anybody knows that it is totally wrong that it should be left so long to notify a family.  It would be different if it had been hard to find the family to notify them, but a call to the local Garda station would have taken only five minutes to make. Indeed it was not the local Garda station that notified her parents but a Garda station ten miles away from where she lives, the Garda station to which she was taken.</P>
    <P>When these people were taken to Monaghan Garda station and questioned <Col N="281" /> they were asked some very unusual questions, questions which would be more becoming to somebody who is interrogated in Northern Ireland, questions with innuendo that you were this and you were that and you know something.  Those sort of questions are accusations and without foundation and without any reason to make them.  That is the type of tactic that is used in Northern Ireland.  I know one person who was interrogated in Northern Ireland and the very same type of questions were put.  You are told that you were in such a place, that your fingerprints were found somewhere else and that your car was seen somewhere else. Those sort of accusations are not the sort of questions and accusations that should be made by gardaí.  The Garda have the right to question anybody they like but they should at least be factual in their questioning.</P>
    <P>Some of the treatment given to the people in Monaghan when they were being questioned is undesirable.  There are allegations that one of those persons was beaten.  That allegation I will not stand for if there is not medical evidence, but I am told there is medical evidence available if the Government, the Minister for Justice or the Garda Commissioner wish to have that evidence investigated. Both of those people are prepared to make sworn statements if need be to the Garda or to the Garda Commissioner with regard to the treatment they received in Monaghan Garda station.</P>
    <P>The sort of treatment that they received is not what one would expect. They were questioned continually, kept awake at night, lights left on all night so that they could not sleep.  They were not given food for long periods.  As I said earlier, accusation after accusation were made against them &mdash; an accusation that nitroglycerine had been found in their cars and that the Garda were telephoning the DPP to arrange for a hearing at the Special Criminal Court to see if the woman would admit that she was involved.  She claimed, and I believe it, that she was not involved in any subversive activity.</P>
    <P>The gardaí who are carrying out this type of questioning are not doing anything <Col N="282" /> for the Garda authorities.  They are giving the ordinary people in the street reason to fear if they are to be questioned by any of those in the Special Task Force, as they are called.  These special units remind me of a little organisation we had from 1973 to 1977, known as &ldquo;The Heavy Gang&rdquo;.  It looks as if they have been reborn &mdash; and we know the damage that they did to the Garda while their activities went unhindered in that period.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the Government to ask the Garda Commissioner to carry out a full inquiry into these accusations; to interview the people concerned and to ask them if they are prepared, which I am told they are, to make sworn statements of what happened to them in Monaghan Garda station.  The Minister is well aware that if the confidence of the people in the Garda is undermined the amount of co-operation they will receive in the future will be greatly damaged.</P>
    <P>One other thing annoyed me with regard to the arrests.  There was an accusation that one of those arrested had made a telephone call to Canada on a certain date.  We have had accusations about telephone calls and telephone tapping for the past 18 months and we have heard the Minister for Justice state that that was not the case.  They could actually tell this person that she was in the company of somebody who had made a telephone call to Canada on a certain date.  I would like to know is there telephone tapping going on at the moment as far as telephone calls made by certain individuals from public telephones are concerned.</P>
    <P>In Monaghan Garda station an air-blower was left on with one of the prisoners in a cell all night but instead of blowing hot air, it was blowing cold air in order to freeze the person concerned.  On release, those people were not taken back to where they had been arrested but let out in the street in Monaghan to find their own way home.  That would not happen in Northern Ireland &mdash; bad as they are there, at least they will take you back to where they arrested you.</P>
    <P>As far as the house searches are concerned, the reason I bring this subject up is that a number of houses of well known <Col N="283" /> people who have no connection with any subversive organisation have been searched in the Ballinamore area.  It appears that if you are known to be committed to Fianna Fáil you will be searched in that area at the moment.  What has happened on those searches has left a lot to be desired.  The attitude taken by the gardaí carrying out the searches was one of &ldquo;We will riddle the house if you do not mind&rdquo;.  The Minister should find out who the individuals concerned were.  They were not local gardaí at all; they were gardaí down from Dublin who were not worried about the people in the area. They were not worried about the gardaí who have to live in the area after they have left.  What those gardaí did was abuse of power.</P>
    <P>I am reliably told that those gardaí searched houses at random, they did not get search warrants and they did not consult with the local Garda authorities when it came to deciding which houses they would search: they decided instead that they would search any house that they felt like going into.  Normally if searches are to be carried out the local chief superintendent or superintendent will authorise them, but instead of that, the local chief superintendent or superintendent to my knowledge was not informed that these gardaí were operating within their divisional areas.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister ask the Government and the Minister for Justice to examine this and see to it that it will not happen again?  If this is allowed to continue the confidence of the general public in the Garda will be undermined.  We will all suffer as a result.  The Garda cannot act in any part of the country without co-operation. We heard in the House earlier this evening when members spoke of the need for co-operation.  Can the Minister tell me&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not intend to go through the Chair, but verbally I will.  I would like <Col N="284" /> to ask him if he could tell me what action, if any, the Government would propose to take on the issues which I have raised here tonight.  I am not raising them for public honour or glory.  I am raising them in the fear that the co-operation which the Garda have received in that area from the local people will not be forthcoming, possibly, in the future as a result of actions such as I have outlined.  The Minister of State is possibly not aware of what has happened.  I have a duty as a public representative to bring it to the Minister's notice hoping that he in turn will bring it to the notice of the Minister for Justice, who in turn, will deal with the matter as far as the Garda authorities are concerned: that he will interview the people who are concerned in these questionings: that he will interview those concerned in the questioning and ask them why they adopted the sort of tactics that they adopted on these occasions.  As I said earlier, this sort of action will undermine public confidence in the Garda.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will convey what I have said to the Minister for Justice and that he in turn will ask the Garda Commissioner to investigate this matter fully in order that no further irreparable damage will be done to the standing of the Garda.</P>

      <P>Senator Ellis began by saying that he had nothing but the highest regard for 99 per cent of the members of the force and that his remarks were directed only to a small section who had gone beyond their role. In subsequent remarks, he went very much further than that and he seemed to constitute the criticism of a far wider section of the force than he originally indicated he would be speaking about.  In particular, I have to say that his remarks when he equated the behaviour of those members of the force assigned to Monaghan Garda station with the actions that in the past have taken place in Castlereagh are quite improper slander.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with the two issues raised by Senator Ellis: the conduct of house searches and the manner of questioning of persons detained in Monaghan Garda <Col N="285" /> station.  I should preface my remarks by saying that both these powers, the power to search conferred by section 29 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and the power to arrest and detain conferred by section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, are valuable weapons in the armoury of the security forces in their fight against subversion.  That is recognised by subversives in this State and they have, as a result, in the past systematically attempted to discredit the Garda in the exercise of their powers under both of these sections.  For that reason it behoves all of us to respond with caution to any allegations made.  It also behoves all of us to see that such allegations are carefully investigated because, as Senator Ellis correctly said, it would be very damaging to the institutions of this State if conduct of an improper or criminal nature were to be carried out by members of the force.</P>
    <P>As an experienced public representative and as a Member of this House, Senator Ellis is aware that there are well established procedures for dealing with complaints of this nature.  Complaints can be made to the local Garda superintendent, the chief superintendent or to the Garda Commissioner.  Senator Ellis and every other Member of the House can be assured that any such complaints that are made will be comprehensively dealt with by the Garda authorities.  I would add that the Government have shown their concern in this area by their publicly stated commitment to introduce in the very near future an independent complaints tribunal.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made that searching was taking place in the Leitrim area on a random basis, that those searches were unauthorised and that it appeared that, whether on a random basis or not, they were directed at the supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I have to say that that is absolutely not so.  Incidentally, it is a matter for comment that both Houses simultaneously are considering attacks on members of the Garda force at this moment.</P>
    <P>In relation to the house searches, 15 homes in the Ballinamore area of County Leitrim, and lands adjoining them, have <Col N="286" /> been searched since mid-December last year.  All of those searches have been carried out on the authority of search warrants issued under section 29 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  All of those searches formed part of the continuing investigation being carried out by the Garda following the murders in that part of Leitrim of recruit Garda Garry Sheehan and Army Private Kelly.  I should like to add that in three of those searches firearms and explosives were found on land adjoining the houses searched.</P>
    <P>I accept, of course, that any search is an occasion of some distress and trauma for those involved, and that fact is appreciated by the gardaí who are assigned to that task, and they endeavour to carry it out as sensitively as possible.  The rest of us accept, with regret, the fact that we are subjected to such a possibility and acknowledge the fact that we are subjected to such a possibility because of the campaign of subversion that has been carried on in the State for upwards of a decade.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that misconduct and perhaps even criminal misconduct occurred in Monaghan Garda station, I should like to repeat my invitation to Senator Ellis to convey to anyone who has concern in this area the assurance that the Garda authorities, at whatever level it is brought to their notice, will investigate very thoroughly any such complaint.  I would say to him, though, that an examination of the list of those who have been detained under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act in the last month does not record the making of any complaint whatever.  Perhaps for comparison purposes it is worth saying that there have been complaints in relation to house searches.  On three occasions there have been such complaints and on each occasion the complaints have been transmitted to the chief superintendent involved through a public representative.  When those complaints have been followed up the would-be complainant seems not to have had any complaint. In one case it was proved that the person whose house was searched said that while she certainly had not been <Col N="287" /> assaulted or abused in any way by the gardaí, she was annoyed when the gardaí searched a pocket of a coat which was hanging in the kitchen.  In the case of another would-be complainant, there was absolutely no complaint.  In the case of the third would-be complainant, not conveyed by Senator Ellis, when the person was interviewed by the Garda the persons stated that far from any complaint to make about the manner in which they had been treated by the gardaí, they had been delighted that the gardaí had called to their house.</P>
    <P>I should like to reiterate that any specific complaint will be investigated thoroughly by the Garda authorities.  It is a matter of note that Senator Ellis, while making a number of general complaints, did not at any stage, for example, offer the House a date on which any of these <Col N="288" /> incidents are said to have taken place so as to facilitate the authorities in identifying the incidents referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask for that.  The position is that any complaint made, whether arising from Leitrim-Monaghan or from anywhere else in the State, has been investigated thoroughly and will continue to be investigated thoroughly. I invite Members of the House to appreciate that the exercise by the Garda of their powers under the Offences Against the State Act is a very important part of their fight against subversion and terrorism.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 7 March 1984.</P>
