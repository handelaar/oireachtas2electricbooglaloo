      <P>Before going to the Order of Business, I feel Members of this House would like to join with me in deploring the outrage that occurred in Brighton at the end of last week in which a Member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom was killed and a member of the British Cabinet was injured.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Order of Business for today, it is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  If No. 3 is reached before 5.30 p.m., no break will be taken and it is proposed that 90 minutes be devoted to the discussion of No. 3.  If No. 3 is not reached by 5.30 p.m., it is proposed to adjourn from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and to take No. 3 from 6.30 p.m. until 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the Adjournment of the House the last day there were representations from some Members that the House should not meet today as ordered because of the elections to Údarás na Gaeltachta. Following discussions among groups in the House, it was decided we should go ahead but, by agreement, there would be no votes, other than any necessary votes in regard to the conduct of business today.  Accordingly, I propose as part of our Order of Business that if any vote arises on any of the questions that will be <Col N="1220" /> put at the conclusion of either Nos. 1, 2 and 3, it shall be taken on the next sitting day.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with the Leader of the House in the condemnation he has expressed of the outrage that occurred in Brighton.  On the Order of Business, we note that today there is no legislation on the Order Paper.  Will the Leader of the House indicate what is the Government's intention over the next couple of weeks regarding the initiation of legislation here if the other House is taken up with the debate on the national plan?  Is there anything in the pipeline to which we need to address ourselves?</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I wish to join with the Leader of the House in expressing our condolence with the victims of the outrage which occurred in Brighton, responsibility for which has been claimed by people who are supposed to represent sections of this country but who have no mandate.  There is no need to put on record my total disagreement with the political philosophy of the present British Government but I would be the first to stand in defence of any democracy.  The British Government were elected through the democratic process.  I respect democracy and I object to people resorting to other means to usurp the process of democracy.  If they think that by carrying out such outrages they will postpone the day in which a democratic solution may be reached, I hope it will be proved by all concerned, the British Government and by our Government, that this process will not be accepted by those of us who respect democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I would like to join in the obviously universal condemnation of the outrage in Brighton last week. I think it is appropriate that this House should express such views, not because we share in any way the guilt of those who commit such a crime, but because sometimes they claim to do it in our name.  It is appropriate that we should make it clear to the people of Britain, <Col N="1221" /> who very often confuse the IRA with Ireland and Irishmen as being synonymous with the IRA, that, as a House, we unanimously condemn their actions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf to my own party and the nationalist people of Northern Ireland whom we represent, I wish to associate myself with what has been said about the outrage in Brighton and to express the sincere hope that nothing will allow democratic politicians on this island or on the neighbouring island to be deterred from the very necessary work towards a political solution for all of us.</P>

      <P>In regard to forthcoming business, it is anticipated that during this session four Bills will be initiated in the Seanad.  The first of these is likely to be the canals Bill, which is concerned with the transfer of ownership of the inland navigation system.  There will be another Bill &mdash; I was not prepared for the question and I do not have the exact title &mdash; dealing with transport issues.  It is also proposed that the National Archives Bill and the National Monuments Bill be introduced in the Seanad.  Here it is more difficult to say when they will be introduced.  They are at present with the Attorney General's office because of legal difficulties involved. I have also urged the Government Whip's office that they should send to us as soon as possible legislation now in the Dáil.  In particular I have asked for the Employers' Insolvency Bill which is concerned with the guarantee of wages on the occasion of a firm going into bankruptcy. I have asked that this Bill which is in Committee in the Dáil be brought to us as soon as possible.  Until we get these there is a natural hiatus.  However, there have already been discussions and it is proposed to have a two-day debate on the national plan in this House.  That debate is proposed for Tuesday and Wednesday, 30 and 31 October.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That it is expedient that a Joint Committee (which shall be called the Joint Committee on the Irish Language) consisting of seven members of Dáil Éireann and four members of Seanad Éireann be appointed.</P>
      <P>(2)  That the Joint Committee shall from time to time review and make recommendations in relation to</P>
      <P>(a)  the extension of the use of Irish in the proceedings of the Dáil and Seanad and in the environs of both Houses, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the promotion of the Irish language in general,</P>
      <P>and report to the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; on item (a) as soon as practicable and thereafter at least once a year on aspects of items (a) and (b).</P>
      <P>(3)  That provision be made for the appointment of substitutes to act for members of the Joint Committee who are unable to attend particular meetings.</P>
      <P>(4)  That the Joint Committee, previous to the commencement of business, shall elect one of its members to be Chairman, who shall have only one vote.</P>
      <P>(5)  That all questions in the Joint Committee shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and voting and in the event of there being an equality of votes the question shall be decided in the negative.</P>
      <P>(6)  That the Joint Committee shall have power to take evidence in public and to print and publish from time to time minutes of evidence taken before it together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
      <P>(7)  That every report of the Joint Committee shall, on adoption by the Joint Committee, be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas forthwith whereupon the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such report together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> (8)  That four members of the Joint Committee shall form a Quorum of whom at least one shall be a member of Dáil Éireann and at least one shall be a member of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that the motion arises from a motion which this House debated this time last year in which we expressed ourselves unanimously of the opinion that such a committee should be created.</P>

      <P>Is cúis áthais dom an tairiscint seo a mholadh don Teach.  Go deimhin is mór le rá an tairiscint í agus is mian liom an deis seo a thapú chun labhairt uirthi agus pointí ginearálta a fheictear dom a bheith tábhachtach a chur os bhur gcomhair.</P>
      <P>Iarrfar ar an gComhchoiste, arna bhunú, athbhreithniú agus moltaí a dhéanamh i dtaobh</P>
      <P>(a)  úsáid na Gaeilge a leathadh in imeachtaí na Dála agus an tSeanaid agus i dtimpeallacht an dá Theach, agus</P>
      <P>(b)  cur chun cinn na Gaeilge i gcoitinne.</P>
      <P>I dtús báire ba mhaith liom dul siar go dtí mí Aibreáin 1983 nuair a bhí sé de phribhléid agam an Plean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge 1983-1986 a d'ullmhaigh Bord na Gaeilge ar iarratas ón Rialtas a chur i láthair an phobail go foirmiúil thar ceann an Rialtais.  Faoi mar is cuimhin le Seanadóirí sonraíodh spriocanna sa phlean sin le freastal ar cheithre mhór-réimse de shaol na tíre &mdash; an Ghaeltacht, an pobal, oideachas agus an Stát &mdash; le súil gur fearr a d'fhéadfaí an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ar bhonn náisiúnta pleanáilte le comhoibriú agus tacaíocht ó gach réimse gníomhaíochta sa tír.  Is féidir a rá gur glacadh go maith tríd is tríd leis an bplean agus go ndearnadh dul chun cinn sásúil sa chéad tréimhse bliana d'ainneoin na bhfadhbanna éagsúla a bhí le sárú agus tá moladh agus buíochas dá réir tuillte ag Bord na Gaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ar cheann de na spriocanna a luadh sa phlean sin bhí moladh go mbunófaí Comhchoiste Oireachtais chun staid na Gaeilge a bhreithniú ó thráth go chéile. <Col N="1224" /> Chuir Seanadóirí ó gach taobh tairiscint dá réir sin os comhair an Tí seo agus bhí díospóireacht dhíograiseach, spreagúil ann thart ar bhliain ó shin faoin bPlean Gníomhaíochta, faoi staid na Gaeilge i gcoitinne agus faoina bhfuil i ndán don teanga amach anseo.  Ba chúis mhór misnigh do Ghaeilgeoirí na tíre agus dóibh siúd uile ar mór acu ár dteanga dhúchais an spéis sa Ghaeilge a léirigh Seanadóirí sa cheist seo.  Is ar éigean is gá a rá gur glacadh leis an tairiscint d'aonghuth. Chuaigh mé ar aghaidh chun an cheist a scrúdú ansin agus, cé go raibh deacrachtaí áirithe ann mar gheall ar líon na gComhchoistí a bhí ag feidhmiú cheana, d'aontaigh an Rialtas, i ngeall ar thábhacht na Gaeilge, gur cheart Comhchoiste foirmiúil a chur ar bun chun athbhreithmiú agus moltaí a dhéananh i ndáil le leathadh na Gaeilge sa Dáil agus sa Seanad agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>Is eol daoibh uile an tionchar is féidir a bheith ag ionadaithe poiblí ar shaol na tíre agus ar mheon na ndaoine.  Is eol daoibh freisin an tábhacht thar cuimse a bhaineann leis an dea-shampla agus an treoir cheart nuair a bhíonn gá leo.  Is cinnte go bhféadfadh Seanadóirí agus Teachtaí Dála cur go mór leis na hiarrachtaí atá á ndéanamh ar mhaithe leis an teanga tríd an dea-shampla a thabharfaí dá mbeadh áit níos feiceálaí ag an nGaeilge in imeachtaí agus in obair an Tí seo agus na Dála.  Is cuid bhunúsach é d'aon bheartas Stáit i leith na teanga an chinnireacht a thabharfadh daoine sa saol poiblí agus an tslí ina mbeidís chun tosaigh go follasach sna hiarrachtaí a bhíonn ar siúl.  An sampla a thabharfadh ionadaithe Thithe an Oireachtais go speisialta bheadh an-éifeacht aige le daoine a mhealladh ar thaobh na teanga.  Is dá bharr sin atá sé leagtha síos sna téarmaí tagartha go ndíreodh an comh-choiste ar shlite a aimsiú chun úsáid na Gaeilge a leathadh ní amháin in imeachtaí foirmiúla na Dála agus an tSeanaid ach i dtimpeallacht an dá Theach freisin.</P>
    <P>Ní miste a lua gur sonraíoch nósmhaireachtaí simplí áirithe sa Phlean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge a dheimhneodh go mbeadh roinnt Gaeilge á húsáid go rialta <Col N="1225" /> sa Dáil agus sa Seanad.  Is iad seo a leanas na moltaí sonracha a rinneadh:</P>
    <P>(i)  sa chás go mbeadh ceisteanna as Gaeilge curtha ar an gclár, go dtógfaí ceist amháin ar a laghad as Gaeilge gach lá a mbíonn Tráth na gCeist sa Dáil, agus dhá cheist ar a laghad as Gaeilge (ó 1984 amach); nó mar mhalairt air sin, go leagfaí amach tréimhse áirithe le haghaidh ceisteanna Gaeilge lá amháin gach seachtain.</P>
    <P>(ii)  go labhródh cainteoir amháin ar a laghad as gach páirtí as Gaeilge, den chuid is mó de, ar an Dara Céim de gach Bille a thógfaí sa Dáil nó sa Seanad agus go mbeadh mír as Gaeilge in óráidí scríofa an Dara Céim ón Rialtas agus ón bhFreasúracht.</P>
    <P>(iii)  go molfadh an Rialtas do gach Aire ar ócáidí oiriúnacha a mbeadh tuairisc ghinearálta ar obair a Roinne á tabhairt aige don Dáil nó don Seanad&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  go dtabharfadh sé cuntas ar fheidhmiú pholasaí na Gaeilge sa Roinn, agus</P>
    <P>(b)  go mbeadh an mhír seo nó mír shubstaintiúil eile dá óráid i nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Os iad na Seanadóirí agus na Teachtaí Dála féin is fearr a thuigeann na slite is éifeachtaí ina bhféadfaí an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn i dtithe an Oireachtais táim cinnte go mbeidh ar a gcumas cur leis na spriocanna sin agus a dheimhniú don tír, agus go háirithe do mhuintir na Gaeltachta, go bhfuil siad lándáiríre lena gcuid tacaíochta do na hiarrachtaí atá ar siúl ar mhaithe le leathadh na Gaeilge. Tá dóchas agam go gcuirfidh an Comh-choiste moltaí fiúntacha dá réir ar fáil chomh scioptha agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Ceangailte go dlúth le leathadh na Gaeilge sa Dáil agus sa Seanad tá an tseirbhís trí Ghaeilge a bheadh ar fáil ón earnáil Stáit &mdash; ar a n-áirítear Ranna Rialtais, comhlachtaí Stáit, údaráis áitiúla agus a leithéidí &mdash; ag daoine a roghnaíonn <Col N="1226" /> an Ghaeilge mar phríomhtheanga nó mar theanga bhunúsach ina saol laethúil. Is den riachtanas é go mbeidh socruithe i bhfeidhm chun seirbhísí de chineálacha éagsúla a sholáthar i nGaeilge dóibh siúd a bhíonn á n-iarraidh agus go mbeadh sé tuigthe dóibh go bhféadfaí na seirbhísí sin a lorg gan scáth gan eagla agus go mbeidís ar fáil le fonn agus le fáilte.  Tá faitíos orm nach bhfuil na cúrsaí sin chomh sásúil agus ba mhaith linn uile iad a bheith.  Is measa fós an scéal, faraor, i gcás na Gaeltachta.  Is cosúil nach mbíonn seirbhís trí Ghaeilge ar fáil go minic ón earnáil phoiblí rud a chothaíonn fíor-dhrochthionchar ar mheon na ndaoine ansin i leith na Gaeilge: mura bhfeictear dóibh go bhfuil an Stát dáiríre faoin nGaeilge is mó fonn a bhíonn orthu, ar ndóigh, a dteanga dhúchais a thréigean.  Tá sé fíorthábhachtach mar sin gur daoine le Gaeilge agus daoine a mbíonn fonn orthu an Ghaeilge a chleachtadh a bheidh fostaithe ag údaráis áitiúla, ag Ranna Rialtais agus ag comhlachtaí Stáit i bpoist a bhaineann go díreach leis an nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ní gá an tábhacht ar leith a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht a mhíniú don Teach seo.  Fad a mhairfidh an Ghaeltacht beidh dóchas ann don Ghaeilge ach dá dtárlódh go dtiocfadh deireadh leis an nGaeilge mar theanga phobail is beag dóchas a bheadh fágtha.  Agus ná bíodh aon dul amú orainn faoi staid na Gaeilge sna ceantair Ghaeltachta &mdash; tá sí ag trá léi ar luas atá scanrúil in áiteanna.  Ní ionadh sin, ar ndóigh, ag féachaint don chaoi a bhfuil Béarla á bhrú ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta trí na mórmheáin chumarsáide, agus go háirithe tríd an teilifís, trí institiúidí Stáit, tríd an gcóras rialtais áitiúil, trí thionchar na forbartha tionsclaíochta agus mar sin de.  Bíodh sé soiléir nach aonad ar leith inti féin í an Ghaeltacht ach cuid bhunúsach den tír seo a mbíonn tionchar sa ghnáthshlí ag gníomhaíochtaí sa chuid eile den tír uirthi.  Ní féidir leis an nGaeltacht feidhmiú uaithi féin gan beann ar an gcuid eile den tír agus ní leor buntáistí beaga breise a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta lena dheimhniú go mairfidh an Ghaeilge mar theanga phobail ansin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1227" /> Is gá go ndíreofaí mar ghnó mórphráinne ar mheath na Gaeilge mar theanga phobail sa Ghaeltacht a chosc. Tá buíon chomhordaithe, atá comhdhéanta d'iondaithe ó mo Roinn féin, ón Roinn Oideachais, ó Údarás na Gaeltachta agus ó Bhord na Gaeilge, i mbun oibre agus é mar chúram orthu maoirseacht ghinearálta a dhéanamh ar scéimeanna a neartóidh le húsáid na Gaeilge i measc phobal na Gaeltachta i gcoitinne d'fhonn an teanga a chur ar lámh shábhála trína chinntiú go mbeidh sí á húsáid mar ghnáth-theanga labhartha ag oiread daoine agus a dheimhneoidh go mbeidh beatha i ndán dí.  Is cúram tábhachtach é sin ach tá dóchas agamsa go mbeidh an rath ar shaothar na buíne.  De bhreis air sin, áfach, ní foláir an meon poiblí agus cúrsaí an tsaoil in Éirinn a bheith ag treisiú dáiríre leis na daoine a roghnóidh an Ghaeilge mar theanga theaghlaigh agus mar theanga phobail.</P>
    <P>Is sa bhunscoil a thagann formhór mór na ndaoine sa tír seo &mdash; lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht ar aon nós &mdash; i dteagmháil don chéad uair leis an nGaeilge: is ar an scoil freisin a bhíonn an chuid is mó acu ag brath chun eolas ar an nGaeilge a fháil agus líofacht sa teanga a bhaint amach. Ní féidir a rá, áfach, go mbíonn cumas labhartha sa Ghaeilge ag daltaí i gcoitinne ag fágáil na scoile dóibh agus is mór an trua é sin: dáiríre is dócha go bhféadfaí a rá go léiríonn sé sin easnamh sa chóras oideachais.  Is é an bunriachtanas dá bhrí sin ná go gcuirfí béim níos mó ar chumas labhartha na Gaeilge a chothú.  Is gá freisin, ar ndóigh, go mbeadh caighdeán sásúil bainte amach ag múinteoirí sa Ghaeilge féin agus cleachtadh faighte acu, le linn a dtréimhse oiliúna, ar úsáid na Gaeilge mar mheán teagaisc in ábhair eile.  Ba chóir go bhfaighidís oiliúint chomh maith sna modhanna múinte teanga is nua-aimseartha agus go mbeidís eolach ar thorthaí an taighde idirnáisiúnta is údarásaí atá déanta ar mhúineadh teangacha.</P>
    <P>Tá daltaí atá á múineadh trí Ghaeilge faoi mhóreasnamh bunúsach sa mhéid nach leor a mbíonn de théacsleabhair <Col N="1228" /> oiriúnacha Ghaeilge ar fáil go háirithe ag an dara leibhéal, gan trácht ar léitheoireacht thacaíochta i nGaeilge.  Tá an cheist sin ag déanamh tinnis dúinn le fada agus is mithid réiteach a fháil uirthi.</P>
    <P>Roimhe seo is ar réimse an oideachais go príomha a bhíothas ag brath chun athbheochan na Gaeilge a chur i gcrích. Tá tábhacht an-mhór ag baint le réimse an oideachais, ar ndóigh, i dtreo go bhféadfar an teanga a mhúineadh don aos óg ar mhodh ceart proifisiúnta.  Ní leor, áfach, a dheimhniú go mbeidh cumas Gaeilge ag daoine mura soláthraítear deiseanna dóibh chun úsáid a bhaint as an gcumas sin.  Ní foláir mar sin ócáidí oiriúnacha a eagrú chun líon maith daoine a mhealladh de réir a chéile chun leas a bhaint go nádúrtha as cibé Gaeilge atá acu.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol dúinn is leis an bpobal ar fad an teanga.  Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh a fhios ag gach duine, a bhfuil fonn air a chion a dhéanamh ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge, cén chaoi a gcuirfidh a ghníomh féin leis an méid atá ar siúl ag daoine agus ag dreamanna eile ar a son. Féachann an plean lena dheimhniú go dtosófar ar thimpeallacht a chruthú ina bhféadfadh daoine an Ghaeilge a úsáid ina gcúrsaí laethúla agus a bheith cinnte lena linn sin go mbeadh bá an phobail leo, go mbeadh tacaíocht acu ón Stát agus ó údaráis eile agus go mbeadh bunseirbhísí riachtannacha trí Ghaeilge ar fáil dóibh.  Maidir leis an teanga féin ba chóir go bhféadfaidís bheith ag súil go leathnófaí raon a húsáide sa tslí go mbeadh na feidhmeanna uile aici a bhaineann le teanga bheo nua-aimseartha agus go bhforbrófaí foclóir agus leaganacha cainte inti a fhreagródh don saol, don mhachnamh agus don teicneolaíocht nua-aimseartha.</P>
    <P>Is beag duine sa tír seo nár fhoghlaim Gaeilge ùair éigin ach, de bhrí nach mbíonn cleachtadh ag a bhformhór ar í a úsáid, cailleann siad a ngreim uirthi agus bíonn leisce orthu í a labhairt.  Chun an pobal a mhealladh i dtreo na teanga ní foláir deiseanna taitneamhacha a chur ar fáil dóibh le go bhféadfaidh siad feidhm a bhaint aisti go nádúrtha i gcaoi go dtiocfaidh feabhas ar a gcumas labhartha. <Col N="1229" /> Deirtear gur as taithí a thagann máistreacht agus tá sé sin fíor ar fad i gcás teanga.</P>
    <P>Léiríonn daonáireamh na bliana 1981 go raibh sé le maíomh ag 31.6 faoin gcéad de dhaonra na tíre go raibh labhairt na Gaeilge acu i gcomparáid le 28.3 faoin gcéad sa bhliain 1971.  Cé nach bhféadfaí a rá gur cainteoirí líofa iad sin ar fad is tábhachtach an rud é go bhfuil siad mórtasach as a gcumas sa teanga.  Is cinnte go bhfuil bunsraith láidir ansin le tógáil fhiúntach a dhéanamh uirthi.  Tá béim ar leith curtha sa Phlean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge ar thábhacht na teilifíse i gcur chun cinn na teanga.  Tá tionchar fíor-láidir ag an teilifís ar shaol na ndaoine ach ní féidir a rá go bhfuil freastal sásúil á dhéanamh ar Ghaeilgeoirí.  Le forbairt na teicneolaíochta tá súil agam gur féidir an scéal a fheabhsú go mór.  Tá géarghá le cláir bhreise i nGaeilge do dhaoine óga go háirithe agus is deacair a thuiscint cén fáth nach féidir le RTÉ freastal níos fearr a dhéanamh orthu.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol do Sheanadóirí tá nuachtán nua Gaeilge tagtha ar an saol ó thús na míosa seo caite.  Má tá an toradh a bhfuilimid uile ag dréim leis le bheith ar na hiarrachtaí éagsúla atá ar siúl ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge is den riachtanas é go mbeadh nuachtán tarraingteach Gaeilge ar fáil a mbeadh éileamh maith air ar mhaithe lena fhiúntas féin.  Ba mhór an chabhair a leithéid le daoine a mhealladh i dtreo na Gaeilge.  Níl aon amhras ach go bhfuil scaipeadh forleathan ar <i>Anois</i> i measc an phobail agus d'iarrfainn ar Ghaeilgeoirí lántacaíocht a thabhairt dó i gcaoi go mbeidh fás agus forbairt ag teacht air.</P>
    <P>Más léargas dubhrónach go maith atá tugtha agam ar staid na Gaeilge go dtí seo, tá comharthaí dóchais ann freisin. Orthusan áirítear an oiread sin daoine atá báúil leis an teanga agus mórtasach aisti, an líon mór daoine a bhfuil bunús maith Gaeilge acu, an dul chun cinn suntasach atá á dhéanamh ag na naí-scoileanna Gaeilge, an t-éileamh mór atá ar bhunscoileanna agus ar scoileanna iarbhunoideachais lán-Ghaeilge, a fheabhas atá ag éirí le Radio na Gaeltachta, an dul chun cinn atá déanta le hoiriúnú na teanga do shaol an lae inniu agus lena <Col N="1230" /> caighdéanú, an litríocht nua-aoiseach atá tagtha chun cinn sa Ghaeilge, an úsáid is féidir a bhaint as modhanna nua teicneolaíochta i múineadh na teanga agus chomh fonnmhar agus a glacadh leis an bPlean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge.  Is comhaidhm agus garchuspóir dúinn uile an Ghaeilge a choimeád ina teanga bheo agus a húsáid a leathnú agus tá an-dóchas agamsa go bhféadfar dul chun cinn suntasach a dhéanamh chun an áit is dual di i saol na tíre a bhaint amach arís don Ghaeilge ach cur chuige le fonn agus le dúthracht.  Is deimhin liom go mbeadh moltaí fiúntacha le fáil ón gComhchoiste chun an aidhm sin a thabhairt i gcrích.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá i dtosach go bhfailtím roimh an tairiscint seo le Comchoiste a bhunú de réir mar a haontaíodh bliain ó shin nuair pléíodh Plean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge anseo sa tSeanad.  Measaim gur céim mhór ar aghaidh é i gcás na Gaeilge coiste mar seo a bhunú le moltaí a dhéanamh féachaint cén chaoi is féidir linn an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn i gcúrsaí an Oireachtais agus san bplé a bhíonn ar bun anseo ar na himeachtaí éagsúla agus ina theannta sin céard is féidir a dhéanamh maidir le cúis na Gaeilge agus úsáid na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn i measc an phobail i gcoitinne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar a duirt mé, is dóigh liom gur céim mhór chun cinn é seo atá dá thógáil inniu agus go m'fhéidir go gcuirfeadh sé tús le ré nua maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge. Dá bhrí sin, failtím roimh an tairiscint agus tá an tAire le moladh as an tairiscint seo a thabhairt os ár gcomhair agus cinneadh a dhéanamh go mbunófar an Comh-choiste seo.  Tá súil agam go mbunófar an Comhchoiste go luath agus go mbeidh toradh dá bharr.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil go leor daoine san Dáil agus san Seanad a bhéas lán-toilteannach agus ábalta gníomhú ar an gcoiste agus moltaí a dhéanamh.  Níl sé i gceist agamsa inniu teacht roimh aon mholtaí dá ndéanfaidh siad mar ní thagann sé sin i gceist, ach níl amhras ná go bhfuil go leor le déanamh. Má thugaimid aghaidh ar an bhfírinne caithfimid a rá nach bhfuil an dul chun <Col N="1231" /> cinn déanta le cúis na Gaeilge agus le cur chun cinn Gaeilge a bhíothas ag súil leis blianta ó shin.</P>
    <P>Is deacair a rá ar bhealach amháin cá bhfuil an locht sin nó cá bhfuil an milleán le cur, ach go minic na heagrais dheonacha na daoine eile gur práinn leo agus gur cás leo staid na Gaeilge, is fíor go gcuirtear cuid mhaith milleáin ar an Oireachtas agus dá bhrí sin ar pholaiteoirí i gcoitinne nach bhfuil siad ag déanamh a gcion nó nach ndearna siad a gcion le staid na Gaeilge agus cás na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn níor fearr.  Bíodh sé sin fíor nó nach fíor, níl aon dabht nó gur féidir le Teachtaí Dála agus Seanadóirí i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge ná mar atá siad á dhéanamh.  Is féidir leo an Ghaeilge a chleachtadh níos mó i dTithe an Oireachtais, i ndiospóireachtaí ar Bhillí anseo agus dár ndóigh í a chleachtadh níos mó in a ngnáth shaoil laethúil freisin. Níl aon dabht faoi sin agus níl aon mhaith á shéanadh: is dócha go bhfuil a lán daoine sa chaoi sin.</P>
    <P>Tabharfaidh sé misneach do na daoine atá ag obair go deonach ar son na teanga taobh amuigh den Oireachtas agus in a ngnáth shaol, tabharfaidh sé misneach dóibh a fheiceáil go bhfuil a leithéid seo de Chomhchoiste á bhunú agus go bhfuiltear níos mó dáiríre ná mar a cheapann siad b'fhéidir faoi chúis na Gaeilge. Tabharfaidh sé misneach go mór do mhuintir na Gaeltachta a ndearna an tAire tagairt dóibh san agus aontaím go hiomlán leis go gcuireann sé isteach orthu go mór nuair a fheiceann siad nach féidir leo a ngnó a dhéanamh ar fad trí Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus go minic na daoine a chuirtear isteach le oibriú ins an nGaeltacht &mdash; déantúsóirí nó lucht oibre &mdash; agus daoine eile a bhíonn ag tabhairt seirbhís san nGaeilge, nuair a fheiceann said nach suim leo go minic an teanga agus gur beag úsáid a bhaineann siad aisti.  Is mór an trua é sin.  Laghdaíonn sé spéis mhuintir na Gaeltachta san teanga. Ní hionadh é dá thoradh sin go bhfuil roinnt mhaith acu &mdash; agus caithfear é sin a admháil a thréigeann an Ghaeilge ina saol féin.  Is cás liomsa go mór mhór go <Col N="1232" /> bhfuil sé sin ag tarlú agus go bhfuil roinnt teaghlaí san Ghaeltacht nach gcleachtann an Ghaeilge chomh mór nó comh minic is bhiodh an scéal tráth.</P>
    <P>Má thugann an dea-shampla seo, bunú an Chomhchoiste seo, misneach do na daoine sin in a ngnáth shaoil do ghnáth phobal labhartha na Gaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, tá beart maith á dhéanamh anseo inniu.  Ní ga dom níos mó a rá.  Ní bheidh aon mhalairt tuairim faoi bhunú an Chomhchoiste seo.  Glacfar leis, táim cinnte, go fonnmhar, agus tá súil agam go dtabharfar an cuidiú don Chomhchoiste amach anseo le pé moltaí a ghlacann siad is ceart a chur ós comhair an Rialtais agus ós comhair an Oireachtais agus go bhfeictear chuige go gcuirfear na moltaí sin chun críche agus go rachaidh siad chun leasa na teanga, don tír agus don chultúr dúchais trí chéile.  Failtím roimh an tairiscint agus guím go mbeidh rath ar an méid a thiocfaidh aisti.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm go bhfuil na Brúnaigh ar aghaidh anseo inniu.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an Chomhchoiste seo.  Sílim go bhfuil sé riachtanach go mbeadh dea-shampla tugtha ag an Dáil agus ag an Seanad don tír ar fad agus bhí an tuairim agam sara tháinig mé anseo agus ó tháinig mé anseo nach bhfuil an dea-shampla sin á thabhairt againn.  Ní bheadh a fhios ag duine a thiocfadh isteach anseo an gnáth lá an bhfuil sé ag an Rialtas i Sasana nó in Éirinn mar níl ach corr fhocal Gaeilge le cloisteáil anseo.  Ní féidir Gaeilge a úsáid ar fad, táim cinnte de sin; níl Gaeilge ag daoine agus ní orthu atá an locht, ach tá Gaeilge ag a lán daoine anseo agus dearfainn go mba chóir go mbeadh iarracht níos fearr á déanamh againn chun an Ghaeilge a labhairt anseo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá deacrachtaí ag baint le labhairt na Gaeilge anseo.  Níl Gaeilge ag an chuid is mó des na daoine a bhíonn ag thabhairt cuntas dos na nuachtáin.  Ní bheidh focail faoi sa pháipéar má labhraíonn tú sa Gaeilge.  Sin an gnáth rud agus ní thugann sé sin misneach d'éinne labhairt trí Ghaeilge. Ba chóir go mbeadh leigheas ar an scéal sin agus faoi mar a dúirt an tAire, tá páipéar nua againn anois &mdash;<i>Anois</i> an <Col N="1233" /> t-ainm atá air.  B'fhéidir go gcuirfidh an páipéar sin feabhas ar an scéal agus go dtabharfaidh sé cuntas ar na rudaí ata ag titim amach timpeall na tíre go mór má tá baint acu leis an Ghaeilge.  Tá gearán amháin agam agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé ró-oiriúnach anseo.  Sílim go bhfuil an cló ró-bheag sa pháipéar sin.  Ní féidir stracfhéachaint a thabhairt ar an pháipéar sin agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil plean ansin go gcaithfidh tú a lán ama á léamh. Tá an cló an-bheag agus ní hé amháin go bhfuilim ag éirí aosta go gceapaim é sin ach tá an tuairim céanna ag mo chlann féin go bhfuil sé deacair é a léamh.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil an iomarca ann, dá mbeadh alt nó dhó fágtha amach b'fhéidir go mbeadh níos mó spáis do chló níos mó.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom nuair a bheidh an Comhchoiste seo á bhunú go mbeadh daoine ar an gComhchoiste seo gan Gaeilge.  Tá sé an-deacair go mbeadh ach tá sé an-éasca daoine go bhfuil Gaeilge acu a chur ar an Comhchoiste.  Déarfainn go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh tuairimí na ndaoine nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu le cloisteáil freisin ar an gComhchoiste mar ní féidir Gaeilge a bhrú ar éinne. Caithfimid iad a mhealladh agus dúirt an tAire go raibh páistí sna scoileanna agus nach raibh siad in ann an Ghaeilge a labhairt, agus tá sin fíor.  Níl a fhios agam an ar an gcóras nó pé air atá an locht. Sílim féin go bhfuil dea-thoil ag teastáil ó na daoine.  Tá Gaeilge ag a lán daoine ach níl an dea-thoil acu don Ghaeilge. B'fhéidir go gcuirfidh an Comhchoiste seo feabhas ar an scéal sin mar feicfidh na daoine go bhfuil na Seanadóirí agus na Teachtaí Dála i ndáiríre i slí amháin faoin Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an Comhchoiste seo a bhunú agas guím rath Dé ar an obair a bheidh le déanamh acu agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go geal leo.</P>

      <P>Cosúil leis na Seanadóirí eile be mhaith liom fáilte a thabhairt don tairiscint chun Comhchoiste Oireachtais don Ghaeilge a bhunú. Cuimhním go maith an díospóireacht a bhí againn anseo an bhliain seo caite agus gur ghlac 20 Seanadóirí páirt sa díospóireacht <Col N="1234" /> ar an bplean sin Bhord na Gaeilge, an Plean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge. Mar a dúirt an tAire ar an ócáid sin, dob é sin an chéad uair a raibh an uimhir sin rannpháirteach sa díospóireact ar ábhar teanga labhartha na Gaeilge.  Ba iontach an díospóireacht a bhí againn agus thaispeáin sé go raibh fíor-imní ar na Baill faoi dhroch-bhail na Gaeilge. Glacadh go bhfuil an Gaeilge i mbaol agus bhí siad ar aon intinn go mb'fhéidir gurb é seo an seans deireanach an teanga a shábháil.  Mar a dúirt mé cheana aontaím go hiomlán leis an rún atá os ár gcomhair inniu chun an Comhchoiste faoi leith seo a bhunú.</P>
      <P>This time last year we had a very animated discussion that lasted virtually for two full days as to the merits and demerits of the action plan for Irish which was launched, and to which the Minister has referred, by Bord na Gaeilge at that time. It was indicative of the degree of anxiety and interest that people had as regards the welfare of the language that some 20 Senators participated in that discussion. While we were quite profuse in identifying the failings and ailings of the language and the causes of the demise of the language to its present low level we were, collectively, somewhat remiss in that we were not very positive in putting forward definite suggestions as to what precisely could and should be done other than what was in the actual contents of the action plan itself.</P>
      <P>We identified many of the failings and ailings.  We agreed unanimously that the language was in danger.  That is why I am somewhat surprised at the statistics given by the Minister that there seems to be a relative increase in the usage of the language on the basis of a survey between 1971 and 1981.  I am not doubting the statistic but I often wonder at the relevance of statistics like this, given the fact that today the people are going to the polls in the Gaeltacht to decide who their representatives in Údarás na Gaeltacht will be for the next few years.  It has been proved that the actual boundary of the Gaeltacht is not a true reflection of the degree of spoken Irish in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We identified the various factors which <Col N="1235" /> were responsible.  We blamed the newspapers and the media.  Aontaíomar go raibh an iomarca béim ar an gramadach agus ar an Ghaeilge scríofa.  We agreed furthermore that it should not be forced down people's throats and I remember Senator Jack Harte saying that one of the reasons he did not have the usage of the Irish language at any level in fact was that, like a lot of people, he was given a distaste for it by the element of compulsion which was so prevalent in primary schools until 1973.  We emphasised in fact that the theatre could have a far greater role in the retention and the resuscitation of the language.  We emphasised the role that the Irish colleges, summer courses and so on could play in reviving the language. We dwelt at some length on the desirability of being realistic and facing up to the fact that, as regards the aspiration to provide the Irish language as the primary spoken language in this country, that it simply is not and will not be on, that we should strive for a degree of realism and an acceptance that if we could ever reach a stage of adequate bilingualism and the two languages could live side by side, we could conduct our business in the first official language, Irish. We also urged that the curriculum revision which is going ahead at intermediate and leaving certificate levels should go ahead apace and that oral Irish should have a far greater role and a greater element of marking in determining the pass rate and the honours rate for our certificate examinations.</P>
    <P>The idea for the comhchoiste, which is envisaged in this motion, in fact was stimulated by the action plan for Irish, as the Minister said.  Senator O'Mahony in his concluding address to the motion on the action plan for Irish mentioned that the key criteria should in fact not be so much putting people on it for the sake of having people on because they spoke Irish but from the point of view of genuine commitment, that this should be the key qualification for people who are proposed, nominated or offer themselves to serve on this very important committee. I agree with the envisaged twin <Col N="1236" /> aims.  The first one is the extension of the use of Irish in the proceedings of the Dáil and Seanad and in the environs of both Houses.  This is a very desirable objective. After all, it is the primary language. It is on the heading of every letter that goes out from every TD and Senator, from every Government Department.  In brackets underneath we have the English version.  While at times we may preach from the high towers of this building about the desirability of reviving the language until we actually practice the language and use the language we are not in a position to exhort and certainly not to preach to the people outside.</P>
    <P>The good example must start here amongst ourselves, in everyday dialogue, in carrying on the business of the Houses. How many times has the Irish language been used in this House since we deliberated on the action plan for Irish this time last year.  I cannot recall an occasion when there was any kind of extensive debate or even any debate at all in the Irish language.  The usage of Irish in both Houses is given added urgency by virtue of the fact that the proceedings of both Houses now in fact will be broadcast.  If we are not in a position to undertake on a regular basis certain legislative matters and debates in Irish in the Houses, which will be going out live to the people outside we are further adding to the demise of the language.</P>
    <P>As regards the promotion of the Irish language in general I ask that the comhchoiste would be empowered to invite in agencies from outside to advise and to make submissions on how we can fulfil the role laid down for us.  I believe the balance is right on the committee.  It is very generous, in fact, to the Seanad. This is right in view of the fact that there was such a genuine and sincere attempt to debate the actual position and status of the language this time last year and by virtue of the fact that one third of the House contributed to that debate.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá fá dtaobh den tairiscint seo. Fáiltíonn na daoine eile anseo roimh an <Col N="1237" /> tairiscint agus caithfidh mé a rá, ó bunaíodh an Stát seo níl a fhios agam cé mhéid coistí atá curtha ar bun agus cé mhéid cáipéisí atá curtha ar fáil agus cé mhéid staidéir atá déanta den teanga agus athbheocaint na teanga agus in ainneoin sin uilig tá an teanga ag dul i laige agus cé go bhfuil eolas níos fearr agus deis labhartha na Gaeilge ag cuid mhór daoine an lá atá inniu ann, níl an Ghaeilge á úsáid.  Sa Teach seo agus sa Teach eile agus ar fud an fhoirgnimh go léir is beag Gaeilge a chloistear.  Níl mórán maith a bheith ag rá le páistí gur maith an rud an teanga agus gur cóir í a labhairt agus gur cóir í a staidéar muna bhfuil na polaiteoirí iad féin, fiú iad sin a bhfuil an Ghaeilge go líofa acu, muna bhfuil siad faoi choinne í a labhairt iad féin nuair atá an chaoi acu.  Tá súil agam nuair a dearcóidh an Comhchoiste ar staid na teanga agus nuair a dhéanfaidh siad staidéar air go dtiocfaidh moltaí praiticiúla romhainn gur féidir linn an teanga a chur chun tosaigh muid féin anseo sa Dáil agus sa tSeanad.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom focal a rá faoi Ghealtacht nach mbíonn morán le rá againn anseo fá dtaobh de, is é sin Gaeltacht nach bhfuil toghchán údaráis ann inniu, is é sin Gaeltacht an Tuaiscirt.  Tá Gaeltacht againn sa Tuaisceart gí nach bhfuil sé faoi riail an Stáit seo.  Tá a fhios agam ó am go ham go raibh cuidiú le fáil ón taobh seo tíre don Ghaeltacht sin.  Is Gaeltacht láidir é agus Gaeltacht atá ag éirí níos láidre.  Tá bunscoil Ghaelach anois i mBéal Feirste.  Tá sé ann le roinnt mhaith blianta agus b'éigean do na daoine a bhí faoina bhun díol as iad féin.  Is mór an obair atá déanta acu.  Tá cuidiú le fáil anois acu ón Stát faoi dheireadh thiar thall.  Tá bunscoil eile bunaithe i nDoire Cholm Cille agus tá ag éirí go maith leis san am atá i láthair.  Tá súil againn go rachaidh sé i láidreacht in aghaidh na mblianta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>San obair seo uilig atá déanta i dTuaisceart na hÉireann tá sampla againn do dhaoine nach bhfuil an Stát taobh thiar díofa mar atá anseo nó mar a bhí leis na blianta &mdash; b'fhéidir gur chóir dom a rá in ainm a bheith taobh thiar den Ghaeilge. Is mór an méid is féidir le daoine a dhéanamh <Col N="1238" /> iad féin.  Cad é go mór an méid ba chóir a bheith déanta anseo nuair atá an Stát go hiomlán ar thaobh na Gaeilge. Ba mhaith liom mar sin de nuair atáimíd ag caint ar Ghaeilge san Ghaeltacht agus cuidiú le muintir na Gaeltachta go smaoineoimís agus go smaoineodh an Comhchoiste ar an Ghaeltacht eile sin, Gaeltacht an Tuaiscirt agus go gcothófar teangmháil agus chomh-oibriú idir Gaeltacht an Tuaiscirt agus Gaeltachtaí san chuid eile den tír.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir &mdash; dúirt mé é seo roimhe agus mé ag caint anuraidh &mdash; is mór an rud atá déanta, is mór an cuidiú atá tugtha do Ghaeilgeoirí an Tuaiscirt ag Raidio na Gaeltachta.  B'fhéidir gur mhaith an rud é dá mbeadh iriseoir speisialta do Raidio na Gaeltachta lonnaithe i dTuaisceart na hÉireann.  Ba mhaith liom fosta nuair atá mé ar mo chosa fáiltiú roimh an pháipéar nuachta <i>Anois</i> agus a chur in iúl don Teach go bhfuil sé le fáil go forleathan sa Tuaisceart agus i mo bhaile féin i Lurgan go bhfuil díol an-mhór air.

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an tairiscint seo.  Is céim mhór ar aghaidh í ceist na Gaeilge agus úsáid na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Is í mo thuairim go bhfuil dualgas ar na Seanadóirí agus na Teachtaí Dála dea-shampla a thabhairt agus iarracht a dhéanamh an Ghaeilge a úsáid sa Teach seo agus sa Teach eile i rith na bliana.  Tá daoine sa tír a bhfuil suim acu sa teanga ach go bhfuil imní orthu an teanga a úsáid mar tá daoine san Roinn agus sna grúpaí atá ag cur an teanga os ár gcomhair mar shampla, Conradh na Gaeilge, agus grúpaí eile mar sin, ag magadh futhu as an iarracht.  Cuir i gcás sna comhairlí chontae ar fud na tíre agus ag na cruinnithe a bhíonn ag na coistí gairm oideachais.  Déanaimíd ár ndícheall an teanga a labhairt ach tá imní go forleathan sa tír faoi labhairt agus scríobh na Ghaeilge.  Sílim gurb é sin an rud is mó atá in aghaidh úsáid na teanga.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is with great pleasure that as one who rarely gets the opportunity of confidently putting a few words forward in Irish I welcome the Minister's intention to <Col N="1239" /> establish this Joint Committee of the Oireachtas to examine the whole question of the Irish language.  For any person in my own position who feels in some way inhibited from speaking the language because I am not a fluent speaker, one of the greatest disadvantages is that people who wish to speak the language feel obliged to speak it go críoch, mar a déarfá. They feel that it has to be spoken using perfect grammar as well as sounding perfect.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason, I believe, that people who might not be proficient in expressing themselves in Irish subdue their expressions in Irish.  There is no question that any other subject is more paramount in the minds of the people than our own language.  Because of the fear of ridicule from various people that fear exists.  It is unfortunate that people who have set themselves up in various groups throughout the country have, in the eyes of many people, become withdrawn.  Therein lies the proficiency and the example but for those outside we cannot break that barrier.</P>
    <P>That is not an opinion held only by me; it is widespread.  That question needs to be tackled more than any other.  I hope that when this Joint Committee get to work in the near future that they will be in contact with those groups who are forwarding the use of the language in their own way but it is only for an elitism they cater.  Access to those groups should be available to those people with, let us call it, &ldquo;pidgin Irish&rdquo;. It is through encouragement along those lines that the Irish language will be revived.</P>
    <P>I believe that no other agency has done more for the Irish language in the Breac Gaeltacht than Radio na Gaeltachta.  It has brought the Irish language not just to the people of the Gaeltacht but also to those outside the Gaeltacht areas.  It is through hearing the things that happen in ordinary everyday life that very many more people have not only become interested but have begun to use cupla focail here and there in their everyday work.  It is a credit also to the many councils and <Col N="1240" /> committees throughout the country at local government level who have shown the light to the Oireachtas in the Seanad and in the Dáil that they have frequently carried out their meetings in part or in full through the medium of Irish.  Every Member has tried in his or her way at local level to express himself or herself through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>We may not be particularly proficient at it in the beginning but we should all make the effort.  If the effort and the lead is coming from here it will reverberate right down along the line in the near future.</P>
    <P>While we are in the process of reorganising the educational system, a serious look must be taken at the content of the syllabus in Irish as at the bunscoil and the gairm scoil agus up along the line much good could be done.  In the national schools and the secondary and vocational schools young people spend the formative years of education.  So much of that education and so much of the Irish used in that context is so irrelevant to life and to usage thereafter that we must call into question to content of the books being used.  Many of the Gaeltacht areas throughout the country are at a decided disadvantage in the educational process because of the non-availability of many ordinary texts through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>In a commercialised world as we are in today the necessity is there for some Government agency to subsidise in some way the availability of such texts.  The ordinary publishing companies will not take on the task of publishing or translating many of those books into Irish, and there must be some sort of deontais mar dearfa to those people to make the books available.  People in the Gaeltacht are at a decided disadvantage.  I am very sure that there are no areas more disadvantaged in the educational circles than the Gaeltacht areas because they do not have the resources, the books or the texts available to them which the ordinary students throughout the country have.</P>
    <P>Time alone will show the reward for the Minister's efforts in encouraging people to use the language.  Some people <Col N="1241" /> may have the idea that the language has in the past been contentious and divisive. The Minister is now taking that divisiveness away from the language.  We can see the language as belonging to all parties and all individuals in the land rather than to any select group.  Go raibh maith agat.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom no bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí a ghlac páirt san díospóireacht seo.  Bhí sé an suimiúil agus go deimhin rinneadh pointí anseo mar is gnách nár smaoinigh mise orthu go dtí gur éist mé leo.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an Seanadóir de Brún, tuigim go hiomlán an imní atá air maidir le usáid na teanga agus dul i léig na teanga.  Ainneoin go bhfuil daoine ag rá go bhfuil suim acu sa teanga, níl an úsáid is mó gur féidir á baint as an teanga ag na daoine céanna.  Mar a dúirt sé bheifí ag súil go mbeadh dea-shampla ag teacht ó obair an Chomhchoiste, is é sin dá mbeadh dea-thoradh ar a gcuid oibre chomh fada agus go mbeadh úsáid na teanga á leathnú i dTithe an Oireachtais. Tá tionchar againn mar Theachtaí Dála agus mar Sheanadóirí ar fud na tíre.  Tá tionchar againn in áiteanna eile agus i saol an ghnáth dhuine agus tagann daoine chugainn le comhairle a chur orthu maidir le rudaí eile, i bpáirteanna eile dá saoil, agus ní haon chúis nach mbeifí ag súil go mbeadh an tionchar céanna againn maidir le dea-shampla a thabhairt in usáid na teanga.</P>

    <P>Ba mhaith liom rud amháin a rá maidir leis an méid a dúirt an Seanadóir Seán de Brún.  Is é an rud sin nár gur mhol sé nuair a bheadh daoine á thóghadh ar an gComchoiste nach Gaeilgeóirí amháin a bheadh páirteach ann ach go dtabharfaí áit do dhaoine ar bheagán Gaeilge nó go deimhin gan Gaeilge a bheith acu, ionas go bhféadfaí a dtuairimí siúd a fháil ar cén chaoi is fearr le cur chuige, mar tá tuairimí acu, go deimhin, tuairimí anphraiticiúil cuid acu, agus d'fhéadfaí úsáid a bhaint as a dtuairimí siúd.  Bheadh áit acu ar Chomhchoiste dá leithéid seo agus tá súil agam go mbainfear úsáid as a leithéidí nuair a bhéas an Comhchoiste <Col N="1242" /> ag obair.  Maidir leis an cló sa pháipéar Domhnaigh <i>Anois,</i> níl a fhios agam; má tá Seán ag dul in aois, tá mise ag dul in aois, mar bhíomar ar scoil le chéile. Táimid ar chomhaois.  Tá an fhadhb chéanna agam féin agus thiocfainn leis go hiomlán go bhfuil an cló an-bheag sa pháipéar.  Níl a fhios agam an rud teicniúil atá ann nó an féidir é a fheabhsú ach caithfimid teagmháil leis na foilsitheóirí go bhfeicfimid an féidir é sin a fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Seanadóir Jim Higgins tagairt do na daoine anseo a ghlac páirt san díospóireacht nuair a bhíomar anseo anuraidh.  Déarfainn gur sin ceann de na díospóireachtaí ba mhó go raibh suim ann sa Teach seo agus bhí mise ceithre bliana anseo.  Rinne sé tagairt chomh maith go deimhin don uimhir Seanadóirí a bhí ar an gcoiste.  Tá súil agam nach bhfuil dearmad á dhéanamh agam ag rá go raibh mé ceithre bliana sa Teach seo.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh an Seanadóir Higgins tagairt chomh maith don mheon a bheadh ag teastáil ó na daoine a bheadh ar an gComhchoiste, nach aon mhaith daoine a chur air muna bhfuil an meon ceart acu i leith na Gaeilge.  Thiocfainn go hiomlán leis sin go mba cheart daoine atá sásta agus go bhfuil imní orthu faoi dul chun cinn na Gaeilge agus atá sásta am agus iarracht a chaitheamh i leith na teanga agus dul chun cinn na teanga taobh istigh den Teach seo agus taobh istigh den Dáil.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir Rogers go raibh Gaeltacht eile ó thuaidh.  Glacaim leis sin go hiomlán agus tá áthas orm a chloisteáil go bhfuil na scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha i nDoire Cholm Cille agus i mBéal Feirste ag dul ar aghaidh go maith agus bhí anáthas orm a chloisteáil go raibh tacaíocht oifigiúil le fáil ag scoil Bhéal Feirste níos luaithe i mbliana ó na húdaráis ansin le dul chun cinn na Gaeilge a chur ar aghaidh sa cheantar sin.  Níl a fhios agam cén bhealach is fearr le cur chuige ach ba cheart go mbeadh teagmháil ghinearálta agus lán-aimsire idir na heagrais, agus tá de gnáth, idir na heagrais ó thuaidh go bhfuil spéis acu sa Ghaeilge agus na heagrais ó dheas anseo.</P>
    <P>Chuir an Seanadóir Rogers chomh maith an cheist: cén fáth, cuir i gcás, nach bhfuil níos mó usáid á baint as Gaeilge <Col N="1243" /> cé go bhfuil deis labhartha níos mó ag daoine anois.  Níl an deis á thapú acu agus níl úsáid a baint acu as an Ghaeilge chomh minic agus a cheapfádh gur cheart.  Níl fhios agam an cheist mheoin é.  Mar a dúirt sí chomh maith, tá lánchófra de thuarascálacha agus cáipéisí caite i leath-taobh sa tír seo leis na blianta, agus ag an am chéanna tá úsáid na teanga ag dul i léig.  Mar sin féin &mdash; agus rinne Senator Jim Higgins tagairt de seo &mdash; tá méadú tagtha ar an uimhir duine a deir go bhfuil suim acu i nGaeilge agus atá ag maíomh as go bhfuil Gaeilge acu. Sin comhartha maith, agus tá mé cinnte go mbeidh dea-thoradh ar an uimhir méadaithe sin.</P>
    <P>Rinne sé cúpla pointe go bhfuil antábhacht leo.  Ceann acu maidir le téacsleabhair. Tá fadbh againn le téacsleabhair mar atá a fhios ag cách.  Ní bheadh aon chlódóir, cuir i gcás, nó foilsitheóir sásta téacsleabhair a chur ar fáil as Gaeilge nó ábhair eile as Gaeilge toisc nach mbeadh an dáiliúchán ann agus nach mbeadh na huimhreacha ann le go mbeadh ar a chumas airgead a dhéanamh nó go deimhin a airgead féin a fháil ar ais. Tugaimid deontas do choiste faoi leith go bhfuil sé mar oibleagáid orthu leabhair Ghaeilge a fhoilsiú, agus is ceist eile ceist na dtéacsleabhair agus is fadhb anmhór í.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh tagairt chomh maith go raibh a lán daoine ann go raibh Gaeilge acu cosúil leat féin ach go raibh faitíos orthu úsáid a bhaint as an méid a bhí acu. Senator Higgins mentioned adequate bilingualism as a concept which would take off and be acceptable to the people.  I am using Irish to emphasise the bilingualism aspect which we ought to gear our minds to because in the past the replacement of the English language by Irish as a policy aim, tá teipthe air sin; ta sé ann le leathchéad bliain agus níor éirigh leis.  Ag an bpointe seo is é an méid is mó gur féidir linn bheith ag tnú leis go bhféadfaí Gaeilge agus Béarla a úsáid taobh le taobh agus dá bhféadfaí an Ghaeilge a leathú ar aon leibhéal leis an Bhéarla, bheadh linn.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke put his finger on one of <Col N="1244" /> the major problems we have, that is the question of attitudes.  He mentioned the word &ldquo;elitism&rdquo;.  There are people who, unfortunately, see themselves as &ldquo;elitist&rdquo; because they are bilingual.  Some Members of this House are trilingual and they do not boast about it.  Senator Jim Higgins speaks French as fluently as Irish or English, but we do not hear him shouting about his competence in any of these languages.  But a small group of people see themselves as having a God-given right to look down their nose at people who make mistakes in syntax or gammar in speaking the Irish Language.  There are many people whose lack of competence precludes them from speaking the Irish language because they are fearful of criticism from others.  Some years ago I called these other people purists.  You can call them what you like.  We all know whom we are talking about.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that I should mention that in a certain part of the north-west we have trouble because of that kind of elitist, purist attitude, trouble which is doing no good to the cause of the Irish language.  It is turning off people who are genuinely interested in its promotion. The sooner the better these people cop on to themselves and realise that they have no God-given right to any language. It is our language.  It is up to us to assert ourselves, use what we have and through usage improve what we have.</P>
    <P>Dúirt Seanadóir eile go mba mhaith leis ní amháin go mbeadh dea-thoradh ar obair an Chomhchoiste taobh istigh de Thithe an Oireachtais, is é sin go mbeadh leathú ar úsáid na teanga anseo agus sa Dáil, ach go mbainfeadh na daoine céanna, Seanadóirí agus Teachtaí Dála, úsáid as an teanga ina saol féin taobh amuigh, agus is ceist chleachtaithe í &mdash; an teanga á úsáid agat anseo ar feadh cuig nóiméad in aghaidh an lae, cuir i gcás agus ní mór é sin: go hiondúil tarlaíonn sé go mbainfidh tú úsáid as nuair a théann tú abhaile ag an deireadh seachtaine agus nuair a théann tú taobh amuig den Teach, thíos san mbaile mór, nuair a théann tú chuig cruinniú agus rudaí an-simplí ar fad, beannú do dhaoine as Gaeilge agus mar sin de.  Má fheiceann <Col N="1245" /> an gnáth dhuine go bhfuilimid sásta i dTithe an Oireachtais Gaeilge a labhairt gan bac, gan náire, is cuma an bhfuil sí ar chaighdeán ard nó íseal ach iarracht a dhéanamh mórtas a bheith againn aisti. Is linne an teanga, is teanga an ársa í, tugadh dúinn i agus tá sé de dhualgas orainn í a thabhairt don ghlúin atá ag teacht in ar ndiaidh.</P>
    <P>We have a moral obligation to pass on our language to our children.  It has been given to us, albeit in somewhat ragged form.  There are historical reasons for that.  We have every opportunity.  Irish is not prohibited in any way, except by people's own attitudes.  We have a moral obligation to pass it on to our children and they to their children.  If we fail, we not only have failed on the basis of the linguistics of this question but we have also denied future generations a whole area of Irish culture that is imbedded, ingrained and inherent in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Feicim an Comhchoiste ag tosnú ar an obair sin.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teach seo a thosnaigh an rud seo ar fad tríd an tairiscint a chuireadh síos bliain ó shin.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil arís leis na Seanadóirí a ghlac páirt ann, agus tá súil agam go mbeimid ar ais arís i gceann bliana agus ag breathnú siar ar bhliain go mbeidh anobair déanta sa dá Theach seo ar son na Gaeilge tríd Chomhchoiste nua a bunófar anois.  Go raibh míle maith agaibh.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Óstlanna Iompair Éireann &mdash;" RHead="Report of Joint Committee: Motion">
    <Title>Óstlanna Iompair Éireann &mdash; Report of Joint Committee: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the First Report of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies &mdash; Ostlanna Iompair Éireann Teoranta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to explain to the House the procedure that the Minister of State and the Minister for Labour will adopt in this motion.  It is their intention to listen to <Col N="1246" /> the debate of the House.  When the Minister is replying to the debate, he will have the benefit of the contributions of Members of the House.</P>
    <P>The introduction to the report sets out the historical background to ÓIE, which was originally incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of CIE with the responsibility of running the Great Southern Hotels and the catering services for CIE.  Time went on and obviously economic circumstances changed in CIE. In December 1983 we in the Labour Party welcomed the decision of the Government, announced by the Minister for Communications, to transfer the ownership of OIE to CERT, which is the primary statutory body responsible for the catering industry.  Arising out of that decision many changes have taken place in the management and structure of the hotel and catering industry, which was originally vested under the responsibility of CIE.  We welcome the recent capital project in the refurbishing of the hotel and catering industry, which is now set up under the management of CERT.</P>
    <P>Some of us attended today the Aer Lingus presentation on their particular enterprise, and it is gratifying to know that semi-State bodies can move into ancillary activities.  Aer Lingus have done it very successfully, particularly with the hotel industry in Britain and in America with the Dunfey hotels.  They have managed to do it efficiently and to make sufficient money to ensure the continuance of our national airline, Aer Lingus. It was a pity that CIE could not continue the responsibility they had in the hotel and catering industry.  However, as it is a specific responsibility of CERT it is appropriate that this House should take note of the report of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies and look in detail at what has been done in this area.  Following the contribution of this House, the Minister will have the appropriate opportunity to respond.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to second the motion and, in seconding what Senator Ferris has said, to indicate that in accordance with the policy we propose <Col N="1247" /> to adopt, all the reports of Joint Committees will come before the House for consideration.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to deal in any detail with this report, except merely to say that this report has a double importance. Firstly, it is a report in regard to this particular operation, which is one of the operations of CIE and the first to be separated from them.  But there is a further importance to this report to which I would like to draw the attention of the House.  We look at the summary of recommendations on pages 37, 38 and 39 of the report which states:</P>
      <P>While the Joint Committee has formulated these recommendations as a result of its examinations of the operations of Óstlanna Iompair Éireann Teoranta the issues raised are relevant to the commercial State-sponsored bodies sector as a whole.  The Joint Committee recommends that legislation be introduced to give effect to any recommendation where it is needed.</P>
      <P>It does indicate that the Joint Committee, appointed by this House and by the other House, is making a very broad recommendation in this regard.  In a sense the scope of our debate here goes beyond merely this particular commercial State-sponsored body, If, of course, the Government do react and introduce legislation, either for this commercial State-sponsored body or for commercial State-sponsored bodies as a whole, we will have an opportunity to discuss it. Nevertheless I think the House should welcome the opportunity of being able to make a contribution before legislation is drawn up.  Indeed, the House should take advantage of the fact that we now have this committee system, that we have recommendations for legislation coming before the House so that we can make an input before the stage of drafting legislation is reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report and compliment the Joint Committee.  It is the first report I have seen which carries such a depth of argument and fact finding <Col N="1248" /> and a quite clear ending to all its consultations. It is a very good outline of what a Joint Committee can do and should do. First and foremost I compliment the members of the committee for their trojan work in the presentation of this document, the contents of which are very clear and in certain instances very shocking. It is really the bringing forth of a knowledge which hitherto has been kept absolutely secret and away from the public eye.</P>
      <P>The performance of Óstlanna Iompair Éireann Teoranta &mdash; in times gone by the subsidiary of the CIE company, under the chairmanship of CIE &mdash; leaves no doubt that it was a mismanaged organisation which made decisions on its own, on many occasions without consultation with Government, without consultation with the Minister for Transport.  In some instances described in the report they more or less told the Minister that he had no say in the matter at all, that it was not his business, that under the legal system by which they were formed he had no right to question certain misdemeanours, which have now been proven, in regard to many aspects of their performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point on which I would differ with Senator Ferris.  Indeed, the report differs also.  It is a fallacy to say that CERT have taken over the affairs of the Great Southern Hotels.  That is far from the truth.  CERT have no say in the day-to-day policy, the day-to-day management or future proposals for the Great Southern Hotels.  In fact CERT are the owners of the share capital which was reallocated to them.  The board have now been appointed directly by the Minister with no consultation with CERT and no input by them.  This will prove in time to be another mistake.  I do not want to start this debate in this vein but one can see, looking at the report of this committee, the performance of the previous board.  I want it to be known quite clearly in this House and throughout the country that CERT have no input in the day-to-day workings of the hotels.  They have no involvement whatsoever and they should not be blamed in any way for decisions <Col N="1249" /> made &mdash; whether good, bad or indifferent &mdash; in any of the Great Southern Hotels. The committee more or less intimated that argument in saying that they did not fully agree with what the Minister had done in setting up this new structure and new board.</P>
    <P>There are a few things one could say about it.  If we look at the functions of semi-State organisations &mdash; in general as well as in particular &mdash; one can always say that the Houses of the Oireachtas, whenever in difficulty with any aspect of those projects, as soon as they became a hot potato, they then made it semi-State, appointed a board and handed over their responsibilities to that board.  I have seen that happen in recent years.  Instead of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government taking on the problem and sorting it out and instead of the Minister responsible taking over that project and sorting it out, they handed it over to this new State board.  All the Houses of the Oireachtas were asked to do was to supply the money and the financial backup to all those semi-State boards.  There is a common belief in the Houses of the Oireachtas that all problems can be solved by forming a semi-State organisation.</P>
    <P>In the submissions sent by Óstlanna Iompair Eireann Teoranta that comes out very clearly &mdash; for example letters of guarantee take a high priority and letters of consent by the Minister did not stand for anything.  They had to get the guarantee or nothing.  If the State did not guarantee it, it was null and void.  No more letters of goodwill or good wishes would stand credit even from one semi-State organisation to another as was proved in this case.  Up to 1972 the Great Southern Hotel Group had been a profitmaking organisation, making not a huge profit but a reasonable one.  One could understand that there could not be a very big profit because this group was a big employer and had a big labour content. That is good in itself and one would not be demanding such huge profits.  Out of the blue, and seemingly for no reason at all, the board responsible for hotels made <Col N="1250" /> this crazy decision to purchase a hotel in Belfast.  That seemed to be the downfall of the organisation.  From that day on things went wrong.  On page 19, paragraph 37 of the report it states:</P>
    <P>This subsidiary company of Ó.I.É. was concerned solely with the Russell Court Hotel, Belfast.  In August, 1968 approval was granted to Ó.I.É. to purchase a sixty bedroom hotel in Belfast (the Russell Court) and adjoining property which was to be used to provide an additional fifty to seventy bedrooms in early 1970's.  The total cost of the completed project was estimated at £500,000 and this limit was agreed under the Public Capital Programme. A revised estimate of £555,000 for the project was given by Ó.I.É. in February, 1970.  Later in 1978 it emerged&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and this is where I say that we handed over authority to people who showed no responsibility for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;that work was well under way on a project radically different from the one that had been approved in 1968.  The original Russell Court had been demolished and the superstructure of a new 198 bedroom hotel on the site was well on the way to completion. The design of the new hotel also allowed for expansion to 350 bedrooms for which planning permission had been secured.  At that stage the capital costs of the project were estimated at £2.6m., to be funded by £0.6 m. grant from the Northern Ireland authorites and the balance from Ó.I.É and lending institutions.  The final cost of the project was £3.1m. approximately.</P>
    <P>Imagine the board of a semi-State organisation which were given the normal capital allocation by the Houses of the Oireachtas taking it upon themselves to go from £555,000 to £3.1 million without even having the courtesy to report back to the Minister in question and tell him that what they had asked for and got in good faith had now been abandoned and that they had gone their own way with a project costing £3.1 million.  If I had been <Col N="1251" /> the Minister in question I would have disbanded that board and sent them into oblivion, because from that day the Great Southern Hotels started going downhill.</P>
    <P>The board were let off the hook and they continued to make serious errors one after the other.  They tried to salvage something by selling off the little hotels around the country which had been making a profit &mdash; and which have continued to make a profit each year since they were sold.  I can name a few of these hotels.  They sold the Kenmare, Bundoran, Mulrany and the Sligo hotels for £550,000.  Rather than believe they had made an error in Belfast, they continued to make further errors.  That is where the rot started.  I blame the Minister.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the work done by this committee in pinpointing those issues. Eventually pressures were exerted on certain Ministers to sell that hotel, or practically to give it away when it was realised that it could not make a profit. They almost gave it away eventually.  I remember the night it was sold.  The man who purchased it, Mr. Eastwood, came on television and the words he said were &ldquo;I bought it for a song&rdquo;.  After crippling the whole of the Great Southern Hotels complex, which up to 1973 had been profitable, that was the comment from the man who purchased that hotel.  He was right.</P>
    <P>I remember suggesting in 1981 to the then Minister that I had information that the Mater Hospital in Belfast needed that site and building.  I believe to this day, and nobody has proved me wrong, that despite informing the Department of Transport at that time that the Mater Hospital in Belfast were interested nobody had made an approach to them. Little wonder Mr. Eastwood could loudly and clearly state on our national network that he bought it for a song.  He obviously knew what was going on.  It was a sad drama.  It was a terrible tragedy for that industry.  It was a terrible tragedy for all the hotels, particularly where I live on the west coast, whose committed staff were very proud of the hotels in which <Col N="1252" /> they worked.  We had three different grades of hotels.  First we had the Great Southern Hotel, Grade A; second, we had the lesser hotels in Mulrany and Bundoran &mdash; they were very good hotels and served the community well and third, we had the new hotels, such as the Corrib Great Southern in Galway, which dealt with the motoring trade, the night trade and commercial trade, all working very well.  This board sold for a nominal figure of £550,000 some of the most beautiful, and financially rewarding hotels in the group.</P>
    <P>This can never happen again in any semi-State organisation because now semi-State organisations must take note that Joint Committees like this committee on commercial State-sponsored bodies who have brought out this first report, have sounded the warning bell that these semi-State organisations will have to behave themselves in future. There is little point in us doing that if the Government do not follow it up with action.  The whole procedure has got to be tightened up.  Capital invested by the taxpayers is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, the Government of the day and the duly selected Minister for that particular Department or State-sponsored body.  This comes over loud and clear from this report.  The committee devote many columns to talking about the bad decisions, not the bad management, of the board.  That seems to be the overriding factor in this report.  For example, who made the decision not to pay the PAYE and PRSI employees' contributions &mdash; somewhere around £2 million? This money was kept by this board. It was not the hotel management who made this decision.  Those cheques were paid to the central office.  Who was responsible in the central office but the managing director and the board of this company.  Imagine, for example, private hotels in a city like Galway.  Demands are being made on them for PRSI and PAYE payments and in hard years the management of these hotels are striving to honour those payments.  Imagine what they thought when they discovered that <Col N="1253" /> the management and board of a semi-State organisation decided to withhold £2 million PAYE and PRSI payments.  I could never understand &mdash; and I still cannot understand &mdash; why the board and management were let off so lightly.  There are people in our jails for a lot less than the disgraceful behaviour of that board.</P>
    <P>The Minister, even at this late stage, should come in here and say what he proposes to do to that company which withheld that money, who literally stole that money from their employees.  Something has to be done about it.  This is remarked on on numerous occasions in this report and fair play to the committee who highlighted this.  This Minister who talked about rectitude should do something about this.  I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy G. Birmingham, before something else happens because the scene has been set, to do something about the manner in which the new organisation is set up.</P>
    <P>We have an appointed board which is responsible only to the Minister.  They are not responsible to CERT.  The way this board is set up they can again put their hands into the till belonging to the PAYE and PRSI people, and can make another decision similar to that made in Belfast when they were given permission by the Houses of the Oireachtas to spend £500,000 and spent £3½ million.  We have got to tighten this procedure.  I ask the Minister and the Government to tighten the structures concerning expenditure on capital projects as well as the other matters that I mentioned.  This report brings this out in their summary of recommendations; the committee are beseeching the Government to do something.</P>
    <P>CERT is a wonderful organisation which has done an enormous amount of work for restaurants, hotels and tourists. It is involved in tourism and quality food and requires high standards in our restaurants. We have courses in regional technical colleges, secondary and technical schools organised by CERT.  We have symposia in tourist districts organised by CERT to show the need to balance and to produce good food.  Despite all those training facilities, we have a group of <Col N="1254" /> hotels which the public believe CERT own, and this, is true but CERT have no administrative authority over the running of these hotels.  It is very important that that should be changed.  There are lecture classes in each regional technical college in this country.  During the summer months certain students could gain practical experience in any of the hotels.  This would lead to better service and would mean that incoming hotel staff would be better educated.</P>
    <P>Each year the regional technical colleges have a great problem trying to place students who have gone through a very grinding course for the summer and to give them practical experience.  Here was one opportunity.  Many hotels are just doing summer business.  Their main business in the winter time is low and they do not need a big staff.  It would be a wonderful experience for those young students to help provide a first class service. Under the new structures, could CERT take on a certain number of students in different grades this year, put them into their hotels as a part of their education &mdash; not as cheap labour &mdash; and at the end of that practical scheme say they will sit their examinations and then pass them?  These students can get remuneration for their work.  I do not expect them to work for nothing.  It is not the remuneration aspect that is in my mind but the furtherance of their practical education.  I beseech the Minister to think along those lines.  It would be an outlet for the regional technical schools in particular, and for other catering schools as well.  As CERT are involved in hotels and schools, this is an obvious choice.</P>
    <P>The lessons that we must learn from this are loud and clear.  A reappraisal has to be made straightaway as to the responsibility of that board and to whom they are responsible.  If they were responsible to an organisation of the calibre of CERT, one can rest assured that some of the obnoxious happenings of previous times would not recur.  It is not good enough for the Minister to think that he is depending upon a friend.  Whoever was appointed chairman of this particular board was a close friend of the Minister, <Col N="1255" /> either politically or personally.  If he was not a close friend of the Minister, he was a friend of the Labour Party.  He was a Coalitionite of one description or another.  This has happened with us, but not to the same extent of course.  The point is that that is not just good enough when you are talking about the expenditure of such quantities of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>I would make the suggestion that the responsibility for and the practical administration of those hotels, and not alone for the ownership of them, should rest on CERT, an organisation that has wonderful technical knowledge.  A board should be appointed and they should be responsible to the Minister when CERT have finished with their responsibilities or <i>vice versa</i>.  In other words, let CERT pick the board, let the board be responsible to CERT and let CERT be responsible to the Minister.  At present CERT are responsible to the Minister and the board are responsible to the Minister, but the board and CERT are not responsible to one another.  That is the missing link which has to be filled.  I suggest that the Minister do a rethink on this.</P>
    <P>I have made a few points because some of the decisions of this board were really serious and I appeal to the Minister to do something about them.  The decision to keep the workers' PAYE and PRSI contributions was most serious.  Everybody seems to have passed it over, and the board have got away with £2 million. There are men serving 20 years in jail for a lot less.  That is the truth.  I know a man who spent 12 months in jail because he owed £241.  That is only a drop in the ocean when compared with what these boys have got away with.  I beseech the Minister and the Government to rectify this position, seeing they are the Government of rectitude and that everything will be perfect when they are finished.  Our tourist industry has improved significantly this year.  The standards are now clear and set.  I hope the Minister will take those few points into consideration when he is replying.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate Senator Killilea on his speech.  He summed up very well the feeling of the committee as far as the hotels are concerned. He paid a tribute to CERT and said the part the regional colleges should play as far as CERT are concerned by giving practical experience in their hotels.  As usual, he says all things will change when Fianna Fáil come back.  It is nice to know that everything is going to be grand when they come back.</P>

      <P>This is a fine report &mdash; and the first &mdash; from this committee on semi-State bodies.  It is based on their investigations into these hotels and is a summary of what they would like to see happen in semi-State bodies.  I agree with Senator Killilea when he says that we have sounded a warning to the semi-State companies that they had better take note that this committee mean business and mean what they say.  They have produced a fine document here.</P>
      <P>A list of major bad decisions made by the board of OIE has been catalogued and I will go through a number of them. The first thing, and probably one of the most relevant things, that came up in this report was when we met Dr. St. John Devlin.  He said we had seven different Ministers over the last ten years as far as OIE are concerned, which indicates very distinctly that Dr. St. John Devlin and his board of directors did not give a twopenny damn about the Ministers, the Oireachtas and the Government, and continued as if there was no governing body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimates for the year ending 31 December 1983 will show accumulated losses for OIE of approximately £12 million, with fixed assets of £3 million in book value.  This indicates to even the least professional mind a disastrous situation. The balance sheet at 31 December 1982 shows current assets of £1.8 million and current liabilities of £10 million. <Col N="1257" /> Anyone can see &mdash; he does not have to be a technologist, an accountant or an economist &mdash; that that company was insolvent.</P>
    <P>We had a recent report in a magazine which indicated the findings of the committee and took the committee to task and criticised them because they suggested that running a deficit of such magnitude was a mortal sin.  They disagreed and outlined the various semi-State bodies which have current deficits and said that the committee were totally wrong to indicate that this semi-State body was in any way less efficient or were in breach of anything because they were running a current deficit.  The current deficit being of such magnitude contravenes the Companies Act, 1963, and clearly indicates that this company was insolvent.  Directors of an insolvent company are duty bound under the Companies Act to cease trading and to liquidate that company. We said at that time that it was the responsibility of the directors to resign, not only because the company was in a deficit situation and was insolvent, but because they were responsible for the magnitude of these losses.  The losses did not happen overnight.</P>
    <P>From 1977 to 1982 there were accumulated losses of £4.3 million.  If one looks at the profile of the losses of this company, one will see that in 1977 the total accumulated losses of £4.3 million increased in 1978 to £4.8 million, in 1979 to £5.5 million, in 1980 to £8.2 million, in 1981 to £9.1 million and in 1982 to £10.4 million.  The hotels show that in 1979 there was a profit of £107,000, in 1980 a loss of £296,000, in 1981 a loss of £383,000, in 1982 a loss of £557,000 and in 1983 a loss of £1 million.  There is the profile of the losses in this particular company.  That did not happen overnight. It happened over a long period of time. We were saying in effect in that report that once a company's current liabilities exceed its current assets to a material degree the Minister of the day should be so informed in writing by the board.  That was one of the strong recommendations of this committee.  Had that happened earlier the Minister would have been <Col N="1258" /> forced to take action because he would have been told in writing the exact position of the company.  That is a major considertion we came to and it is a decision that should be adopted by the House in dealing with semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>As public representatives we know the only time a company come near the Oireachtas is when they are in desperate need of finance.  We have seen it in Irish Shipping, in Irish Steel and in all the other semi-State bodies.  We are saying that the warning bells are there and the procedure is laid down.  It is a very simple exercise for a board of directors, faced with the accounts of the company where there is a material difference between the assets and liabilities to inform the Minister.  We had a situation where this particular company were insolvent and still trading under the Companies Act, 1963, and thus acting illegal.  The directors refused to sign the accounts for the years 1980 to 1983 on the ground that they wanted to bring pressure on the Minister to take some action.  They decided they would take action by not signing the accounts so that the Minister would immediately refer to that and would do something about it.  The relationship between the Minister's office and OIE at times seemed non-existent.  The way this company should have brought pressure on the Minister to do something about their own organisation was for the board to resign.  How could the board continue in existence when it refused to sign the accounts and thereby contravened the Companies Act?  To me that was totally ridiculous.  If they wanted to bring pressure on the Minister the way would have been to resign because they could not fulfil the role they were appointed to fulfil, namely, to run the hotels in CIE which are now in liquidation.</P>
    <P>If accounts are not signed they cannot be judged by anybody because they do not represent a true and fair indication of how the company stands.  Once the directors refuse to sign them it means they have no faith in the accounts.  You can read from that that the accounts were wrongly drawn up.  What they were actuping <Col N="1259" /> ally saying was that they were bringing pressure on the Government but what the Department of Transport say is that because the accounts were not signed the Minister could do nothing about helping this company.  To my mind there is a difference here on both sides.  Both sides are wrong.  If they wanted to do something, if they wanted to bring pressure on the Minister, the way to do so was to resign because they could not continue in their role as directors in the company.</P>
    <P>We have a board of directors set up to do a particular job, to look at a particular company.  They are given full authority to control the company and yet they are not willing to take any decisions.  Certain hotels in Ireland during the winter months are closed and we put the proposition to the chairman why CIE hotels themselves did not investigate why they should not close during the winter months.  His answer to that was that a certain junior Minister contacted him on the telephone and told him that he was not to close the hotels in the winter.  We requested to know the name of the Minister and we were not told.  We also requested to have a look at the documentation but this did not happen.  We were told that a major decision had been taken on foot of a telephone message from the Minister's office.  To me that rings hollow and very wrong, because such a decision is a major one and must be covered by full documentation.</P>
    <P>When we questioned Dr. St. John Devlin, he stated when the 1982 accounts were not signed it seemingly made no difference because nobody panicked and nobody was worried.  In fact we were criticised by no less a person than the chairman of the Leinster branch of Chartered Accountants for a failure to produce annual accounts.  I would have thought we acted very responsibly in trying to draw attention to an insolvency situation.  Nobody took any notice.  You can blame the Department, the Ministers, you can blame the Oireachtas, because the Oireachtas did not react either.  We are actually saying that the <Col N="1260" /> Oireachtas should be much more involved in the semi-State operations.  He is actually saying here that the Minister did not care, the Oireachtas did not care, the Department did not care and the board certainly did not care.  Here we have the company that was costing the State £10 million and nobody cared.  It was a disasterous situation.  We are talking about accountability.</P>
    <P>The committee talked about accountability when it investigated the Údarás and found that there was a company called G. T. Carpets that had not produced accounts since 1978.  It ceased trading in 1980 and is still not in liquidation.  What this body is saying is that there should and must be accountability.  Taxpayers' money is going into Údarás and into Irish Shipping Limited and there has to be an account.  The directors are responsible for what is happening.</P>
    <P>Senator Killilea talked about PAYE and PRSI.  The committee were alarmed that this situation had developed, that PAYE and PRSI was deducted from the staff and the company actually owed £2 million in 1982.  We were concerned for the State and we were concerned for the employees and their protection.  I asked Mr. Rabbitt who was the union representative when he heard about this and what information he had been given and he said he knew nothing about the PAYE situation until he saw it on television.  He said RTE seemed to have more information about the company than he had.  It is a crazy situation that the union representative did not know that there was a non-payment of PAYE.</P>
    <P>Dr. St. John Devlin when asked about the PAYE and VAT situation said he thought there was some kind of arrangement with the Minister for Finance.  He did not know what that arrangement was but he thought that because the collectors had not enforced legal proceedings on them that was to be taken as an indication that everything was squared up.  That was the kind of relationship between the board of CIE and the Government. Money had been deducted by the company but was not paid over.  The reason there was no problem was that somebody <Col N="1261" /> thought there was some kind of relationship between the Department of Transport&mdash;who probably did not know anything about it&mdash;and the Minister for Finance.  He said that it would have been better if the Minister for Finance had brought them to court because it would have highlighted their case.  He was looking for something else to highlight his case.  It is a scandal, as Senator Killilea said, that this should happen and in our report we say it should never happen again.  If the committee and the Houses of the Oireachtas were vigilant it would not happen.  As the chairman said in his opening statement, he met seven Ministers in the past ten years, which meant that the company did not give a tupenny damn about the Oireachtas, that they were a law unto themselves.</P>
    <P>I would like to talk about Powerscourt. This company entered into an arrangement in Powerscourt and over 15 months, in 1981-1982, they lost £249,000.  The chairman of the company called it a disaster. There was no fixed capital investment. Therefore, the chairman and the board did not have to go to the Minister to get sanction because there was a leasing agreement and any leasing arrangement does not have sanction of the Minister and the Department.  He said they were kept informed but I do not know how people were kept informed.  Contact between the Department of Transport and the company was non-existent at times.  It meant that the board could do whatever they liked.  As long as it was not fixed capital investment, they could lease any property they wished and enter into any operation so long as it had something to do with the hotel/restaurant business. They could not invest in capital expenditure because if they did they would have to go to the Minister but they could do whatever they liked so far as leasing was concerned.  They could enter into any project they wished and they could incur losses as they wished without any hold on them.  In this particular project they lost £249,000.  We asked what type of information they had and he said all the usual market research and so on. It was their own decision and it was a <Col N="1262" /> disastrous one.</P>
    <P>The situation is that a company was set up with terms of reference but those terms of reference, in most cases, were flouted by the company.  There are many things wrong with it.  Many things have happened.  You might say that things went wrong because of the economy but it had nothing to do with the economy. It had to do with the disastrous situation the company got themselves into and they took no great action to get themselves out of it.</P>
    <P>Senator Killilea talked about letters of comfort.  We said that no letters of comfort will ever be issued again.  The company went to ICC looking for a loan and produced a letter of comfort.  If anybody looked at the accounts of the company they would not issue a loan on anybody's recommendation or on a letter of comfort. Why should ICC give the company a loan on the Minister's letter of comfort when the company were insolvent?  We are saying letters of comfort are meaningless and should be discontinued.  A letter of guarantee is totally different.  It is covered by statute and the Minister has to go to the Oireachtas in order to get a letter of guarantee.  The ICC were correct when they indicated they could not loan money to the company.  That should have been taken as an indication to the board that they were insolvent, that they could not raise capital, and to the Department that the company were refused by a body like the ICC.  The situation should have been investigated and the company should not have been allowed continue in that loss-making situation.</P>
    <P>We have stated in our report that there should be an overall strategy so far as hotels are concerned.  There should be marketing expertise centrally.  Údarás, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and OIE are all involved in the hotel business.  We are a small country and we are saying there should be some kind of centralisation of activities.  If it is to be done properly it should be done by people who understand the business.  Dr. St. John Devlin, for whom I have some regard, has an expertise so far as CIE are concerned but I would query his expertise in the hotel <Col N="1263" /> business.  We are saying here that you have and should have a central body, a central committee or a central semi-State body set up to run these hotels.</P>
    <P>This committee, when it came out with the results of its investigation, was criticised by no less a newspaper than <i>The Irish Times</i>.  In its editorial it gave credit to the committee and recognised what they were doing but said they would be better off looking at themselves and concentrating on their own jobs instead of criticising and highlighting the actions of all of these semi-State bodies.  On the basis of the facts we have produced here, should we not highlight a situation where we find gross mismanagement?  Should we not highlight a situation where PAYE and PRSI, to the tune of about £2 million, was not paid over to the State and where employees could lose benefit because of that?  Should this committee not highlight that?  Should not this committee, in this particular report, indicate a possible anomaly where a semi-State body can lease, <i>ad infinitum</i>, and have no accountability to the Minister or to the Department? Should this body not highlight these things?  Should we not highlight the situation as we found it, where this company were trading illegally and in contravention of the 1963 Act?  Should not we indicate and highlight a situation where this company, up to 1983, could run up £12 million in losses?  If the executives, the board, responsible for the running of the hotels were not able to run them they should have resigned.  They should have taken action.  They should not have allowed a situation to develop where you get this glib answer and say that nobody cared.  They are the people involved in the running of these hotels.</P>
    <P>It is said that nobody took any notice, that nobody cared.  I would suggest that this committee cares and it should be listened to.  It is a committee made up of all the political parties, with expertise in business, in the trade union movement and in the industrial world.  It is a body which takes its job very seriously.  I have been on the committee since it was founded &mdash; and there is no division <Col N="1264" /> between the political parties, but there is the unanimous consensus that we take our work seriously.  We take seriously the fact that so much money is being wasted in the semi-State bodies.  We take exception to the fact that when we reveal a situation such as with Údarás regarding GT Carpets, where no accounts were produced at all, nobody seemed to know and nobody seems to care.  We have a very important role to play.  We take seriously the fact that when Irish Shipping go into long leasing arrangements they lose so much money and these things should be highlighted.  The committee has charted a course to investigate and look at semi-State bodies in future.  Probably people may disagree with some of the findings of the committee but it produces worth-while reports.</P>
    <P>I would be remiss if I did not pay tribute to our consultant who produced this report and who worked so well with the committee.  This report should be circulated to all Members of both Houses, the Dáil and Seanad, as it probably has been. It should be read and its recommendations should be heeded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This first report of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies on OIE raises several important issues which are relevant to the commercial State-sponsored bodies sector as a whole.</P>
      <P>I want to focus on the most fundamental problem arising out of the existence of a wide range of commerical State-sponsored bodies, that is, the problem of the control of these undertakings and the supervision of their policies and practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his officials are responsible for the preparation of policies, that is the norm, and for ensuring that the boards of the bodies concerned conform to the policies laid down.  In practice it falls to the civil servants to supervise the activities of the State-sponsored bodies, with the obligation to inform their Minister and secure his clearance on issues, as appropriate.  It has not been the practice either for Ministers or civil servants to interfere with the day <Col N="1265" /> to day conduct of the business of State-sponsored bodies.  That is as it should be. I certainly subscribe to that view as a member of the Joint Committee and also as one who worked for several years in State-sponsored bodies before I joined the staff of UCD.  My complaint, however, is a serious one and has been voiced already.  There is a very serious problem of inadequate control on major issues emerging from this report, for which the Minister and his civil servants must take at least some of the responsibility.</P>
    <P>The case I have in mind is the Russell Court Hotel, Belfast, which accounts for £8 million of the £12 million debts accumulated to the end of 1983.  As has been said already, the then Minister and his Department conveyed approval to OIE for the Russell Court Hotel investment in 1968.  The total cost at that time for the completed project was estimated at £500,000.  The project was to be finalised without exceeding the limit set for OIE under the public capital programme.  A revised estimate for the project was given by OIE in February 1970, which was £555,000.  But later in that year of 1970 it emerged that work was at an advanced stage on a project totally different from the one already approved.  Again, as has been pointed out but it bears repeating, the cost of the Russell Court Hotel on its completion was £3.1 million.  The effect was that OIE spent over £3 million on a project for which £500,000 had been approved.  The Joint Committee, in the course of our hearings, received no satisfactory evidence as to why the initial project, as approved, was not adhered to.</P>
    <P>This obviously illustrates a very serious weakness in the monitoring mechanisms which should and must exist between a State-sponsored body and a Government Department.  As we pointed out in our report, regardless of the merits of the expanded project it should not have been undertaken without prior consultation with the Department.  The total loss incurred by the Russell Court was almost £8 million which has now been paid out of Irish taxpayers' money.  That raises the question as to who is responsible for this <Col N="1266" /> mess?  The responsibility in my view must be shared between the former board of OIE for not informing the Department of the radical departure they made in this project and also the Department must take their share of the responsibility for not ensuring that they got the relevant information from OIE.  A serious problem with the operation of State-sponsored bodies is that there is a civil service attitude that says, &ldquo;We will control by exception; we do not particularly want to hear from you if you are progressing satisfactorily&rdquo;.  That is inadequate.  Here we have a case where there was not adequate monitoring by the Department and we have a project with approved expenditure of £½ million which ultimately costs £3.1 million without approval.</P>
    <P>As we point out in our report, we strongly favour closer monitoring mechanisms. If there had been quarterly monitoring of the Russell Court project as a condition of approval of the initial £0.5 million then subsequent action by OIE would have been detected and appropriate action would have been taken.  It is for this reason that we made recommendation No. 7 which reads:</P>
    <P>Where a decision is taken by the company which would have the effect of exceeding approved capital expenditure, the formal approval in writing of the Minister concerned to exceed approved expenditure should be obtained.</P>
    <P>Day to day control should properly belong to the State-sponsored bodies themselves.  When we are talking about substantial investments and other major decisions, there is a need for close monitoring and for close control and hence our recommendation.</P>
    <P>I have two specific recommendations to put to the Minister which are not contained in the report before us.  There is the obvious danger that some boards of State-sponsored bodies will think of themselves as independent entities rather than as part of a larger organisation.  At the end of the day, however, the responsibility for the failure and deficiencies of a State board rests with the Minister.  The Minister has the power to change directors <Col N="1267" /> or to dismiss a board.  If, in justifiable circumstances, he neither changes the directors nor sacks the board he is then indicating that he is satisfied with the performance of the board.</P>
    <P>My first additional recommendation is this: where the Minister considers that circumstances warrant it, he should dismiss a board of a State-sponsored body, notwithstanding the lack of this practice in the past.  The second recommendation that I wish to put to the Minister relates to the position of the chief executive of State-sponsored bodies.  I put it to the Minister that chief executives of State-sponsored bodies should not be appointed for life but should hold contracts for a period of five years.  If they give satisfactory service, the contract can be renewed.  This should be general practice. I know it is already the practice in a small number of State-sponsored bodies. The relevant Ministers should direct the boards under their political control so that fixed contracts for chief executives will become the norm.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Joint Committee's examination the scandalous fact emerged that unpaid PAYE and PRSI accounted for almost £2 million of creditors at the end of 1982.  On further inquiry we discovered that towards the end of 1981 an arrangement was reached with the Revenue Commissioners and the relevant Minister at the time that proceedings should be withheld for the non-payment of the taxes.  The Revenue Commissioners were asked by the Minister to consider withholding proceedings as the whole question of OIE and its future was under review.  I asked Dr. Devlin, the former chairman of OIE in the course of our hearings how could he justify the non-payment of the taxes.  He replied that he could not justify the non-payment of taxes and that he wished in fact that the company had been pressed to pay the £2 million arrears and thereby bring the future of the company to a head.  A year later, at the end of 1982, funds were set aside by the Minister for Finance to meet the tax liability.  In my book this is a highly provocative and dangerous thing, <Col N="1268" /> that arrears of taxes to the tune of £2 million should have been allowed to accumulate in a State company.</P>
    <P>This provides a particularly bad example to hard-pressed companies in the private sector and it obviously gave an edge, at the taxpayers' expense, to the State owned hotel group over their competitors in the hotel industry in the private sector. Furthermore, the employees in OIE, whose entitlements could have been infringed by the non-payment of the taxes were not informed of the non-payment of taxes, taxes that they themselves had paid by way of deductions from their incomes.  In this latter respect, I think there is a defect in the social welfare regulations.  The social welfare regulations entitle an employee to inspect his employer's records with regard to contributions payable by him or he may obtain a statement of such record from his employer once in every period of three months.  The regulations do not require an employer to disclose to the employee whether deducted contributions have actually been paid over to the Revenue Commissioners.  In our report we recommend that where PAYE and PRSI payments to the Revenue Commissioners are overdue for a period in excess of three months employees should be informed of the position.</P>
    <P>Personally, I want to put a further recommendation to the Minister in this regard.  I feel that the social welfare regulations should be amended so as to require an employer to disclose to his employees whether deducted contributions have been paid over to the Revenue Commissioners or not.  Earlier this year, ownership of OIE was transferred from CIE to CERT.  Under the new arrangement the owners of the hotel group will be CERT but the new board was appointed by the Minister for Labour and will report directly to him.  I joined with the other members of the committee when we produced our report in wishing the new board success.  I also shared the misgivings of the committee about the new board's ability to resolve the difficulties facing the company.  Precisely <Col N="1269" /> because of our misgivings the Joint Committee has recommended that the company be required to furnish to the Joint Committee a progress report in respect of the period ending 31 December 1984. The terms of reference of the new board are to make the hotels viable and commercial. In the course of evidence we were told that the Government were providing approximately £14 million to clear certain debts.  While I would hope otherwise, I have serious doubts that this Government injection of the very large sum of £14 million of taxpayers' money to wipe the slate clean will actually be sufficient to ensure that the company will not show a loss in December 1984.  I hope I am proved wrong but I doubt it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the future of the hotels, the evidence given by the former chairman of OIE, Dr. St. John Devlin, is both revealing and relevant.  I would like to hear the Ministers reaction to the following quotes from Dr. St. John Devlin.  At page 12 of the minutes of evidence Dr. St. John Devlin said:</P>
    <P>If I was in the private sector I would certainly close down Restaurant na Mara.  I would sell off the hotels either to a chain or to individuals.  I would certainly get out of the business because I do not think it is possible to make a business generate an acceptable return on the investment that would be necessary over the next ten years.  You may ask who would I get to buy it?  I think one would need a different style of hotel management and indeed a different style of trading to make it pay.  One would also have to have a different type of staffing.  One would have to do many things that might not be possible in the public sector.</P>
    <P>On page 13 of the minutes of evidence Dr. St. John Devlin has the following to say:</P>
    <P>My philosophy is that the public sector should not be in anything that can be done by the private sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1270" /> Nobody seems to have a philosophy about semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>My philosophy has been that the State should only be in if nobody else can do it.</P>
    <P>These quotations from Dr. St. John Devlin raised the fundamental question as to whether these hotels should be in State ownership at all and also the question whether, if they remain in State ownership, and that is the more likely scenario at present, they have any real prospect of meeting the terms of reference of the new board, namely that they be made viable and commercial.  If we assume that the hotels remain in State ownership it is vital that the recommendations of the Joint Committee be implemented and that is the plea that I as a member of the Joint Committee want to make and Senator Conway has already made.  We make a plea for the implementation of the recommendations.  No private undertaking could survive the haemorrhage of losses incurred by the OIE hotels in recent years.  In 1980 the hotels incurred losses of £296,000 and in 1981 the losses came to £383,000, in 1982 £557,000, in 1983 the losses reached £1,008,000.  All these figures are separate from the major problem of the £8 million lost on the Russell Court Hotel.  There was no successful attempt made to remedy the situation and this reflects badly on both the company and the Department.</P>
    <P>The performance of the hotels up to now has been monitored solely on the basis of annual accounts.  These are historical documents and given the serious background of £14 million in debts, the Joint Committee recommends that the company be obliged to prepare halfyearly interim accounts, which would be available to the Joint Committee, and that where significant variances arise in relation to budget then the Minister should be notified in writing.  This would be a far more effective control than relying on past history through the use of annual accounts as has been the practice up to now.  We further recommend in the report that, where significant variances arise, the Minister should then ensure <Col N="1271" /> that corrective action be taken by the company.</P>
    <P>There is the question as to whether the monitoring arrangements stressed and recommended by us is too close and too severe.  I put it to the Minister that such close monitoring is both justified and necessary.  There is an urgent need to protect the taxpayer's money, the aggrieved PAYE sector in particular, and to ensure effective management in the hotels.  While I believe that there is a compelling case for the closer monitoring of the hotel company as already described, I must add my personal concern about the ability of the Department of Labour to evaluate the business of the hotels in the future.  I am aware that there are civil servants in the Department of Communications, the previous parent Department, with expertise regarding OIE.  In the course of evidence we were informed that these civil servants will not be transferred to the Department of Labour.  I know many civil servants in the Department of Labour and I have the highest regard for them.  What I am questioning here is whether the necessary expertise is within the Department of Labour to evaluate a hotel group.  Therefore I raise the question as to how the Minister can expect his Department officials adequately to evaluate proposals and proposed decisions submitted to them by OIE.  In the particularly difficult circumstances in which OIE finds itself, I would make a personal additional recommendation to the Minister that he either arrange to transfer the people with the OIE experience from the Department of Communications to his own Department of Labour or, that he put a Department of Labour representative on the board of OIE, or that he does both.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>Most of the points have been covered by the previous speakers.  I would like to compliment the previous speakers who have been members of this committee who were responsible for this report.  There are a few points that really <Col N="1272" /> surprised me in this report.  The first one was where Senator Hillery spoke about the fact that there was £2 million collected in PRSI that was not handed over to the Government.  If a private company had withheld money they had got like this they would find themselves in court and possibly in jail.  What surprised me altogether was that a Minister could get the Revenue Commissioners to withhold taking action to recover this money.  I did not think the Minister had the power to stop action being taken in relation to a company who had withheld payment of their PRSI, money which they had collected from the workers which was rightfully the workers'.  I cannot say how he did that.</P>
      <P>Senator Killilea spoke about the sale of hotels and said that some of them were given away for a song.  It would be better if the hotels which were losing money were given away for a verse of a song rather than continue with those loss-making units.</P>
      <P>Various figures have been given by Senator Conway and Senator Hillery.  I would like to go into the details published in the report.  The Great Southern Hotel in Galway in 1979 lost £91,000, in 1980, £32,000, 1981, £75,000, 1982, £138,000 and in 1983, £331,000.  The Great Southern Hotel in Killarney in 1979 lost £80,000, in 1980, £53,000, in 1981, £100,000, in 1982, £95,000 and in 1983, £234,000.  The Great Southern Hotel, Parknasilla, in 1979 lost £11,000, in 1980, £50,000, in 1981, £39,000, in 1982, £52,000 and in 1983, £47,000.  Progressively, the losses have got worse and worse. The Corrib in Galway in 1979 lost £53,000, in 1980, £59,000, in 1981, £82,000, in 1982, £155,000 and in 1983, £174,000.  The Torc in Killarney in 1979 lost £52,000, in 1980, £8,000, in 1981, £9,000, in 1982, £30,000 and in 1983, £53,000.  The Great Southern Hotel in Rosslare lost in 1979 £2,000, in 1980, £94,000, in 1981, £78,000, in 1982, £87,000 and in 1983, £169,000.  The total losses in 1979 for this group of hotels were £107,000, in 1980, £296,000, in 1981, £383,000, in 1982, £577,000 and £1,008,000 in 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> In any well run business if the business is losing money there is an investigation. Accountants come in, there is an audit done and the part that is loss-making is got rid of, otherwise there is a haemorrhage. Any money that the companies may have just flows away like blood from a wound in the body.  That was some wound in CIE.  I do not know how they got away with withholding the money from the PRSI and how the Revenue Commissioners could let them run on, because this obviously went on over a number of years.  If a private company withheld their payments for more than two months they would be visited by an inspector from the Revenue Commissioners who would want to see their books and would want to know why they had not paid this money.  I know companies where the Revenue Commissioners are going back five years.  If their payments were late two, three or five days because of postal delays the Revenue Commissioners are now looking for interest from these people.  These people have a workforce just the same as CIE.</P>
    <P>In September 1971 Senator Killilea was a member of a Government who took a decision to sell these hotels.  The sale of the hotels was being processed when there was a change of Government.  The new Minister could not do anything about the sale of the hotels at that stage as CIE in their typical attitude of running the show by their own rules, had made reservations for the whole of 1982 and the Government had no choice but to honour them.  The same thing happened in 1983. In 1984 we have CERT running the hotels.</P>
    <P>The remedy is not to sell the hotels.  I come from Killarney where there are two of these hotels and a neighbouring one in Parknasilla.  They are beautiful hotels, an asset to the area and very important for tourism.  I would not like to see these hotels sold in case they would be put to other use.  I should like to see the hotels retained, but not at the taxpayers' expense.  If the hotels were not to become viable and if the PRSI worker and every other taxpayer had to provide luxury holidays <Col N="1274" /> for somebody thousands of miles away, I would not like to see that happening.</P>
    <P>There was obviously mismanagement on the part of CIE because they were handed over premises, equipment, a business and goodwill.  It is the same as many a father who ran a successful business which he built from the ground up and which he handed over to his son but the son just eroded that business until it went burst.  They say after a gatherer comes a squanderer.  We took over these hotels from the British Government who were the gatherers and we have turned out to be the squanderers.  Unless there is something done now about making these hotels viable, it would be better to get rid of them no matter what use was made of them.  People who have expertise in the hotel business should lease these hotels. These people could run these hotels profitably, charging reasonable rates which would be an attraction to tourists.  They would be giving a service to the country.</P>
    <P>At present CIE link tours to their hotels with their own coaches.  It is a sad sight to travel from Dublin to Kerry and see five or six people in a 55-seater CIE coach going to Killarney.  I know if they want to provide a service, there may be reasons why they cannot fulfil their engagements, for example, if something happens overseas or in circumstances which are outside their control.  I cannot understand why CIE when they have not the people to fill their luxury buses, could not use minibuses and at least keep down costs.  I should like to know if CIE are responsible for the losses in the coach department or are the coach department adding some of their losses to the hotels? Who is codding who?  I have not seen anything in the report on this.</P>
    <P>An American ambassador's wife wrote a book about her experiences in Ireland and she said that one thing she could not understand was that we did not have a sense of outrage.  If there was a sense of outrage there would be an outrage about the way CIE manage their affairs and how they ignore all the rules.  It was pointed out by Senators Conway and Hillery <Col N="1275" /> that CIE are a bankrupt concern and that this is in contravention of the 1963 Act.  If this is allowed to continue people will be very bitter especially when they see a big portion of their hard earned money going in tax and that money being used to subsidise somebody coming from Tanganyika or Saudi Arabia to get a suite in the Great Southern Hotel in Killarney.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to examine this whole question, and if the hotels continue to show the losses they have been showing, to get rid of them. CIE should lease them.  There is one particular man in Dublin who had a group of hotels.  He built them one by one.  He did not get the hotels provided for him, or the equipment or the goodwill provided for him like the people did with CIE.  He is giving a service today to the people.  Many more people like him around the country, particularly the family-run hotels, have a human approach to the business.  I do not want an inhuman approach in cutting our losses, closing the doors and leaving it at that.  There are people involved whose livelihoods are at stake.  Their livelihood will go anyway if the hotels continue in the way they have been run in the past.  Lease the hotels and offer them to people who have the expertise to run them.  The leases should be short term in case the people who get them do not do a good job.  They might not make them viable or might affect tourism in other ways.  With a proper drawn-up programme these hotels can be successful.  If the right people get them I have no doubt whatever that they will pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to apologise for the fact that I was not here at the beginning of the debate.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy George Birmingham, has given me a note of the line of discussion that has been taken by various Members, so I am aware of the broad outline of what has been said.</P>
      <P>I would respond initially by complimenting the Joint Committee on their report.  It underpins the extraordinary value that the reform of the Oireachtas has in enabling Members in an investigative way to examine the operation of different aspects of the State sector and different aspects of public administration. The verbatim evidence of the committee is an extraordinary document in showing the way in which, for the first time probably at central Government level, public representatives are able directly to question executives of semi-State companies and civil servants in a manner that previously was not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee made a number of recommendations.  I would like to respond to them and in so doing to take up some of the points that Senator Hillery and other Senators made.  I would like to start at the very beginning, because it was fundamental to the reasons why these <Col N="1277" /> hotels are still in public ownership.  Since Senator Hillery quoted Dr. St. John Devlin on page 13 of the report on this very point, I would like to respond to it. Dr. St. John Devlin stated:</P>
    <P>My philosophy is that the public sector should not be in anything that can be done by the private sector. Nobody seems to have a philosophy about semi-State bodies.  My philosophy has been that the State should only be in it if nobody else can do it.</P>
    <P>He seems to be very poorly informed, I am sorry to say, because the Labour Party have a very consistent theory on what the State sector should be doing.  In this area I would make the distinction between the commercial State sector and public service State sector where in fact the public service element is distorting the pricing mechanism that the market would otherwise operate for the services that the State sector company would provide.</P>
    <P>It was the view of the Labour Party members at that time, and still is the view of the Labour Party, that there is a valid role for a State-owned chain of hotels in this country.  People tend to focus on the failures of a particular enterprise if it is State-owned and use that as an argument to prove a spurious ideological belief that somehow or other State-owned enterprise is incapable of being efficient.  If one was to apply the same logic to every private company that goes bankrupt and extend from the number of bankruptcies in the private sector the conclusion that private enterprise is somehow or other inefficient because of the failure of individual firms, the contradictions in the first argument against State-owned enterprises would become very apparent.  I do not think the nature of ownership in itself is the critical factor in the operation of a commercially viable enterprise.  What is critical is that the terms of reference of that enterprise are clearly stated and that the management are given a clear mandate to operate within commercial terms of reference and given the resources to undertake it.</P>
    <P>I would go on to say in relation to Dr. <Col N="1278" /> St. John Devlin's comment that in view of what he says on page 13 it is quite extraordinary to read his justification in response to Senator Brian Fleming as to why he authorised, as Chairman of OIE, the participation of OIE in the Powerscourt restaurant lease, an area where the private sector was manifestly doing on a fairly substantial scale in the city centre something which seems to be directly at odds with what he states in chapter 13. However, this is not a debate through the Seanad with Dr. St. John Devlin.</P>
    <P>The report has clearly indicated that over a number of years political interference or political procrastination, the phrase that occurs in the verbatim report, has not helped the commercial operation of this group of companies.  Therefore it is my intention to ensure that having set the terms of reference and appointed the board of the OIE group of hotels or the Great Southern group of hotels there should be no political interference of that kind.  They have been given a job to do. The terms of reference are clear &mdash; to make a commercial success, in consultation with the trade union movement. There has been very good relations with the trade union movement on that front and they have a mutual interest in making a success of this important chain of hotels.  That view regarding the retention of public ownership and the successful contribution to the tourism infrastructure is a view that is shared by the Irish Hotels Federation and by Bord Fáilte, who recognise the critical and pivotal role of the Great Southern Hotels within the infrastructure of our tourism industry and welcome the decision that this hotel group should be retained in public ownership, provided it will run on an efficient basis.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to report to the House that so far to date &mdash; and the transfer only took place on the 9 March and the board came into operation very soon after that &mdash; their projections for this year are being out-performed in terms of what they had hoped to get at the beginning of this tourist year. According to the note that I have here revenue for the current year is 17 per cent <Col N="1279" /> ahead of the 1983 level.  There is an increase in sleepers, I presume that is bed nights, of 12.5 per cent in the hotels. There is a 20 per cent increase expected in business from North America.  Despite the difficult economic situation in Ireland the aggressive marketing of the hotels is yielding an extra increase in what is referred to as sleepers, or overnight stays.  This summer would indicate that there has been a successful trading on behalf of the ÓIE group and they have had a satisfactory series of discussions with the trade unions in relation to manning and staffing levels and other matters of management.</P>
    <P>On the question of the recommendations of the report, I will say that in principle I am accepting all of the recommendations. I believe in the disclosure of information and the right of elected members to comment upon it.  So in principle we will come back at some stage suitable to the House on that matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn briefly to a point that was raised both in the committee's report and during the debate as to why there should be a relationship between the Department of Labour, CERT and myself.  A political decision was taken, supported by the private sector in the form of the Irish Hotels Federation, to retain these hotels in public ownership. The question then was to which Department should that hotel group be responsible. The only Department that had a catering dimension to it was the Department of Labour in the form of CERT. Therefore the decision was taken, before I became a member of the Cabinet, to assign the hotel group from the Department of Communications to the Department of Labour under the ownership of CERT.  That decision was taken in principle and the details were to be worked out.  When we came to work out the details in full consultation with the council of CERT it was agreed that the relationship should be some form of an arm's length one, for the very reason that there is not a board of CERT but a council.</P>
    <P>CERT is a representative organisation <Col N="1280" /> in which there are nominated members both educational and commercial. They felt it would be inappropriate themselves felt it would be inappropriate for that representative council to be involved in the operation of what will be a commercial operation in the very field from which they were drawn as representatives. Yet there was a political decision to retain the group of hotels in public ownership under the umbrella of the Department of Labour.  We therefore agreed that the best way to handle that situation was for the legal ownership of the hotels to be vested in CERT, which is an organisation directly under my responsibility, and for me in consultation with the council of CERT, to appoint the members of the board and to have the board reporting on a direct basis to the Minister and the Department of Labour. That was agreed by CERT and by the Government and the necessary arrangements were made.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the way it has operated to date.  The members of the board were selected by me in consultation with Government, as is the normal practice, on the basis of their proved ability in areas related to the running and operation of a hotel or of a catering organisation.  They were also selected on the basis that they had the time available and were prepared to make the commitment, which would be quite onerous in terms of time, to the successful re-launch of this publicly-owned company.  The figures I have read out would appear to indicate that it is a case of so far so good in that regard.  That is the essential nub of the question in relation to the nature of the ownership and its reporting relationship with the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery raised the question of the way in which PAYE and PRSI payments, which are the legal property of the employee, were utilised in effect as working capital in a manner which was effectively illegal as far as one can gather. I hesitate to use that word, so the qualification is there.  He raised a broader point with which I am in full agreement.  There is a problem about the utilisation of <Col N="1281" /> moneys by any employer which are properly in the ownership of the employee and which should properly be in a particular fund or contributed to the State in the shape of a social welfare contribution.  I will certainly bring the points that have been raised in this regard to the attention of the Minister for Social Welfare because it does, as the Senator points out, involve changing or improving the operation of the social welfare code.  It is not peculiar to this company, as the House will agree, and many public representatives will be aware of that problem.</P>
    <P>Another point in the report is the suggestion that there should be an overall strategy for State sector hotels.  The report brings out the fact that Aer Lingus is a very substantial hotel operator both in this country and abroad.  In this country it is a minority shareholder in a large and commercially successful hotel chain, and it is either an outright owner or a leaseholder or an equity partner in one shape or form in a whole range of hotels in three, if not four, countries.  Ancillary services of Aer Lingus in that regard have been extremely successful.  Údarás na Gaeltachta through the Department of the Gaeltacht also own and operate hotels.  There is considerable merit in the idea of looking at some form of co-ordinated strategy for the State hotel sector. I would, however, be inclined to leave it to the commercial good sense of the people involved, because the objective would be to maximise the commercial operational performance of those hotels within the terms of reference that have been set for them by the relevant Department.</P>
    <P>The final point I raise is the way in which our State sector companies can be monitored in a responsible way by public representatives, because in a sense we are the ultimate shareholders acting in trust on behalf of the public whose taxes are put into them either as initial capital or frequently as additional equity capital. We must consider the way in which that particular responsibility can be exercised, while at the same time preventing undue or unhelpful political interference which <Col N="1282" /> gets in the way of what would be seen as normal and bona fide commercial operational activity.  Part of the trouble, politically, ideologically or philosophically &mdash; to go back to Dr. St. John Devlin &mdash; is that we have had a large State sector for a long time run by some people and some parties who fundamentally do not believe in a State sector to begin with, who find the whole idea of public ownership somehow anathema to their political philosophy and who, therefore, do not apply one category of commercial sets of rules or another and then, to my chagrin, at the end of that process of intervention and interference, have the temerity to suggest that the State sector does not work, when in reality over a period of time they have succeeded in ensuring that it could not possibly work.</P>
    <P>That is why the Labour Party have always said that in the commitment to a mixed economy which we share there is not only room but an absolute necessity for a vibrant commercial State sector working side by side with private enterprise companies, possibly working in joint ventures with private enterprise companies or possibly doing things which private enterprise has manifestly refused to do since the foundation of the State. Therefore, the committee's report has enabled, probably for the first time, the public at large and Members of the Oireachtas to see some of the tensions and contradictions that have in a general way permeated through the operation of some of our State-owned companies.  I hope we have learned a lesson from that kind of unhelpful interference.  It is right and proper that public representatives should set criteria for operation through the enactment of the legislation that establishes a company and should set certain aspirations and standards of performance through the authority of the Oireachtas and the Government.  What is clear and comes right through the operation of this hotel group &mdash; I use this merely as an example rather than a particular case and I am sure the Members of the House will agree with me because it is the first report of the committee &mdash; is the contradiction brought about by the lack of a clear philosophy <Col N="1283" /> on the role of a State sector in our economy.</P>
    <P>To conclude on a general note, we have quite clearly taken publicly and politically a decision that has been supported by the workers in the enterprise, by the tourism organisation and by the hotels' organisation that this group of hotels should be retained in public ownership and should be made successful in the interests of themselves, the tourist industry and the taxpayers, who at the end of the line are effectively the shareholders.  Having taken that decision, it behoves all of us to maintain a benign and fatherly interest in the operations of it but to enable the organisation and the company to get on with the job.  I am quite confident that in this case they will be able to get on with the job and I hope that when we come to review at the appropriate time and in the appropriate manner the first year we will be able to consolidate the preliminary figures of success that I have indicated to the House.</P>
    <P>I hope I have taken all of the points raised by the various Members.  I will be happy to come back at some later stage and elaborate on them if that is required.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion I had indicated what I thought was the historical situation which had created two sections of the community in Northern Ireland in a system that was based on sectarian loyalties.  I had also indicated the lack of basic rights to the Nationalist community &mdash; discrimination in housing, electoral rights and jobs.  I had moved on to make the point that the Forum had been established for consultation in a way which would bring about a lasting peace that could be achieved through the democratic system.  As we all know, this Forum was open to all democratic parties who rejected violence.  Regrettably, the Unionists saw fit not to take part in the Forum, but I do know from the reports and from people I spoke to who sat on that famous Forum, that they went out of their way to welcome and to meet people of the Unionist tradition.  They went out of their way to understand their beliefs and traditions, and their oral and written submissions were particularly well scrutinised.  I cannot help feeling, and the Minister would probably confirm, that the oral submissions on 19 January 1984 were of particular importance to the work of the Forum and were examined in great detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We waited and hoped for a good response from the British as a result of the recent House of Commons debate. That was an opportunity for Mrs. Thatcher and her Government to spell out what they might do.  But, having closely followed that debate, nothing more than the usual, dull and monotonous recitation of clichés came from Mr. Prior on that occasion.  In my opinion, he paid no justice to the issue or to the efforts, hopes and beliefs which went into the work of the Forum report.  It seemed to me that the Tories on that occasion <Col N="1285" /> were far more interested in seeing how Mr. Prior performed on what was to be one of his last occasions before he retired to the back benches.  Clearly, it was a very negative response and I could not help feeling that the Labour Party's performance on that occasion was very little better.  Their spokesman on the North, Mr. Archer, dismissed the findings of the Forum by saying that his party were not interested in making political mileage from the outcome and deliberations on the New Ireland Forum report.  This is the easy way out for the party which first gave the Unionists their guarantee.  It goes without saying that neither party would in any way support the main recommendation of this report.</P>
    <P>The failure of both parties to be positive simply means that security will continue to cost this country and Britain millions of pounds, that our jails will continue to be filled with subversives and that an air of general hopelessness will continue to affect both the North and the Republic.  I would prefer not to use the words &ldquo;Nero fiddling while Rome burns&rdquo;, but that is how I could describe the situation at the moment.  Both the Labour Party and the British Government have not responded positively and because of the continuance of violence, more people will die in the North, in England and in Ireland.  It is time for Mrs. Thatcher and her Government to take the Northern Ireland problem seriously.  I had hoped that the opinion polls commissioned for the London Weekend Television Company would change her mind and the minds of her Government because those polls indicated that over 60 per cent of those interviewed believe that Dublin should have a say in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.  If this poll had been taken four, five or six years ago, I do not think you would have 2 per cent or 3 per cent saying that.  This increase in support must give encouragement to all those who are interested in solving this particular problem.</P>
    <P>It would be a tragedy if the efforts of so many genuine and well meaning people, were wasted.  I support the main <Col N="1286" /> recommendation of the report because I feel that a unitary State achieved by agreement between the Nationalists and the Unionists would allow full participating by all traditions in the government of this island.  It would provide many advantages in the area of agriculture, tourism, commerce and trade.  Like many people I waited for a reaction to last Friday's tragedy.  I noted &mdash; and quite rightly &mdash; that swift condemnation came from the Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, from Mr. Haughey and other party leaders.  Clearly, the whole democratic process was interfered with in the most abhorrent way.  We must not condone what happened in Brighton, but, at the same time, we cannot act like the ostrich and bury our heads in the sand and pretend we do not understand why it happened.</P>
    <P>It is obvious now that the bombing in Brighton will not alter the response to the New Ireland Forum.  Last Monday on television Mrs. Thatcher virtually ruled out any new initiative by saying that moves must come from Northern Ireland and have the support of the majority.  I found this to be a most distressing and disappointing statement.  Mrs. Thatcher has always claimed that Northern Ireland was an integral part of the United Kingdom. If that is the case, surely she has a duty to rule Northern Ireland and to endeavour to solve the problems of Northern Ireland.  It is very obvious to me that if there is to be any new initiative it is not coming from this source. Obviously we must wait for a new Government and for a new Prime Minister. Certainly it is not coming from Mrs. Thatcher, which is most regrettable.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Thatcher also made a point &mdash; which I think was unfair &mdash; that each and every person in Northern Ireland had equal rights because they live in a democracy and, whether Catholic or Protestant, they have one vote.  In other words she said they were equal.  Of course they have one vote but what about the discriminations I mentioned two weeks ago?  What about the denial of basic human rights for so many of our people there?  What about the terrible discrimination in the <Col N="1287" /> area of electoral rights, housing and jobs? I am not denying that all the people in the North have a vote, but they are clearly denied other very important basic human rights.</P>
    <P>On Monday &mdash; the same day Mrs. Thatcher gave her television interview &mdash; Mr. Molyneaux, the Official Unionist Leader, clearly indicated how happy he was with the solution.  He suggested that constitutional Nationalists &mdash; people like Deputy Garret FitzGerald, Deputy Haughey, Deputy Spring, Deputy Barry, Mr. John Hume, not forgetting the Senators from Northern Ireland &mdash; were all cast in the same mould, that they travelled along the same road as the Brighton bombers.  I thought that a most irresponsible and outrageous statement from any leader.  The pity of it is that Mrs. Thatcher says the initiative must come from within Northern Ireland.  If she is waiting for Mr. Molyneaux to take the initiative, then the problems in Northern Ireland will never end.</P>
    <P>Last June the President of the United States visited Ireland.  In his address to the Dáil and Seanad one sentence caught my eye.  He said:</P>
    <P>Believe me, to hold the office I now hold is to understand, each waking moment of the day, the awesome responsibility of protecting peace and perserving human life.</P>
    <P>I would say that Mrs. Thatcher has the same responsibility, but she is not responding.  The British Government will be clearly failing in their duty if they do not respond positively to the findings of the New Ireland Forum Report.  If they do, all our aspirations and hopes can be summed up briefly in the words we all dearly want for Northern Ireland, peace with justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because the Minister wants to contribute to the debate.  While the Leader of the House and I welcomed the motion from the Independent group, we felt that the wording did not do justice to the full report of the New Ireland Forum and the <Col N="1288" /> accompanying documents which should also be read in conjunction with the report.  I hope that people at home and abroad will take into consideration the implications for all of us in the documentation produced by the Forum and by those who took part in the Forum who went to such great detail to put in writing the cost factors involved &mdash; in monetary terms, the loss of 2,300 lives since 1969 and 24,000 people injured or maimed. These are costs people forget about quickly nowadays because with the continuing violence we have become almost punch-drunk and immune to the outrages that occur in the South, in the North and in Britain on numerous occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special tribute should be paid to all the constitutional politicians who took part in the Forum.  It was a pity that the invitation to the Unionists was not taken up.  I was pleased to see those who would be considered moderate Unionists, the Alliance Party and others, made submissions to the Forum.  That was welcomed. In discussions in Belfast with the liberal Alliance group I was told of their continuing concern about the on-going violence in Northern Ireland.  It seems to be a never-ending struggle for people in the North to survive or even to express their views.  That is why I welcome the initiative of a small group of people in my own town, Tipperary, who initiated the festival of peace which gave a platform to people of varying views on not alone international peace, but on peace in our island.  I was happy to afford the hospitality of my home to Mr. Oliver Napier who spoke at that forum.  He left privileged and honoured to be allowed the facility to do so without fear of intimidation from the people in the South.  The Protestant hierarchy in the Twenty-six Counties have a major responsibility to be more outspoken about the privileges, constitutional and otherwise, they have enjoyed for many years &mdash; ownership of land and property and religious freedom. If that was spoken of more often in other fora, the doubts of people in the North who have reservations about our attitude to other people's religious freedom, would be dispelled quickly.  I noticed <Col N="1289" /> recently one member of the Protestant religious hierarchy had some reservations about the Forum report because he felt it was not self-critical enough.</P>
    <P>I have read with interest the complete report and was satisfied that for the first time the people in the Twenty-six Counties particularly and our colleagues in the SDLP, have put in writing the problems as we see them and the mistakes we have made down through the years &mdash; and we have made mistakes.  We are not as perfect as we would like to be.  We have made overtures time and time again. We have amended our Constitution on a couple of occasions and have been prepared in the Forum report to make other major constitutional amendments if that was required.  From contributions I have heard from the Unionist side in particular, I doubt that any further constitutional amendments would make any difference to their bigoted attitude.</P>
    <P>Sunningdale, which was a major initiative with an inbuilt structure and which was acceptable to everybody was the first serious opportunity taken by any government to do something constructive about the situation in Northern Ireland.  At election times different parties waved different coloured flags to try to make political capital out of the troubles in the North.  That was a tragedy because any utterances of ours that are not made in a constructive way towards a settlement of the problem can only do damage.  The British Labour Party who were in government at the time showed a lack of commitment to the sunningdale agreement and allowed illegal organisations and extreme paramilitary Protestant organisations to overthrow the power-sharing executive which we had worked so hard for.  That too was a tragedy.</P>
    <P>On a recent visit to North America I had the opportunity on various radio-programmes and other media to have discussions directly on the air with people about the troubles in Ireland, and particularly in Northern Ireland.  There is a keen awareness among the American people, and the Irish-Americans in particular, that something needs to be done urgently to overcome the problems in the <Col N="1290" /> Six Counties.  Unfortunately the people have been prepared, misguidedly so, to devote money to various factions in the belief that they were helping.  I availed of every opportunity to condemn Noraid and the other organisations that purport on the surface to be doing good in this country when they are getting money from genuinely concerned people for the purpose of buying arms for the continuation of the destruction of human life.  It did not take courage to say that because I am accustomed to saying that.  The response on the air to my comments evoked a lot of interest, and I was impressed by the deep concern and commitment of genuine Americans and Irish-Americans in particular to the lack of response to the Forum.</P>
    <P>There is a responsibility on the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, to respond to this report in a way that can be seen as an indication of her concern. She expressed concern after the Brighton bombing.  She publicly declared that it would not deter her from continuing to consider all the options open to her.  I hope that whatever disagreement there was between the parties which took part in the Forum, whether there was a preferential option or only one option will be settled.  All this ambiguity can only do damage to the excellent work done by members of the Forum.  Everybody's first option is the unitary state but that is not the only option.  If we consider it as the only option, there will be no settlement of the northern problem.  We must move slowly but positively forward.  Any lesser option than what is documented in the Forum report should be grasped.  If there is only a slim hope of a movement forward, we should respond to it and I have no doubt the Minister for Foreign Affairs will respond to it.  I want to compliment him on the courageous statements he made on this subject during his period in office.  There is no ambiguity about where he stands on the question of violence and his ultimate aim for the reunification of the country.  He is prepared to take any step forward to meet any initiative from the Unionists or the British Government.</P>
    <P>Last week I had the opportunity on <Col N="1291" /> behalf of my party to have a wide-ranging discussion with some colleagues from the British Labour Party.  They left us in no doubt about their responsibility as a major political force in Britain.  Even in Opposition they felt they had a responsibility to communicate to the Conservative Government our views about the response we require from Mrs. Thatcher. I am asking her to respond positively.  I am not putting a time factor on it.  Those who call for a British withdrawal from Northern Ireland call for it in a partial way; they want to put a time on it.  In this kind of situation time is not important. It is the commitment to do it that is important.  I would like to see a British withdrawal at some stage, but I would only like to see it if all the paramilitaries on both sides&mdash;the Provisional IRA, the UVF and all the organisations who carry arms&mdash;were disarmed on the same day and if there was a political structure and a political settlement that would stop people destroying life for no reason &mdash; although they will give a religious reason in the North.  I realise they have their loyalty to the Crown, and nobody wants to take that from them, but in the meantime there is no reason why we as democratically elected constitutional politicians could not have aspirations &mdash; whether Protestant, Unionist or reunification aspirations&mdash;to live, survive and work together with our colleagues in the North and in Britain.</P>
    <P>I want to commend the previous Leader of Fianna Fáil, Mr. Lynch.  In his speech last Sunday in Tipperary he addressed himself to the Forum report. He laid a responsibility on all of us not to be ambiguous about the Forum and not to close our eyes to the options available. That takes courage, particularly in the presence of Mr. Adams to whom the media seemed to give a priority in the coverage of the event and otherwise and almost disregarded Mr. Lynch's contribution. It is amazing that we in the Twenty-six Counties tolerate somebody who advocates violence, who comes here accompanied by a colour party in the presence of many innocent, gullible <Col N="1292" /> young people who feel that this person had some charisma, when all he wants is to break down the institutions in the North, the South and in Britain.  I, as a democratically elected politician, as a socialist and a pacifist, will not tolerate that kind of attitude from anybody, even if he is elected as an MP.  I respect his position as an MP but I would respectfully suggest that he should not have the right to advocate violence or to condone the violence that took place while he was speaking to an assembled group of people in Tipperary to commemorate a patriot who gave his life for a different cause when this island was occupied by the British forces and over-run by the Black and Tans.  That was a totally different time, and Mr. Lynch's statement has clarified the difference between the two fights that are going on.  At least those who fought at that time had the will and had the people of Ireland behind them.  These people have set themselves up with no mandate and with no support from the vast majority of the people of this State and indeed from the people of the entire island of Ireland over which we have claimed jurisdiction in Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise the fact that in the twenties there was a settlement. People agreed or disagreed with that settlement and that is the <i>de facto</i> situation. There has been a political vacuum in the North of Ireland since 1969 when people had to fight for the right of one man, one vote.  If the British Government had conceded that when it was demanded perhaps there would never have been a revolution.  The civil rights movement had all our support because we all believed in what they were doing.  It threw up some of the best politicians in this era and many of them, thankfully, are still with us.  In the meantime their fight for freedom has been taken over by paramilitaries. There still exists in the North discrimination regarding jobs and ambiguity about security risks for people because they are either Catholic or Protestant and there is no redress by way of appeal or otherwise.  There are still <Col N="1293" /> elements in the laws of the North which make it very difficult for those of us who cannot tolerate that kind of ambiguity when it comes to giving freedom of choice to people to work, to have a house, to have religious freedom or to have no belief in religion whatsoever.</P>
    <P>We have a major responsibility.  The Taoiseach will be meeting with the British Prime Minister soon.  I hope that they will find common ground to move forward at any pace so long as it is a move forward.  The situation cannot be allowed to stagnate as it is, because if it does and if the British Prime Minister does not respond this island will be taken over by men of violence because there will be an element of frustration on all sides.  We must play our part in ensuring that there will be a response from the British Government, and there is a major responsibility on them to respond to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to talk about the report without referring to the events in Brighton last week.  So many outrageous murders and acts of savage violence have taken place that we have become almost immune to them, but that is something we must never do, because the last act of violence, or any act of violence no matter when it occurs, is just as reprehensible as the first one in this long line of violence.  When we attempt to deplore these events we find that language has begun to fail us.  The words we used to condemn them seem to have lost their edge.  The bombing in Brighton, however, which was designed to kill so many innocent people, must rank as a new low in depravity and must be condemned without reservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who condemn violence must have been somewhat disappointed to hear from Mrs. Thatcher in her statement a few days later that there could be no sudden initiatives.  We could hardly talk about sudden initiatives at this stage of the events in Northern Ireland.  There has been plenty of time for initiatives and plenty of time to think about them, and anything that is put forward at the present time could hardly be described as sudden. Indeed, the report has put forward very, <Col N="1294" /> very constructive initiatives which are in no sense sudden and are certainly worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>If initiatives are not put forward, then the future for Northern Ireland is very bleak.  The United Kingdom must realise that the position will not remain the same, that they cannot just sit back and say that violence has been more or less contained and they are going to do nothing. The position will not remain at the stage it is at at the present time.  It will either get better if there are initiatives or worse if there are not.  In the absence of initiatives the position will almost certainly deteriorate very seriously over the next year or two.</P>
    <P>As usual in the United Kingdom, the first reaction from many people to last week's events was to call for more security and further co-operation from the Republic.  One despairs of this kind of instant reaction.  One wonders whether certain people in the United Kingdom will ever learn the lesson that security is not the answer.  It has been the stock reaction in the United Kingdom not merely for the past ten or 15 years, not merely for the past 50 or 100 years, but looking back over the centuries their reaction to trouble in Ireland was always to send over another army.  Their answer throughout the centuries was always security.  It must be realised if the root of the problem is not tackled then security measures are useless.</P>
    <P>As far as co-operation from the Republic is concerned, it should be realised that this is only forthcoming on the basis that political initiatives are on the way.  Security co-operation from us is, in a sense, a holding operation.  We are prepared to co-operate provided there is going to be some political initiative.  If it becomes clear in the next year or two that there are going to be no initiatives in the United Kingdom, then the whole question of security and co-operation in that field will have to be seriously re-examined.  In such circumstances we would, of course, have our own problems and we would have to apply ourselves to these problems of security but there would no longer be any justification for shouldering part of the <Col N="1295" /> United Kingdom's problem as well as our own.</P>
    <P>The Forum report is an excellent document, and I would like to take the opportunity of congratulating everybody who was concerned in drawing it up and who took part in the discussions which took place beforehand.  Certainly there was an extraordinary amount of hard work and dedication put into the preliminary discussions, the production of various reports and the production of the final report.  The report identifies the convictions, fears and aspirations of both the Nationalists and the Unionists.  It gives the economic background, the consequences of Partition to date and the projections into the future if there was a United Ireland.  It is the first time this has been done in a thorough way.  It is an excellent document and one which should and must be very seriously considered by the United Kingdom.  There must be some response to it.</P>
    <P>The parties who took part in the production of the report set out three possible solutions but agreed that the unitary state was the one they would particularly wish to see.  Since the publication of the report Fianna Fáil have adopted the unitary state as the only solution, as Hamlet said, &ldquo;A consummation devoutly to be wished&rdquo;.  It is a consummation devoutly to be wished, but whether we can achieve a unitary state, or achieve it in the immediate future, is something which is very doubtful.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the response of most Unionists has been extremely negative. Not only do they not want to have a unitary State or a united Ireland or any new arrangement, they do not wish to even discuss it.  But there have been signs &mdash; a few cases &mdash; of some impact by the report.  Both of the Protestant parties, the DUP and the OUP, have issued documents which, although not very helpful in their content, nevertheless are an acknowledgment that we are possibly in a time of change and a time for re-stating party positions.  Although there is not much change in the outlook there is some small change, which is something to be <Col N="1296" /> thankful for.  The gap is still extremely wide.  Our problem in this country is not to solve the position immediately but to find a way to begin to bridge the gap between the Unionists and ourselves.  We must find a way of inducing the Unionists even to discuss the problems and the possibilities and attractions of a new Ireland.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted in the first place that most Unionists see very little attraction in a united Ireland.  They see their loyalties, their cultural background, elsewhere. At the moment they see no economic advantage in joining with us.  They believe that their welfare and their identity would be threatened in a united Ireland. These are the problems we have in inducing them to talk to us about the idea of a new Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the absence of initiatives from the British and the Irish Governments I think it is unlikely that we would ever make any progress in this respect.  In Chapter 5.8 of the Forum report it is recognised that it is the role of the two Governments to take this initiative and ensure that some discussions take place.  If initiatives are taken and if some kind of convention or meeting takes place, it would be basically a convention between the two sovereign Governments but the Unionists would have to be fully represented to enable them to put forward their points of view.  If and when that time comes there will be some very serious consequences and proposals will be put forward which will be received with some shock by many people in this country.</P>
    <P>It must be evident that if a convention takes place and if Unionists are present they will want to introduce very far-reaching changes in a new Ireland, changes of course &mdash; from their point of view &mdash; which will be very serious, but also if we are to have them in a new Ireland there will have to be very serious changes from our point of view.  There will have to be far-reaching sacrifices for the people in this part of the country in regard to new political, social and economic structures.  I wonder if people in the South realise, particularly those who ask rather glibly for a united Ireland and will settle for nothing else, the sacrifices that <Col N="1297" /> would have to be made?  I wonder if they realise them, whether they are willing to make these sacrifices?</P>
    <P>Politically, the Unionists in a new Ireland would not only have full representation in the Dáil and in the Seanad but they would probably have extra representation. They would possibly have more than they were entitled to so as to ensure that their point of view was fully considered and that they were not steamrolled or overcome by this part of the country.  There would possibly be some kind of powers of veto to deal with that sort of situation.</P>
    <P>In any event the Unionists in a new situation here would be a major power in the Oireachtas.  They would have a voting strength of 20 per cent or more, which would have a decisive effect on legislation affecting all of us and affecting all aspects of our way of life.  Some people consider, possibly rather superficially, that the Unionists would only be concerned with Northern Ireland and so on.  Of course they would have a vote, they would have a say in everything affecting all aspects of our way of life.  Economically, the cost of a united Ireland &mdash; which would mean that to a greater or lesser extent we would be taking over the United Kingdom subsidy &mdash; would be extremely onerous.  It is doubtful, in present economic circumstances, whether it would be possible at all.</P>
    <P>Socially, we would have to accept legislation in connection with such matters as divorce, contraception, family law and so on, which has not been accepted by us up to now.  We would have to accept this on the basis that even though we do not agree with some of these things it is essential to accommodate and incorporate the Unionists and their points of view in a new Ireland.  We would have to accept that and accept things many people would find hard to accept.  We would have to strive for a consensus, which means accommodating ourselves to the views of all the people in a new Ireland.</P>
    <P>In this regard there has been a call from people for what is known as separation of church and State.  In a newspaper today a Protestant bishop has said that the <Col N="1298" /> people in the North of Ireland would never accept a united Ireland because they would fear the dominance of the Catholic Church.  Of course there is no formal link in the Constitution between church and State.  It is somewhat ironic that usually the call for having no link between church and State comes from people with a British background.  They seem to ignore the fact that although we have no formal link between church and State, in the UK the Head of State is a Protestant pledged to defend the Protestant ascendancy, that they have bishops sitting in the House of Lords with a vote in all legislation, and that most of the clergymen of the Church of England are appointed by the Government.  The people who call on us not to have links between church and State have it themselves, but that is one of these inconsistencies which we get used to hearing from people on the other side of the Irish Sea. However, I think that is beside the point.</P>
    <P>An effort should be made to evaluate and to put into perspective the influence of religion on affairs of State in Ireland. Until we try to put that into perspective it would be difficult to envisage the kind of society we would have in a new Ireland. It would be difficult to give the Unionists, the Protestants, an honest assessment of their likely position in a new Ireland.  In my view the influence of the Catholic hierarchy in this country is vastly exaggerated.  When discussing, for instance, the referendum last year it is nonsense to assert that people voted one way or the other merely because the bishops brandished a few croziers or because parish priests laid down the law in sermons. In my view the influence of the clergy in present-day political affairs is minimal.  When they attempt to influence these matters it is very often counterproductive.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that people decide on these matters not because of any present-day influence but because of the atmosphere in which they were reared, because of their education, because of their beliefs and principles and outlook on life and not because of any attempted influence on them at the <Col N="1299" /> present time.  Certainly the way they were reared, certainly if they were reared as Catholics, has an influence, but not attempts by the hierarchy to influence them at the present time.  To put that in a kind of perspective, I think in the referendum last year if all the Catholic hierarchy had been exiled for six months before the actual referendum it would not have made any real difference in the way the people voted.  They voted because of their own way of life, their outlook, their beliefs, and not because anybody attempted to tell them what to do.</P>
    <P>What I am saying to our friends in the North of Ireland is that there is no need for Unionists to fear a church-State link or to fear influence from the hierarchy, but they would be correct in expecting that the religious background of the majority of people in the Twenty-six Counties would have a significant influence on the way in which that majority would like to see the State run.  Hopefully, the influence would be modified in the new circumstances, hopefully, the majority would accept the need for consensus and that a new approach would be made in which a distinction was made between personal beliefs and laws passed for the benefit of all the people in a new Ireland.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have concentrated too much on the problems which would face us in a new Ireland, on the difficulties in such a situation, the difficulties of living together in peace and understanding but I do not think that we can begin to build a new Ireland until we understand and acknowledge the problems.  I am optimistic not pessimistic.  I believe that if these two sovereign Governments start the process of negotiation and discussion and if this is done in the absence of the veto which exists at the present time then progress will certainly be made.  It will be a long time before we achieve the particular solution we would wish to see as set out in the Forum report.  There will be much heart-searching and many sacrifices to be made if we want a new Ireland.  If we want a new Ireland we <Col N="1300" /> must become, first of all, a more united people in the sense that we must try to understand one another more, we must try to make concessions to one another. If we can achieve that, then a new Ireland is possible and the sacrifices that will have to be made will be well worth while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a very interesting contribution from Senator Ryan.  I listened very attentively to it, as I did to the equally worth-while contributions from Senators Ferris and Fallon.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make this contribution in response to the remarks of Senators in this debate, particularly today when the Seanad has so trenchantly condemned the outrageous bombing which took place in Brighton last weekend. I welcome the opportunity especially because it permits me to join with the Seanad in condemning categorically, and with all the force at my command, the appalling carnage and destruction which has been wreaked by the IRA at the Conservative Party Conference in Brighton. I condemn this atrocity because of the loss of life, because of the terrible injuries suffered by members of the British Government and others staying at the Grand Hotel in Brighton, because of the sufferings of those bereaved and particularly because this assault was an assault at the head of democracy in Britain and at the heart of democracy throughout these islands.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has expressed our solidarity with out neighbours.  We, no less than the British Government, are determined that the IRA shall not succeed in its efforts to polarise Nationalist opinion in this country, to divide democratic Irish men and women from democratic Britons, and so to undermine and eventually destroy democratic political life in both our countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it needs to be emphasised that democratic political values are real values.  They are at the source of the way we actually live, our control of our own affairs, our ability to contribute to and to influence decision-making in our society, and to lead our lives as we wish to lead <Col N="1301" /> them, not as the IRA would force us to lead them if ever they achieved power. The IRA want to terrorise us by slaughter and destruction to abandon our will to govern ourselves and to surrender our rights as free men and women to live in peace and prosperity and to practice all the rights which we have gained for ourselves since the establishment of the State: the right to elect our Governments democratically and the right to change them democratically, the right to peaceful assembly, the right of freedom of speech, the right of worship and religious tolerance and all the other rights which are central to the way we live our lives.</P>
    <P>I have often spoken during the past months of another major commitment of the Government, and that is to end the intolerable situation of the minority in Northern Ireland, the only group left absolutely out in the cold by the arrangements made 60 years ago for the government of this island.  This is, in fact, more than a commitment in my view, it is a moral obligation on us all.  What every Nationalist in this State should realise, and what I believe the overwhelming majority of Nationalists in the North know from their experience and in their hearts, is that the objective of the IRA in trying to murder the British Cabinet was to make it impossible for this Government to deliver on this moral obligation.  In other words, so fanatical are they in their determination to dominate our people that they are prepared to say to the minority in the North, to those very people whom they spuriously claim to defend: &ldquo;You must languish in your misery to suit us; you must languish until we are ready to take power in Ireland&rdquo;. Should the people of this State ever accept such terms, we would betray not alone this great obligation but the very heritage of the nationalist tradition. We shall never do that.  We shall never lose the will, and never surrender the right, to uphold these things.  Let the IRA know of that determination and let them know that all democratic political parties will never permit them to succeed.</P>
    <P>I believe that the calm and resolute reaction of the British Prime Minister and <Col N="1302" /> the British Government to the Brighton outrage, and the calm and resolute reaction of the British people, already shows that this attempt by the IRA to divide still further our two peoples has failed. We know all too well that after past outrages the millions of people of Irish birth and Irish blood living in Britain have been harassed and abused, convicted by prejudice of association with the evildoers of the IRA.  We know all to well that after past outrages the British media have blindly lashed out at our Government for imagined failures in security cooperation. On this occasion, and here I disagree with Senator Eoin Ryan, such reactions have been greatly diminished. One British Sunday newspaper quoted the entire editorial of one of our national newspapers with approval.  Newspapers have urged the British and Irish Governments to tackle the problem of Northern Ireland together, with all the greater determination because of this atrocity.</P>
    <P>I believe that this calm and understanding response owes a great deal to the efforts of successive Governments here to explain the facts to the British Government and people, to demonstrate the resources which every man, woman and child in Ireland has been obliged to contribute to the fight against the IRA which is more than three times the burden of their counterparts in Britain.  I believe, in particular, that the efforts of the constitutional nationalist parties, North and South, in the proceedings of the Forum have caught the imagination of the British Government and people and helped to bring these two islands closer than they have been for a very long time.</P>
    <P>The realities and the requirements of the situation contributed to the Forum by all strands of opinion in Ireland, debated in the Forum with great earnestness and debated throughout Ireland, in the British Parliament, in the British press, on British radio and television, and by the wider international public, notably in the European Parliament and in the United States, has led to a new order of analysis of the Northern Ireland problem, and a new order of determination to tackle the <Col N="1303" /> Northern Ireland conflict at its roots.</P>
    <P>I know from this debate that these views are shared by the Seanad also.  Here I wish to pay a special tribute to the Senators with personal experience of the Northern Ireland problem.  I believe the debate in this House has shown the earnestness and sense of conviction, the unswerving determination and unsparing analysis which the Forum proceedings have also shown.</P>
    <P>May I say that in this effort to solve the Northern Ireland problem, which is the desire of every Irish man and woman, we must show other values also.  We must show the determination not only to succeed, but the patience to recognise that all our aims may not be accomplished overnight.  We must not be deflected from our commitment by the ups and downs of everyday political life.  In the Forum report we have called on the British Government and people to show determination, urgency and imagination.  We, who in this moment of horror have called on the British to remain steady, must also be determined and able ourselves to show all of these qualities.  We must, in other words, show ourselves worthy of the New Ireland to which we aspire.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to quote from a leading article from the <i>Financial Times</i> earlier in the week which says:</P>
    <P>The Irish question is a piece of unfinished business which should be placed at the top of the Government's agenda...Never were the circumstances more ripe for a concerted search for a settlement.  The Irish Government is ready and able.  The British Government has been warned of the perils of sticking to the status quo, and the bulk of opinion in both islands must now be behind them.  Failure to act would be unforgiveable.</P>
    <P>Let me add my plea to that leading article.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I welcome the report of the New Ireland Forum.  I would like to congratulate those politicians who earnestly devoted their <Col N="1304" /> time and energy to the formulation of this major report.  The first thing to be said about the report of the New Ireland Forum is that it is rather generalised. This was inevitable, seeing that it tried to summarise a detailed examination of the major aspects of the present Northern problem &mdash; its economic, social, legal and political implications, not just as they stand today but as those problems and difficulties were allowed to develop and fester for the past 60 years.</P>
      <P>The strength of the report is that for the first time the Nationalist people of the whole island have sat down together and examined the situation.  The end product has been a concise yet balanced summary of Nationalist thinking on the need to settle the national question once and for all.  The report does not seek to prescribe any single solution.  Rather it leaves the door open for all the people concerned to come up with an agreeable solution, whether this be a single unitary State, a federation or a confederation.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately the attitude of some people in Fianna Fáil has tended to undermine the consensus of the report by over-emphasising the Forum's stated preference for a unitary State encompassing the whole of the 32 counties.  We would all like to see, as the report clearly states, a unitary State achieved by agreement and consent embracing the whole of Ireland.  This does not mean that any of the other solutions outlined in the report would not be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report refers specifically to other models for unity such as the federation of Australia or the United States of America or the confederation of Switzerland. Unfortunately, whether wittingly or unwittingly, the Leader of Fianna Fáil has given the impression that solutions on such lines were not acceptable to the Fianna Fáil members of the Forum.  This, of course, is ridiculous.  Indeed this should be apparent from the space the report gave to suggesting federal and confederal systems as models for a final solution of the partition question.  The door was clearly left open for a solution on unitary, federal and confederal lines.  The Swiss model of confederation would <Col N="1305" /> undoubtedly differ considerably from the unitary State which Irish nationalists would prefer, but this does not mean it is not acceptable.  In fact, the founder of Fianna Fáil, the late President Eamon de Valera, actually put forward the Swiss system as a model for Irish settlement in 1921.  Eamon de Valera said in February 1921 as quoted in <i>The Manchester Guardian:</i></P>
    <P>There is plenty of room in Ireland for partition, real partition and plenty of it.</P>
    <P>Later, as reported in <i>The Gaelic American</i>, he said:</P>
    <P>The whole island could be parcelled up into administrative units associated in a confederation like Switzerland.</P>
    <P>Continuing, Eamon de Valera said:</P>
    <P>If Belfast, or for that matter, all Carsonia,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>as he called Northern Ireland</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;were a Swiss canton like Berne, Geneva or Zurich it would have more control over its own affairs, economic, social and political, than it is given by the Westminster Partition Act.  The real objection to that Act, prescinding from the question of its moral and political validity, is that it does not give Belfast and Ulster enough local liberty and power.</P>
    <P>In an Irish Confederation we ought to get far more.</P>
    <P>One must ask if the leader of Fianna Fáil and his party are now rejecting a solution on the lines of the Swiss Confederation that Eamon de Valera suggested as a model for an Irish settlement?  Are they now saying that a unitary State is the only option open to the Unionists?  If they are then we must recognise that they have scuttled the consensus of the Forum report which they signed.  I believe we must consider every conceivable solution, as previous Senators have said, to this difficult problem, and must not get locked in the view that there is only one solution.</P>
    <P>With its initial unanimity the Forum <Col N="1306" /> report was an instrument that could be used to enlist international support to compel Britain to rectify the blatantly unjust system imposed on the Irish people in 1921.  For 60 years now Britain managed to dodge her responsibility while the Irish nationalist parties were preoccupied with their own squabbles over who loved this island most. Throughout the period nationalist people in Northern Ireland were compelled to live under a thoroughly unjust system.</P>
    <P>Northern Unionists claim that nationalist Ireland should recognise their democratic right to choose their own form of Government yet they conveniently deny the same rights to the minority in their midst.  For example, there is no democratic justification whatever for keeping large areas of Counties Fermanagh and Tyrone, South Down, South Armagh or Derry City within Northern Ireland.  Nevertheless, Britain closed her eyes to this injustice for over 60 years. Having favoured the Unionists for so long Britain should now make it clear that she is going to redress the balance if the Unionists do not sit down with us and make a determined effort to iron out our difficulties.  This would only be justice. More importantly, it would wake up the Unionists to their own need to find a solution to this tragic problem.</P>
    <P>Our Government must now enlist the help of international opinion to put pressure on Britain to face up to the Northern problem honestly for the first time.  To do this the Government will need the united support of all democratic nationalists. On this side of the House, there is a determination that this tragic issue should not be exploited as some kind of political football.  We can only hope that the honourable people in Fianna Fáil will demonstrate similar determination and not permit their leader to exploit the difficulties for his own personal ends.  The situation is far too tragic for this.  Britain must be made realise that she has a duty to bring pressure to bear on the recalcitrant majority in the Six Counties, to sit down and try honestly to find an honourable solution.</P>
    <P>The Forum report provides a real basis <Col N="1307" /> for discussion.  With the united support of the democratic nationalist opinion, the Forum report can be used to get Britain to face realities.  If, however, any of the parties here are allowed to limit the opinions and insist on a specific solution, the basis for discussion will be undermined and the chance of securing a settlement again wrecked.  Let us, therefore, support the Forum report in its entirety in an un-partisan spirit which is needed if we are to have any hope of bridging the wide gulf between Nationalists and Unionists on this island of ours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this Forum report, I should like to view things on the scene as I have experienced it.  One of the sad things I find in school is to deal with the civil war.  We can talk about many good things in our history.  We can tell of the people who have died for this country in a very legitimate way, who showed great courage and great ingenuity against the odds, but when it comes to the civil war it is very difficult to teach it in a heroic way, because there is no way you can make it heroic.  It is the one occasion when I feel like skipping the subject of history.  You have only to think of the many good people who fought so gallantly to get our freedom and then took opposite sides because they did not agree.  It would be very easy for us, know that we have 60 years experience behind us, to look back and to give a clinical assessment as to who was right and who was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be easy to attempt it at least but it is unfair to those who were there in those times.  They reacted as they saw the situation, and if they had the advantage of 60 years' further information they probably would have a different line.  We have to be kind to those who we may feel made the wrong judgment.  We must be charitable, at least, on the basis that they did what was right.  In dealing with those who have gone before us, I have for a long time felt, it is time that we let them say what they said while they were alive. Personally, when I am dead and gone, and of no great importance, I would hate <Col N="1308" /> to have people quoting me for what I would say if I happened to be present at the time.  With regard to Padraig Pearse's view on the language or Wolfe Tone's idea of republicanhood they said what they wanted to say when they were alive. This has been said lately by a man much more important than I am.  I share his views completely and have felt this way for a long time.  We should speak for ourselves in the present day as the situation arises.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have had slogans of &ldquo;No surrender&rdquo; and &ldquo;Not an inch&rdquo; and on our side now we have &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo;. We have reached the stage now where we can see the reality of the situation as it is.  There cannot be a monopoly by any side.  The Forum report has gone out of its way to show that we are able to cater for the views of people who hold completely different views to us.  If we have come up with options it means we are prepared to compromise.  I cannot see any other way except compromise. We certainly cannot get exactly what we want; and I do not believe the Unionists can get exactly what they want either.  I appeal at this stage for leniency towards those who have views that are different to ours.  I also appeal for this acceptance of the other person's views and to accept a position that may not be exactly what everybody wants.  I sincerely hope that the British Government will come in and make an offer that will get our people off the hook in what is a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>During the summer I visited Northern Ireland.  I did not see either soldiers or policemen, except in a very limited way. This is not the picture in reality for those people who have been cut off by the agreements which were made 60 years ago: they are living in a different situation altogether.  They have been under severe hardship and have suffered a lot of deprivations. It is easy for me to speak, as a tourist travelling through, looking at what is happening there and feeling that everything is fine.  It is the people who are living in Northern Ireland who are aware of what is going on.  I should like to compliment the SDLP people who have <Col N="1309" /> taken such a brave stand in the face of some terrible provocation in an effort to uphold democracy.</P>
    <P>This Forum report has taken a lot of time.  The people who took part in it, the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, the Minister for Energy and the SDLP, deserve a lot of credit for giving their time when maybe people could say that there were other more important things to discuss for example, the economy.  The one cry that people have is to forget about the North.  It is to their credit that they gave so much time to produce a report that gives hope and a certain sense of light at the end of the tunnel, depending, of course, on the response.  We have put our side of the house in order.  We have made a reasonable effort at showing that we are reasonable.  I sincerely hope that there will be a response that will bring relief to those of our people in the North who very much want to be with us and that those who may at the moment not want to be with us, will not fear the suggestions that will be made and the solutions that will be offered.  My wish is that we will achieve something as a result of the long deliberations that have gone on to produce this Forum report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the very sincere feelings of many people in this House about the motivation for setting up the Forum report.  I believe there is absolutely no room for doubt that those who went into this assembly, those who sat around the Forum table, were genuine in wanting to find a way forward for the Irish problem. I believe that sincerity was absolutely genuine.  That does not necessarily mean that the Forum report was an unqualified success.  I do not think, to be fair to them, that they were looking for some results or for quick answers to the solution.  We have to decide, when we analyse what came out of the Forum report, if it was a good start in tackling this very complicated problem or has it turned out to be a lost opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that the speech of the Minister for Foreign Affairs just now was a very encouraging response to the first debate which the Oireachtas has had on <Col N="1310" /> the Forum.  It was &mdash; and I take no pleasure in saying this &mdash; full of a certain amount of platitudes.  It said virtually nothing.  At the beginning it goes through the fairly well worn procedure of condemning the IRA and later it goes on to talk about the rights of the minority in Northern Ireland.  It is not until we come half way through his speech that the Forum gets a mention.</P>
    <P>I do not think that that is a worthy response to this Debate which has been going on here for several weeks.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I believe, in particular, that the efforts of the constitutional nationalist parties, North and South, in the proceedings of the Forum have caught the imagination of the British Government and people and helped to bring these two islands closer than they have been for a very long time.</P>
    <P>I do not know what he means by that, and I think it is very short on specifics.  I am sorry &mdash; maybe there are other reasons &mdash; that we have had no indication from the Government in this debate where the Forum is leading us.  This says absolutely nothing.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The realities and the requirements of the situation contributed to the Forum by all strands of opinion in Ireland, debated in the Forum with great earnestness and debated throughout Ireland, ...</P>
    <P>That means nothing at all.  The Minister goes on in the ritual way to praise the contributions of the Members of this House.  This House deserves a better response from the Government than that if we are to take the Forum seriously, as we are told to do.</P>
    <P>We deserve something better than these four sheets of paper which gives us no indication of where the Forum has gone in the last four or five months.  The truth may be &mdash; it may be an unpalatable truth &mdash; that Mrs. Thatcher's response to the tragedy at Brighton was to scoff at the Forum.  That may be the truth and that may be difficult for us to face.  Mrs. Thatcher said quite blatantly on Monday or Tuesday that there <Col N="1311" /> would be no immediate initiatives in Northern Ireland.  That may not be what we like to hear.  That may be why the Minister for Foreign Affairs has to produce what is merely a holding operation at this time.  It may be that the Forum will meet a very deaf response.  If that is true let us face up to it and let us go somewhere else.</P>
    <P>It was a pity to hear from Senator Deenihan a division in the ranks when he attacked certain members of Fianna Fáil and their attitude to the Forum, because if the Forum report is to be genuine it has to be unanimous.  It is not helpful for anybody who is a member of the Forum to attack the attitudes of other members of the Forum.  The Forum is meant to be unanimous.  If the cracks are appearing publicly then how are the British Government going to take the Forum seriously? If Senator Deenihan, the Tánaiste and Deputy Haughey are going to argue in public about what the Forum report said how is anybody to whom the Forum report is presented going to know whose Forum report it is?</P>
    <P>There is a problem that we will have maybe the Leader of one Government representing the policies of an Opposition in which he does not believe but if that is true and he finds it impossible to do then he should reject it as a bogus report. Having said that, I still believe that there is a sincere motivation behind what happened. I still believe some good could come out of the Forum report and that it may not be necessarily a totally wasted exercise.  What must be faced about the Forum report is that it was a pan-nationalist group of people, all with a fairly similar, if not identical, outlook on what was the answer to the nationalist question.</P>
    <P>It must be faced that there was very little questioning of the underlying beliefs of these people, that there were no Unionists at this table, despite the fact that they were invited, and that there was no question of the final solution which was some form of a united Ireland.  If the Forum report is to be useful at all it should have questioned this very fundamental assumption which lay behind its whole purpose, that they <Col N="1312" /> should have first said: Do we want a united Ireland at all?  You can see from the conclusions of the Forum report that that was never questioned and that the conclusions it came out with were three different sorts of a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>The questions they asked themselves were which sort of united Ireland they wanted.  I do not understand why they did not, if the other solutions which are offered to us are so impossible to take &mdash; why they did not, as Senator Deenihan said, look at the possibilities, for instance, of another solution not necessarily a solution but an alternative, he said.  Why should south Armagh, Fermanagh, Tyrone and other various parts of Northern Ireland not be part of the Republic of Ireland?  Why should the Border not be redrawn?  Why did the Forum not look at the possibility of repartition?  I am not in any way advocating repartition but I think if the Forum report was to look at the alternatives it should have looked at repartition and said repartition is a bad idea for the following reasons.</P>
    <P>Why did the Forum report not look at the possibility of total integration of Northern Ireland with Great Britain?  That may be politically impossible for a politician here to advocate, but it should be practically possible for any politician here to take up the problem of total integration of Northern Ireland and Great Britain and say why it will not work.  That was not looked at.  Why did the Forum report not look at the possibility of direct rule?  Why did the Forum report not look at the possibility of the total independence of Northern Ireland?</P>
    <P>All of these things have been put forward as possible solutions in a different context before.  Those who sat around that Forum table ignored the possibilities completely. Those who sat around that Forum table worked on the one assumption, that the ultimate and only solution was some sort of territorial unity of this island.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 30 October 1984.</P>
