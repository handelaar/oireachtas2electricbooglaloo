      <P>I have notice from Senator Seán O'Leary that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The position with regard to the proposed take-over of the Irish Civil Service Building Society by the Bank of Ireland Group.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>
      <P>I also have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The delay in providing adequate sites and facilities for travelling people in the Greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>I rule this matter is not admissible for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground that there is no ministerial responsibility involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 6.  In regard to Nos. 1 and 2, these are orders for the Second Stages of Bills which are being introduced first in Seanad Éireann.  By agreement it is proposed that No. 1 be taken today. Item No. 2 will be ordered today but not actually debated on Second Stage.  I would like to inform the House that the Social Welfare Bill, which was circulated a few days ago and is being debated on Second Stage at the moment in another place, must be law by the end of March.  Accordingly, it will be necessary for the Seanad to take that Bill on short notice from the Dáil.  It may well be that we will only receive it on 27 March which means that, having received it on that date, we will have to deal with all Stages before the end of March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On No. 1, I presume that we are not taking all Stages today &mdash; that we will take only the Second Stage.  I would like to ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to get together so that this House will not be used in the manner in which it has been used.  We had a period in this House when on the Order of Business the press took note of what was being said by the person arguing <Col N="404" /> on the Order of Business and at the end of the day, the press had notes of what was said and what was meant by the person but this House did not get an opportunity to reply.  A certain Senator was asked to leave the House today.  I agree with it, because I feel that the Order of Business is not the proper occasion on which to raise matters which cannot by the rules of the House be raised here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the House said it may be 27 March before we get the Social Welfare Bill, and indeed it might even be later.  The Dáil may not have passed the Bill before the Wednesday or Thursday of that week.  It is rather unfair that this is to happen.  It is not the first time for the Social Welfare Bill to be delayed.  It is happening every year.  It happened also while Fianna Fáil were in power.  I cannot understand why we had to rush this very important Bill through in a day.  I see no reason why the Dáil could not have their business well prepared in advance and have the Bill passed next week so that we could have it then. I would like to register a protest as far as that Bill is concerned.</P>

      <P>I echo the sentiments of Senator W. Ryan.  I know that it is not the fault of the Leader of the House that it is happening in this way.  Although it may not be appropriate to do so, we should register our dissatisfaction with the other House.  I should like to register my dissatisfaction with the manner in which they expect us to deal with legislation in the limited time available.</P>

      <P>In order to protect the individuals of this House and the elected Members of this House I suggest that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges might have a look at this situation so that the glamour attached to such an escapade may not attract the attention which it does, and instead that the reality of the workings of this House could be recognised. Many of us spend a long time in the House.  I want to bring it to the Chair's attention so that the matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At the risk of joining my colleague, Senator Ryan, outside, might I add to the sentiments expressed by Senator Willie Ryan and Senator Ferris about the Bill coming before the House at such short notice?  Without trying to get out of order I would point out that it is almost always to important Bills that this happens.  There are Bills on which we would not have much to say and we have plenty of time to discuss them.  I would like to see this House having time to deal properly with important Bills.  It is not impossible that we might actually amend them and improve them if we were given time to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Two points have been raised which it is proper for me to answer. The first is in regard to the extent of the progress which is hoped for in regard to the Dentists Bill.  My proposition to the House would be that we should debate that Bill from now until 4 p.m.  At 4 p.m. we should take up item No. 3, that is, the EEC motion, until 5.30 p.m., break from 5.30 p.m. until 6.30 p.m., and that would enable us to devote one hour and a half to the Private Members' Motion put forward by the Fianna Fáil group, from 6.30 p.m. until 8 p.m.  I would ask the House to agree that as part of the Order of Business we should adopt those timings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Social Welfare Bill, the position is that the Bill was introduced only a few days ago.  I understand that the new family assistance scheme gave rise to some difficulties in drafting the Bill.  This is possibly a partial explanation for the delay.  But I join with Senators in deploring the fact that the late introduction of the Bill year after year has meant that the Seanad felt it had not adequate time to discuss the Bill.  I would suggest that the representatives of every group in this House should talk to their counterparts in Dáil Éireann asking them to ensure that the Bill will reach us earlier. There is nothing I or the Cathaoirleach can do.  It rests in the hands of the Whips in another place as to when the Bill will reach us.  I understand that one of their difficulties &mdash; they have taken Second Stage at very short notice &mdash; is that they have a short sitting week next week <Col N="407" /> because of the public holiday on Monday. This is creating difficulties for them, but if the Whips in the Seanad would approach the Whips in the Dáil and convey the feelings of the Seanad to them, it would be helpful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to query the time for the Fianna Fáil motion.  It was said it will be taken from 6.30 p.m. onwards this evening.  I presume that we will have further time at a future date to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Social Welfare Bill has to be put through by 30 March inhibits proper discussion on it.  If it were to come here with flaws there is no way that we should allow it to be sent to the President if we see the flaws, irrespective of whether the Government want or need to do that.  The only reason I can see for the Bill being law by 30 March is that the following week is the start of a new tax year.  If there were flaws in that Bill I do not see why we should be constrained in our discussion of it by having a guillotine placed on it.  From this House we should say to the Government &mdash; I do not think we should go through our Whips &mdash;&ldquo;We do not accept the 30 March if we see flaws in that Bill&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dentists Act, 1928, is the legislation that governs the registration and control of persons practising dentistry and the maintenance of standards of dental education and training in this country.  There has been only one minor amendment to the legislation since its enactment.  That was in November last when it was found necessary to extend the term of office of the Dental Board, established under the 1928 Act, so as to keep it in office until this new legislation was passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1928 Act has, therefore, remained virtually unaltered over the years.  Legislation, no matter how well thought out and drafted, cannot be expected to provide for every eventuality, especially in times of rapid change, and so with the <Col N="409" /> passage of time and in particular in the past few years, it became evident that alterations were required to the provisions of the 1928 Act.  Some of these alterations could be termed necessary while others were of a desirable rather than of an essential nature.</P>
    <P>A series of amendments to the 1928 Act perhaps could have effected the necessary changes but it was thought preferable to bring in an entirely new Dentists Act and to incorporate in it the best of modern thinking in relation to the practice of dentistry.</P>
    <P>This Bill, therefore, is designed to bring the laws governing dentistry up to date and, in so far as possible, to provide for future developments in the profession. It is being put forward as a comprehensive measure, repealing the existing legislation, but at the same time re-enacting where necessary the provisions of the old Act.  In many ways the proposed legislation is parallel to the legislation governing the medical profession contained in the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978 but it contains also certain provisions which are peculiar to dentistry.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the dissolution of the Dental Board set up under the 1928 Act and its replacement by a new body to be known as the Dental Council.  Over the years the Dental Board has served the general public and the dental profession well.  The esteem in which Irish dentistry is held today throughout the world is due in no small measure to the dedication and efficiency of the many individuals who have served as members of the Dental Board over the years.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere thanks to all of them. Special thanks are due to the current membership of the Dental Board who were willing when called upon to serve for an extended period beyond the normal term of office of board members in order to facilitate the smooth transition from Dental Board to Dental Council arising from the provisions of the new legislation.</P>
    <P>In drafting any legislation it is necessary to consult with all those who will be affected in one way or another by its <Col N="410" /> provisions and with those who might have an input into the legislation.  I can assure the House that this has been done in the case of the Dentists Bill and that every shade of opinion has been sought and listened to.  We are indeed fortunate in this country in that in almost every sphere individuals exist who are dedicated to the promotion of excellence.</P>
    <P>The dental profession is no exception and in the course of consultations on this new Bill discussions were held with those who are committed to promoting the profession and the practice of dentistry and who are anxious to maintain and improve standards of education and training, and indeed the code of behaviour which governs the members of the profession.  In formulating the proposals contained in this Bill, due regard was had to all opinions put forward by those consulted.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the new Dentists Bill is to update and improve the legislation governing dentistry in this country.  One of the fundamentals of the regulation of any profession is the recognition and registration of those who by virtue of their education and training are regarded as competent to practise it.  The benefit which the general public derives from statutory registration is that it enables them to recognise the qualified practitioner, thus protecting them from those who are unqualified.</P>
    <P>The registered practitioner on the other hand, through statutory registration, enjoys the benefit of public recognition of his status and the consequent practical advantages which this bestows. Statutory registration is, therefore, to the mutual benefit and advantage of the general public and the practitioner.</P>
    <P>There are eight main parts in the Bill and I propose to deal with the principal provisions of each part in sequence.</P>
    <P>Part 1 of the Bill provides for interpretation, by defining certain words and phrases which occur throughout the Bill. It also provides for the fixing of commencement days for the bringing into operation of certain provisions of the Bill.  It provides, too, for the repeal of the existing legislation governing the dental profession; that is to say, the Dentists <Col N="411" /> Act, 1928 and the Dentists (Amendment) Act, 1983 &mdash; the latter being the Act through which the term of office of the present Dental Board was extended to facilitate the introduction of this new legislation.</P>
    <P>The first major change in the existing provisions is contained in Part II.  This provides for the dissolution of the Dental Board and its replacement by the new Dental Council.  This is not merely a changing of the name of the statutory body for the regulation and registration of the dental profession.</P>
    <P>First of all, the new council will have 19 members whereas the Dental Board has only nine.  However, it is the make-up of the membership of the new council and its powers, rather than the number of its members that is significant.  The role of the Dental Council in the education and training of dentists is reflected in the representation given to educational interests.  The council will have four members appointed by the undergraduate educational institutions and one member by postgraduate interests and it will also have a nominee of the Minister for Education.  The number of representatives of the practising profession, elected by their colleagues, will be increased from five to seven and while this will not give them a majority on the council as they have on the present board, it will nevertheless ensure that the practising profession will form the biggest single group on the council.  Two members of the new council will be nominated by the Medical Council which has three representatives on the Dental Board at present.  The reduced Medical Council representation reflects the increased independence and responsibility of the Dental Council in the matter of the education and training of dentists.  The remaining four places on the council will be filled by my nominees and at least two of these must be non-dentists who will represent the general public as consumers of dental services.  This is in line with the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978 which gives similar representation on the Medical Council to consumers of medical services.</P>

      <Col N="412" /> The Dental Council will have the authority to set up various committees to carry out specific functions of the council, and the Bill provides in particular that three such committees shall be set up to act for the council in matters relating to its education and training functions, its functions in relation to the fitness of members of the profession to practise dentistry and its functions in relation to auxiliary dental workers.</P>
    <P>The remainder of Part II of the Bill deals with the mechanics for the setting up and the staffing of the Dental Council, the make-up of membership of the three specific committees of the council and the various powers of the council, including the charging of registration fees.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the registration of dentists.  In addition to the establishment and maintenance of the basic register of dental practitioners there is provision for the future establishment of a register of dental specialists, should the council consider it desirable.  The provisions relating to the establishment of the basic register follow the pattern of the existing legislation except that specific provision is made for the registration of nationals of member states of the European Economic Community who possess the necessary qualifications. Under directives of the EEC which came into effect here in January 1980 we here in Ireland are obliged to recognise certain qualifications in dentistry issued by other member states of the EEC and <i>vice versa.</i> There is also an obligation under these directives to permit the holders of the recognised qualifications to practise dentistry anywhere in the EEC.  One of the directives relates to the setting and maintaining of minimum standards of education and training in dentistry within the EEC.</P>
    <P>An agreement concluded in 1927 between this country and the United Kingdom and incorporated in the 1928 Dentists Act provides for the mutual recognition of dental qualifications awarded in these islands and could be said to have foreshadowed the provisions of the relatively recent EEC directives.</P>
    <P>Registers of dental specialists, such as orthodontists and oral surgeons, exist in <Col N="413" /> France and Germany and such registration is about to be introduced in the Netherlands. It exists also in many countries outside the EEC, for instance in the USA and in Canada.  The registration of specialists is of benefit to the public in enabling them to identify those who are qualified and who specialise in particular aspects of dentistry.  It also enables the public to clarify whether a practitioner possesses the qualifications he purports to possess.  Although the provisions in the Bill do not compel the Dental Council to set up a register of dental specialists now, they give the council the facility for registering specialists at some future date if it should consider it desirable to do so.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with the education and training of dentists.  It spells out the duties of the council in relation to undergraduate and postgraduate education.  The council will have to satisfy itself as to the suitability of the education provided by the two dental schools in the State, that is to say Trinity College, Dublin and University College, Cork, and as to the standards of education and clinical experience required for basic qualifications in dentistry.</P>
    <P>The council will also be required to satisfy itself as to the standards of postgraduate education and training in the State.  Part IV also outlines the duties of the council in relation to compliance with EEC directives regarding minimum requirements for qualifications in dentistry in member states.  It also outlines the Council's responsibilities in relation to qualifications in specialised dentistry. Our standards in dental education and training are highly regarded abroad and I feel sure that the objectives of the Dental Council will be to establish and maintain standards that are higher than those stipulated by the EEC as minimum requirements.  The educational role of the council is far more responsible than that exercised by the Dental Board at present and in general the new Bill makes provisions which will assign to the council powers in relation to undergraduate dental education that are vested in the Medical Council at present.</P>
    <P>This move to make the dental profession <Col N="414" /> self-governing is long awaited and will, I know, be welcomed, not only by the dentists, but also by the undergraduate educational interests and indeed by the medical profession.  The education and training functions of the Dental Council will be performed by the Education and Training Committee which I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill extends greatly the powers of the council in relation to the discipline of members of the profession for professional misconduct or general unfitness to practise.  While, fortunately, it is only very rarely that it is necessary to have recourse to disciplinary action in regard to any member of the dental profession, it is essential in the interests of the public and of the profession itself to have adequate and suitable machinery available whenever it is necessary to have recourse to such action.  The statutory powers of the Dental Board at present provide only for the erasure of a dentist's name from the register.  Recognising the fact that circumstances may arise where some disciplinary action may be called for but that the penalty of erasure would not be always warranted, provision is also made in the Bill for lesser penalties.</P>
    <P>Section 39 empowers the council to suspend a dentist's registration; section 40 gives the council power to attach conditions to a dentist's continuing registration and section 41 contains provisions enabling the council to admonish, to advise or to censure a dentist in relation to his or her professional conduct.</P>
    <P>In relation to Part V as a whole, it was necessary to ensure that its provisions would not be in conflict with the Constitution. Difficulties have arisen over the years in relation to the constitutionality of the powers of registration councils and other bodies dealing with the regulation of certain professions and there have been some instances where these powers have been found to be in conflict with the Constitution.  The provisions of Part V of the Bill, therefore, have been very carefully drafted to ensure that there can be no such conflict in so far as the discipline of the dental profession is concerned. What is proposed is that every disciplinary decision of the council will be subject <Col N="415" /> to the approval of the High Court either on appeal by the dentist concerned or by way of application to the court by the council in the event of no appeal being made.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision which enables the council to take action against a dentist because of his unfitness to practise by reason of physical or mental disability. Again, the judicial safeguards have been built into this section.</P>
    <P>Part VI defines the practice of dentistry and describes those who are entitled to practise dentistry in the State.  The 1928 legislation could be regarded as somewhat defective in that it made no specific provision for the practice of dentistry by students of medical and dental schools. The new Bill contains provision for the practice of dentistry by these students, under the supervision of a registered dentist. The Bill also provides that the general prohibition on the practice of dentistry by non-dentists does not apply in the case of auxiliary dental workers, subject to certain provisions outlined in Part VII.  The penalties for offences under this part of the Bill have been updated, as indeed have all others throughout the Bill, and these could serve as deterrents to those who at present might be prepared to run the risk of prosecution in the knowledge that the maximum penalties that can be imposed for the illegal practice of dentistry are relatively trivial in this day and age.</P>
    <P>Under Part VII there is provision for the recognition and registration of classes of auxiliary dental workers.  It gives the Dental Council the power, subject to my approval, to determine the nature of the dental work that a dental auxiliary may be allowed to undertake and to stipulate the circumstances and conditions under which such work might be undertaken. We already have dental mechanics and dental surgery assistants working in this country though neither class of dental auxiliary can be registered under existing provisions.  There are certain classes of auxiliary dental workers in other countries who perform various dental procedures which under the existing 1928 legislation are illegal here.  For instance, <Col N="416" /> dental hygienists are a class of dental auxiliary that exist in some countries and which I would like to see introduced here under the new provisions.  Hygienists, as well as carrying out clinical tasks such as cleaning and polishing teeth, perform a very useful service in instructing patients in preventive care measures such as oral hygiene and in dental health education in general.  The dental profession would have no objection to and in fact would welcome the introduction of dental hygienists here.  In the public sector they could make a significant contribution to the dental care of school children since, apart from the valuable service they would provide themselves, their use would permit health board dentists to concentrate on the delivery of clinical work rather than have them spend valuable time on oral hygiene instruction, etc.</P>
    <P>I intend also to establish under the new legislation a class of auxiliary dental workers whose education and training would make them competent to supply dentures direct to persons of 18 years of age or over.  They would not, of course, be permitted to perform any work on living tissue.  The idea of such a class of dental auxiliary workers is not new and they already exist in many countries abroad.  For instance, such a class has existed in Denmark for many years.  The introduction of such a class of dental auxiliary here was one of the alternatives suggested by the Restrictive Practices Commission following the public inquiry which they carried out in 1982 into the legal restriction to registered dentists of the supply of dentures to the public.  The commission made it clear in their report that they were not at all in favour of dentures being supplied to the public by unqualified persons but they were against the retention of the existing legislative provisions which they regarded as restrictive.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a qualified class of auxiliary dental workers who are competent to supply dentures to the public direct will to some extent remove the monopoly enjoyed by dentists in providing this service at present.  However, it is well known that for many years certain dental mechanics have been dealing with <Col N="417" /> the public direct, which, in the case of the supply of dentures, constitutes the illegal practice of dentistry within the meaning of the 1928 Act.  As indicated earlier, the penalties for offences under the existing legislation did not prove to be an effective deterrent and this will now be rectified.  The provisions of the new legislation, therefore, far from constituting a relaxing of the restrictions on the practice of dentistry, should in fact result in greater safeguards for the public from the activities of illegal operators.  Only qualified persons will be permitted to practice dentistry and those who are in breach of these provisions will be liable to incur stiff penalties.  I would hope that preliminary moves towards the establishment of this new class of dental auxiliary would be initiated as soon as this legislation is passed.  This would involve discussions with all concerned leading to agreement on standards and on education and training programmes for the new class of auxiliary.</P>
    <P>Although there is no specific provision in the membership of the Dental Council for auxiliary dental workers, any class of auxiliary established by the council would have a representative on the committee of the council dealing with auxiliary dental workers.  This is provided for also in section 13 of Part II of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As well as providing for the establishment by the council of certain classes of auxiliary dental workers, Part VII also gives the Minister the authority, if he thinks fit, to direct the council to establish a particular class of dental auxiliary either on a permanent basis or for an experimental period, in order that the value to the public of the particular class of auxiliary may be assessed.</P>
    <P>Part VIII contains various miscellaneous provisions including authority for the making of regulations by the Minister for Health to give effect to any of the provisions of the Bill.  It also provides, under section 65, for the continuing in force for the time being of the agreement I referred to earlier between this country and the United Kingdom for the mutual recognition of dental qualifications awarded in these islands.  This agreement has served its purpose well over the years <Col N="418" /> but it is no longer relevant in the light of the mutual recognition of dental qualifications and rights of nationals of member states of the EEC to practice dentistry in the other member states.  This agreement will, therefore, be terminated as soon as practicable following the enactment of this legislation and discussions are already in progress with the United Kingdom authorities towards this end.</P>
    <P>There are two Schedules attached to the Bill, one of which lists the primary qualifications in dentistry issued in the State at present.  The other Schedule contains details of the rules regarding membership and meetings of the new Dental Council.  It covers such items as tenure of office of members, resignations and termination of membership, casual vacancies, quorum, proceedings at meetings, etc., all of which are on the lines of the normal rules governing bodies of this type.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to place on the records of the House my appreciation of the role played by the dental profession in our society.  They have given long and dedicated service to the community and I know that this will continue to be the case in the future.  I would like in particular to thank all those members of the profession who have given and continue to give their services voluntarily in serving on various committees, boards and working parties.  Their contributions help to maintain the high standards in dentistry which we in this country are so lucky to possess.</P>
    <P>The general description which I have given of this Bill will, I hope, demonstrate that it is non-controversial and that its only aims are the advancement of standards of the practice of dentistry and the safeguarding of the general public. The introduction of the Bill is long awaited by the dental profession itself and I am sure that the profession will be in agreement with its general provisions and would wish for its enactment at the earliest possible date.  In that regard I welcome the statement issued on 8 March by Mr. Donal Atkins, General Secretary of the Irish Dental Association, commenting on the Bill and generally welcoming its introduction.  I welcome his <Col N="419" /> agreement and the agreement of the association that the general direction of the Bill will provide for the protection of dental patients and the community as a whole from harmful practice by unqualified personnel.  Further, I welcome the indication from the association that the composition of the proposed Dental Council appears to reflect the public interest as well as that of the profession and that they will be given sufficient powers to safeguard that public interest.</P>
    <P>I noted that the association were reassured and pleased by the fact that the Bill makes provision for the establishment of schemes whereby properly qualified, registered and supervised dental auxiliary workers, such as dental hygienists who will be concerned with the prevention of dental disease, may be permitted to practise under the supervision of dentists.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I hope that this Bill will have a speedy passage, and I look forward to the co-operation of the House in making this possible.  I want to thank Senator Jim Dooge for initiating the Bill in the first instance in Seanad Éireann, and its passage through this House is the first step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dental Board who have been referred to by the Minister as we all know have been a statutory body set up under the Dentists Act, 1928, over 50 years ago.  As the Minister rightly said, they have served the profession well.  Up to then the profession was in a chaotic situation.  Indeed in this House the then Minister for Health referred to unlicensed persons from whom the public should be protected.  Obviously in those days there were wholesale massive abuses of the profession and it was right and proper that corrective action should have been taken.  Since 1928 &mdash; as the Minister said, we had a short Bill here some months ago &mdash; the practice of dentistry has come a long way.  The profession has served the public very well, as we all acknowledge, and this fact has been totally acknowledged in the Minister's address here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 56 years the Dental Board have acted as a very important <Col N="420" /> watchdog for the profession.  They have not been afraid to act against a member of the profession if they felt it necessary. Generally as a collective group they have a very real sense of pride and responsibility for maintaining the integrity and competence of their profession as a whole.  In their area of specialist skill we are getting a fairly specialised service.</P>
    <P>This Bill does many things.  For example, the right of the State to intervene in certain professions if it considers that the public need protection, cannot but be agreed upon, particularly in the area of health, life and so on.  It is right that in this highly skilled area also that the State should have some input, and the council that the Minister sets up should consist of people who understand the profession. Members of the public are sometimes good judges of the quality of service but in skilled specialist service, as in this case, perhaps their judgment would not be totally correct.  For that reason the 19 members of the council provided for in section 9 of the Bill have been fairly well considered.  My calculation is that of the 19 members, 14 have a medical-dental background and obviously would understand medical problems facing the council.  One is representing the general public and here the Minister is probably thinking of fees and charges generally. Certainly the consumer has a right to have a voice on this council and so too has the Minister for Education.  I throw out for discussion a possible amendment to provide that this council should have a direct link with the Irish National Teachers Organisation.  Perhaps the Minister for Education will decide in her wisdom to nominate somebody from that area because it is an area of importance.</P>
    <P>At primary school level the question of brushing and care of the teeth is vital for the children and if at that stage hygiene and all other relative matters are explained to them that training will stay with them for the rest of their lives.  The Minister should think about this because, apart from that aspect, it is generally accepted that the school dental scheme is a very serious matter of contention which I, as a public representative, and I am <Col N="421" /> sure the Minister also, have found many times to be a very real problem.</P>
    <P>Of course the question of orthodontics at that level is surely a national disgrace. I have known of delays of five, six and seven years before a child is looked at after his name appears on the list for treatment, and by that time it may well be too late to do anything about the problem. Indeed, in ordinary dental treatment too there is quite a backlog.  This whole area should be examined thoroughly with a view to corrective action. That is why I am keen that somebody from the INTO should be a member of the board.  If need be why not have a 20-member board?  I hope the Minister will consider my suggestion.</P>
    <P>Section 34 deals with the area of education and training, and standards of knowledge and experience required in dentistry in this country.  It is well known that people who aspire to a professional qualification must have obtained a sufficiently high standard in their leaving certificate and the points necessary for entry into dentistry studies are equal or very close to what are required for medical students.  Subsequent examinations ensure great competency on the part of the people who qualify, and not alone that but the profession imposes what is almost a duty on its members to continue to improve their standards.  Through the years they have continued to improve their own education, thus continuing to provide service for the people which has been of a very high degree of professionalism.</P>
    <P>The three sections dealing with auxiliary dental workers need very close examination and perhaps will be examined in greater detail on Committee Stage.  What does the Minister mean in section 56 by directing &ldquo;the Council to make a scheme&rdquo; and &ldquo;an experimental period&rdquo;?  In so far as the training of these people is concerned any work that they carry out must be under the direction of a registered dentist after the dentist has first examined the patient and outlined the course of treatment.  How will the public react to this?  It must be remembered that the work that these people will be engaged in is and has been part and <Col N="422" /> parcel of the work of the dentist who has had many long years of careful training. The medical profession will certainly have to have a very large input into this whole area.  That profession are very conscious, and rightly so, of the preventive aspects of medicine.  So too, dentists now tend towards preventive treatment.  Scaling and general gum treatment play an important role in the whole dental field.</P>
    <P>Section 38 of the Bill deals with &ldquo;Inquiry by Fitness to Practise Committee into the conduct of a registered dentist&rdquo;. The dentists of Ireland would welcome this section, the aim of which is to extend disciplinary powers in relation to the practise of dentistry and to ensure that these powers are compatible with the provisions of the Constitution.  The present power of the Dental Board in this regard deals only with the erasure of a dentist's name from the register.  I would generally welcome the provision for broader powers to be given to the Dental Council whereby a dentist can be suspended from the dentists' register for professional misconduct, as can happen from time to time with so many people practising.  It is also right that the Bill provides the right of the dentist in question to apply to the High Court for cancellation of the council's decision.  That is to be welcomed also because dentists, like all of us, are human beings and unfitness to practise in that profession, as indeed in any profession, due to change in physical or mental ability, can occur at any time.  The changes in this area appear to be practical and fair and they protect the general public, the profession and the rights of the suspended dentist.</P>
    <P>It is generally believed that the training of technicians in this country is totally inadequate and I understand that the scheme administered by AnCO has not been at all satisfactory.  The council should investigate and tackle this problem. The technicians would require a full-time course in a dental school or college of technology.  It is interesting to compare our training system with what pertains in Denmark where the training of denturists consists of a period of five years, that is two years of technical training, two years of clinical training and a <Col N="423" /> year of supervised clinical practice, a total of five years in all compared to our training period of six months which is inadequate.  People who are trained should have priority over those who have not the same competence and degree of training.  A person with, say, six months of training should not be allowed to set himself up as suitable to treat the public. We have some excellent dental mechanics in this country.  They should be protected and overnight technicians should not be allowed to spring up all over the place.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to preventive dentistry and to the gums.  It can be said that the gum is the very foundation of the whole dental set-up and dentures can cause real problems if the operation is not properly executed.  We speak of foreign bodies in our mouths but in that sense one could say that a denture is a foreign body.  I think that gums and all the supporting tissues would be at risk with the provision of dentures by persons not trained in oral physiology.  All of this area must be totally understood.  Therefore, years of training must be given to the person concerned.  The general comment I make is that the financing of the work of the water fluoridation scheme should be extended.  Money spent in this area is well worth while.  I am told of a scheme in the Monaghan-Cavan area where money could not be sought from either the Department or from the county council for fluoridation.  This is a disgrace. Hopefully it will not be allowed to continue.  The worth while effect of fluoridation is obvious everywhere.  It must be allowed to advance with its very obvious benefits.  Fluoridation has clearly improved the dental health of people.</P>
    <P>The dental treatment of physically and mentally handicapped people, disabled people and people in various institutions is something that should be examined. Hopefully nobody will be neglected in this area.  Overall, I would hope that there must be something in this Bill for everybody.  In particular, there must be something in it for the public because we have to consider the implications for the dental health of the public primarily.  I <Col N="424" /> give my wholehearted support and a general welcome to the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are areas we will talk further about on Committee Stage.  At this point in time, I would say that it is a Bill to which I give general welcome and I support the principles enshrined in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is mian liomsa ar dtús fáilte a chur roimh Bille na bhFiaclóirí agus is mian liomsa freisin comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire Sláinte agus leis an Rialtas as ucht an Bille seo a thabhairt os comhair an tSeanaid.</P>
      <P>First of all, I would like to express a very broad welcome for this comprehensive Bill, the first such Bill introduced in this country in 66 years.  In doing so, I would like to pay tribute to the Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Deputy Barry Desmond, and to the Government. In particular, I would like to pay tribute to Deputy Fergus O'Brien, Minister of State, who during his time as Minister of State at the Department of Health had a particular interest in this matter.  We are seeing some of the fruit and results of his hard endeavours in that regard.</P>
      <P>I would also like to take this opportunity to express our grateful appreciation to the joint working party for their dedicated work in this regard.  This is a very comprehensive Bill consisting of eight parts, 68 sections and some Schedules.  I would like to compliment the Government in bringing this Bill before the Seanad within 15 months of their being elected to office.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Fallon in welcoming the proposals in Part II of the Bill, sections 9 to 25, for the establishment of a Dental Council to replace the existing Dental Board.  The council will consist of 19 representatives as opposed to nine on the board at the moment.  The council will be broadly representative of the various interests and there will be at least two representatives of the consumer interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Fallon that the Minister should give very serious consideration to having representation from the Irish National Teachers Organisation. I believe teachers, especially primary <Col N="425" /> teachers, have a vital role to play in the whole area of dental education.  I would like to welcome the provisions in Part V of the Bill in regard to fitness to practice in respect of which the new Dental Council will have much wider powers than heretofore.  Under existing legislation the only disciplinary measure open to the Dental Board is the erasure of a dentist's name from the register.  This has obvious drawbacks.  There are bound to be occasions when some form of disciplinary measure is called for but where the nature of the offence would not warrant so drastic a measure as the removal of the dentist's name from the register. In that context, therefore, I welcome the provisions in sections 39, 40 and 41 in relation to the professional conduct of a dentist.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides for the recognition and registration of dental specialists. While that may be desirable in the context of EEC legislation and so on, the informed dental profession believe that the paramount need at this moment and in the years ahead is primary health care supported by the consultants, some of whom were recently appointed to the health boards.  I would like to congratulate the Government for their decision to appoint consultants to advise health boards.  I have no doubt the Minister will see that every health board in the country will have such a consultant on its staff.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal under section 54 which will enable the Dental Council to recognise and register certain classes of auxiliaries.  This will be a decided boon to the underdeveloped health board dental service and also in regard to the vital area of job creation for suitably qualified people.  However, there are reservations among the dental profession, and they are well-informed reservations, regarding sections 55(1), 55(2) and also section 56.  I hope that we will have the opportunity of discussing these sections when we come to Committee Stage.  I also hope the Minister will be amenable to meeting the various interests in regard to these sections.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are members of health boards and who are elected public representatives <Col N="426" /> will agree that the existing dental service is totally unsatisfactory and inadequate.  I think a few statistics in this regard are pertinent.  Sixty per cent of children in the eight to nine year age group have dental decay which is untreated and 37 per cent in the 13 to 14 year age group have dental decay which is untreated.  These facts speak for themselves. The question of the population-dentist ratio needs to be looked at. According to world health standards, it is three times what it should be.</P>
    <P>The joint working party emphasised the importance of giving priority to the preventive aspects of dental care.  They stressed that the establishment of an improved dental service in this country in the absence of a preventive philosophy is unlikely to bring about an improvement in the overall dental health of a community. The World Health Organisation has this to say on this topic.  I quote as follows:</P>
    <P>Given the high incidence of dental caries today, no country, no matter how wealthy, can train a sufficient number of dentists and finance the service required to give an adequate treatment to the whole population. The only solution is to reduce the incidence through preventive measures.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is very important that the whole philosophy of the Bill should be an emphasis on preventive treatment.</P>
    <P>The joint working party also stress that the drinking of fluoridated water to a level of one part per million is well established as the most effective and efficient measure available on a community basis in the fight against dental caries.  A reduction of over 50 per cent in the incidence of disease is recorded among children using fluoridated piped water supplies. Again the joint working party are anxious that effective fluoridation of piped water supplies should be utilised to the fullest extent.  I would like to put on record my support for their proposal for the setting up of a national monitoring agency designed to ensure that we can have effective fluoridation of water supplies where necessary.</P>
    <P>The working party also indicate that <Col N="427" /> other measures need to be examined in regard to this area.  They point out that fluoride toothpaste, for example, gives a reduction of 20 per cent to 25 per cent in dental caries.  Other examinations are currently being carried out in regard to milk and the EEC subsidy.  I hope this will play a role for those children who do not have access to fluoridated water supplies. Dental health education is of paramount importance.  Dental hygiene, as Senator Fallon mentioned, has a very important role to play in the whole area of oral hygiene, in diet control and other measures in our schools.  For that reason, therefore, I support his suggestion that the INTO should have a representative on the Dental Council.</P>
    <P>Provision must be made for the special groups, for example, the mentally handicapped and the physically handicapped. Dental treatment can pose special hazards for the institutionalised handicapped patients, for Down's Syndrome patients and for patients suffering from various blood disorders.  Therefore, I welcome the decision of the Minister and the Government in regard to the appointment of senior dental officers in this discipline. It is important that provision be made for nursing mothers also.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider seriously &mdash; it has been said on a number of occasions in this House and in the other House &mdash; the question of the insured worker.  Some provision will have to be made for the wife and dependants of the insured worker in regard to the provision of dental and other services.  I would also suggest to the Minister that the whole question of third-party funding of dental care needs to be examined.  In this regard I would suggest to the Minister that an examination should be carried out by his Department with regard to the Danish experience.  Consideration should be given to the work of Professor Norman Butler who is currently President of the Irish Dental Association.  We are enormously indebted to Professor Butler for the stimulating suggestions which he has made in recent addresses and for his work in this matter.  I have today received representations on behalf <Col N="428" /> of what are called dental mechanics or technicians.  As a group they are concerned in regard to the provisions in the Bill relating to their role.  As Senator Fallon said, there are some such who are excellent people but we also know there is another side to the coin.  I am sure the Minister will be amenable to having appropriate discussions with these people.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the remit of the health boards in regard to dental care over the past number of years is not being met &mdash; it is being grossly under-provided. Pre-school children, as we are aware, receive little or no treatment.  Medical card holders are similarly ill-served.  The service provided for primary school children is grossly inadequate.  If the spirit of the Bill is to be realised these matters will have to be looked at very seriously.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Bill, the first such major comprehensive Bill since 1928, is long overdue.  I would like to commend all concerned with the provision of dental care, both those who work in the health boards and those working in the private sector for the unstinting service which they have given the community. With adequate consultation between all concerned an appropriate Bill can go through both Houses and eventually become an Act and thereby serve the community better in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I welcome the Bill which has my approval.  I understand the Bill has the full approval of the Dental Association.  I note from the Minister's speech that this will bring the entire administration of the service as operative at present under the control of one new body.  Certainly this is a step in the right direction.  All aspects of the service will be under the control of the new body, from post-graduate level to training level and dental care.  It is also worthy of note that the Bill will bring control of dentistry into line with EEC regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister a few brief questions.  Is he satisfied that there are sufficient trainee dentists to meet the needs of the scheme, not just to have the scheme administered but to have it done <Col N="429" /> as we would like to have it administered. I speak specifically of rural areas where Senator Kennedy correctly stated there is a backlog.  For an on-going service, which it should be for dental care, the number of dentists in rural areas is not sufficient especially for the school going population.  We all recognise that that is the most important area at treatment level.  In the orthodontal treatment service as everybody is aware, there is a long waiting list.  I am aware that it is a very expensive area.  While health boards are limited in their resources, especially with regard to finance for orthodontal care, there is a growing problem in that service.</P>
    <P>The scheme is not financially attractive enough for the recruitment of dentists. That is where the major problem lies.  I would urge the Minister to see if something could be done to make the scheme attractive enough so that when health boards advertise for dentists in an area they will not find that young people who have been educated, mostly by the State and trained in dentistry, have emigrated to practise in some other country.  Several suggestions have been made that especially at local health committee level there should be some regulation stipulating, especially in the dentist's field and perhaps in the GP's field also, that students who qualify be requested to give service for a number of years in their own country.  Meanwhile there is a major problem.  The problem is simply that health boards are not offering a decent and attractive salary to dentists to join the scheme as administered by the health boards.  I would especially like the Minister to look into that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome the Minister and his opening remarks on this Bill. The origin of this Bill goes back to 1976 under a previous Labour Party Minister, Mr. Brendan Corish, when I think for the first time people involved in health boards began to look at the whole area of dentistry, what the existing role of the Dental Board was, what was needed to be done in the whole area to revolutionise the practice of dentistry.  Indeed, I want <Col N="430" /> to put on record my appreciation of the Minister, Deputy Desmond, who is with us today, on his ability to listen to the various submissions we made to him before the Bill was finally drafted and brought into the Seanad today.  I think that period of consultation and the recognition that this was a whole new area has been justified by the warm welcome that has been generally given to the Bill by the dentists' association.</P>
      <P>The board shows a new concept and I am pleased to see an adequate representation, not alone of the profession that have given a lifetime to the service of dentristry but also for the first time it takes into consideration the role of the consumer.  In this particular area the role of the consumer is vitally important from two points of view; first of all, to ensure that the consumer gets a fair service competently provided at a reasonable cost, but also to ensure that when they submit themselves as patients to dental clinics they can do so in the knowledge that qualified people are there to look after them and only an adequately trained and qualified person can be responsible for dealing with the live tissue.  I am glad that the Minister actually used that terminology in his opening speech.  At very early stages any problems within the mouth &mdash; mouth ulcers or mouth cancer or whatever other major problem can arise can only be dealt with confidently by people who are trained and educated and fully qualified to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not take away for one moment from the very useful role that can be performed and will, I hope, be performed, under this new council in the area of auxiliary dental workers or hygienists, or whatever we would like to call them.  I am pleased that these will be working under the direction and supervision of the dental profession because the public will need to be reassured that when they submit themselves in this area they can have the confidence that they always had in the past, particularly with the dental profession.  I do not think the dental profession can ever be accused, unlike some other professions in this and other countries, of having a vested interest in this legislation.  All the submissions <Col N="431" /> that were made to us were made along the lines of protecting the health and the future of people, particularly schoolchildren, young children and adults who had neglected themselves because of a lack of hygiene or a lack of knowledge of the appropriate hygiene that they should have adopted.</P>
    <P>I wish this new board well when it is full initiated.  We may have questions to ask the Minister on Committee Stage. For instance, in section 51 it says specifically that a person who is not a registered dentist shall not take or use the title of a dentist or dental surgeon or dental practitioner and a person who is not a registered dentist shall not take or use any title or description which implies that he is a registered dentist.  We are changing to the council instead of the board.  That is an area where we have to be extremely careful to ensure that people do not purport to be something that they are not or to do what they are not trained to do.  If that happens certainly the interest of the consumer would not be protected.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that that section gives that protection and also ensures that adequate fines are available to act as a deterrent to people who, as Senator Fallon stated, spring up overnight and purport to be providing a service which, on the surface, seems to be good value, but when we take the risks involved into consideration, could be the worst value for money that the consumer could have.</P>
    <P>Section 54 states that:</P>
    <P>The Council may, with the consent of the Minister, make a scheme for establishing classes of auxilliary dental workers who may undertake such class or classes of dental work as may be specified by the council, notwithstanding that the doing of such work would constitute the practice of dentistry within the meaning of this Act.</P>
    <P>This is a section that I would like the Minister on Committee Stage to elaborate on so that there can be no doubt in anybody's mind whether they are people who will become auxiliary dental workers or indeed the existing dental profession <Col N="432" /> or the council dealing with both of them as to what this section means.</P>
    <P>I would like also an explanation from the Minister in respect of section 56, under which, if he considers that the council do not perform their functions under this section, he would have the right to ask them to establish the particular auxiliary dental service.  Although I have no objection in principle to the section giving the Minister the right to do that I would hope that he would trust this new council to perform the functions which are given to them by the Houses of the Oireachtas and that they would perform them with due regard for all the consequences.  I hope the Minister will never find it necessary to implement section 56, because there is a general feeling amongst the profession and, indeed, among those of us who are involved in health boards and know the inadequacies of the service that we on the health boards provide that something had to be done within this area.  I have no doubt that the council will do it and I have no doubt whatsoever that the dental profession involved in the new council will have a major input in ensuring that that section is carried out to the letter of the law.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to dentists. I know very many of them in my constituency and many of them at health board level.  Not alone are they experts and contributors to the normal day-to-day policy-making functions of health boards, but they have always shown a dedication to their own calling and to their duties under extreme pressure.  The Minister is aware that up to now, because of the limited number of dentists qualified in this country, they have always seemed to be working round the clock, keeping appointments and then suddenly having to face urgent situations in cases of extreme pain.  In spite of all that, they have managed to give this tremendous service.  They also provide facilities at their own expense and make very expensive equipment available to the public at unsociable hours in many areas.  That is well known.  It is only right that we should put it on the record of the House today.</P>
    <P>They operate in the private sector in a private capacity.  Within their private surgery <Col N="433" /> hours, they also facilitate people who qualify under the Social Welfare Acts and I would like to thank them for that.  I know that their compensation for that service has not always been as good as I would have liked it to have been. There have been delays because people give a wrong social insurance number or present themselves for emergency dental treatment, being, according to themselves, covered under insurance contributions. The dentist kindly obliges and by the time the number is submitted he discovers that there were not sufficient contributions to qualify for payment.  In spite of that, the dentists still react professionally to the demands of society.</P>
    <P>I join with my colleague, Senator Kennedy, in trying to ensure that this area of cover for social welfare contributors would be extended to the dependants of the insured contributor.  It would be a policy of both the Minister's party and my own to try to extend this particular facility at some stage so that people who pay quite a large share of PRSI and PAYE contributions may, if at all possible, have their families covered at some future extension when our economic situation has improved to the degree that both the Minister and I would like.</P>
    <P>I would like also to thank the dentists who have functioned under the medical cardholders system.  There are quite a few dentists throughout the country who have given such a service &mdash; limited though it may be.  Some boards operate quite a good scheme.  Unfortunately in recent years sufficient money was not available in the health allocations to have this medical cardholder dental service continued.  That was a pity, because the area in which you would probably find most neglect is that of the medical cardholder bracket.  Because some of these people do not have the contributions to qualify for the social welfare section of the dentistry services, they may neglect themselves and not present themselves in time to ensure that proper dental treatment can be given.</P>

      <P>It is rather appropriate that we should have the opportunity of discussing the activities or developments in the European Communities this week, which one hopes will be followed by a week which will give some hope to many sectors of the industrial and commercial life of this country.  I refer to the coming Summit meeting.  It is important that we should extend to the Taoiseach and to the team of people who will accompany him our support and best wishes and the hope that he will be able to secure an equitable deal for us at this most difficult time.  The motion gives us an opportunity to review the year of 1983 but unfortunately, we do not have the benefit of the two reports that we should be discussing. Nevertheless, we have lived through a period &mdash; from a European point of view &mdash; which can only be described as disappointing because it lacked leadership and drive.  Obviously, the people at the helm have no semblance of the spirit which moved the founding fathers, and so the Community has ground on through a turbulent period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not look at the workings of the European Community from a completely negative standpoint.  Within the system, enshrined in the Treaty of Rome and in our Treaty of Accession, there is much of benefit and many Articles and regulations which bring tremendous solace and grant-aid daily to so many different sectors of our community.  The Social Fund is certainly playing a very significant <Col N="435" /> role in providing invaluable resources to enable our administration to tackle, in a more determined way, the problems associated with unemployment, redundancies and school leavers who are still searching for employment.</P>
    <P>The more I see of the way in which the Social Fund is evolving, the more I think that we owe a great debt of gratitude to President Hillery for his tremendous work and his great achievement in introducing his first social action programme. Even at that time, the early seventies, the graph was going up.  It provided a foundation which has enabled the Community and the organisations that the Social Fund finances to tackle the programme. There are many who will say that the moneys are not all being spent as intelligently as possible.  Nevertheless, while many people will say that there is much duplication and triplication of services, it would be worse if there were areas which were not adequately covered and needs not being fairly met.  The Social Fund, therefore, has introduced to this country a new concept in care.  As you go through each one of our county administrative areas, without exception you will find special schools, schools for slow learners, the mildly handicapped, or people with one or more disadvantages.  Were it not for the generous grants from the Social Fund they would not be there, so we have a lot to be thankful for.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, there is need for the Council of Ministers and, indeed, the Commission and our own Department of State to examine how the considerable amount of money is being expended.  Our benefit from the Social Fund last year, the year under review, was in excess of £140 million.  When you add to that the yield from the 1 per cent levy on income it represents a considerable amount of money which, in the main, is available to ease the problems of people who are unemployed or to assist in the financing of the schemes to train or retrain workers or to help with the various AnCO projects.</P>
    <P>I am slightly disappointed with AnCO in that they are obviously empire builders. I do not see the necessity for having <Col N="436" /> skyscraper blocks in practically every city, and certainly right around Dublin city, with very expensive facades with the AnCO sign on them.  The money could be much better spent on encouraging people, especially under the enterprise incentive scheme, which encourages and assists young people with ideas to start up for themselves in the private sector.  However, this scheme is slowly getting off the ground and it holds out hope for our young people, people with ideas who have the energy to match them.  In the main, we lack the finance to put these projects into operation and I would hope that the Government would allocate the maximum resources to that scheme to meet whatever demand is there.  It is important that our young people, who have had the benefit of perhaps the best educational facilities that any generation of Irish people have been offered, be given a break and granted whatever resources they need.</P>
    <P>The IDA, who could be said to be over-financed in ratio to the number of jobs they are providing in the year under review, should change considerably and take more chances.  While they get a lot of stick for the factories that fail, they should be prepared to be a little more adventurous in trying to find the job opportunities that we need so badly.  I have had occasion to write several letters to the IDA over the last five or six weeks and whether they are on a go-slow or are having difficulties with the post, they are not noted for acknowledging correspondence. This is unacceptable for a semi-State organisation.  However, I do not think we should be discussing them except to say that if we are to get through our present economic difficulties it is quite obvious that we will need all the assistance we can get and from whatever source possible.  I hope that priority will be afforded under the Social Fund to the agencies who are engaged in assisting young people to start into a new life.</P>
    <P>There is an area, too, which we should take the opportunity of examining when talking about job opportunities and the role of the Social Fund in that sphere.  It is not perhaps relevant, but some of our European partners have various schemes <Col N="437" /> for a reduction in the general retirement age for ordinary workers in jobs.  We find that many local authorities do not conform exactly to the present retirement age of 65.  The Government should examine seriously the question of lowering the retirement age so as to create additional job opportunities.</P>
    <P>When dealing with European policies, it is very difficult not to think of the Regional Fund.  I have a particular belief in the ability of that fund to set the pace in transforming the face of this country but unfortunately, as far as we are concerned, the administration of the Regional Fund is not operated as most other countries operate it, that is to say it is controlled completely by two or three senior civil servants in the Department of Finance.  There is absolutely no dimension of additionality in that area.  In other words, the moneys from the Regional Fund are used in substitution of services that up to now were provided either from the Road Fund or from the ordinary capital budget.  This defeats the whole concept of a fund provided by the Community to help to redress the imbalance between the economies of the wealthier and the poorer areas in the Community. In the last five years, that imbalance has changed, unfortunately in the wrong direction.  Back in 1978 it was of the proportion of 1:8 but now it is gone to 1:10. The richer areas are ten times wealthier than the poorer areas and coming from one of the poorest areas, our midlands, I think that it is unfortunate that we have not had a fair crack of the whip &mdash; from successive Governments, I hasten to add.</P>
    <P>The Government should take the lead and put the spirit of the Treaty of Rome into action, to read the Charter setting up the Regional Fund and consult the regions.  In each of the industrial regions, we have the MRDOs, set up by members of local authorities and senior officials of the local authorities.  I believe until such time as those MRDOs and local representatives are able to have a very significant input in deciding on the order of priorities for the expenditure of regional funds in their regions the moneys will not be spent to the best advantage of the areas concerned.  I am quite alarmed that, <Col N="438" /> at the end of practically every year, various Departments publish lists of projects to be executed in the next four, five or six weeks before the end of the calendar year in order to use up the moneys.  That is an affront which I would ask sincerely should be changed.  The time is long gone when we can afford expenditure of considerable proportions with so little thought and certainly no local input whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The regulations coming from Europe and within the European Community indicate a considerable amount of effort and many regulations are designed to strengthen and conserve the quality of the environment.  While we here enjoy the cleanest environment &mdash; certainly cleaner than any of the industrialised areas &mdash; we are doing precious little to conserve it.  While we have had, over the last couple of years the Water Pollution Act and a number of other Acts very few of these are being put into practice.  We are standing idly by and allowing the situation to deteriorate.  It is shocking that most of our rivers are now so polluted that you cannot see your toes if you stand up to your knees in them.  Within the next five years, a high proportion of our waterways and rivers will be absolutely hostile to fish life, which would be a great pity.  Unless fairly strict rules are applied and something done about it, the environment will suffer irreparable damage, so I hope that the regulations which are adopted at Community level will be put into action as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot from time to time on the Common Fisheries Policy.  Unfortunately, I am not very up-to-date on that. Some six or seven weeks ago I had occasion to write to the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry for a brief on the up-to-date situation.  I suppose his Department is very busy and, unfortunately, he has not been able to reply.  Nevertheless, it is important that the problems being experienced by our fishing industry should be treated very seriously.  I recall a few years ago being on a delegation to Greenland during one of the turbulent sessions with the Greenlanders towards the end of the so-called Cod War.  One of the reasons why I, as an Irishman, was <Col N="439" /> sent there was that at that time we had only one boat in excess of 100 or 105 feet, or some particular dimension, so that we could not be accused of raiding their cod fishing grounds.  That is just an indication of the state of our fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>The fishermen who took the chance on expanding and invested heavily, borrowing in order to do so have been adversely affected by changes in the quota system and perhaps by the difficulties in the trade.  I would hope that it would be possible for the Government to ensure that our people get the best possible support through the Common Fisheries Policy. We must at all times be in there to fight for a greater share and part in the management of this valuable resource to which we should have first access, as we have possibly some of the most extensive waters in the European Community.  We do not seem to be getting a fair share of the returns from these waters, but we should put the fisheries industry a little higher on our order of priorities.</P>
    <P>To most people, the European Community is not much more than the Common Agricultural Policy.  I should like to deal with the problem that exercises the minds of most people, the question of milk.  The Council of Ministers for Agriculture at their meeting some days ago decided more or less to implement the Commission's proposals, leaving the vexed question of an exemption for our country from most of these proposals to be decided by the heads of State next week.  Of all the proposals, the media seem just to take the milk levy and concentrate on that.  Of course, it is certainly the most radical.</P>
    <P>The other proposals are (1) that price policies will be restricted and will operate on a two year basis rather than annually as heretofore and (2) that production which is more than 1 per cent in excess of that achieved by creameries and dairies during 1981 will be severely penalised through the imposition of a super-levy or a tax on the excess.  This levy will be applied at the rate of 75 per cent of the Community's target price for milk, that is, approximately 70p per gallon.  In this country, that would amount to almost 100 per cent of the price that the farmer <Col N="440" /> gets, whereas the price that the Danes and the Dutch receive is almost £1 per gallon, so it affects our farmers on two fronts.  I certainly support the Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach on the vigorous campaign that they have undertaken against that.</P>
    <P>We must accept that action must be taken to limit the growth of milk supply in the Community and to contain the growth in expenditure.  However, I insist that expenditure in other sectors, which is, in fact, growing more rapidly than in the milk sector should also be dealt with. I believe that whatever action is eventually taken next week will be fair and that it will take account of the level of development of the dairy industries in the different regions of the Community and of the special importance of milk to the Irish economy.  In my view, the proposed super-levy meets none of these aims and, consequently, is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I would like briefly to put on record my reasons for believing that we must have an exemption from the super-levy.  We must insist that we are not being bad Europeans but, believing in the true spirit of the Treaty of Rome, are adamant on getting the benefit of that treaty.  The super-levy proposal cannot be fair while there exists the present wide divergence in levels of development as between the various member states.  It cannot take due account of the degree to which the different regions and different groups of producers contribute to the current surplus. The three member states with the most developed dairying &mdash; the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Denmark &mdash; which have only 9 per cent of the Community holdings, have 27 per cent of the Community dairy cows and account for almost one-third of the Community's milk production.  Other member states, including Ireland, contribute to the total milk production roughly in proportion to their holdings, with perhaps the Greek and Italian contributions being less than proportionate.  It is no coincidence that the disproportionately high contributions come those member states with the highest proportion of the larger scale holdings.</P>
    <P>While milk production is of far greater <Col N="441" /> relative economic importance to Ireland, where directly and indirectly it accounts for almost 9 per cent of our gross national product, our dairying industry is still comparatively under-developed compared with the other member states.  Our average yields are only 80 per cent of the Community average and only about 65 per cent of the average yields in the most developed dairying regions.  To freeze production levels at this time would clearly be unfair to us.  For instance, a farmer with 30 cows in Ireland would have his annual production frozen at 21,000 gallons or face a levy of the full price that he would get, which is around 70 pence per gallon, whereas a similar sized farmer in Denmark, Holland or the very developed areas could maintain production at 32,000 gallons without any penalty, and he would be getting almost £1 a gallon for his milk at the same time.</P>
    <P>From the low base milk deliveries in Ireland we have increased more rapidly since 1981 than elsewhere in the Community and, therefore, in addition to preventing our industry developing towards the level achieved elsewhere this proposed super-levy would impose the greatest relative burden on our industry in respect of the current levels of production. Our increase over 1981 could result in levies totalling close to £1 million on the industry or, more likely, a loss of output of a similar amount.  This would represent at least 10 per cent of the overall Community take from the levy, whereas Ireland accounts for less than 5 per cent of the Community deliveries.</P>
    <P>Many people who are absolutely cheesed off listening the argument on the super-levy find difficulty in appreciating the effects that that kind of an imposition is going to have on Irish agriculture and agricultural development.  This year we are told that price increases &mdash; if there are any &mdash; for farm produce will amount to roughly 2 or 3 per cent at the most, but already this year the nitrogen fertilisers that have already been spread on the land have been purchased by dairy farmers at a cost of 19 or 20 per cent more than last year.  Similarly the price of concentrated dairy nuts has increased substantially over the last couple of <Col N="442" /> months, so farm costs have gone up significantly.  People, in pursuance of their participation in the farm modernisation scheme, decided to develop their holdings in accordance with a farm plan which was drawn up by their advisers embarked on an extension at fairly costly amounts, most of which were borrowed. They can only increase their income and their return from the farms by increasing their output, and if the super-levy is imposed this will mean that they will not be able to make any money by increasing their output and therefore, will not be able to reach their target.</P>
    <P>Many thousands of dairy farmers &mdash; who account for practically half the farmers in this country &mdash; will be in serious difficulties with their lending agencies, the ordinary commercial banks or the ACC, and they will be forced to re-negotiate whatever loans or arrangements that they had come to over the last few years. This is something that has not been mentioned and to which sufficient attention has not been paid.</P>
    <P>I see this as the most serious aspect of the arguments surrounding the imposition of the super-levy.  We certainly cannot blame the Government, the Taoiseach or his senior Ministers, who have for many months in very strong terms told all the Heads of State and every Minister concerned in the other nine partner countries of the difficult situation in this country.  The basic reason for joining the Community was that we should be able to improve our output by improving the quality of our husbandry to increase production and to be able to bring the standard of living and the working conditions of our people more closely aligned to that in the better developed countries of Europe.  I hope that in the negotiations next week the country will get a fair deal from the Community which will justify the hope and trust that we originally placed in it.</P>
    <P>There is also the proposal about the elimination of the special subsidy on butter, which would result in a loss of about £50 million to our country.  It will lead to an increase in the retail price of butter of some 13p per lb., which will mean a drop in consumption.  Also coming up at the <Col N="443" /> Summit is the question of the deal with the New Zealand Government on the importation of New Zealand butter into the United Kingdom.  They undermined one of the cornerstones of the Common Agricultural Policy inasmuch as they offer a challenge to the principle of Community preference.  The New Zealand imports to the United Kingdom, which of course was always our traditional market, amounts to 34 per cent of consumption in the UK, and since the Commission proposals on milk involve major sacrifices by Community producers, it is imperative that these are matched by sacrifices from the third countries as well. For this reason I should like to see a significant reduction in the New Zealand butter import quotas to the Community over and above that likely to be imposed in the normal review.  The Commission proposals for a five year agreement providing for the import of 83,000 tonnes of New Zealand butter in 1984 reducing by 2,000 tonnes a year to, I think, 75,000 tonnes in 1988 is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>I also wish to draw attention to the fact that we are the only other major supplier of the butter imported from New Zealand to the British market which is classified as cream butter.  Britain is still our main outlet for this butter, and we are put in a very adverse trading position compared with Denmark and the Netherlands, who export ripened or lactic cream butter to the British market and are, accordingly, not affected by New Zealand imports. Imports of New Zealand cheddar cheese to the UK market causes a similar problem for us, as cheddar cheese is our main variety of cheese on the British market also.  The position constitutes a serious discrimination against our dairy products. The Minister should continue his efforts to ensure that the Commission proposals for the import of New Zealand butter and cheese on the UK market take a realistic and sympathetic view of our special problems in this area.</P>
    <P>We are also facing the question of the variable premium system and the problem that it presents to the Irish beef industry, not just to farmers but to our meat processing plants.  Since the beginning <Col N="444" /> of 1983, the variable premium rate has been at or near its maximum of 20p per kilogram.  Possibly it is down to 10p this week and, as a result, the Southern meat plant buyers are unable to compete with Northern buyers.  This has resulted in an increase in animals going North in 1983 compared to 1982.  Last year it is estimated that 165,000 head went to Northern Ireland meat plants whereas in 1982 the figure was 88,000.  This distortion of trade has occurred at a time when our own meat plants are starved of supplies and many operate a restricted working week or close down for long periods.</P>
    <P>As a result of the review, I hope the suckler cow premium will be increased to a more realistic level.  Perhaps the Minister might be able to give us the latest information regarding the calf subsidy. Indications were that it was going to disappear altogether, nevertheless where there is life there is hope.  Perhaps the Minister could also inform the House about the latest situation regarding transport policy which has not been given a high priority in the European scheme of things for 27 or 28 years.  While transport systems are, to a degree, rationalised our exporters and producers who must place their produce on the large and profitable markets in the centre of Europe are at a significant disadvantage without the benefit of a transport policy.  I hope that the Minister for Transport will redouble his efforts to bring in a transport policy which will take account of the problems that we have in negotiating two very expensive sea crossings.  We should be able to place our produce in Paris or Brussels or in any of the big continental markets at a competitive price.  I hope that a system, whether through national subsidies or whatever, will be introduced to enable more Irish truckers or transport companies to compete and to bring our produce out to those markets.  Our Government have not placed sufficient emphasis on this and we should press very hard for a policy which would introduce a system of equality.  If you had harmonisation of taxation on juggernauts or large lorries it would be very helpful in enabling our transport companies to compete.</P>
    <P>Since this is a European election year <Col N="445" /> it would be difficult to contribute without mentioning the European Parliament and the progress that institution has made as, according to the Treaty of Rome, it is the first of the Community institutions.  I believe &mdash; perhaps it is not a belief shared by everybody &mdash; that we should have greater powers for the parliament.  In my experience the parliament and the members from across the Community are always more than fair to the cases advanced in support of people from the various regions.  I have no doubt that that system of fair play will continue.  It is unfortunate that the European parliament has not taken more powers to be in a better position to directly affect and react to the problems in the different parts of the Community.</P>
    <P>From a Community point of view, the Common Agricultural Policy is worse than it was in 1979.  There has been no success in correcting the imbalance in the EEC budget or in working out a new policy in the Community.  The Council of Ministers seldom heed the recommendations of the parliament anyway.  I am not disappointed at the work that was done in the Community and in the parliament in particular but I am disappointed with the results.  There has been no improvement in the standing of parliament in its first five years as a directly elected body, which is a pity.</P>
    <P>Next week the Taoiseach will fight to have the EEC budget increased substantially and this will mean a new net benefit of considerable proportions of hundreds of millions of pounds to Ireland to enable the continuation of the development of the Social Fund which is so desperately needed for young and old to fight the blight of unemployment, to help the handicapped and train and re-train workers.  Women in particular must be afforded a special programme to enable them to re-enter the workforce.  It is important that heads of state reach agreement on the increase in the rate of VAT for the budget.  Perhaps the Minister can tell us what is expected, whether it will be 1.4 per cent or 1.8 per cent VAT.</P>
    <P>On the question of surpluses and food surpluses it is ironic that in this part of the world, in Europe, we are complaining <Col N="446" /> about surplus food which does not at present constitute record stockpiles. They represent only a few days' supply in excess of what is necessary to feed the Community.  I do not think that the population in this country would object to paying an extra .4 per cent if they knew that some of that money could be used to sell the extra food that would be produced to the millions of people who are undernourished and starving in some Third World countries.</P>
    <P>According to the latest report from the FAO, by the end of this decade there will be serious famine problems in quite a number of countries.  This country and the European Community in general should be prepared to make a significant contribution to alleviate the hunger and famine conditions in those countries. Protein-rich powdered milk is the ideal way to transport that kind of food aid across the world.  I hope that the Community in its deliberations next week will avail of the opportunity to display its social conscience.</P>
    <P>In advance of the European elections, it is imperative that the Government should publish in statistical form a list of the net benefits and the areas in which the country benefits from grants and otherwise from our membership of the Community.  People should be encouraged not to view the activities of the Community as a crutch to help what could be described as a &ldquo;limping&rdquo; agricultural economy or system but to understand the different ways in which the Community plays a role in the development of this country and I am confident that it is possible to do that.</P>
    <P>Since the appropriate reports have not been published for last year &mdash; the 22nd and 23rd reports &mdash; the Minister of State should publish the appropriate figures regarding development-in-aid.  It is important that the taxpayer should know what our contribution is and also the amount of moneys we have received and can expect to receive in respect of the Common Agricultural Policy both from FEOGA grants, the Social Fund and the Regional Fund.  Could the Minister indicate in what areas he anticipates that we can expect to see reform, even from a <Col N="447" /> national point of view, in the administration of some of those grants?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the highly topical and controversial super-levy.  Negotiations have now reached a critical stage.  We can only hope for the country's sake that the Minister for Agriculture has not made a tactical blunder in leaving the final decision on the super-levy to the Heads of Government meeting next week.  This same body failed to reach agreement on this issue as recently as December last.  I should like to know from the Minister what foundations the Minister for Agriculture has laid to show that a better deal can be achieved at next week's Summit meeting.</P>
      <P>On the question of farmers' incomes, there are misunderstandings and mistaken views about what farmers are getting from the EEC and from the CAP in particular.  The benefits that accrue from the CAP were the primary consideration when the Irish people voted to join the EEC.  Farmers regularly come in for unfair criticism about the benefits they enjoy from the CAP.  Central to our joining the EEC was the belief that farmers would achieve a fair standard of living with increasing individual earnings. Given the budgetary crisis in the Community at present, agricultural increases are exceptionally low.  Present indications are that price increases for the market year 1984-85 will be drastically below the Irish rate of inflation and, one might speculate, well below what other sectors in Ireland will likely achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In short, farmers can validly argue that they are not now getting out of the CAP what they believed they would and should get when we voted to join the Community.  During 1983, primarily the period we are discussing, the Government suspended the farm modernisation scheme, thereby failing to implement the terms of an EEC directive.  The consequences of this were to deny farmers the right to progress and also to deprive the country of EEC aid.  In one thoughtless move the Government succeeded in wiping out the farm construction business which has led to the creation in its place <Col N="448" /> of a black economy in farm construction. The Government have much to answer for in this connection.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald referred briefly to farm retirement.  For all practical purposes, the present farm retirement scheme has failed.  I would like to put it on record that the European Progressive Democrats, who are comprised of Fianna Fáil members and their French allies, in the European Parliament, have been very active in tackling this problem by proposing and gaining support in the Parliament for a new EEC farm retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer briefly to industry. During 1983, and credit should be given where it is due, as a result of the initiative and hard work of the European Progressive Democrats, the year was dedicated to Small and Medium Sized Industries, SMEs.  The Community came to realise during the year the importance to member states of small firms and their place in the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, of course, there has been a rapid growth in small industries since the mid-seventies and in our case they have made a significant contribution to job creation.  The emphasis on the employment generating ability of SMEs is reflected in the new Social Fund which extends aid to vocational training operations for persons employed in SMEs who require retraining as a result of the introduction of new technology.  Projects aided by the Social Fund in Ireland are reimbursed 55 per cent of the cost.</P>
    <P>On the same industrial theme, electronics and chemicals are two key sectors that have shown increases in both output and employment over the past decade. Our membership of the Community, of course, has provided access to the world's biggest single market.  This membership has in turn been central to attracting industrial investment to Ireland, especially American subsidiaries of electronic and computer software firms.  Export prospects for both electronic and computer software are excellent.  However, to ensure the future viability and competitiveness of these subsidiaries, it is most desirable that permanent research <Col N="449" /> and development functions be attached to the Irish manufacturing units.</P>
    <P>In the context of technological development there was movement in 1983 in the EEC towards the introduction of a Community technological programme ESPRIT.  This, of course, is a belated response to the major technological advances in the United States and Japan. Given the great potential of this programme for future industrial development, it is vital for Ireland to be involved in the research stage and for Irish university and research groups to participate fully.  The results of their research may well chart the course for the industries of the future and the direction of new employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>One of the most important developments in the Community during 1983 was the agreement reached on the terms of a new European Social Fund.  In 1983 Ireland received £134 million from the fund, mainly for educational and training programmes.  Given the gravity of unemployment, funds for training are particularly welcome.  Without a trained workforce, employment opportunities are clearly reduced.  AnCO, IDA, YEA, the ESB, CERT, Aer Lingus and the Departments of Labour and the Environment are all aided by the Social Fund as is the National Rehabilitation Board.  Most of the £134 million received from the fund was spent on training young people under the age of 25.  The new Social Fund is now to devote 75 per cent of its aid to young people under the age of 25 years.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald correctly referred to the powers of the European Parliament and his desire that those powers would be increased.  However, a lot of useful work is done in the Parliament.  As a practical example of what can be achieved, the Fianna Fáil Euro MPs in the EPD group, with their French allies, against tough British opposition, succeeded in ensuring that all people under the age of 25 years would be eligible to receive aid from the Social Fund for training programmes.  Also in the context of the Social Fund, the EPD has actively sought more funds for the training and job opportunities of the handicapped. Towards this end the EPD has proposed <Col N="450" /> a European Charter for the residential care of the physically disabled.</P>
    <P>One of the major concerns Ireland had during 1983 was that our priority status in the Social Fund would be changed.  It was not, and credit is due for that.  This will not be construed as a begging bowl attitude.  Ireland can legitimately claim under the terms and objectives of the Social Fund that we should be placed and stay at the top of the priority list for aid. Nonetheless, areas of industrial decline, the so-called black spots on the Continent in highly developed countries such as Germany, are now to be included for priority consideration.  While one can readily acknowledge that industries such as ship building and textiles are hard hit in those countries, I would like an assurance from the Minister that no effort will be spared to ensure that Ireland will remain at the top of the priority list. Whatever about the black spots in industrial areas of the Continent, we do not have the economic resources of the more advanced continental countries.</P>
    <P>The news on the Social Fund during 1983 was encouraging, but unfortunately the same cannot be said for the Regional Fund.  After discussions which lasted for well over two years a new Regional Fund has not been introduced.  Since its foundation in 1975, Ireland has received £370 million, of which £74 million was received in 1983.  Having said that, however, the gap between the richer and poorer countries of the Community has widened over the last decade.</P>
    <P>In other words, the primary objective of the Regional Fund has not been achieved.  Compared with Holland, for example, Ireland is relatively worse off than it was at the time we joined the Community in 1973.  Clearly the Regional Fund is of particular relevance to Ireland because among Community states we are one of the least developed countries.  We are on the periphery of Europe, distant from the major markets on the Continent. We have, therefore, a compelling case for perferential and more generous treatment from the Regional Fund, given the objectives of the Treaties under which we joined the Community.  For the Regional Fund to be a real instrument <Col N="451" /> for infrastructural development its resources must be substantially increased.  Without adequate infrastructure, industrial development cannot proceed satisfactorily.  Indeed, if we are to continue to attract foreign investment, for which there is intense international competition, we must have proper roads, telecommunications and services.  Surely the Regional Fund is a major key to that type of development and more funds should be allocated to it.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to refer to the area of energy.  As we are aware, turf development does not qualify for EEC aid at present.  I am happy to put on record that one of the Fianna Fáil Euro MPs, Mr. Seán Flanagan, has been instrumental in pressing for the inclusion of turf development aid under the energy policy of the EEC.  Due to his efforts, I understand, the Commission has prepared a report on this issue which may well lead to EEC aid for turf development.  The benefits which would flow from such aid are obvious and include increased employment in turf development and a reduction in our dependence on expensive imported oil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what Senator Hillery has said.  We are complaining about being worse off now than when we joined the EEC.  The time to look at the conditions was before we joined.  We were aware of what we were doing.  We went in with our eyes wide open, and thank God The Labour Party, if it can say nothing else for itself, was the party that said we would not get the conditions, and we canvassed in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the wording of the motion, &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann takes note of the developments in the EEC during 1983,&rdquo; I am a little puzzled by this terminology. I find it difficult to know where developments took place.  A very strong nation, France, holds the Presidency of the European Council of Ministers and despite their holding of the Presidency we have not seen anything happening. Since 1979 there have been very few developments in many areas.  While I am <Col N="452" /> not blaming the French, I am saying that what has been happening is that there has been indecision rather than initiatives over that period.  Consequently, it behoves us to urge the Presidency, with its strength and influence, to start dealing with initiatives to help us over the economic crisis that we find ourselves in.</P>
    <P>We have more than 12 million people unemployed in Europe, an unprecedented level of unemployment.  As long as initiatives to create employment are not taken there is no point arguing for a fair and just society, because once you start taking initiatives in this regard you get into the area of jobs, peace and freedom, and it is only then we can say that we are moving in the right direction. But the initiatives are not there.  I welcome much of what has been said in this debate, but for my part I am beginning to despair, because what I have been seeing is a revival of the <i>laissez-faire</i> monetarism and a sustained assault on the welfare state.  This is what is happening throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>Instead of worrying about unemployment and taking initiatives in a collective way in Europe, we all have our nationalism, and the way it is manifesting itself here is very disturbing.  We are reengaged in the civil war, with accusations of bugging and counter accusations by the two main parties.  This politiking is taking us away from the real issues of jobs, peace and freedom.  It must be a sorry sight for a boy of 20 years, or his mother or father having put him through school, to turn on the radio and hear all this about the bugging, but with no initiatives on the question of employment or other relevent matters.  We are not innocent in the European scene; we are part of it and we must share the guilt, yet we subject our young people to this nonsense of bugging.  What are they doing in the rest of Europe?  There is a shadow over the world now.  The whole question of our activities as Europeans is responsible for that shadow.  There is stagnation and the falling off of economic growth; mass unemployment; a substantial drop in contributions to the Third World in particular; relations between the two super powers are at their lowest ebb ever; <Col N="453" /> there is an acceleration of the arms race; overall incomes have dropped; crime has accelerated.  There is the crime attached to technology, not in the sense that we do not need it, of allowing it to come on at the rate and pace that it has come, and we have not taken precautions alongside it to circumvent the effects of it.  We are going to have technological progress, we need it, it has been good for us, but we must use it to our advantage.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence in the European scene of a policy of containing costs, of lowering inflation, of maintenance of purchasing power and the redistribution of work by not only shortening the working week but the reallocation of working hours.  There is no initiative for investment by public authorities or industrialists. In short, there is no overall package running alongside the technological advance to assist us over the problems that we are facing in relation to jobs, peace, and so on in a fair and just society.</P>
    <P>Europe lags behind the USA and Japan as regards the whole question of a reduction in unemployment.  There is not any seriousness in relation to the Third World in the sense of trying to free it from hunger and poverty.  We, as Europeans, have not done much to stop the world from sinking &mdash; and it has sunk. If we let it drift on in the direction it is going and not pay attention to the important aspects of how to get over the economic crisis, and stop referring back to the second oil price increases, and so on, followed by the economic crisis, and get on with looking at how we can take initiatives, we will be dealing with the question of providing uniforms and not reforms.  This is a gloomy situation that we are in.  What we have in Europe are depression and unemployment.  Both are used as tools to reduce inflationary pressures.</P>
    <P>The precarious energy market was dealt with by Senator Hillery.  This is another area which the EEC do not seem to have got their teeth into in a unified way or as a collective force.  I have not seen much in the direction of private monopolies which would be of assistance. There are pressures for the redistribution of incomes: there is not a lot in that <Col N="454" /> direction in the sense of sustained initiatives.</P>
    <P>Britain chooses to remain outside the European Monetary System.  Unless Europeans make up their minds that they can start using some sort of pressures to get Britain to join the EMS there is no way in which Europe can begin the road to independence in economic and monetary affairs from the USA.  In Europe we should begin thinking in a collective way of becoming economically and monetarily independent of the US.</P>
    <P>The problems of adjustments within the EMS should be shared equally.  We, in Ireland, have a very serious situation facing us.  We were speaking about the Spinelli Report in the House last week. The great danger for Ireland is that the more we get from Europe the bigger the obligation we have to it and the more vulnerable we become to the people who would advocate alignment.  Therefore, it is very important for us to ensure that either by accident or design we will not slip up.  We do not owe the EEC our neutrality, and we have to guard against this.</P>
    <P>I should like to finish by saying that I do not think there has been much development in the unemployment, peace or jobs aspects of the EEC, or independence from the USA not only since 1983 but since 1979.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>For some time now a motion has been on the Order Paper to deal with the 21st Report of Developments in the European Communities. Since this report deals only with the period to January 1983, more than a year out of date, I welcome the decision to broaden the debate to cover all of last year.  At the same time, and particularly as a new Member, I find it difficult to make any kind of meaningful contribution without the help of an up-to-date report.  The Minister's detailed and comprehensive address makes up for this deficiency to some extent, but not entirely &mdash; I am sure it is not unkind or unfair to say this.  I would like to know what the reason is for the delay in publishing the reports and if this can be avoided in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> As committed Europeans, but proud of our national, traditional and cultural heritage, we are all anxious to play our part in solving the problems that for so long transcended national frontiers and divisions.  We all want to get an opportunity to make a positive contribution at individual and national level.  This involves financial aid and incentives, more particularly because of our misfortune to have been an exploited people for nearly a thousand years.  I do not think this is something we should be ashamed of.  For that reason I deplore the tendency in some Irish quarters lately to portray our country as Caitlín Ní hUallacháin with the begging bowl and the disposition of Oliver.  I believe this is an insidious and perverted picture.  It misjudges and misrepresents the situation. The real picture is a tragic one of our young people, our unemployed and deprived, losing hope and interest.  They are the chief sufferers.</P>
    <P>I have a list of some preliminary figures for grants and loans to Ireland during 1983.  These are: FEOGA Guidance, £58,850,759; Social Fund, £134,278,733; Regional Fund, £77,349,623; ECSC loans, £124,037; EIB loans, £220,000,000; NCI loans, £21,100,000; EMS interest subsidies, £22,885,823; Energy grants, £894,750; ECSC grants, £53,000; Budget contribution, £191.5 million.  Because the headings do not correspond entirely with those which I have for previous years, back to 1973, I am unable to make annual comparisons, but I welcome the increase in the European Social Fund allocation from £97 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>In July 1975 it was decided to change the rules of the fund to make aid available for operations intended to help young people under 25 years who were unemployed or seeking employment.  It was also decided that priority would be given to those seeking employment for the first time.  This was a new and welcome departure. Now the Minister has informed us that a further review was successfully completed in June of last year.  In addition, Social Fund assistance became available for certain job-creation measures <Col N="456" /> for young people under 25 years and this provision has operated since 1979. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of the Community in this respect and the important results the Minister spoke of, all of these efforts are proving to be totally inadequate to cope with the problem.  I would like some detailed figures on the basis of results and proposals, as well as the general figures we were given.  I would also like details on how this country is benefiting through the education and exchange programmes of the EEC and the European Youth Forum.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Common Fisheries Policy, the outcome of the Fisheries Council early this year is encouraging, particularly the increase of 5,300 tonnes of western stock mackerel over our 1983 quota and the optimism, which we hope is justified, regarding the market situation in herring.  There has been a spectacular growth in the Irish fishing industry which had started before our accession to the EEC, but our achievements in this regard are still nowhere near the level we are entitled to because of our strategic geographic location.  The fisheries question has been dominated by the controversies over national fishing limits and quotas.  I would like information on the grants that have been paid for the construction and modernisation of trawlers and for mariculture and fish farming projects, including fish farming plants.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his address that the Community has lost its way over the past four years.  This is something which concerns us all.  It is somewhat heartening to hear the Minister say that he believes this is only temporary.  I do not wish to go into great detail on the Common Agricultural Policy, because this has been debated extensively by people who are more familiar with it than I.  The Minister pointed out that Community consumption of milk and milk products is estimated at just over 80 million tonnes while production last year was 113 million tonnes.  Of course this creates very serious problems.  In these circumstances how can we justify the importation into the Community of New Zealand butter when the market is so over-supplied, or the importation of cereal substitutes <Col N="457" /> when Community cereals have to be off-loaded on third country markets?  The Government must take a very firm stand on the crisis looming for Irish agriculture, as it is vital that they do so.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have contributed to the discussion on the super-levy on milk production, so I do not propose to go into it in any great detail.  It would be a tragedy for this country if a satisfactory solution is not reached.  The Minister stated that our demand is for an exemption from the four-year duration of the levy.  He stated that milk in Ireland is responsible for about 9 per cent of our GNP.  He felt that our partners have shown considerable understanding and appreciation for the particular circumstances of our case. However, having read reports in today's newspapers I would put a question mark against this optimism.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said we need in particular to give the Community financial security to plan ahead.  He welcomed the increase in VAT, the doubling of the VAT ceiling of 1 per cent.  This is something with which we would all agree.  He said in rather figurative language &mdash; and I suppose we could all agree with him although we would like to have it spelt out in some great detail &mdash; that we require above all to take a giant qualitative step forward and that our achievements must be built on and not rested upon.  He referred to a new departure and the important continuing work on a range of possible new Community policies and that we must successfully match our competitors in the vital growth area of modem economics, research and development, bio-technology and telecommunications, if we are to create new job opportunities in the Community for the future.</P>
    <P>The only problem I see here and of course I agree with keeping abreast of technology and developments, is that all of these in the past, in my view, resulted in reducing employment.  The Minister stated that we will give our support to the development of other new policies which can help to create jobs.  Of course, we all agree with this and feel that job creation is vital.  We all welcome the prospect of EEC enlargement, and it is pleasing to <Col N="458" /> note the progress made in the accession negotiations with both Spain and Portugal in 1983.  It is also gratifying to note that there is a possibility of concluding the negotiations by September of this year.  I suppose we should also feel somewhat saddened at Greenland's withdrawing from the Community, because in some degree it was a loss and shows a defeat in some ways.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Arab-Israeli situation, we would all agree with the Minister in his expressions.  We are glad that the European Council statement expressed concern at the lack of progress towards a peace settlement in that area.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Title>Local Authority Financing: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann deplores the inadequate financing of local authorities for the financial year 1984 with the derisory increase for rates support grants of 0.8% over 1983 which will lead to further unemployment and a deterioration in services, and calls on the Government to take immediate action to rectify their position.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  It is regrettable that as a result of a decision by his predecessor in bringing in the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1983 the present Minister has now inherited an appalling situation with regard to the financing of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil opposed that measure at that time and we pointed out the financial implications it would have on local authorities throughout the country. Most of the Senators in this House who are members of county councils know the financial plight we are in.  We have 27 county councils and two borough councils and since their establishment, and indeed since 1902 when the county councils received statutory powers, never were they in such a financial plight.  Most people who want to criticise the situation <Col N="459" /> today will say that it is a result of the removal of domestic rates in 1978.  I do not hold that view.  Most of the people on the other side of the House &mdash; especially on the Fine Gael benches &mdash; will not hold that view either, because prior to the abolition of rates on domestic dwellings the previous Government had made a move to abolish 25 per cent of the rates on domestic dwellings.  Therefore, it is unfair to say that the situation arose as a result of the removal of domestic rates.</P>
    <P>The real crunch came last year when we decided to enact the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 1983, which gave power to the manager to increase charges and took away from the Minister the commitment he had in the 1978 Act.  As we head into the 1984 financial year there can be little doubt that the system of local government financing is in chaos.  Many local authorities find themselves in a position of virtual insolvency.  This situation has not developed overnight but is possibly the product of inadequate financing over years.  The chronic under-financing and under-funding of a range of sources include the low level of recoupment grants, the high level of statutory repayments, the disappearance of the agricultural rate &mdash; which affects some counties more than others, depending on the valuations &mdash; and the high level in some areas of non-payment of charges for services.  Any one of these factors in itself presents local authorities with cash and finance problems and the combined effect of these factors is proving nothing short of disastrous.  Clearly this situation cannot be allowed to deteriorate any further. Since 1978 the level of poundage increases, sanctioned by a variety of Ministers for the Environment, has meant a severe drop in real terms in the incomes of local authorities from that source. Rate increases, compared with inflation, left a considerable gap to be made up. From 1978 to 1982 we had a poundage rate increase of about 58 per cent, compared with 74.4 per cent inflation and this left a shortfall to local authorities during that period.  Even with that reduction they were able to tick over, but it is clear <Col N="460" /> that there has been a substantial drop in real terms in their income from this source.  The powers of the Minister in this area have greatly undermined what little autonomy existed prior to their introduction.</P>
    <P>The burden of statutory payments from local authorities has considerably excerbated the financial problems brought on by funding cutbacks in other areas.  In 1983, for example, £12 million was paid towards supplementary welfare for a scheme over which local authorities had no control whatever.  You get your demand from the health board in the region that governs your council and just pay and get no other detailed account of where or how that money has been spent. That was a departure from the old system whereby health came under your rate consideration for rates estimates.  The local authority no longer have any say in what is demanded from the health boards.  The same applies in connection with the Office of Public Works and this in my county and in most western counties where some arterial drainage works have been carried out is a very large commitment in the statutory requirement each year by the Office of Public Works. In Mayo alone, we have a demand for over £900,000 which is, to say the least, very considerable.</P>
    <P>In such things as malicious damages, local authorities had to fund this commitment last year to the tune of £15 million, something that should not be under the financing of local authorities.  Clearly an alternative method of local authority financing must be devised which will rationalise the payment of statutory charges and remove the punitive burden of costs of, as I mentioned, malicious claims injuries.  The consequences of the successful challenge to the constitutionality of sections of the 1852 Valuation Act must be tackled.</P>
    <P>An adequate and fair system of valuation on agricultural land must be quickly devised.  Since the abolition of domestic rates in 1978 the tax base of the local authority has been precariously narrowed and today it is to all intents and purposes non-existent.  Such total dependence on central Government <Col N="461" /> funding, particularly given the level of departmental control, is an attack on the very roots of democracy itself.  While local authorities in some instances welcome in principle the discretionary power to levy charges in some areas, the financial implications of these charges are less than satisfactory.  The use of charges to make up for the recoupment shortfalls from the Department and as an attempt merely to maintain the level of existing services means that charges are seen by many citizens as simply an added burden of taxation from which no benefits will accrue.  The unpopularity resulting from such a perception rebounds directly on the local authority rather than on the causes and source of the original revenue shortfall.  Despite such charges the critical financial position means that local authorities will carry a debt of over £60 million into the current financial year. That debt is recurring in addition to the debt that will be piled on in this current year, which will be greatly increased as a result of the severe lack of finances in this year.</P>
    <P>Considering the 1984 estimates for all local authorities one is confronted with the full effects of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983 which removes the statutory requirement on the Minister for the Environment to provide annual grants to each local authority equal to the amount they would have received had rates on dwelling houses and agricultural land continued to be levied.  The new legislation empowers the Minister to allocate a nominal sum in lieu of rates and he has taken advantage of his new powers to limit this year's grant increase to 0.8 per cent despite inflation projected at 9 per cent or maybe 10 per cent in 1984.  This decision contrasts with the Government's decision to allow an 8 per cent increase in current Estimates for Government Departments, thus protecting central Government funding at the expense of local government.</P>
    <P>The 1983 Act also empowers county managers to levy charges for council services and it is clear that the Government intend that their cutback in financial support for local authorities will be made up by dramatic increases in local <Col N="462" /> service charges and in all probability by seriously detrimental increases in rates on commercial premises without any consequent easing of the direct and indirect taxation burden already imposed by the Exchequer.  The Fianna Fáil Party did not support the 1983 Act and opposed it here in the Seanad as in the Dáil because it enabled service charges to be introduced to replace grants in lieu of rates rather than to supplement the existing sources of local authority revenue.  We also opposed the 1983 Act because it gave the Minister rather than the elected councillors the power to bring in new service charges.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are very concerned at this attack on local democracy and our councillors should highlight the detrimental effect of the 1983 Act so that the public can understand the position fully.  Local authority members are best qualified to decide finally what is best for their own area, drawing on their great experience and knowledge of local circumstances. Fianna Fáil recognise the urgent need for a new structure and method of financing of local authorities, and completely reject the 1983 Act as being inadequate and destructive to local democracy.</P>
    <P>I am sure that if I deal with County Mayo nobody will say that I am being parochial.  I have been a member of the county council there for at least 29 years. I have seen their financial estimates in that time and I can safely say here that this year's estimate is the worst we have ever faced.  We have already had a meeting in committee when we tried to iron out our difficulties and meet the challenge that faces the people of our county. We have failed to reach any reasonable decision that would accommodate the people for whom we administer.  Of two possible measures, one is to increase the rate, which is £27 in the £ this year, and the manager's rate demand for 1984 is something in the region of £31.70.  That is a collossal increase but we must face it if we do not get some moneys from the Department of the Environment.  There is a suggestion that water rates will go up from £45 to £60 and refuse collection charge from £10 to £15 and then all our service charges will be increased.  We lose <Col N="463" /> something in the region of £170,000 each year in rates on agricultural land as a result of a court decision.</P>
    <P>Our roads are in a terrible condition and not getting the attention they require.  The result will be, unfortunately, that the road workers will be laid off as a result of the Minister's decision &mdash; which will be our decision in the final analysis &mdash; but the administrative or engineering staff cannot be touched. Regardless of how services are reduced, because of their terms of appointment we cannot reduce the number on the administrative or engineering side.  The only people we can reach for are the poor unfortunate road workers, thus adding to the number on the unemployment register, immediately and putting it soaring within the county, and indeed it is fairly high at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is discrimination in that a percentage of commercial ratepayers and business people are caught with the increase in rates on the one hand and the increase of the service charges on the other, and I think they will no longer be able to meet the demand.  As a result of the charges we introduced we had conditioned the people to a change from getting free services to paying for services.  They had accepted that fairly well, although maybe reluctantly at the outset.  It is surprising how after a year or two paying service charges they can become resigned to paying, but they will not be resigned to this drastic increase which we will have to make this year in order to provide the services to the county that they demand.</P>
    <P>Finally, I call on the Minister to extend the statutory period within which county councils are allowed to strike a rate.  The 21-day statutory period means that once one starts on one's estimates they must be completed within 21 days.  I call on the Minister to extend that period to allow county councils to negotiate with him as most councils are doing at the moment. I understand that some councils have already met, and most councils are in the process of meeting, either the Minister for the Environment or the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment <Col N="464" /> during this week and the coming weeks.  It behoves the Minister to give county councils an extension of time because they have yet only some indications of the amounts of grants that will be available to them.  We in County Mayo have got the road grant, we have a £100,000 reduction in the LIS and the highest LIS county in Ireland.  Our housing construction and sanitary services grants have not been indicated to us, and I understand we are to lose £238,000 that we had last year in environmental grants. It behoves the Minister to tell the people in each local authority what grants are being made available and what finances he is going to allocate to them.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, most of the Members here are members of local authorities.  We are not bringing up this for any political reason.  The General Council of County Councils, orientated by the Labour and Fine Gael superior numbers, have taken a unanimous decision to meet the Minister on this problem of local authority financing. They met the Minister and they are not happy with the result of that meeting, but they will, I understand, meet him again in a very short time with a view to getting better results.  They have unanimously decided that a crisis exists in local authority financing.  Some restructuring will have to come about this year or next year. We have heard about local government restructuring, and I ask the Minister when he intends to bring about local government reform and local government finance restructure.  They are the main problems facing local government at the moment.</P>
    <P>Finally, we are demanding the removal of the statutory demands to local authorities, namely the OPW statutory demands, the ACOT statutory demands, the health boards, the courthouses and malicious damages charges.  These are the greatest burden of expenditure we have and there is no recoupment whatever in respect of them, so I would suggest to the Minister that if we got rid of the statutory demands we would be in a position to run our own business in a businesslike fashion and give the people <Col N="465" /> the services which they are prepared to pay for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to second this motion and I sincerely hope that the Minister will not alone take note but will take action on many of the matters and issues raised here tonight before this debate is concluded. I can anticipate some of the replies from the Government benches. We tabled this motion in the full knowledge and firm belief that there is a sense of social deprivation in this country today that was never witnessed or had never existed before.  I am calling on this Government to take whatever action is necessary, to take whatever steps are necessary, to alleviate many of the problems and many of the hardships that we know only too well exist at present and have been created at Government level. County councils and corporations have served the needs of the local community well down through the years.  We must ask ourselves what has happened, not alone to the power of the county councils but also to the spirit within that particular community in that area which enabled boreens to be tarred, lanes tarred, roads tarred, employment created and generated. The environment was improved.  A major contribution was made at that level to the development of this country.  We must ask ourselves what is to be the end result if the situation is allowed to continue. It is a situation into which we are, from a local authority member point of view, being pushed by the present administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to many matters which are of great concer to myself and to every member of every county council, to the members of the corporations and to Members of this House.  The present financial difficulties of the county councils, corporations etc. have been created at national level.  The resolution of these problems must come at Government level.  The costing of the local taxation base and progressive reduction in the rate support grant which has been mentioned by Senator O'Toole can cause and are causing severe financial problems for every local authority.  This year, as has been mentioned by Senator O'Toole, <Col N="466" /> the increase in rate support grant is only 0.8 per cent.  We must recognise the fact that inflation is estimated at 10 per cent, hoping for the best.  The recent Supreme Court decision that rates on land are unconstitutional has resulted in a very severe loss of revenue to county councils. My own county council in County Meath has lost £1.4 million.  Yet the Government has not taken any cognisance of the serious financial problems facing the county councils as a result of this decision, except to say: &ldquo;Make it up yourselves, apply local charges&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The introduction of local charges, in the present manner, is most unsatisfactory and cannot be regarded as a resolution of the serious financial problems of local authorities.  A variety of local charges has been suggested and is in operation.  This can only lead to administrative difficulties.  We should all recognise that fact.  It is also very doubtful if, because of the resentment which they create, they can have a worth while and lasting impact on the local financial base. That is a fact we must all take cognisance of.  In any event, they can only make a very small contribution to the overall finances of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to local government reform.  It is imperative that the Government formulate proposals for the reform of local government.  A lot has been said in this Chamber during a recent debate concerning local government reform.  In fact the local elections were postponed because local government reform was being implemented.  Yet, has any Member of this or the other House seen one scrap of paper or one sentence produced in relation to local government reform?  I believe &mdash; and I will probably be proved right &mdash; that to introduce local government reform, to implement it so as to meet the needs of the local communities and the needs of the country, would take many years.  We will have a local government election before proper local government reform will or can be implemented.  I am sure the Minister must recognise this fact.  If we are to look at the structures as they exist at present and as we would like to see them exist and to function, a lot of research is <Col N="467" /> needed and a lot of identification would have to be made with other countries where the system is in operation.  Many years will have passed and many members of local authorities will have changed before that can be implemented.</P>
    <P>What is happening is that under pretext of the implementation of local government reform county councils and corporations are being left with a shortfall.  The gun is being put to the head of the local authority members to implement programmes and execute charges so that by the time local government reform does come in the Exchequer will apparently be relieved of its responsibility to the local community.  That is my firm belief and it seems to be the way it is heading.</P>
    <P>I believe that the reform itself would alleviate some of the financial problems if the extraneous services to which Senator O'Toole referred &mdash; and I also mentioned courthouses &mdash; which are at present the responsibility of local authorities were transferred to central Government Departments.  If the State demands &mdash; I am again talking about what Senator O'Toole has mentioned &mdash; in respect of the Office of Public Works, health boards, vocational education committees &mdash; were removed from local authorities the position would be changed, but the fact that these charges are still levied on county councils is indicative of the lack of Government action.  I call on the Government to take appropriate action to carry out local government reform and to provide a proper method of financing local authorities.  The financial problem created by Government decision, or lack of decision in my honest opinion, has detracted from the tremendous progress which the local authorities have made down through the years.  I think we would all agree that in difficult times the councils and the local authorities have performed creditably and I have no doubt they will continue to do so if proper decisions are made at Government level.</P>
    <P>If you go back to the root of the problems that exist today, to revert to what I said earlier about the sense of deprivation that exists in this country, when rates were removed from private dwellings, <Col N="468" /> it started in the late 1966-67 period &mdash; guarantees were given at that time that local authorities would be financed from central Government funds.  This would be done on a par with the amount of capital that would have been generated from the old rates system under the PLV rates collection which was administered by the local authority.  At the same time the Government of the day, my own party, decided that VAT &mdash; and nobody could tell me today what the rate was in 1977: I think it was about 5 per cent &mdash; would be increased to provide the extra capital allocations for the local authorities. The VAT rates were increased and indeed for a few years the estimated rate that would have been generated from the system that had been abolished, was met from central Government funds.  PRSI rates also increased.  In each ensuing budget we had the usual increases on duty on goods up to the present budget when VAT was even put on clothes.</P>
    <P>Take all the increases and take the problems facing many of our young people today, many of them unemployed, many of them not sure if their jobs will last a week, a month or a year, many of them with mortgage repayments to meet, many of them having got married and starting to build up a household and to rear a family and assumed all sorts of commitments, and in spite of all the taxation that has been imposed, this Government sees as the solution to the problems the imposition of extra charges for refuse collection and water supply.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that I have only a few minutes left because there is another problem that we need to look at very seriously. The people in my own county who are paying rates at the moment are the family businesses who are giving employment, who are paying VAT and PRSI, the people who are keeping the show going. The number of commercial ratepayers in my own county is 1,000.  They are asked to generate a sum of £900,000 this year, pay their water rates as well and meet all their demands.  This is one area that is over-burdened.  To impose more charges on these people who are carrying the can and supporting the community to such a degree, I think, is most unfair.  I would <Col N="469" /> ask the Minister to look into that particular sector and see can we do something. I feel that people who are paying commercial rates should be exempt from water rates or something like that.  We asked to have a meeting with the Minister in our own county and the Fine Gael and Labour councillors concerned would not agree to Meath County Council coming up to meet the Minister until after we had struck the rate.  We were out-voted on it. By coming up to meet the Minister after we had struck the rate the service charges have been approved by the county council and every thing is rosy.</P>

      <P>It gives me considerable pleasure to move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes the level of Government support for local authority finances as reflected in the increase of 10.3 per cent in the aggregate of grants and subsidies being provided for 1984 and the fact that almost two-thirds of all local authority spending on current account is provided, or recouped, from the Exchequer; and that taking account of these facts and of the extended powers which have been conferred on local authorities to raise revenue from local sources, any adverse effects of the current economic difficulties on local authority services and employment in 1984 will be minimised.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I want to speak just for a few minutes on a few boring figures.  For any of you who would like to remain, I am sure I will be able to entertain you with some more lighthearted stuff at a later time.  The first thing we should do is look at the position that this Government had to consider when it arrived in power, and the revised Estimates for the Public Service for 1983 contain a wealth of information, because they contain not only the changes made by this Government but also uniquely in considerable detail the changes which were made by the previous Government.  The fact is that with regard to the small portion of <Col N="470" /> local government finance which is referred to in the 0.8 per cent increase the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government anticipated that the amount that they would give to local authorities in 1983, had they returned to power, was £138 million.  That is a very large sum of money.  Coincidentally, it was precisely the same as had been given to them in 1982.</P>
    <P>That shows that an authoritative decision had been taken to change the law in that regard because estimates are normally produced on the basis of the continuation of existing policy.  Policy decisions had been taken by Fianna Fáil.  This is recited in the Government's explanation which is contained in the budget 1983 document presented to Dáil Éireann by the Minister for Finance on 9 February 1983.  It is stated on page 51 under the heading of the Environment Vote that the previous administration had budgeted for a shortfall in local authority finances to the extent of £77 million to be financed by the introduction by the local authorities of new charges, increases in existing charges and increases in rates on industrial and commercial property to yield £58.16 million.  That was the declared intention of the Fianna Fáil Party and I maintain that it is still their policy at national level but their local councillors throughout the country like to pretend, in talking to the people that they think they represent, that that is not their policy at all.  It is, in fact, their policy to have local charges and bigger charges than the local charges which we found necessary to impose upon the people.</P>
    <P>I have it on no other authority than the present leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in January 1984, what his policy is in regard to public expenditure.  In an interview given to <i>Success</i> magazine, page 20, January 1984, the following is Deputy Haughey's view.  Referring to the present Government he said:</P>
    <P>We are reducing capital expenditure, but not cutting current expenditure. That is the change which has to take place.  We have to curtail current expenditure to make more resources available for capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> And you would do that?</P>
    <P>Yes.</P>
    <P>Cutting current expenditure is very difficult politically?</P>
    <P>It is.  Cutting current expenditure is very difficult but it has to be done.  The emphasis has to be changed.  More resources have to be made available for capital expenditure because investment today means jobs tomorrow.</P>

      <P>The official policy of the Fianna Fáil Party is to cut expenditure more than this Government have done. I would not criticise them for having that policy.  What I would criticise them for is at national level putting forward one point of view and at local level trying to fool the people by putting forward a different point of view.  Those are the present antics of the Fianna Fáil Party and of Fianna Fáil councillors up and down this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are in favour of cutting expenditure <i>in toto.</i>  One should take note that they are not in favour of maintaining expenditure.  They are in favour of cutting expenditure below the present level.  They are also in favour of local charges because they planned to introduce them.  That is only right but it should be done within reason. Remember you are also in favour of cutting local expenditure.  How can you do that, reduce the amount of money that is being spent on various things, and at the same time not have local charges?  Of course, this can be done: it can be done if the policy of this Government is changed in one of the following ways: if in regard to the local authority housing <Col N="472" /> subsidy, instead of giving an increase of 25 per cent, you give a smaller increase; with regard to private housing grants, instead of giving, as this Government have been doing, an increase of 25 per cent to local authorities, you give nothing. In respect of water and sewerage, instead of an increase of 30 per cent give no increase at all.  You can do that.  With regard to group water schemes, instead of increasing expenditure by 50 per cent, no increase need be given.  Then there will be no local charges but there will be no group water schemes either.  With regard to water supply schemes in general, you need not give an increase of 20 per cent, which this Government have decided on.  You can keep local charges static and probably even reduce them, but you can only do so by reducing these essential elements of our local government structure.  Nobody has suggested to me any way in which they can do anything else.</P>
      <P>We have the grotesque situation where the Fianna Fáil Party at national level is putting forward a policy of cutting current expenditure.  It means cutting the grants which local authorities are being given under the various headings.  That is the Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, would it be fair to ask Senator O'Leary, if his Government have given all those increases, could he explain to us about a cut in capital expenditure of approximately £253 million in the present budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, most of what I am talking about is not capital but current expenditure.  What the Fianna Fáil Party are trying to do is create a two-tier policy structure where in order to impress the bankers and the people who write in <i>The Irish Times</i>, they are putting forward a policy of financial rectitude at national level.  At local level they are fighting tooth and nail in exactly the opposite direction.  Deputations are coming from all sides of the country descending on Ministers to persuade them to do precisely the opposite to what the Fianna Fáil Party policy is.  That is the reality of <Col N="473" /> what is going on.  It is about time we had a little realism and appreciation for the difficult financial situation in which this Government find themselves and in which any other Government which would replace us would find themselves. We cannot have our cake and eat it.</P>
      <P>The only point I would concede in the excellent contribution of Senator O'Toole is his appeal on the statutory demands.  Let us get this straight.  To remove the statutory demands, for example, for health and the rates on courthouses, it should mean, if we are serious about it, a further substantial cut in the rates support grant, in the grant in lieu of rates and a further substantial cut in the agricultural rate.  Otherwise, it is only a licence to increase expenditure.  I am in favour of taking these things away from the local authorities.  They should not be involved in them.  The local business people should not be expected to pay part of these national charges through their business rates.  I agree with and accept that.  We will then have to accept that the whole range of support which local authorities get, and which is based on the inclusion of these items, would have to be readjusted to reduce the amount to what it would be if they were excluded.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, one cannot say that one is in favour of getting rid of these statutory demands and expect the Government to come up at the end of the day with the same support in lieu of rates. This is not realistic.  While I would concede that the tidying up of local government is a good thing, we must be realistic enough to realise when that occurs the benefit of that has to go, unless we want to double tax the people back to the business community in the area which was referred to by Senator Lynch or back to the general body of rates by transferring these important items from a local taxation basis to a national taxation basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concentration by Fianna Fáil on the 0.8 per cent increase in the grant in lieu of rates does not give proper or due importance to the very many other areas increase which have taken place during this year.  This is only one small method by which local authorities are financed. <Col N="474" /> As I explained, the local authority housing subsidy has increased by 25 per cent and the water supply and sewerage schemes by 30 per cent.  This is part of the overall picture.  What local authority have made serious attempts to minimise the increase in the level of current expenditure over the last few years?  Both parties should do this in common.  We have not been very successful at national level in doing it, but local authorities have been even less successful.</P>
    <P>Another point on which I agree with Senator O'Toole is on the cuts which have had to be made over the last few years and which will need to be made in years to come.  These cannot just be concentrated on those who are making and repairing the roads, but must be spread across the spectrum.  There will need to be better value for money in the services being provided by local authorities.  It will then be seen that the amount of money which the Government are providing under the various headings is, indeed, very substantial.  That in respect of the grant for relief on rates is now £164,700,000.</P>

      <P>The amount which the local authorities are receiving under the local environment heading is very substantial. I accept that if a local authority are not development minded and not drawing on the resources of the Department of the Environment because of the manner in which the grants are being administered at present, they may not be getting their fair share.  The promoting within local authorities of constructive schemes for the development of the sanitary services and road network facilities will be met by a positive response on the part of the Department of the Environment. For that reason, the motion before us is too narrow in that it confines their consideration to one small aspect of financing.  For that reason, I commend the amendment to the House as reflecting more the level of general support which the Government have given in the past <Col N="475" /> and are continuing to give local authorities throughout the country.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I am very glad of this opportunity of speaking here on local authority financing and on the Government's position in regard to the financial provision for the current year. Far from feeling in any way defensive on this subject, the position is that the Government have taken radical action to retrieve local authority finances from the brink.  The financial provision for local authorities this year is as much as can be done in the current economic conditions. It is, moreover, a fair and reasonable provision and is calculated to enable service and employment to be maintained as closely as possible to the 1983 levels.  I want also to explain that I am looking very urgently and very fully at the whole system of local authority financing to see how we can modify it so as to get rid of the worst features, including the inordinate dependence on central financing and the related diminution in local independence and discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, it is appropriate, I think, to remind ourselves of the importance of the part which local authorities have come to play in the national life of the country.  Not alone does the Government of the day rely on them to give effect to important national policies in such key areas as housing, roads development, provision of services and infrastructure and in matters such as planning and environmental protection, but the local communities, too, rely on them to create wealth and to provide jobs.  Because of the scale of their responsibilities and the way in which they have developed in recent years, they have now become very important local centres of economic and social activity.  Perhaps the best indicator of their key economic and social role is the fact that in 1983 they spent, between current and capital spending, about £1.4 billion and provided employment for about 35,000 people.  It is only natural, <Col N="476" /> therefore, that there should be keen political and public interest in their affairs and in their wellbeing.</P>
    <P>In times of economic difficulty such as those we are experiencing at the moment, it is inevitable that problems will be experienced in maintaining services and employment.  Local authorities are no different from any other institutions in the public sector in this regard &mdash; all are being asked to do their share in the effort to bring the public finances under control. Where the local authorities are different, however, is in that the problems which the general economic situation has created for them have been compounded by other difficulties which have emerged over the past few years.</P>
    <P>Nobody will deny that the burden of domestic rates was regarded as a severe one on many families and that the decision to abolish them was, indeed, a popular one.  But, although it was not acknowledged by the Government of the time, this step was to deal a major blow to the financial state of local authorities &mdash; one from which they have not recovered &mdash; and to their vitality as local democratic bodies.</P>
    <P>For all the problems about rates &mdash; and there were considerable problems &mdash; the fact is that domestic rates had come to be recognised and accepted as one of the mainstays of local authority financing.  To knock away this prop without providing any adequate substitute system was a recipe for financial trouble, and so it has proved to be.  The decline of local authority finances on current account from a position of credit to a situation of substantial deficit is clearly traceable to the decision of 1978.  The acceleration in the dependence of local authorities on Exchequer financing &mdash; to which I shall come back &mdash; is also traceable to those decisions.</P>
    <P>The inordinate dependence on central financing, in turn, threatens the sense of responsibility, the sense of discretion and the sense of accountability at local level. These are not trends that are in the best interests of a healthy and effective system of local democracy.  It was in connection with the abolition of domestic rates in 1978, also, that the decision was made <Col N="477" />&mdash; which I am glad to say this Government has reversed &mdash; to remove the discretion of local councils to determine the level of their rates.  Instead, we had the spectacle of the Minister deciding for them each year the level to which rates had to be limited, leaving the council with no option but to put up with it and to tailor their decisions and what they could do for the local community accordingly.</P>
    <P>Rates were the discretionary source of local authority revenue which they used to effectively perform their functions and meet their commitments.  With the loss of this discretionary power of revenue and the rate poundage limits imposed by the Minister, local authorities were no longer able to raise funds as they had always done, but the demands for more and better services continued.  Naturally, the authorities wished to maintain services and the infrastructure in which they had invested so much and, consequently, available credits were quickly used up and deficit financing and certain cut-backs became inevitable.  I think it is well to remind ourselves at this stage of the background to which I have referred and that a heavy price has been paid by local authorities and by the public for whatever political gain was secured by the abolition of rates in 1978.</P>
    <P>Other factors have aggravated the position.  Local authorities were already beginning to feel the strain when the farmers challenged the constitutionality of rates on land.  While the Supreme Court, in January of this year, ruled in favour of the farmers, this decision itself did not present immediate problems for local authorities because rates on land had already been relieved in full with effect from 1983.  But some farmers, in anticipation of a favourable outcome to the court challenge, had refused to pay rates in 1981 and 1982 and, as a consequence of this action, local authorities lost over £20 million in rate arrears over those two years.  This was money which the authorities had budgeted to get and which they spent in the normal way.  The loss was, consequently, very real and very severe.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, been experiencing a very severe recession.  This has meant <Col N="478" /> that there has been very severe pressure on public finances generally and, of course, finance for local authorities did not escape.  In this situation, it was found impossible to maintain full Exchequer recoupment to local authorities in respect of the domestic rate reliefs granted to householders and in 1982 there was a shortfall of £10.7 million in the Exchequer recoupment.</P>
    <P>This, then, was the position which we found when the present Government took office.  Furthermore, the 1983 Estimates which our predecessors had prepared provided for no increase in the domestic grant over the reduced amount which was paid in 1982, while the provision for the grant in lieu of rates on land would have financed only a standstill in rates poundages.  This would have spelt disaster for the local authorities and for the provision of local services and, despite the serious state of the national finances generally, we felt we had to take steps to avert that situation.</P>
    <P>The first step which we took was to allocate a special additional £31.5 million to the rate support grants.  This enabled us to provide for full recoupment of rates, including an increase of about 5 per cent over the 1982 rate poundage level.  This was an immense improvement for local authorities, both immediately and in terms of the measure of the commitment of this Government to the local government system.</P>
    <P>We also looked at the question of the rate poundage limitation which had operated since 1978 and we came to the conclusion that this practice, while basically designed to protect the State from unreasonable demands was, in fact, a counter productive, inappropriate device. What was happening in practice was that local authorities wee being prevented from raising revenue from local rate sources by the State imposed limitation and, consequently, the demand for State grants was being pushed up.  This situation existed because of the link established by the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978 between the amount of the rates reliefs given by a local authority and the amount of the State recoupment.  So we decided to <Col N="479" /> break this link and to remove the obligation to give full recoupment of rates reliefs.  This left the way open to release the stranglehold of the State on rate poundage levels and, in fact, no rate poundage limit was imposed for 1983 &mdash; or, indeed, for 1984.  We were, of course, criticised in certain quarters for the removal of the obligation to give full domestic rates recoupment, but this was essential if we were to relax control of rate poundages and, as I have said, full recoupment had already been dropped in practice.</P>
    <P>This relaxation of the rate poundage controls was the first step in an effort to restore to local authorities some of the independence which they previously enjoyed.  We took another significant step in this direction when we gave to the local authorities greatly increased powers to charge for the services which they provide. I know that local authorities were not in a position to reap the full benefit of these additional powers in 1983 for reasons which I shall go into later, but I am confident that they will make full use of them in 1984.  Although charges of this type will never constitute a major source of revenue for local authorities, they constitute a necessary and significant source of additional discretionary revenue which can be called on to finance various projects.  I know that the additional powers were welcomed by most people associated with local authorities for this reason.</P>
    <P>This, then, was the financial package which we gave to the local authorities in 1983 and I am glad to say that they responded positively.  They adopted realistic increases in industrial and commercial rates; they applied their new charging powers, although the full benefits have not yet been seen; they looked at their various existing charges and reviewed them as appropriate; they continued to seek better and more efficient ways of doing things, and the net result was that they managed to get their finances on to a better basis than had been possible for a number of years.</P>
    <P>And what of the proposals for 1984?  I should like at this point to dispel a few <Col N="480" /> misconceptions which have been expressed about the Government's treatment of local authorities in the 1984 Estimates.  The story is being put about that the Government are looking after services and employment in Government Departments through an overall increase of 8 per cent in the Public Service Estimates but that grants to local authorities are going up by only 0.8 per cent.  This is certainly not the case.  In my own Department, for example, staff numbers are now down by 15 per cent on what they were in 1981 through the operation of the embargo.  There is no corresponding embargo in local authorities, although I would expect that local authorities should look seriously at vacant posts, to see if savings can be achieved.</P>
    <P>In so far as grants to local authorities are concerned, Senators may wish to know that Government grants and subsidies to local authorites will this year amount to £663.311 million, an increase of £52 million, or 10.3 per cent on 1983. The capital allocations will be up by £12.5 million, between voted provisions and borrowing authorisation, in spite of the curtailments arising from the need to restore overall State borrowing to more manageable proportions.  In so far as the rate support grants are concerned, we have managed not alone to maintain the additional £31.5 million which we provided in 1983, but we have added a supplement of £2.27 million.  This brings the total of the rate of support grants to almost £280 million, a massive contribution by any standards.</P>
    <P>If we are going to talk about the level of grant provision, therefore, we should look at the total picture.  We should take account of the major financial rescue effected by this Government last year, without which there would have been major losses in services and employment, and relate this year's provisions with last year's.  We should in fairness be prepared to look at the total subventions and to acknowledge, as I have shown, that the total has been increased to a degree that reflects well on the Government's commitment in this area in the present very difficult times.</P>
    <P>I believe that these provisions, combined <Col N="481" /> with greater competitiveness in tendering for local authority contracts, will enable the authorities to maintain the level of employment and services at or close to existing levels in the short term.  Councils must be willing to make reasonable use of the extended powers which they have been given to raise revenue locally and they must be diligent in collecting funds due to them.  I have no wish to see local rates or charges raised to excessive levels, but there has to be some correlation between the demand for local services and the readiness to finance them from local sources.  A further factor working in favour of the local authority position is the fact that there is at present keen tendering for their contracts.</P>
    <P>There must also be closer attention than ever, in the present climate, to ensuring that the best possible return is secured for local authority expenditure in terms of employment and output.  This requires programmes at local authority level for eliminating waste and for promoting cost effective procedures in all areas of their operations.  I know that a lot of economising has been going on, but all local authorities must make further efforts to maintain services and employment within the constraints of the restricted budgets within which they have to operate.  This is a considerable challenge, but I have no doubt that local authorities will respond to it positively and successfully as they have done in the past.</P>
    <P>As I said a moment ago, local authorities were not in a position to reap the full benefit of their additional charging powers in 1983.  There were a number of reasons for this.  Firstly, the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, the instrument which contained the additional powers, did not come into effect until 12 July last, more than half way through the year, and then there was a problem about preparing and issuing demands because of industrial action by local authority staff.  This means that the issue of demands was delayed for a very long time and, in some areas, demands were not actually issued until well into November.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> In these circumstances, I am sure that Senators will agree that a collection of about one-third &mdash; we have not got all the returns in yet, but this is the trend so far in relation to new charges imposed for the first time in 1983 &mdash; is reasonable. In some areas, collections have been particularly heartening &mdash; in Cork city, for example, 65 per cent of the new charges have now been collected.  The position in regard to the existing charges, for example domestic water in the country council areas, has also been good, with collection levels well up to the standard of previous years.  In some cases collections have bordered on 100 per cent of the amounts provided in the Estimates. These indications give real grounds for optimism and I am hoping that a vigorous and sustained collection campaign in 1984 will yield good returns.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the question of charges, I would like to refer briefly to the objections which have come from various quarters to the payment of charges.  The principal argument which is used against charges is that the services were paid for through the rates and that the cost of the rates relief is now being paid for through direct and indirect taxes.  But, of course, the principle of services being paid for by those who have access to them has long been enshrined in local government law. There was provision for a separate water charge with which we are all familiar in non-urban areas, where the services were not available to all, and payment was expected where the service was available. This principle is equally valid in relation to urban areas.  There is no valid reason why a person who lives in a non-urban area and who does not have access to services such as water or refuse collection, should have to contribute towards the cost of providing these services for his urban neighbour.  The only fair system is to charge separately for those services which are not available to all.</P>
    <P>What I find more difficult to understand, and what I find disquieting, is the attitude of opposition to payment of charges which has been taken up by some politicians, and even by a political party represented in the Oireachtas.  Let me be clear about this.  I am not questioning the <Col N="483" /> right of any political figure to express his opposition to a Government measure of this kind and, indeed, a certain amount of political point-scoring is only to be expected in an area like this and does not bother us very much.</P>
    <P>What does bother us and, should I suggest, bother all who are interested in the welfare of the political process is a situation in which people who claim to be involved in that process are openly encouraging ordinary people to break the law by withholding payments which are legally due from them; who are openly professing their intentions, as some are recently doing, of themselves breaking the law by refusing to pay charges due to their own local authority.  I can only appeal to these people to look again at their positions and their responsibilities and to consider whether they are being true to their role as public representatives.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that many people are going to be taken in by these tactics, or that they will have much influence at the end of the day on the local authority finances.  The greater danger lies in the damage that can be done to the standing of representative local government itself if political practitioners feel free to break laws and to encourage others to break laws duly enacted and being duly applied in the local government sector.  That, I believe, is a real danger and a real cause for concern.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of mischievous talk about charges being rates restored in another form.  Neither the form nor the amount of charges in any way matches up to what would be involved now for householders if domestic rating were to be restored on the old basis.  The rates on a typical semi-detached dwelling in the Dublin area would now be about £450 and local authority charges are nowhere in this league. Moreover, I do believe that most householders will accept that the charges are perfectly reasonable in relation to services such as water supply as compared, for example, with what they pay for other domestic services such as electricity, gas, television, telephones and so on.  I can, at the same time, fully apprecitate <Col N="484" /> that the initial reaction of many people to what is regarded as an additional impost is not one of welcome.  I think the system will settle down fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>To turn away for a moment from the revenue raising functions of local authorities, I would now like to mention one particular area of local authority expenditure which is the subject of much criticism and complaint.  It is the area of the statutory demands, as they are known. In many respects, statutory demands are the relics of former functions of local authorities which have now been taken over by other public bodies.  But although the functions have gone, the financial obligation remains.  The principal statutory demands are in respect of supplementary welfare allowances, arterial drainage and ACOT.  There are many other demands also, but these are the ones about which local authorities express the greater concern.</P>
    <P>Supplementary welfare allowances are paid by the health boards on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare.  But because they replaced a scheme of home assistance which the local authorities used to operate, the local authorities are obliged by law to contribute up to more than 40 per cent of the cost of the scheme plus the full cost of the administration of the scheme by the health boards.  Similarly, the local authorities' responsibility for arterial drainage was taken over by the Office of Public Works but they must still pay the full cost of the maintenance work carried out by the Office of Public Works.  The position with regard to ACOT is much the same as it is for most other demands, except that there is a limit to the amount of the ACOT demand.</P>
    <P>Local authorities argue, with some justification, that they have no control over the statutory demands and no say in the administration of the schemes to which they relate.  They are not consulted in advance about policy, or furnished with detailed accounts.  They have seen over recent years the demands, particularly in respect of the supplementary welfare allowances scheme and the arterial drainage, escalating at an alarming rate, while <Col N="485" /> their income has, in addition to being tightly curtailed by the rate poundage limits, suffered the loss of over £20 million of farmers' rate arrears.</P>
    <P>Another problem with statutory demands is, of course, that they do not fall evenly on every area.  The burden of supplementary welfare demands falls most severely on those counties which formerly had the best home assistance schemes, because of the peculiar arrangements which were built into the law at the time this scheme was introduced.  This has resulted in a disproportionate burden being imposed on counties which had good home assistance schemes while other counties, which had less generous schemes, are faring far better now.  Similarly with the arterial drainage demand. Naturally, drainage and maintenance are not equally spread over the country and some counties are badly hit.  Western counties come to mind as facing particularly severe demands because of the level of drainage activity.  It is unfortunate that, although land is improved through this drainage, there is no extra yield in taxes to the local authorities in response to their financial commitment.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the concern and difficulties these statutory demands and other extraneous services are causing for local authorities, and it is my aim to have them examined urgently in the context of the review of local government.</P>
    <P>Another area which is very much akin to the statutory demands is malicious injuries compensation.  Again, local authority involvement is a relic of bygone days when local authorities had a role in law enforcement and judicial affairs.  And although their liability is now limited to a maximum of the produce of a rate of 20 pence in the £ in any year, local authorities do incur non-recoupable expenses of considerable amounts in processing and defending claims.  It is this financial burden, arising from a function which has nothing to do with the normal role and functions of a local authority, which gives rise to frustration and annoyance, and I am also looking at this question of malicious injuries compensation in the context of the review of finances.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the review of local <Col N="486" /> finances, and I would now like to talk about it for a few moments.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken of the financial difficulties of local authorities and of the adverse effects which they are having on local democracy and on local government generally.  These problems stem directly from the abolition of domestic rates in 1978 and the assumption of a greater degree of central control over local financial affairs.  No new system was devised to replace the rates and the system has just stumbled along ever since, with local dependence on the Exchequer increasing year by year.  We have now reached a stage where almost two-thirds of the current spending of the local authorities is funded by the State, as compared with only 40 per cent in 1976.  This trend cannot be allowed to continue &mdash; it is unhealthy for the local authorities and unhealthy for the State, and so we must find a new and better way of financing local authorities.  The review is part of the search for this new and better system.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the review is to identify clearly and positively the problems which beset the finances of local authorities at present, to determine the source of these problems and to suggest solutions.  Any solution should provide a firm basis for adequate funding of the various local services and programmes, without undue dependence on the Exchequer; should involve an appropriate degree of local financial independence and discretion, and should ensure that all sectors of the community contribute their fair share. Most of us could, I suspect, make a reasonable stab at identifying the problems, but I am not at all sure that there would be too many takers for the job of producing realistic and workable solutions.</P>
    <P>But solutions will have to be found. From the point of view of local authorities, the present situation is one in which their freedom of action as elective local representative bodies is seriously restricted by the constraints of limited local revenue sources, by statutory demands and by their dependence on the Exchequer.  This situation can only continue to undermine the viability and independence of the local government <Col N="487" /> system, and cannot go on.  It is generally accepted that proper accountability in a democratic local government system requires that a reasonable portion of the resources spent by the local authorities in providing local services should be controlled by them.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Exchequer, the increasing cost of funding local authorities cannot continue, given the other demands which have to be accommodated from the same source.  The task is to devise a system which will reconcile the aim of the central Government for less participation in local financing and that of local authorities for greater financial discretion, with due regard for the overall national economic policy.</P>
    <P>The task is not an easy one.  It requires considerable analysis of all the available options, including the methods of financing in other countries.  It is necessary to apply as much expertise as possible to the problem, and I would welcome the contributions of people, particularly in local authorities, who have expressed concern on this matter previously.  I should also, perhaps, mention in this regard that the National Economic and Social Council are carrying out an independent review of local authority finance at present, and I hope to have the fruits of their labour available to me before making final decisions on new arrangements.</P>
    <P>I will close now, a Chathaoirligh, and I would like to thank you and the Members of this House for your attention and for giving me this opportunity to speak about this very important subject, to explain the Government's position and the action that has been taken to provide the fullest possible measure of support for local authorities under the current circumstances, as well as the intention to seek as a matter of urgency to devise a more appropriate overall system of local authority financing for the medium and longer terms.</P>
    <P>I should like to respond to Senator Doolin's request that the estimates of local authorities should be put back for some time until I can meet deputations. Estimates have to be prepared within the <Col N="488" /> prescribed time.  That is a statutory requirement which must be respected.  I am willing to see deputations at an early date but I have to say again, and I am quite clear in saying it, that I cannot hold out any prospect of extra funds being provided in the current year.  The local estimates process should, therefore, proceed in every local authority area.  I will certainly be available to meet local authorities and, if an immediate meeting is required, I will try to get the Minister of State to meet any local authority who requests it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for giving me the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment, and I should also like to thank the Minister for his attendance here.  My purpose in raising this matter is to add to the debate which is going on in public concerning the problems which have arisen concerning the proposed take-over of the Irish Civil Service Building Society by the Bank of Ireland group. In doing so, I am conscious of the fact that the Minister and other Ministers involved, have a very complicated series of decisions to take and I do not expect him to announce those decisions here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate that Seanad Éireann should consider the problems associated with this and whether allowing it to go ahead would be in the public interest.  It is true that the five major building societies are dominant in the market, and my information is that the proposed take-over of the Irish Civil Service Building Society is a take-over of the smallest of these societies although of course there <Col N="489" /> are smaller societies.  I understand it is the only society with shares quoted on the Stock Exchange and that the special section of the Building Societies Act, 1976, was inserted so as to facilitate the continuation of this unusual circumstance.</P>
    <P>I should like to consider two matters in logical progression.  Is it in the public interest that the Bank of Ireland should acquire a building society, specifically the Irish Civil Service Building Society and if it is permitted by the Government and accepted by the shareholders of that society, will the proposed take-over be successful?  If it goes ahead, successfully, should there be special provisions so that the Minister in his wisdom could make whatever regulations are necessary, or indeed amend anything which might be necessary in order to make the take-over work?  Consider whether it is in the public interest.  This is a matter about which people have instinctive feelings.  I am highly conscious of the growth of the building society movement, the growing dominance of the five building societies and indeed the growing dominance of the biggest building society in Ireland.  I would like to bring about a situation where the five building societies, in a dominant market, were more equal among themselves.  I think &mdash; and this has some relevance to what I have to say later on &mdash; that the biggest building society is proportionately very big when you consider the market as a whole.  There are advantages to having a multitude of retail outlets, and that is what a building society is.  It is a retail outlet for the gathering of money and for the supplying of money to the house mortgage market.  It is an independent source of finance for housing.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other sources of finance for housing, such as local authorities, but they are now marginally only a theoretical source of finance in respect of most houses, that is local authority loans as distinct from local authority grants.  It is not a very important part of the overall national field.  The associated banks have certain tax advantages.  They provide some mortgage finance themselves, and to that extent are already in competition with the building societies.  There are <Col N="490" /> many reasons for the attractiveness of building societies and I am sure that attractiveness will increase over the years if the building societies develop to a stage where they provide alternative services to the consumer, such as the provision of a cheque book and other things which appears to be a developing trend in other countries.  This might, under a benign Government, develop here.</P>
    <P>My instinctive reaction &mdash; for a number of reasons &mdash; is that to have a bank involved with a building society is not in the public interest.  I will deal later with the dominant position of the two major banking groups in the Irish financial scene.  The separation of a man's dwelling and the financing of that dwelling from his other business transactions is a good principle.  The State has gone to considerable lengths to ensure that in the event of the house being pledged in respect of business commitments owners' spouses will be protected.</P>
    <P>It is my personal experience that both of the major banking groups, in advancing money to somebody in respect of his house, include in the mortgage a clause which puts the house as security, not only with regard to the money being borrowed in respect of the purchase of the house, but any other money which might be borrowed from time to time during the course of business.  That is where the danger lies.  Separation has already broken down within the banking community in respect of those homes which are financed in that way and the absorption of a building society into a banking group will encourage that trend further.  Very soon any persons who deal with the enlarged Bank of Ireland Group will find themselves in that position.  That is socially unacceptable and not a trend which we should encourage or foster.</P>
    <P>There has been a dramatic reduction in the number of choices available to people, particularly those outside the metropolitan area, with regard to availability of finance in general.  There are three or four banks in the Allied Irish Group and three or four in the other, certainly the six or seven banks have &mdash; in my lifetime &mdash; been reduced to two. There are other banks such as the <Col N="491" /> Northern Bank or the Ulster Bank, but these do not operate over a large portion of the country.  As far as banking facilities are concerned, in many country towns there are only two choices.  The building society movement has given an additional source for people to put their money in and an additional source for them to raise finance in respect of their house mortgage, without complicating their affairs to such an extent that their house mortgage is tied in with their business activities. It might be that they voluntarily tie it in from time to time, but it is my experience that anybody who has borrowed money from the Bank of Ireland Group or the Allied Irish Banks Group at present has pledged, directly or indirectly, his house against debts other than those incurred in respect of the purchase of his house.  I would not like to encourage that.  The restriction of the element of choice is something I consider to be very important.</P>
    <P>The reduction of choice is not good. When that is coupled with the fact that the reduction is into a banking group that adds a second element of unpleasantness and a second reason why it should not be encouraged to go ahead.  Banks are too dominant in the financial area of the country at the moment.  They control too high a proportion of the money which is available to people for spending.  The growth of other financial institutions should be encouraged.  For that reason the building society movement must be protected and fostered, not just the dominant societies within that movement, but the building society movement in general.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons why it would be quite unsuitable for the Government to permit this to go ahead without making changes in the legislation.  The views I have expressed refer to my personal possition with regard to whether it should go ahead at all.  I will explain why it would be most unsuitable that a bank should take over any building society under present legislation.</P>
    <P>The Building Society Act, 1976, is really the consolidation Act of the building society legislation at present.  Section <Col N="492" /> 77 of that Act appears to confer on the Minister for Finance the power to direct the type of loans which a building society might give.  Section 77 (1) says:</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister considers it expedient in the interests of the orderly and proper regulation of building society business and having regard to the demand for loans for house purchase, he may, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance and after consultation with the Registrar, make regulations in relation to the purposes and amounts of loans by societies.</P>
    <P>I have not investigated this but if there are no statutory regulations in force in that regard there must be unofficial guidelines whereby money is not extended by the building society beyond a certain amount.  The sum of £50,000 comes into my mind but I am not sure of that figure.</P>
    <P>That section of the Act and the following section appear to give the Minister the power to do that.  Therefore, the Minister might feel that he was in a position to protect the investor and the society in general in the event of these two institutions getting together.  In fact the Minister would be powerless, under present legislation, to stop the Bank of Ireland Group, as expanded, from utilising a substantial portion of the money collected by the building society for its own purposes, purposes which have nothing whatsoever to do with the advancement of money for mortgage finance.  Section 38 (1) would provide a substantial loophole to the building society.  It states:</P>
    <P>the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister and the Central Bank, may prescribe the investments in which a society may invest such portion of its funds as are not immediately required....</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) is independent and superior to that.  It says:</P>
    <P>To the extent that a society's surplus funds are not invested in accordance with subsection (1), the society may keep them in cash in the custody of officers of the society or on current <Col N="493" /> account, or on deposit with the Central Bank, a bank, the Post Office Savings Bank....</P>
    <P>That stands on its own.  While the Minister can refuse or grant a request under section 1, if that request is not make at all or is only made in respect of a small portion of funds, the remainder of the funds in respect of which no request has been made can be put on deposit by a building society in a bank.  So in the event of the Irish Civil Service Building Society being taken over by the Bank of Ireland, the money collected by the building society can be put on deposit with a bank on the basis that it is investment or surplus funds for the moment without the approval of the Minister for Finance. That is clear because it was never envisaged that a building society would take over a bank.  That is why it is framed like that.  Nobody ever thought that one of these listed options would become the parent body.  Therefore, that is something which must be considered very carefully by the Minister in deciding what to do.</P>
    <P>I refer to section 52 (1) of the same Act which deals with the entitlement of people to vote.  We must look at this in the context of the rules of the Irish Civil Service Building Society and, in so far as they are not in conflict, I do not think they will be incorrect.  Section 52 (1) of the Building Society Act, 1976, deals with the question of who is entitled to vote at meetings.  Those who are entitled to vote at meetings in respect of a building society irrespective of what it says in the rules of that society &mdash; in fact, I understand the rules of the Irish Civil Service Building Society contain the same provision &mdash; shall be the numbers who at the end of the last financial year before the date of the meeting held shares to which voting rights attached and were issued by the society under section 22 (1) and at the date of the meeting continued to hold such shares.  In other words, the people who were entitled to vote at a meeting of the Irish Civil Service Building Society at present are those shareholders who held shares on 31 December 1983 and who continue to hold them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> If the Bank of Ireland have acquired 17 per cent of that company that 17 per cent are not entitled to vote at all until at least 31 December 1984.</P>
    <P>I wonder do the Bank of Ireland know that.  Effectively they have disenfranchised themselves to the extent of 17 per cent of the share capital of the building society.  Even if they acquire more shares during 1984 they will not under any circumstances be entitled to vote prior to 31 December 1984.  That is a very serious situation, because the control of the society might go into a smaller and smaller group until eventually 5 per cent of the people before the end of this year might have all the controlling voting rights of this society.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, section 53 (1) of the 1976 Act says that the persons entitled to vote in the event of all being properly registered and having the votes at the right time at the meeting of the society shall be all members who at the end of the last financial year before the last meeting held shares to which voting rights attached which were issued by the society under section 22 (1) to a value of not less than £10 and at the date of the meeting continued to hold such shares.  I understand that together with the provisions concerning polls and proxies as meaning that anybody who holds shares, has held them on the previous 31 December and continues to hold them is entitled to one vote in respect of shares which he had even though they might be in excess of £10.  Even if you wait until after 31 December 1984 the Bank of Ireland will be entitled to one vote in respect of their 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside for the moment the disenfranchisement of the Bank of Ireland by reason of the operation of the rule concerning the previous year's voting rights, they could acquire 99 per cent of the shares of the company and still be controlled by the remaining 1 per cent. The only way they could do it is to use nominees at any time.  It would be most extraordinary for a bank having acquired the shares in the building society to disperse them on a nominee basis to a considerable number of their employees.  I believe that use of nominees was criticised <Col N="495" /> by the Registrar and the court in a case involving the building society promoted by another building society against an insurance company.</P>
    <P>What will happen now?  The Bank of Ireland should be persuaded not to proceed with their bid.  Suitable people, such as existing shareholders, should be encouraged to buy the shares at a fair price.  They should either buy those shares and hold them in trust or, alternatively, hold them in trust until such time as the Irish Civil Service Building Society can out of their own funds in due course re-purchase their own shares and convert themselves into a mutual society. They are entitled to do this under their rules.  Alternatively, a possibility could be considered that instead of acquiring the shares, loans could be given proportional to the reserves of each society to enable the Irish Civil Service Building Society to purchase its old shares now.  If some adjustment in respect of the reserves or the percentages are necessary to do that, it should be done.  If that is not possible then an outright purchase by a consortium of building societies would be preferable to the purchase by the bank, even though I am not in favour of that.  I prefer to have the five of them there.  But if it has to be acquired by somebody I would prefer it to be a building society.  If that is not possible, the possibility of a union of the societies should be considered.  We should be realistic enough to realise that probably only one or at the most two societies would be substantial enough to envisage something like that.  They are the possibilities that I suggest to the Minister and no doubt others are being considered. This is an area which is fraught with danger and I hope the Bank of Ireland realise the can of worms which they have opened because they now have a very heavy responsibility to ensure that the Irish Civil Service Building Society continues to prosper, which I sincerely hope it will.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Leary at the beginning of his remarks said that we are dealing here with a situation that requires or could <Col N="496" /> require a number of complicated decisions. Listening to Senator O'Leary's analysis of the situation and his own views on the desirable course to follow, we can confirm that it requires a number of complicated decisions.  We are dealing with a situation which while in a sense provided for or made possible by the terms of the 1976 Act was not precisely foreseen when the Act was passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Leary felt that in view of the fact that a number of complex decisions needed to be made he did not expect to hear this evening what those decisions would be.  The Government have not made a decision as to the precise approach that we would adopt to this case, partly for the reason that the particular difficulties and considerations outlined by Senator O'Leary are ones to which the Government are alive and because a number of other considerations which Senator O'Leary has not raised this evening need to be examined.  As I have said on two occasions in the last week, whatever decision the Government make about this particular matter in the event and to the extent that it turns out to be a matter for Government decision, it would be based on a concern to at least maintain the supply of housing finance and to protect and promote the interests, both of those who have borrowed money from building societies and the interests of depositors in building societies as well.  Having said that, some aspects of what Senator O'Leary said need a great deal more discussion and I should like to make a few points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Leary has spoken of the desirability of creating more balance between the building societies.  It is part of his concern to develop greater balance between the different kinds of financial institutions.  These are two of the questions very much at the centre of the present debate.  There is no particular reason, other than the Senator's own preference, why in any area of activity, whether it is financial, commercial or any other area, we should secure a given balance between the different operators in the market unless there are so few of them that one threatens to dominate excessively <Col N="497" /> or a very small number threatens to dominate and perhaps to collude in that kind of domination.</P>
    <P>It is a moot point, in relation to building societies in a country of 3,250,000 people, given the demand that we properly make on building societies as to the solidity of their operations, whether we are at the stage when we really need to be concerned with that kind of balance as a primary factor between the existing five major building societies.  Objectively speaking, there is no particular reason why there should be a given balance between different kinds of financial institutions. Before I examine that a little more I would like to make the point that whatever the result of the present situation and whatever the outcome of the discussions that are going on now or in future, the building society that continues in being after those discussions had been completed would continue to be subject to the same rules, the same supervisory conditions, the same regulations, the same Act to which the building societies now in existence and operating are subject. Senator O'Leary did not take enough cognisance of that fact and that the provisions of the 1976 Act which have shown themselves adequate to deal with <Col N="498" /> the operations of building societies would continue to apply to this building society whatever the eventual outcome of these discussions.</P>
    <P>I indicated, a Chathaoirligh, with your permission, that I would not have as much time to deal with this section as I would like.  I think that the evidence of my ears indicates that I have come to the end of my time, but I would like to thank Senator O'Leary for raising the matter in the way that he has and for bringing out a number of the considerations which the Government and other people need to bear in mind in making up their minds about this proposal.  I agree with one point which Senator O'Leary made &mdash; we may have introduced a new element into the financial institutions that currently serve our country.  It might be a good thing to have that new element; on the other hand it might not.  It is different, and this debate will at least help to focus our thinking.  Recent events have shown that we need to rethink some of the ways in which our community is served by our financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.35 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 21 March 1984.</P>
