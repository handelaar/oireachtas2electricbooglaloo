      <P>I have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The psychiatric illnesses, tuberculosis and problems of chest infections resulting from the inadequate community care services provided by health boards for homeless people when discharged from general and psychiatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I want to refer Senators to the Order Paper and the supplementary Order Paper in front of them and for which I want to apologise.  It is a matter outside the control of this House because of arrangements made in another House.  I intend to order Nos. 1, 1 (a), 1 (b), 2, 3 and 4.  No. 4 will be from 6.30 to 8 o'clock if business allows.</P>

      <P>I suppose we could agree with the Order of Business but we have not got the relevant Order Paper.  On the <Col N="584" /> Order Paper I have the first item relates to the Joint Committee on Building Land and the second to the Dentists Bill.  The Social Welfare Bill is one of the most important Bills to come before the House every year and to get it at 2.35 p.m. is a disgrace although I am not blaming the Acting Leader of the House.  I do not know exactly what to say about it as I am flabbergasted to think that items which we will be discussing today had not been given to us earlier.  The Order of Business should have been before us at a much earlier stage.  This happens every year at this time.  We should have the full text of the Social Welfare Bill before us long before the last day on which it has to go to the President for signature.</P>

      <P>I agree wholeheartedly for once with the leader of Fianna Fáil. I find it astonishing that a Bill that has implications for close to a million people and which needs an enormous amount of technical work, as it refers to other major legislation, should be landed in my mail this morning at very short notice.  I understand the problems and I am not criticising the Acting Leader of the House as it is not his fault.  I criticise the principle which forces us into a position where fundamental legislation has effectively to be rushed through in a way which is contemptuous of the legislation and even more contemptuous of this House because we are treated in a very subordinate way by having to do business in this fashion.</P>

      <P>We dealt with criticisms last week of the problems that we, as legislators, are faced with.  It was agreed last week that we would take the Social Welfare Bill this week.  The fact that Senators did not have Order Papers containing it was outside my control and arose by arrangement with the Opposition in the other House.  I am sorry that it happened that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> To deal with the legislation before us, we had a supplementary Order Paper printed which includes the Social Welfare Bill.  There is a copy of the Social Welfare Bill before the House as passed by Dáil Éireann at 1.30 p.m. today so it is before us properly.  I propose that the Order of Business should be as I outlined.  Referring to Senator Kiely's question, it does not arise in the way I have ordered business as the sitting is open-ended until we complete business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the period for reporting back to the Joint Committee on Building Land be extended to 31st December, 1984.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of that committee I should like to second the motion. The reasons are obvious and I agree with that interpretation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is such an important item, I supported the request by the committee to be able to look for professional expertise in examining the whole question of control of the price of building land.  This brief report gives the background to why the committee feel it necessary to extend until next December the time scale for compiling the report. That is a full year longer than the original remit.  The Labour Party in particular and the Acting Leader of the House know this and have been most anxious for the report and, indeed, the whole area of the control of building land to be advanced. <Col N="586" /> It is quite a long further extension and it is doubling the life of this committee.</P>
      <P>It would be helpful if the Acting Leader of the House who is a member of that committee and knows more than is contained in this brief report could give us some idea of the programme of work which requires a further period until next December and if he could give us a real guarantee and assurance at this stage so that there will be no necessity for further delay on the matter.  It is one of the most urgent economical and social problems facing us, particularly facing those who want to see a greater programme of housing and better use of our land for development in the urban areas.  It is something which has been regarded for a considerable time as one of the greatest areas of inequity and inequality and social injustice and it has taken us a long time to get this committee under way.  I would be very sorry indeed if the subject matter began to drift and was further postponed.  I would welcome some assurance on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by Senator Robinson about the length of time that the moving of this motion requests, but it is really a safeguard because the committee intend to have it completed &mdash; now that we have cleared some of the problems about advice available to us and other matters arising out of our work &mdash; and reported much earlier than the time suggested.  It is just to avoid the possibility of coming back again at a further date looking for another short extension that all parties on the committee were unanimous that we would look for a proper time so that we would not feel constrained by a short period if we are to do justice to the problem before us.  When this House was planning for an extension previously we were unaware that certain advice we had asked for was not available, which put the matter beyond the control of the committee.  It will probably not be delayed for long and I assure Senator Robinson that I am trying to ensure that this committee complete their important work and will report to this House as <Col N="587" /> soon as possible and certainly long before the date mentioned.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Pattison) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Pattison)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main improvements provided for in this Bill were announced in the budget last January and include an increase of 8 per cent in rates of unemployment assistance for the long-term unemployed and 7 per cent for other social welfare recipients. The Bill also provides for the introduction of a new scheme of family income supplement and for a number of changes in various social welfare schemes.</P>
      <P>Before dealing specifically with the measures contained in this Bill, I would like to outline the context in which social welfare policy must be considered.  Since the Department of Social Welfare were set up there has been a continuing development of schemes and services.  Contributory old age, retirement and invalidity pension, pay-related benefit, death grants, deserted wife's benefit and allowance and supplementary welfare allowance have all been introduced, as well as special support for prisoners' wives, unmarried mothers, and single women. In addition a variety of supplements and benefits-in-kind, such as free travel and free electricity have been provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The progressive development of the social welfare system over the years has had a number of objectives.  The first and most important has been to assist people in particular situations, where they were unable to provide for the necessities of life from their own resources.  There are always people, not necessarily easily identified, who are on the margins of society in terms of their ability to support themselves and make a contribution to community life.  It is the task of a social welfare system to identify groups of people with a high risk of poverty and to provide direct income support related to need.  In the case of loss of income arising <Col N="588" /> from short-term absences from the work-force due to sickness or unemployment, the objective is to provide through pay-related benefits a replacement income which bears a reasonable relationship to the person's normal take home pay.</P>
    <P>Another important purpose of social welfare is to redistribute resources from the better-off sections of the community to those in need.  The social welfare system achieves this by transferring resources in a number of ways, from those at work who are contributors to those who are sick, unemployed, widowed or old and who generally need support. There is also redistribution from people without dependants towards those with families, in recognition of the additional costs of living in such circumstances. Contributions are levied on workers through the PRSI system in proportion to earning levels, giving, in the overall, a redistribution towards those on the lowest incomes.</P>
    <P>The dramatic growth in social welfare spending, particularly in the last decade, highlights the extent of the development of services and the increase in levels of individual support as well as population and employment changes.  Gross social welfare spending amounted to £204 million in 1973-74, while in the same price terms, this year's overall spending on social welfare will amount to £491 million. This illustrates the magnitude of the real two-and-a-half fold increase over the decade.  Social welfare expenditure now accounts for one-seventh of our gross national product.</P>
    <P>The scale of spending in 1984 gives a good indication of the central place of social welfare in our society today, the level of commitment made by the community and also the extent of relative need.  Because of this scale of commitment, even marginal changes in social welfare rates, scope or entitlement can have, in the aggregate, very significant economic and budgetary consequences. Furthermore, the number of people who depend on social welfare in one form or another is never static.  Provision for increase in numbers must be made in estimating the amount of Exchequer commitment to social welfare parallel <Col N="589" /> with consideration of improvements in individual entitlements.</P>
    <P>One of the major pressures on social welfare support comes from the high and growing number of people, with their dependants, who rely on unemployment payments.  The current disturbing numbers of unemployed, which on average will be about 30,000 people a week more than in 1983, poses the most serious problem for our community and not just in the social welfare area.  Unemployment has now reached into every sector and stratum of our society, bringing with it complete dependence on social welfare for many of the households involved.  The hardships associated with prolonged unemployment are well documented and the increasing numbers of people experiencing long-term unemployment are a matter of particular concern.</P>
    <P>Social welfare spending in 1984 on unemployment support will amount to about £580 million, over a quarter of all social welfare expenditure.  This is some 28 per cent higher than the unemployment provision needed in 1983 reflecting the growth in numbers unemployed and higher rates of individual payment.  These figures say nothing about the extent of personal hardship and loss of status in the community associated with unemployment.</P>
    <P>The need for effective action to correct the situation was never more pressing but my most immediate concern is to ensure that social welfare support for unemployed households is available as quickly and as effectively as possible and that the special problems facing the long term unemployed are dealt with.  This is an essential parallel to overall Government action on the economic front to correct the unemployment situation itself.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the purpose of social welfare provision and the growth in the range and scope of services over the years, the cost of which is now being accelerated because of unemployment, in order to place the developments contained in this Bill in their context.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an increase of 8 per cent in the rates of unemployment assistance for the long-term unemployed <Col N="590" /> and 7 per cent for other social assistance payments, children's allowances, social insurance benefits and occupational injuries payments.  These increases will take effect from the beginning of next July for weekly payments and from August in the case of children's allowance.</P>
    <P>The increases are in line with the specific commitment given by this Government on coming into office to maintain the living standards of the section of the community dependent on social welfare payments.  I am confident that the rates increases provided in the Bill, at a cost of nearly £70 million this year, will protect the purchasing power of benefits until well into 1985.</P>
    <P>Since these rates increases were announced in the budget there has been some criticism of the adequacy of the increases in the face of price increases. Reference has been made to apparently large increases in social welfare benefits given by previous administrations.  We should not forget, however, that nominally large increases in rates often did little more than compensate for correspondingly large increases in inflation. Another important consideration was the real increases in PRSI contributions by workers and employers which were necessary to pay for the increases in benefits. This Government on the other hand have managed to maintain the real value of pensions and benefits without increasing PRSI contributions above their 1982 rates.</P>
    <P>According to the latest figures for the consumer price index, the Government's recent budget measures added about ½ per cent to the underlying inflation rate. This Government's containment of inflation, together with the retention of food subsidies, increased tax-free allowances and income levy exemptions, will allow the most vulnerable groups in the community to benefit from the slight upswing in national prosperity this year and into 1985.  It now appears as though inflation will be equivalent to about 5 per cent into 1985 and likely to hold this level for the period for which the increase granted to social welfare recipients is intended to apply.  This is why I am confident that the <Col N="591" /> real value of pensions and benefits will be maintained in the period to mid-1985.</P>
    <P>This indexation of benefits levels has been provided for within the most severe limitations of Exchequer resources.  You will appreciate this more when you consider that social welfare spending will increase by 13 per cent in 1984 relative to 1983 in spite of the weekly payments increase of 7 per cent generally.  The additional increase in expenditure would have to be provided for in any event this year due to the growth in numbers of recipients, particularly of unemployment payments and the need to meet the full year cost of last year's 10 per cent to 12 per cent increases.  Indeed, the proportion of social welfare spending to be met by the Exchequer this year will be nearly 15 per cent, or £161 million greater than in 1983, representing a recognition by the Government that the capacity of the workforce and employers to make further direct contributions to social insurance through PRSI is severely limited.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that it was possible this year to provide a further special increase for people who have been unemployed for 15 months or more. I have already alluded to the particular hardships faced by this group and I consider that the 8 per cent to be paid to people in this situation together with the increase provided last year will provide significant real additional help.  This special increase follows the extra 5 per cent which was given to this group last October. In aggregate, therefore, the long-term unemployed will have received an increase of almost 25 per cent in their rates, taking the increase in June and October 1983 and next July into account &mdash; more than sufficient to secure a real improvement in their situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer now to the main provisions contained in the Bill.  I do not propose to detail the individual rates increases but Senators will find them summarised in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill, which I hope they will find helpful.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill makes a technical amendment to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, to allow for certain <Col N="592" /> expenses in relation to the administration of the social insurance and occupational injuries schemes to be paid to An Post rather than to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as was formerly the case.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for an increase of 0.1 per cent to 0.4 per cent in the rate of contribution to be paid by employers into the Occupational Injuries Fund through the PRSI system.  This contribution will be levied on employers in respect of employee earnings up to a ceiling of £13,000 a year, as at present.</P>
    <P>The Occupational Injuries Fund is entirely financed by employer contributions and by fund investments.  This increase in employer contribution is necessary to maintain the solvency of the fund in the light of estimated expenditure on occupational injuries compensation this year.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;floor&rdquo; for the calculation of pay-related benefit is increased in section 7 of the Bill.  Pay-related benefit (PRB) is payable with unemployment, disability and injury benefits and with maternity allowance.  It has been a feature of the PRB scheme since its introduction in 1974 that a certain proportion of reckonable earnings is disregarded in calculating entitlement.  This disregard or &ldquo;floor&rdquo; was set at £14 a week in 1974, over twice the prevailing level of the flat-rate benefit. The floor was not increased until 1981 even though flat-rate benefits rose significantly in that period.  Since 1981, the floor has been steadily raised.  Section 7 continues this process, raising the floor by £7 from £36 to £43 a week.  This increase will apply to new claimants only from 2 April next.  Even with this latest increase the floor will still be just over half of its relative level in 1974.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the possibility of payment of pay-related benefit in a lump sum to persons who qualify under the enterprise allowance scheme administered by the Department of Labour.  That scheme was introduced by the Government at the end of 1983 to provide financial support for unemployed people who wished to start up their own businesses.  As an alternative to unemployment payments people who qualify under the scheme can receive a weekly allowance <Col N="593" /> of £50, or £30 if they are single.  The scheme is administered through the National Manpower Service.  The response so far to the scheme has been most encouraging and, as an additional incentive, section 8 provides that any pay-related benefit to which enterprise allowance scheme applicants would be entitled to receive if they had remained unemployed can now be paid to them as a lump sum.  This lump sum will be equivalent to the amount of PRB that applicants would otherwise have received for the remaining portion of the relevant period of interruption of employment, subject to a maximum of 26 weeks.  This will provide lump sums up to a maximum of about £1,150, depending on individual entitlements which will be a useful extra support at the start of a business when credit can often be difficult to obtain.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill changes the method of assessment of income from the leasing of land.  The Government are concerned to encourage greater use of medium-term land leasing as part of their policy in relation to farming.  At present, the means assessment for social welfare purposes of leased land favours the less efficient conacre or 11-month system and this, in turn, restricts the access to land of younger and possibly more progressive farmers.  At present the capital value of land is used for means assessment purposes where it is being leased for a number of years.  The land in such cases is deemed not to be personally used or enjoyed by the owner.  On the other hand, land let on a short-term basis is taken to remain in the occupation and use of the owner and means for pension and other purposes are calculated on the basis of the profits from the lettings.</P>
    <P>This section of the Bill provides that, where land has been leased with the approval of the Land Commission, the lessor's means for social assistance purposes will be calculated by reference to the profits from the lease rather than to the capital value of the holding.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 deal with two minor changes to the children's allowance scheme.  At present, children's allowances in respect of a child resident outside <Col N="594" /> the State can be paid to the father while he is working abroad for the Government, the State or an international organisation. Section 10 extends this provision to a qualified person other than the father, in other words, the mother.</P>
    <P>Section 11 extends the validity of the orders in children's allowance books from three to six months.  This measure will reduce the amount of payable orders issued by my Department in respect of children's allowance orders and will enable arrears payments to be made to a much greater extent by order book rather than by separate payment.  This problem arises particularly in relation to children aged between 16 and 18 who continue in full-time education and in respect of whom arrears payments for the summer months are generally made at the beginning of the school year.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill provides that the amount of disability benefit, associated pay-related benefit or invalidity pension payable for up to a period of five years to a person arising from injuries received as the result of a road traffic accident will be taken into account in assessing damages for those injuries.  This is in line with similar arrangements which already exist in relation to occupational injuries benefits and follows a recommendation in the report on the inquiry into the cost and methods of providing motor insurance.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with a new development in social welfare, the provision of direct cash support for employees on low earnings with families through a family income supplement scheme.</P>
    <P>In discussing the background to this Bill, I outlined the functions of social welfare in relieving poverty and in redistribution of income.  This new scheme is concerned with both issues.  By a combination of the structures of the social welfare and income tax codes, workers on low earnings can find themselves in a &ldquo;poverty-trap&rdquo; whereby it could be more advantageous to them to claim social welfare support than to work.  The benefits system has higher rates of payment with increasing family size, whereas earnings are paid regardless of marital or family status.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" /> The family income supplement scheme will provide additional cash support in direct relation to family size and to other income.  This will result in improved redistribution of resources to lower paid workers.  The scheme will be introduced from next November.  It will provide additional support for about 35,000 families at a cost of £2.2 million in 1984 and £13 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Payments of the supplement will be made to families with children where one or more parent is in full-time paid employment and where the income of a family is less than a specified amount. The actual rate of payment to recipients under the scheme will depend on two factors &mdash; the number of children in the family and the amount of the family income.  The supplement will be calculated in each case as one-quarter of the difference between the family's actual income and the appropriate upper level of income for the family size in question.</P>
    <P>The maximum family earnings up to which a supplement will be payable will be £95 in the case of a one-child family. An additional £15 earnings will be allowed for each subsequent child up to the fifth.  At this family size the maximum earnings allowable will be £155 a week. As this level of earnings will correspond to average male earnings in the transportable goods industries this year, I do not consider it appropriate to supplement incomes above this level.  Accordingly, families with more than five children will all be assessed according to the income limits for a five-child family.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the lower income limits will vary from £63 in the case of a one-child family to £95 a week in the case of families with five or more children.  The maximum family income supplement payable where earnings are at or below these limits will range from £8 to £15, a week depending on family size.  It will be payable to the principal wage earner in the family and the supplement will not be subject to income tax or PRSI.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 to 17 provide for the introduction of this scheme along the lines I have indicated, with consequential amendments to the social welfare code. <Col N="596" /> Section 15 provides for the making of regulations to adjust payment of the supplement where the recipient ceases to work and draws unemployment benefit or assistance, disability benefit or retirement pension.</P>
    <P>I do not claim that the scheme provided for in this Bill will solve all the problems faced by workers trying to provide for their families on low earnings.  However, I consider that the family income supplement scheme will provide a significant level of support for a section of the community whose needs could not be catered for adequately within the scope of the existing social welfare system or the taxation system as currently structured.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill, comprising sections 18 to 30 inclusive, provide for the abolition of old age pensions committees and for the transfer of their function in deciding pension entitlement to deciding officers in my Department.  There are a number of consequential amendments to existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The effect of these measures is to provide that applications for old age non-contributory pensions will go through the same adjudication process as for other social welfare benefits and assistance claims.  The system being replaced is out of date and actually obstructs the prompt and effective payment of pensions and this reform will, I believe, be welcomed by those involved in the welfare of the elderly.</P>
    <P>The old age pensions committees were first set up under the Old Age Pensions Act, 1908.  They are appointed by county councils and county borough and borough councils to determine individual entitlement to old age, non-contributory, pensions.  There are currently about 355 committees and sub-committees around the country.</P>
    <P>Under the present system each old age pension claim is investigated by a social welfare officer whose report to the old age pension committee, or sub-committee, includes a recommendation as to the amount of pension entitlement in accordance with the relevant legislation.  The claim must then await the next meeting of the committee for consideration.</P>
    <P>The committees are voluntary and <Col N="597" /> part-time and are required to meet once a month but frequently there are delays of as much as three months in deciding claims.  To counteract this problem, provision was made in 1978 to enable pensions recommended by the social welfare officer to be put into payment pending the committees' decisions.  Committees may cause further delays when they award pensions which are not payable or which are clearly higher than those payable under the legislation.  This is a frequent occurrence which necessitates appeals by social welfare officers against such decisions.  These appeals are decided by statutorily appointed appeals officers.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I would like to pay tribute to the work of the local pensions committees in fulfilling their statutory duties down through the years.  The fact that I might not agree with the basic policy under which the committees were established and operated does not take from my appreciation of the contribution, commitment and dedication which individual voluntary members have brought to their task.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Bill provides for the consequential abolition of the post of clerk to the old age pensions committee or sub-committee and for the provision of appropriate compensation to the clerks in line with Civil Service practice. My remarks about the dedication and commitment of the committees apply with equal validity to the work of clerks to those committees over the years.  Their role in co-ordinating the work of committees and in liaising with Department officials has ensured that the system of adjudication worked as efficiently as it could within the constraints which it faced.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 to 28 make necessary consequential amendments to relevant sections of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  It is the intention to bring these provisions into operation by regulation in the near future.</P>
    <P>I spoke at the start about the context in which social welfare operates and the objectives that the community has set for the system of welfare as we see it today. This Bill has provided for a number of <Col N="598" /> improvements to the social welfare code, notably in the increase in rates and in the introduction of a family income supplement. Much work remains to be done to ensure the most effective and desirable redistribution of resources to those in relative need.  The family income supplement, together with the indexation of rates for social welfare recipients, will help to maintain progress in this area.</P>
    <P>I also referred in my opening remarks to the massive financial commitment involved for the community in providing social welfare services.  It is undoubtedly necessary at the present time and will be in the foreseeable future to exercise a greater degree of control on public expenditure than has been the practice in the past.  It seems to me that what may well be of paramount importance is the effectiveness and quality of the services we are providing.  It is a question of ensuring that what we are spending is given to best effect and that waste in expenditure is eliminated.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, the time is opportune to review the social welfare system to ensure that it meets its objectives effectively and the Government have established a Commission on Social Welfare to carry out this important task.  The commission's task is to undertake a fundamental appraisal of social welfare and its interaction with other forms of social support and fiscal welfare and to report its recommendations within two years.  I consider the work of the commission to be of crucial importance to the long-term development and effectiveness of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the purpose of social welfare must be to achieve a more just redistribution of income, wealth and power and thereby remove poverty as far as possible.  As a parallel to the commission's review of existing social welfare provisions, the Minister, with the approval of the Government, established an Interim Board of the Combat Poverty Organisation.  This interim board will report to the Minister by the end of June next with regard to the structure of a permanent Combat Poverty Organisation and its detailed terms of reference. The Minister has also asked the interim <Col N="599" /> board to advise him on the Irish input into the forthcoming EEC poverty programme.</P>
    <P>I consider that the three forms of action I have outlined &mdash; the measures contained in this Bill, the Commission on Social Welfare's examination and the renewed combat poverty programme &mdash; indicate the Government's commitment to the least well-off sections of our community despite the economic and financial constraints facing us all today.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the Seanad for favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I think this is his first visit and I would like to congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well.  One could say that when Ministers or Ministers of State for Social Welfare produce Social Welfare Bills they do not come with good news but I can say in fairness that this Bill is slightly better than the news we received in 1983. That was a very difficult and tough measure which, in fact, brought the result within the Coalition that one of the members resigned from the Labour Party.  We have a very difficult Social Welfare Bill this year also, and we cannot forget it is being introduced against a background of massive unemployment.  The Minister of State has referred to this in his statement. He said that of the total figure for social welfare in 1984, £580 million, will be for unemployment support and that represents more than one-quarter of the total budget.</P>
      <P>Unemployment is at the highest point ever in the history of the State and we know it is growing.  As a result of this, more and more people are now dependent on the social welfare code for survival. For most of them it is not their own choice but because of circumstances totally outside their control.  For the first time in the history of the State the most highly qualified of our people such as technicians, engineers, architects, production managers and many other highly rated people are depending on social welfare benefits for survival.  Clearly we have the new poor in our midst.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> Generally we can say that with the climate that prevails today the morale of our people is declining, confidence is probably at an all-time low and our living standards are being greatly reduced as the years go by.  It is not surprising, therefore, that social welfare costs have reached the huge amount of £2,156 million for this year, as has been mentioned by the Minister.  When we look at this figure and bring it down a stage further we find that the cost is £6 million a day. Perhaps that is a better way to look at it because it gives us a clearer picture of what the taxpayer is really paying for social welfare.  It is right to assess this situation and to say to the taxpayers, &ldquo;You are contributing largely to this money, take an interest in it and see what can be done about it&rdquo;.  If this situation were spelled out to taxpayers in the country I believe they would take a greater interest in the matter; they might look at the matter in terms of dole abuse and other areas of concern within the social welfare system because it is a frightening situation.  Many taxpayers will query and rightly will ask how far this state of affairs can go.  As a nation how long can we afford to allow this situation to continue? Can we continue to hand out unemployment benefit and all the other benefits that are in the social welfare code?  At some stage we will have to cry halt but having said that I think the people in their hearts realise what they have to do for the very poor and the needy.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 provide for increases of 7 per cent in the weekly rates of social insurance and occupational injury benefits with effect from July 1984.  Last week we were told positively that our inflation rate was 10 per cent.  Certainly I was disappointed and I would have imagined the Labour people in Government in particular would have said that any increases should be in line with inflation unfortunately that is not the case.  The Labour Party said at the beginning of the period of office of the Coalition Government that it would be their philosophy that social welfare recipients would not be affected because we are in a recessionary situation.  Again, this is not reflected in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> Section 4 provides for a very meagre children's allowance increase from August 1984: in other words, two-thirds or more of the year will have passed before this increase is given.  When you consider that there was no increase at all last year in the children's allowance, that this 7 per cent now being granted is for a two-year period, it is not fair.  A feature of the Bill with which I disagree is that the additional payments that are being given are being delayed as long as possible but what we are taking in terms of revenue from our people comes about almost immediately.  It is not a fair system and I have to highlight it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The PRSI contribution is a body blow to all employers and will further worsen the prospect of new jobs being created.  I have always felt that PRSI and other taxes generally have hindered the prospects of job creation. The policy of the Government will not help in job creation despite the fact that 216,000 people are out of work and I think the Minister for Finance said this figure will continue to grow.  When we consider that 66,000 of those people are under the age of 25 we certainly have a most serious problem on our hands which will have to be tackled by the Government before it bankrupts this country not just in terms of finances but in terms of morale and the confidence of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the change in the means test under section 9 of the Bill in the case of leased land.  In my opinion it would be preferable that the means of the lessor be calculated not by reference to the capital value of the holding but on the basis of the profits from the particular lease.  The sections dealing with family income benefit are certainly worthy of consideration <Col N="602" /> and indeed this is a very fundamental measure in the Bill.  The Minister has told us that 35,000 families will benefit from this family income scheme.  I think it is true to say that this huge number does not do us any credit.  We have waited for this measure for a long time.  It was promised in 1981.  In 1983 the budget provided £5 million for this measure but it was reduced subsequently by £1 million at the famous meeting in Barrettstown.  However, it never became a reality.  Now we are told that it will come into effect, again very late in the year, in November.</P>
    <P>Many people are not happy &mdash; and I would support this view &mdash; with this particular measure on the grounds that we are not tackling properly the problem of the low wage.  In my opinion this section will almost guarantee low wages.  I do not know what the trade union movement will say about it.  I do not know if they have made any comment about it.  I am certainly prepared to wager that where employers are paying low wages those firms are almost certainly not unionised. It will deserve a comment from the trade union movement and I will look with interest at their statement.  As the Bill says, and assuming that it becomes a reality, the maximum amount is £8 benefit in the case where there is one child and £15 where there are five children and arguably that is too low.  To qualify for the £8 benefit the man's income will have to be less than £63 a week and he will have to be in full-time employment.  Nobody in this House or elsewhere would say in this day and age and in that kind of situation that £63 a week is a fair wage.</P>
    <P>Some recognition should be given to the self-employed person.  We all know that in the case of self-employed people, small shopkeepers or people like that, their incomes have continued to dwindle over the years.  With Government taxes, rates at local government level and new charges for refuse and water and so on they find that their profits have dwindled. There are many of these people with small businesses earning less than £63 a week.  It is something perhaps the Minister might consider and do something positive about it.  In my opinion it is the wrong way to approach the question of <Col N="603" /> providing a basic adequate income for all families.  What is required is a statutory minimum wage.  I realise the Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn, made reference to this recently and said there would be some problems in this particular area but what we are now doing is simply making sure of a continuation of low wages.  It will be seen as a deliberate attempt to subsidise employers who pay low wages.</P>
    <P>I wish the measure every success.  I sincerely hope that it will be far more successful than the famous or infamous £9.60 per week that we all know about of some years back.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 to 30 dealing with local pension committees seem to have given rise to diverse views.  My view certainly is that many county councillors have played a magnificent role in this area.  I am sure you would be the first to accept that.  They have given up their time freely and voluntarily in that area and were glad to do so.  There are mixed feelings about this.  We rightly have to congratulate many local pension committees all over the country and they have in their wisdom carried out excellent work in the past. The fact that they are being abolished now is being greeted by the councillors with a degree of sadness.  Against that, many people who would be applicants for pensions tell me they would not apply or they have not applied because they did not like their business being talked about in the presence of five, six or eight elected members: that is their right; I can understand their feelings.  Certainly, the element of confidentiality should be present in all of these situations.  Indeed, one could argue that it was not so in the case of a local pension committee.  Nonetheless, the committee as we had it, did guarantee a full inquiry into the means of the person seeking the pension.  It meant that the social welfare officer examined the position very carefully and at the end of the day the committee decided on the amount of the pension based on the report of the social welfare officer.</P>
    <P>We are now told that a deciding officer will be the person responsible for this.  I ask who will the deciding officers be?  Will they be some of the superiors down the <Col N="604" /> country?  Will it be a new section based in Dublin?  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that when he is replying.  The question of the clerks has been referred to by the Minister and I would like to pay a compliment to the various clerks of these committees down through the years and I hope for a re-examination of the compensation envisaged in this particular area.</P>
    <P>The criticism in the past weeks of social welfare officers, in my opinion, is regrettable. I am not saying that this is the first time it happened.  Those social welfare officers should be above political interference in this way.  The criticism has come about largely because of last year's Social Welfare Act which created real, practical problems for small farmers, particularly those affected by the payment of social welfare assistance under the notional system.  It must be remembered that social welfare officers are working in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Department of Social Welfare, who in turn receive the guidelines from the Oireachtas.  If there is flak to be thrown, it should be thrown at the Minister for Social Welfare of the day.  It should not be thrown at the unfortunate people who are asked to operate within the guidelines set up by the Government of the day.  Indeed, if we wanted to change the guidelines this is the place to change them, or in the Dáil, or at the parliamentary party meetings of the various parties.</P>
    <P>I have to say that these men and women throughout the country are carrying out their work with great understanding and in a compassionate way. They have a very difficult role.  It is a role which, I think, has increased dramatically over the past few years.  It is understandable that in a time of recession that role should further increase.  It is true to say that their work is very varied and demanding.  It is expanding and, as I have said, they have carried it out with great responsibility, understanding and compassion.</P>
    <P>One could argue that there is a need for some extra training for these people. As I understand it, they receive some initial training.  It would be no harm &mdash;<Col N="605" /> perhaps the Minister would note this &mdash; that because of the changing demands of the social welfare system they should be brought back every two years or thereabouts for refresher courses to deal with the problems that exist and how they should be handled.  For example, it should be suggested that in so far as the farming community are concerned qualified people from ACOT would occasionally meet them and come to the refresher courses that I referred to.</P>
    <P>I know that many of them are ordinary people, many coming from urban areas who would not be all too happy discussing farming problems and trying to assess farming income and so on, and they might not be the most competent people in the world to come to a conclusion as far as depreciation of a farm tractor or rotavator or machinery generally is concerned. It is not their fault that this criticism has been levelled.  They are working within the guidelines set by the Minister. This area of social welfare officers is one that should be examined because they are chasing the wrong areas in my opinion: they are involved in dealing with perhaps 120 claims per month and find when they have cleared their desks of the 120 that 150 claims are in for the following month.  The pressure is building up on them all the time.  Despite embargoes or whatever, there is need for a big increase in social welfare officers.  What about the area of PRSI and incomes not being properly stated to the Revenue Commissioners?  I know that social welfare officers do not collect income but they can play a role and it might be a very worth while financial long-term consideration for the State if they were allowed to get on and do this type of work allied to the other work that we now know they do.  From time to time we see advertisements in the paper, asking people if they have returned their P35.  Again, how many prosecutions have we had in that regard?</P>
    <P>Extra social welfare officers would more than pay their way and certainly could help to bring in additional income to the State.  The abuses of the system are obvious and have been obvious.  We all know they take place.  I am not talking <Col N="606" /> about the man on the dole who might dig a garden for half a day and get a few pounds for it.  I am talking about the planned, organised abuse of the system that is taking place.  It is the abuse of the system whereby people sign not just in one town but maybe in four, five, or six different towns or cities for unemployment benefit or assistance and in a city like Dublin I believe there are people signing on at three or four different venues. That kind of abuse has to be stopped. I think that is the worst form of abuse and again if we had more staff we could tackle that problem to the benefit of the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the whole social welfare system and where we might go.  It is right that we should spell out precisely where our social welfare system is going.  It is generally accepted that there is need for a new approach to the whole question of the system and for that reason I would welcome the establishment of the social welfare commission that has been mentioned by the Minister but, having said that, I would ask if the work could not be done more expeditiously? Why do we have to wait two full years for the results of that report?  One of the basic objectives of our system must be to compliment those of our financial or economic policy and to help to tackle the causes of poverty and hardship in our society.  I do not think that our present system makes any real attempt to see how this poverty can be eliminated.  In the short term, in dealing with the matter that was discussed last week regarding the reform of local government, we might consider an allocation of some of the resources of the Department of Social Welfare to the various local authorities for the employment of currently unemployed persons who are in receipt of these funds in the form of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>To conclude, despite promises, statements and so on, on the formation of the present Coalition Government that social welfare beneficiaries should not be the victims of the recession I find very little in this Bill to support this argument. Really nothing worthwhile is in the Bill to tackle the problems of poverty and <Col N="607" /> hardship and there is nothing in it to ease the burden on the unemployed and the less well-off sections of our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Senator Fallon in extending a welcome to the Minister.  I wish him every success.  I know the Minister is a public representative of long standing and that his contact with the people and his knowledge of their hopes, problems and aspirations will contribute to making him an effective and caring Minister.  I wish him well.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I think the Minister for his comprehensive statement to the House which presents the Bill in all its wide-ranging aspects.  He points out the efforts being made by the Government to help the less well-off sections of the community, the genuine attempts made by increases to help to meet inflation and a general caring approach towards catering for those at the lowest income level.  It is good that the facts should be presented in such a way that we understand the huge amount that has to be paid out under this heading of social welfare, not just to inform people who complain that too much is being paid out, but to inform everybody in regard to what exactly is being done.  I believe that when all the figures are taken into account, whether you take it on the figure of £6 million a day or one-seventh of our GNP, it has to be conceded by those who might have been hoping for more that a genuine effort is being made to meet the problems confronting the less well-off sections of the community.  It is only fair that that should be done because there are two views prevailing and for that reason it is good to have a balanced presentation of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two views prevail.  There are the people who begrudge contributions of this magnitude to the unemployed, the old and infirm and there are those who think it is not enough.  Both sides could make cases which would detain you for a very long time if you chose to listen to them.  But it is the function of the Government and the Minister with direct responsibility to present a balanced view, <Col N="608" /> taking into account the views of the people on both sides of the divide, and for the Minister to do what he believes the country can afford and where possible to be sympathetic in his approach.  In all the circumstances that confront the people at present it cannot be denied that a caring approach was adopted by the Government and Ministers with regard to this section of the community and I welcome that heartily.</P>
    <P>Apart from the part of the Minister's statement that presents the background to the whole set-up &mdash; if I may use the expression &mdash; and the need there is for helping certain sections of the community and the difficulties that confront us in not being able to help to the degree we might like, there are some innovations which I will come to deal with later on and which I welcome enthusiastically.  These innovations &mdash; one in particular &mdash; bear testimony to what I have said in regard to the caring approach adopted by the Government and by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Increasing unemployment adds to the difficulty and one of the complaints most frequently heard with regard to unemployment &mdash; I am going to refer to it only briefly today &mdash; is that there is a growing belief that some of the funds channelled into relieving unemployment could be channelled into providing more work by being transferred from the social services section to the Department of the Environment to provide a greater workforce for road making, drainage and work of that kind which needs a lot of attention. There are difficulties in that area but it is an aspect of society that will have to be examined in great detail in time to come because the growing figures of unemployment are generally attributed to the worldwide recession from which we could not hope to escape.  It is also true that increased unemployment is in some significant degree due to technological advance and the greater the technological advance unfortunately, it would appear, the less the need for manpower.  If one only takes a casual look at the development of robots in car plants and so on it is brought home forcibly that the question of unemployment is going to be a major problem for a long time to come <Col N="609" /> and even with the improvement in the economy of which we see signs and which we anticipate, unemployment will still remain a problem.  It will then fall on people in authority to devise means of assisting able-bodied people to do gainful work by supplementing their incomes in some way with money from the social services.  I believe that day will come and the sooner we provide for it the better.  I am not naive enough to think it is a simple matter, but it is a problem that will confront us in the years not so far ahead.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, quite rightly, drawn attention to the problem of unemployment and has stated clearly that it is a problem of major concern to the country and the Government.  Frank statements of this kind are good.  The less favourable side of the picture should be presented to the public as well as the more optimistic side.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about an incentive to people to set up industries; I hope that is the beginning of something that will develop.  Everything possible that can be done to encourage initiative and help people to make practical use of the skills that so many of our young people are acquiring in our school system should be done.  Everything a Government can undertake to generate initiative of that kind by reliefs and benefits in every shape and form would have a beneficial effect in the long run.  We must take into account the vast increase in the allocation to the social welfare services in the last couple of years to recognise that it has been a growing problem and to record our appreciation of the way it was tackled.  I do that; it is a huge problem. If it was not handled efficiently and with expedition it could lead to great poverty, distress and frustration.  The approach as outlined in the Minister's speech is an indication that the Government by prompt action do not intend to let frustration develop or get out of control.</P>
    <P>I welcome most heartily the enterprise allowance scheme.  It is an indication of right thinking and I hope that that sort of thinking will be developed to its fullest potential.  I believe that the results that would accrue from a concentrated effort developed on those lines will be beneficial <Col N="610" /> to the State, to the economy in general and to the morale of the people.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a sincere tribute to the Minister for the introduction of the family income supplement scheme.  The Minister dealt with it in detail, so it would not serve any useful purpose for me to go over it again, except to say that I welcome it.  It is a clear, unmistakable indication of the caring attitude adopted by the Government, the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>On the abolition of the old age pension committees, I must say at this stage I am not sure that it is the correct decision for a number of reasons.  One reason is that applicants for pensions, whether old age or whatever, are not always articulate people.  They may not always be capable of presenting their case properly.  Very often they are intimidated by the very presence of an official from the Department. I must say with some regret that this intimidation is not wholly to be wondered at because of the approach that some of these officers have had &mdash; not all of them.  There are some very humane, considerate people who go around the country investigating pension claims. They are doing a good service to the State and to the people with whom they deal, but there are other officials whose approach is that the person who is applying is 100 per cent mendicant, that he or she has one purpose only, to get as much money as possible from the State by telling lies and so on.  That may happen today to a lesser degree than some years ago, but it is still happening.  I know of one or two instances of it happening in the last six months.</P>
    <P>A good purpose was served by the old age pension committee.  I was never a member of one but I know people who were: people of different political views from my own as well as some who shared my own views.  I know them all to be people who were in a position to put to the pension officer the case of the applicant because they lived near him, knew him, knew his family background.  Those people were much more capable of presenting the cases rather than the applicants themselves.  The case presented by those people was a more accurate picture <Col N="611" /> of the person's conditions than anything that some of these officers are able to get from the applicants by interviewing them, because of their approach, because of the timidity of some of the people in this regard and because they are not sufficiently articulate.  I would hope that this transition period that will occur when the old age pension committee is gone will be handled with care.  I am sure everybody in this House, and every public representative, knows people who would not have got the pension but for the case put forward by the local old age pension committee who knew all the facts.  That is true and I am sure other Members here will agree with me.</P>
    <P>It is also stated that the existence of such committees often held up payments. That may be true in some isolated cases. I know of pensions or allowances being held up for very long periods in cases where there was no local committee operating.  The delay was caused by the tardiness of the officials concerned in making the examinations or tendering reports, or acting on them when they reached the Department.  A local committee cannot be held accountable for those delays.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I welcome also the comprehensive statement that was made presenting the case to us in all its aspects.  I welcome the effort made to relieve the growing hardships imposed on people by inflation and I am glad to note the Minister's statement that it is expected that within a relatively short time inflation will be brought down to perhaps a figure as low as 5 per cent. Apart altogether from the effects it has on payments to social welfare classes, that will have a good effect on the economy of the country.  I agree with the Minister's concluding paragraph where he outlines three forms of action &mdash; first, the measures contained in the Bill which I believe are good; secondly, the Commission on Social Welfare's examination and, thirdly, the renewed combat poverty programme.  I believe that with these three ideas in mind the Minister will do a good job and that the people can see <Col N="612" /> we are making an honest effort, maybe not as great an effort as we would like, because of economic circumstances, to help those in need.  At the same time we are doing what we can under the provisions of this scheme to promote initiative. We have an appreciation of what the outlook of the Government is on this matter and I wish the Minister and the Government well and I hope the combat poverty programme will be effective.  I may say on a somewhat personal note that I was more than delighted to see that the Minister of Health had called Sister Stanislaus &mdash; a person with enormous experience in this area &mdash; back into the field to avail of her advice and help in combating poverty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He and I are members of the same local authority.  I wish him well in his new role.  As has been said by other speakers he has been a member of various authorities, be they local or national, for more than 21 years now.  Because of that I am sure he has a better knowledge of the needs of people than have some Ministers who have come in here without serving their apprenticeship, as it were, and who have attempted to address themselves to measures such as Social Welfare Bills.</P>
      <P>The Bill we are dealing with today is a Bill which merely enables the Government to increase in a marginal way the benefits which are available to people who are in social need, whether it be for unemployment purposes, disability, sickness or whatever.  Nevertheless, it is a very weak piece of legislation in the sense that it does not address itself at all to the causes of deprivation in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us that the setting up again of the Commission on Social Welfare will make a difference and that the establishment of an interim board to combat poverty will make changes. Nevertheless, when one looks at the background to this Bill one wonders about the Government's will to alleviate the problems.  I must say that if one looks at the problems and the way they are being alleviated it would seem as if a monetary compensation is the only compensation <Col N="613" /> that is available.  I do not think we should be so limited in our view of compensation for loss of earnings or loss of the ability to work.  Monetary compensation is only one element.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no mention of a re-education process in this Bill.  The social welfare beneficiary is supposed, by being granted a monetary sum each week, to retain his morale within the community and not to consider himself deprived.  The monetary compensation involved in this Bill will do nothing to raise the morale of the people who are in the unfortunate position of having to depend on social welfare.  It is about time that Ministers for Social Welfare got down to looking at the problems that are created by unemployment or disability and to look at them in terms of re-educating these people to be able to take a place within society which is not the place they had before but nevertheless a useful place.  There are voluntary groups which are helped by the State.  These groups are doing an immense amount of good.  The Rehabilitation Institute and other such bodies are helping the underprivileged and the disabled to return, not exactly to the mainstream of society, but to an area of work which helps them to maintain their dignity at all times.  This is the question to which future Social Welfare Bills will have to be addressed, rather than just giving percentage increases to people who are already in a difficult position.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the amount of money being spent this year is £2,156 million or £6 million a day, or whatever. It does not make any difference what the sum is.  It is a large amount of money and I do not think that the people who are getting this money are getting very good value.  The Minister of State would have to agree with me that in many places throughout the country the conditions under which benefits of any kind are given out leave a lot to be desired.  We have a situation in Kilkenny where it is an indignity for anybody who is involved in the system to have to queue outside the office in adverse weather conditions. The building is totally inadequate and was never meant to serve the purpose for which it is now used.  With the increasing <Col N="614" /> number of people who are looking for State benefits to which they are entitled, and for which they have paid, it is about time we addressed ourselves to providing proper facilities for these people where they can go in dignity and discuss their problems with the social welfare officer. It is about time we addressed ourselves to providing proper facilities for these people so that in dignity they may discuss their problems and have themselves examined either medically or in terms of eligibility for benefit.  There is no mention in the Bill of moneys being spent to provide proper facilities.  There must come from the Department of Finance a commitment that proper facilities will be provided, facilities equal to if not better than those that people would find in hospitals, clinics or any other place they might have to go to in the normal course of their business.  This year the benefits being provided are mainly benefits which are being allowed for only six months of this year and whether it be 7 per cent or 8 per cent the effective increase this year is not sufficient to give a real increase.</P>
    <P>Mention was made in the Minister's speech of inflation rates, of the fact that inflation rates are now lower than they have been in the past and that therefore there is a real benefit to social welfare beneficiaries because of this.  In the past three weeks we have had from the Government a statement that inflation this year has been running at a much higher level for the past three months than was the case in the same period last year.  The underlying level of inflation, rather than being 5 per cent as stated in the Minister's speech, is more likely to end up at 11 to 12 per cent so that the 3½ per cent annualised, or the 4 per cent annualised, that is being given to beneficiaries this year will not at all allow them a real level of increase in benefit.</P>
    <P>It is about time that the social welfare system was brought up to date.  We have a computer in Dublin and it is blamed for every delay, for every piece of inaction and for every flaw in the system.  It surely should not be outside the bounds of possibility that the Department of Social Welfare would regionalise their computer capacity.  There is not a business of <Col N="615" /> its magnitude dealing with the amount of money that is involved which would not have at least a terminal in every county. If it is not within the bounds of the money available, surely the Department should at least be able to have a computer terminal in every region, in every major city, so that the social welfare beneficiary could get on to the computer terminal in the city or town and find out exactly what is his situation rather than to have somebody else ringing Dublin, whether it be the social welfare officer, the officers in the Department of Labour, the local elected representatives or whoever.  In this way they would not have to be shuffled around at the benefits section to find out what their situation is.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to ensure that in the very near future we will have a series of computer terminals around the country so that we could deal with the problems that arise much more rapidly than is the case at present.  This would help not alone the beneficiaries but it would help the social welfare officers who, rather than having to write to Dublin, could immediately tap the RSI number into the computer terminal and get the required information.  This would enable them to deal more speedily with the problems that are arising at present.</P>
    <P>The delays being experienced are purely delays in communication.  I do not think there is anybody in the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Labour who is deliberately trying to hold up the payment of benefit but the system as it is currently being operated has militated against efficiency and speed.  It is all right for us to stand here and talk about the problems the social welfare beneficiary has.  We in this House will be paid our salaries at the end of every month.  Even if we do not get them on the very last day of the month, or the first day of the next month, somebody will be able to carry us through until the next week, but a social welfare beneficiary who is not paid his cheque on the Thursday morning or the Friday morning on which it is due is in a totally different situation.  He may have severe problems getting enough food to keep him going <Col N="616" /> until his next cheque arrives.  I do not think people should have to suffer the indignity of being without food or of having to go to anybody outside the system to get help when they are entitled to their payment on the due date.  Again, for this reason I appeal to the Minister to ensure that there will be an updating in communications as between the beneficiary and the Department.</P>
    <P>We must praise the community welfare officers right around the country.  They are doing a tremendous job under very difficult circumstances.  The community welfare officer is bearing the brunt of the problems because he is the one to whom every problem is sent.  The social welfare officer can do nothing in terms of giving a supplementary benefit.  All he can do is to try to proceed with the normal working of the Department.  The community welfare officer is a man to whom everybody goes when stuck for payment.  These officers are doing a tremendous amount of social work but they seem to be better equipped in terms of public relations and to be better educated in how to deal with people than are some of our social welfare officers who, in all fairness, were never trained to deal with the public.  This is why, as Senator O'Brien has said, many problems arise when a social welfare officer goes out to try to assess the means of a person who is looking for benefit. The attitude sometimes can be misunderstood by the person who is looking for the benefit.  This can result in a stress situation.</P>
    <P>The social welfare officer might be doing exactly the job he is supposed to be doing.  He may be dealing with the case as sympathetically as is possible but, nevertheless, one has to realise that when somebody if looking for benefit he is under a strain.  People who are not trained in psychology or in public relations are often not able to get across that they are asking these questions for the benefit of the beneficiary rather than for the benefit of the Department and that they are not there to block payment to anybody who deserves it.  If we could have the same type of sympathetic approach by the social welfare officers as <Col N="617" /> we have by the community welfare officers the system would probably work better.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the proposal in the Bill to abolish the local pension committees. There are mixed views on this. I resigned from an old age pension committee because I did not consider that such committees were the right vehicle for dealing with this problem.  I felt that although the people on the local health committees had an intimate knowledge of the people in the locality, sometimes over-enthusiastically, they might have granted an increase in pension or a new pension to a person only to find that subsequently their decision was subject to a review by the social welfare officer. There were people who would get in touch with an applicant and tell him he had been granted an old age pension increase but two months later, after further investigation, the amount of money that was granted by the committee was taken away because it never should have been granted.  For that reason I considered it a little hypocritical to serve on one of those committees.  Having said that, there are many good reasons for continuing this system.  The local knowledge of people who have worked on these committees has helped to personalise the system. In many cases it has helped to break the barrier as between officialdom and the people of the locality.  It has helped the person who is looking for an old age pension, or for an increase in an old age pension, to get a personal hearing.  That personal hearing and the knowledge the members of the old age pension committees have had have probably broken down the bureaucracy that has tended to dominate this area for too long. Although, on a personal basis, I would not agree with the old age pension committees, on balance they serve a genuine social purpose.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill deals with the enterprise allowance scheme.  It states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1A) Notwithstanding section 72, the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations providing that, for the purposes of a scheme administered by the <Col N="618" /> Department of Labour and known as the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, a person accepted into that Scheme who, if he had continued to be unemployed, would be entitled to continue to receive pay-related benefit, shall be entitled, subject to such conditions as may be specified in the regulations, to receive such benefit in the form of a lump sum equivalent to the amount which he would otherwise have received in respect of the unexpired portion (subject to a maximum of 26 weeks) of the relevant period of interruption of employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That makes very good sense but what does not make very good sense to me is the case of a person who wishes to start off his own business, who has found the means of starting in business immediately on losing his job but who does not get any benefit from the enterprise allowance scheme.  There should be a period of perhaps 26 weeks after a person loses his job, and he should get the benefit for that period even if he starts an enterprise within that time.  The situation at present is that if a person is honest enough not to go on benefit, having lost a job, and starts off an enterprise on his own, he gets absolutely nothing by way of this section because he would have had to be unemployed for a certain period.  By being unemployed he would have got benefit from the State but because of an anxiety to start off immediately people totally miss out on this enterprise allowance scheme although their problems in the initial 26 weeks would be enormous.  I should like the Minister to consider the development of the enterprise allowance scheme for the person who has the ability or the opportunity to go into business within a short time.  I do not mean someone going into a safe job, transferring from one Department to another, or from one job to another, but where a person is made redundant.  He must be allowed some benefit if he starts off on his own within a very reasonable period after being laid off.</P>
    <P>The situation in regard to pay-related benefit disturbs me now that the floor has been raised from £36 to £44.  This means <Col N="619" /> that quite a few people will suffer.  The amount of money that will be saved by raising this ceiling is £2 million.  This is not an enormous sum of money but it will create problems when people are being made redundant.  In the Minister's statement we are referred back to 1973-74 when £7 was the floor and now it is being brought up to £44, and that consequently there is an increase.  I do not think we should be referring back to any time.  If we are going to refer back to 1973-74 in that manner we must equally refer back to 1973-74 and refer to the tax take from somebody's wages at that time.  There is absolutely no doubt that at the lower levels of income the tax is much higher now than it was.  So there is no point in referring back in monetary terms and saying the floor has been raised.  The floor has not been raised because taxation bands have narrowed and levels of taxation have increased.  That will create many difficulties when people are negotiating for pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the Minister's statement is that the Social Welfare Bill is to provide a redistribution of resources, a redistribution of income, a redistribution of welfare and a redistribution of power. I feel, equally, that we must have a situation whereby those at work must be paid for the work they do.  I am not suggesting that the people who will become involved in payments under the Social Welfare Bill should be equated in any way to people who work, but I think work must be given the place in society that it had in previous years and that those who work must at least be given some incentive to work.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the family income supplement.  It was stated that 35,000 families will come under this family income supplement section of the Bill.  The figure mentioned is 35,000 and it would appear that £63 per week is the level of income that is being set by the Department as the poverty line.  Mention was made of a Combat Poverty Organisation. There are many people who would suggest that £63 per week for a married couple with one child is well below the poverty line that the combat poverty committee would suggest.  If we <Col N="620" /> are bringing in a family income supplement we must have it set at a reasonable level and not have it set as it is at £63 per week for one child or, in the example given: upper income level, £125 a week, weekly family income £85, a difference of £40, amount of supplement 25 per cent of £40, or £10 a week.  We should, instead be taking the level of family income below which the maximum supplement would be payable for a one child family, which is £63, and that would give a supplement of £8.</P>
    <P>It will be interesting to see how that particular part of the Bill will be implemented. It has been mentioned that once it is given it will be allowed for a full 12 months.  It will be interesting to see then, if it is allowed for a full 12 months, if there is an increase in salary into that family in what way it will be treated for income tax purposes.  There is no mention as to whether this family income supplement will be taxed.  Judging by the wording of the Bill it appears that it will be granted for a 12-month period.  If it is granted under the Social Welfare Bill I would like to know if it will be a taxable extra allowance, because it appears to me that if it is to be taxable that it is not a true increase.  If it is a supplementary grant it should not be taxable.  I would like to know what the intention of the Minister is on this because it will be important when we get to Committee Stage and we are addressing ourselves to that item that we know whether it will be a taxable or a non-taxable supplement.</P>
    <P>I ask that in future years the Social Welfare Bill will address itself not only to monetary compensation for deprivation but that it will address itself to alleviating the problems other than monetary problems which are associated with unemployment or disability, that we will have a Social Welfare Bill that will take the dignity of the person totally into account rather than bringing in each year a compensatory Bill which increases in a small or large measure the amount of money that deprived people get.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers from both sides of the House I would like to concur with their expressions of welcome <Col N="621" /> for the Minister of State, and, like the only speaker who has spoken from this side of the House so far, Senator Andy O'Brien, I would like to welcome the Bill.  I concur with the sentiments expressed by the Minister of State in his opening address when presenting the Bill in which he again reaffirmed his stated determination to ensure that social welfare recipients, their dependants and their living standards will be protected. This Bill does this.</P>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed in the other House by the Minister rebutting the misguided criticism from some quarters in relation to the projected cost of the Social Welfare Bill for this year, which is £2,156 million as already referred to by Senator Fallon.  At a time like this we must reaffirm very definitely our social and moral commitment to the principle that the thousands of genuine people who depend on social welfare must be protected at all times but particularly at times like this when they more than any other section are subjected to the harsh, recessionary buffeting of the wind.  I believe that this Social Welfare Bill does this and that it makes a very genuine attempt to keep the standard of living of all sections who are depending on social welfare in line with the cost of living.</P>
      <P>In that regard I welcome particularly the two innovations in the Bill, that is the family income supplement and the introduction of the concept of indexation of rates.  I would also agree with the Minister's affirmation in the other House that virtually all social welfare payments made to recipients are spent on basic goods, basic items, basic services, in other words, the necessities of life. Therefore they play a significant role in maintaining consumer demands and thereby protecting jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is reasonable to assume that all Members of this House hold absolutely no brief whatever for the minority of people who abuse various forms of social welfare.  Indeed, it is fair to assume that we unanimously laud all attempts to root out and to eliminate such abuses not alone because they taint the deserving <Col N="622" /> majority but also because they syphon off money that rightfully belongs to others.</P>
    <P>The single greatest area of controversy in the present social welfare system is the concept of unemployment assistance, commonly referred to as small farmers' dole.  I am quite prepared to acknowledge that the old notional system, which was abolished in July 1982, was a very convenient form of assessment.  It was convenient for the recipients, for the social welfare officers and for the politicians who had their workload considerably diminished by virtue of the facility this particular form afforded to them.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that despite the reservations of other people I fundamentally have no quibble whatever with the alternative system which has been introduced to replace the notional system, that is the introduction of factual assessment.  In fairness, the Minister has been very fair, specific, and precise.  He has specified quite clearly what exactly he means by factual assessment.</P>
    <P>There is nothing very difficult about it. You calculate a farmer's gross income, you calculate the expenses necessarily incurred by him in the running of his farm during the previous 12 months, you subtract the latter from the former and you arrive at his net income; in layman's terms, what his clear profit is.  The new form of social welfare is supposed to be based on this clear profit or this net income but this, unfortunately, is not happening.</P>
    <P>It has been common practice when the officers carry out the assessment that they make a very detailed, very factual assessment of gross income which will essentially be based on any one of the five following categories: milk returns, stock sales, headage payments, suckler grants or capital.  What is not happening and what I object to, what has caused a lot of the furore in relation to this particular form of assessment is that the specific instructions of the Minister <i>vis-à-vis</i> the assessment of the actual cost involved in the running of the farm the previous 12 months have not been adhered to.</P>
    <P>The scenario very often is, but not always &mdash; I give credit to some social <Col N="623" /> welfare officers &mdash; that the social welfare officer arrives unannounced.  He simply asks the farmer what his costs were for the previous 12 months.  How in the name of heaven can any farmer, no matter how small he is, be expected to say off the top of his head all the costs involved in the running of his farm for the previous 12 months?  How can he possibly, at absolutely no notice whatsoever, give details for the previous 12 months of his replacement stock, his tractor diesel, his tractor tax, his tractor insurance, tractor servicing, the driving licence involved and his car tax.  In the west many holdings are fragmented, which means that the farmer has to use his car to travel twice, maybe three times, daily to inspect stock on outlying land.</P>
    <P>The costs involved for any farmer are his car insurance, his car servicing, petrol, fertiliser, lime, lime-spreading, feeding, veterinary calls, dosing, AI, sprays, weedkillers, drainage maintenance &mdash; again in the west of Ireland this is an integral part of the running and the maintenance of any farm &mdash; his group water scheme, again a basic cost, particularly on dairy farms where most of the water consumed is for the purpose of maintaining the dairy.  There is as well his farm clothing, again a genuine cost, farm utensils, farm phone calls, haymaking, silage making, fencing, ESB, liners and detergents, the bales he very often has to purchase because of inadequate fodder on the land, the hire of labour, haulage, sheep-dipping, building repairs, bank, ACC or some other building agency interest, machinery purchased, sheep-shearing etc.  There are up to 38 items of expenditure there and it is simply not on to expect any farmer, even farmers who keep their accounts meticulously, to be able to give these costs off the top of their heads.  As a result what has been happening is that time and time again totally exaggerated and inflated net income figures have been set down against small farmers, thereby depriving them of their just entitlements.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate that I hold absolutely no brief whatever for anybody who abuses the social welfare system.  The facts are that over £1 million has been <Col N="624" /> taken out of circulation in the west of Ireland as a result of this particular system. Hundreds, indeed thousands, of people have had their dole totally withdrawn or substantially reduced.  In many cases this is because social welfare officers either did not know or did not want to know the meaning of true factual assessment.  I know that the Minister on more than one occasion has come to the defence of social welfare officers.  I know that he did so particularly in the introduction of this Bill in the other House.  I know that not once has he accepted that the criticisms of the application of the system, which we are objecting to, are valid.  Does the Minister really believe that the individual voices that have come time and time again from the 12 western counties are not justified?</P>
    <P>Does he believe that the collective voices that have come from the west of Ireland time and time again over the past 12 months are not justified?  Does he not accept that the criticisms that have come in cohort and in concert with these from the IFA, the ICMSA and from a television programme in relation to this particular form again are all unjustified?  How can the Minister explain the fortunes of, in my particular area, QC 56, 178, 52, 118, 52, 523, 55, 443, 70, 026 or 61, 713 in a concentrated small area of County Mayo, all of whom under the notional system were receiving between £18 and £45 per week, all of whom as a result of alleged factual assessment had their entitlement totally withdrawn, all of whom as a result of a long tedious appeal process had their entitlements restored?  Surely there is something wrong when somebody goes from £35 to zero to £35.  What is wrong is that the initial assessment was not a factual assessment, or was not carried out in accordance with the precise criteria laid down by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister may make the argument that these people in fact receive arrears of payment if they find their claims and their appeals are justified. Will the Minister and the Minister of State say what these people are supposed to live on in the meantime?  Would they not concur with the legal principle that justice delayed it justice denied?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> I agree that there are staff problems. I concur entirely with Senator Fallon when he says that there should be additional staff.  I have spoken to individual social welfare officers who tell me that the time apportionment for the carrying out of assessment is simply, in the case of the workload, too great, and the time too little.  I call the House's attention to the remark made by Mr. Tom McKevitt of the Civil Service Union some weeks ago on a &ldquo;Day by Day&rdquo; programme when he admitted that because of time structures the questioning that was carried out by social welfare officers had to be carried out on a rapid basis.  The system is an archaic outmoded system.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to remarks, and comments made by Mr. Bill Kelleher, senior inspector of the Department of Social Welfare, also on a &ldquo;Day by Day&rdquo; programme, when he admitted that it was permissible for social welfare officers to go to an applicant's neighbour in order to extract the truth, in other words, to determine if the applicant was telling the truth or if he had some other source of income.</P>
    <P>This is a despicable form of assessment if it condones this particular <i>modus operandi.</i> Any system which is based, as this system is based to an extent, on rumour, innuendo, anonymous letters and anonymous telephone calls, no matter how authoritative the voice may be at the other end of the line, should in fact, be streamlined and be brought into the realm of the second half of the twentieth century.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State in the Department of Social Welfare to introduce some basic reforms in this area for their own sakes, the sake of the social welfare officers and most important, for the sake of the applicants. Will the Department notify people in advance that it is the intention of the social welfare officer to call within a specific period of time?  I am not asking them to give the precise day or time.  Of course, this would afford the person who is on, what we call &ldquo;the nixer&rdquo; the chance to be at home on that particular day.  Surely a person is entitled to 21 or 28 days basic notice of the intention of the Department <Col N="626" /> to reassess him?  I ask also that a complete list of the expenses that go into the formation of income be furnished in advance to these people so that, coolly and calculatedly they may come up with what the true figure of net income is.</P>
    <P>I ask the Department to speed up appeals process by (a) the provision of additional staff and (b) the adoption of the two previous points which I have made.  I maintain that if the system was streamlined and if people knew in advance what the precise entitlements were it would considerably reduce the number of appeals.  I also ask that some basic threshold figure is introduced.  As far as I know, it is the only form of social welfare that does not have a basic exemption levy.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to please change the title of this form of assistance.  Will he change it from small farmers' dole and from its more respectable appendage, unemployment assistance.  These people are not unemployed.  Indeed, they are fully employed, but the problem is that they are fully employed in substandard holdings which, because of the poor quality of the land, means that they have to work all the harder in order to eke out a slender living.  I conclude, with a remark that I have made twice during my contribution. I hold absolutely no brief whatever with anybody who abuses the social welfare code.  I merely ask for fair play.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers I want to say that there are many demands on the time of the Minister of State and he does not get credit for a lot of the work he does.  I am sure he will be perfectly satisfied if he can improve the lot of the weaker sections of our community. The improvements announced in this Bill were already announced in the budget so people will be aware of what increases they are getting.  The unfortunate thing is that those increases are so far away.  Some of them are postponed until next August.  It is regrettable that those benefits could not be paid much earlier. I am sure it would be possible to pay those increases much earlier, but the Government are saving some millions of <Col N="627" /> pounds by postponing them until July or August.</P>
      <P>When one considers the present rate of inflation, which is running at approximately 10 per cent &mdash; part of this inflation rate is the direct result of Government policy and taxes imposed in the budget last January &mdash; the increase of 7 per cent and 8 per cent granted to social welfare recipients is not sufficient to keep in line with the cost of living.  Many of those people who are on the poverty line cannot provide themselves with the necessities of life from the benefits they are receiving.  The growth in social welfare spending in recent years has highlighted the number of people depending on social welfare.  Many new schemes have been introduced over the years such as free travel, free electricity, free television and radio licences for the old people, pay-related benefit, wet time pay, holiday pay and so on.  All of those schemes have helped to ease the lot of the less well off sections of our community.</P>
      <P>Unemployment, which is the cancer of our society at present, is a severe drain on the resources of the Department of Social Welfare.  The money spent in 1984 on unemployment support will amount to £580 million, over a quarter of all social welfare expenditure.  This should be a matter of serious concern to the Government. Every effort should be made to provide employment and so reduce the huge number who are at present depending on social welfare.  It is indeed sad to see the numbers of able bodied men and women signing on for assistance each week.  Those people would prefer to have jobs and be at work.  The money being paid to them could be paid to improve the benefits for all the other people who are in severe need of social benefits such as the old, disabled and those who are no longer able to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator J. Higgins made a very strong case for the small farmers in the west of Ireland.  I concur with everything he had to say on that matter.  Those of us who have been representing the west of Ireland in recent years have had to put up with a lot of criticism from people who have lost their assistance, their small <Col N="628" /> farmer's dole.  I believe they are being dealt with in a particularly harsh manner under this new review that has taken place in recent times.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State, who is a reasonable person, will take note of what the western representatives have to say about this matter.  We know that the western small farmer does not have the advantages that his counterparts in the other parts of the country have.  He has the problem of having fragmented holdings and cannot produce crops or cattle in the same way as the people in the midlands or the south of Ireland can. Therefore, he is handicapped from the word go.</P>
    <P>The small farmer's assistance has been part of his income over a number of years.  As Seantor J. Higgins said, he is not unemployed.  This assistance was granted in the first instance to supplement his income for a small holding.  In many cases where this has been taken away from him it has imposed terrible hardship on that particular family.  I know cases in my own area where married farmers with families have lost up to £70 or £80 per week in assistance.  There is nothing to replace it and there is no chance of a job.  One of the main reasons why they have lost that assistance is that, according to the social welfare officer's assessment, the income from that small farm has exceeded the prescribed figure.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, most of the people affected are those who have been sending milk to the creameries, and I do not know what system the officer applies in estimating their income from that.  I suppose it is easy enough to estimate their income, because all they have to do is to get the receipts of the cheques that were paid out to them, but I wonder if they give the farmer the full advantage of the amount that he paid for meals and other expenses in trying to produce that milk.  In some cases I know of he certainly has not done that.</P>
    <P>There should be a different system applied in assessing income from those kind of people, because at present the Department of Social Welfare officers are doing more in their efforts to reduce <Col N="629" /> the milk lake than the summit in Brussels. They are driving those farmers away from the only system of farming that is suitable for them, where they have a regular income every week, every month or whenever the cheque comes out, supplemented by the few pounds social assistance they were getting.  They are very worried at present because they can see no future on those farms for themselves or for their families unless they are given assistance.  Not alone did the farmers benefit from this assistance because they were able to support their families and to plough some of the money back into developing the farms by fertilising, liming and in many cases draining them, but also the small business people in the west benefited from this assistance.  Indeed many business in towns in the west would have closed years ago if it were not for the support they were getting from people who were in receipt of the unemployment assistance every week and who came into town to spend those few pounds to buy groceries and other provisions for their families, which kept the whole thing going.</P>
    <P>I hope that representatives of the Fine Gael and Labour parties will highlight those problems at their party meetings, because we could all see this coming after the introduction of the Social Welfare Bill last year which caused ripples within the Labour Party and which saw the departure of Deputy Bell.  He knew the problems that this Bill was going to create, and his fears are now realised.</P>
    <P>There is no point in blaming the social welfare officers.  They are carrying out the wishes of the Minister and the Government, and that is why it is up to Fine Gael and Labour now to make sure that that system is changed.  It was a bad day for the west when the rateable valuation system was abolished.  The present system in operation is particularly suitable for the big farmer, and that is why those big farmers were anxious to get rid of the rateable valuation system. Unfortunately, many of the small farmers in the west, by their contributions at the marts, co-ops and so on paid some of the court costs to get rid of that system.  They now can see the disadvantages which are <Col N="630" /> highlighted every day.  I ask the Minister to be more lenient in his approach to those people.  As I said at the outset, they have not the advantages that farmers in the better off areas have.  They rely to a great extent on the social assistance that has been paid to them down through the years and it is frightening for any family to lose £40 to £60 per week, with nothing to replace it, with markets and problems in the area of milk production as they are today.  I hope the Minister will take that into consideration in dealing with those problems.</P>
    <P>We certainly welcome the improvements that have taken place which are being initiated in this Bill, and hope that in the next year or so we will see a definite reduction in the number of people who are depending on social benefits, particularly young able bodied people who have some contribution to make to this country, but who, unfortunately, are not able to get the jobs that they so wish for.  I hope that the world economy will improve and that the economy of this country will follow suit in due course.  It is my wish that when we come back to review a new Bill in 1985 we will see some improvements in the number of people who are unemployed at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in welcoming Deputy Pattison, the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare.  I worked with him for ten years on a health board and I know his commitment in the area of health and social welfare.  He has plenty of expertise to offer this Department.  I wish him well in it and in his first visit to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have before us legislation which is urgent because of the date on which some of the requirements of the Bill come into operation.  There are a few comments I want to make on various sections of the Bill arising out of the Minister's Second Stage speech.  Of course we on this side of the House will never be really satisfied with the amount of money we can offer to people under this heading.  The rates of unemployment assistance, long term unemployment assistance or disability benefit can never be as high as we would like them to be, but we must have due <Col N="631" /> regard to the finances of the Exchequer and the amount of money available to us.</P>
    <P>I would not like it to go out from this House and from this debate that the people who are beneficiaries under this are getting something from the State to which they are not entitled.  People contribute to the social welfare fund while they are working or able to work, and it is designed as an insurance scheme to buffer them against unemployment or ill health which occurs through no fault of theirs.  There have been condemnations of people who are idle for long periods, that they have lost their incentive to work.  As a public representative, I have never come across that attitude.  Fundamentally, people are happier if they have a job and if the level of income from it is enough to sustain themselves and their family &mdash; basically that is the philosophy of most people.  We must not be unmindful of the people who will never be able to work through mental or physical disability or through ill health.  A Government must have regard for people in that category, so when we make comments on the Bill about levels of payment or whether people are getting too much or too little we must have regard to the fact that they are drawing this income from a fund into which they have contributed.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, the Minister for Labour, has spoken about the possibility of ensuring that public works should be carried out and contemplated by people who are unemployed and available for work.  This will take quite a lot of discussion at different levels between the trade union movement and those of us who have an interest in this area.  The philosophy is excellent, but when putting it into practice we must be mindful of the fact that no Government Department can plunder a social welfare fund which has been contributed to by people at work and by their employers.  Once we establish that criterion we can make progress.  I am happy with the rates of increase, taking into consideration last year's increases and the overall increase in inflation between last year and this year.  Beneficiaries under this Bill will just about hold <Col N="632" /> their own.  For that reason, some of the other sections in the Bill have been welcomed by speakers from both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the area dealing with the raising of the floor in the pay-related benefit section.  If we accept the fundamental principles behind the pay-related scheme when it was initiated, people paid a contribution into the fund based on their earnings at the time and their level of compensation must be comparable to the earnings that they had when they are unemployed or ill.  These are the fundamental principles behind pay-related contributions.  If you start precluding people at the top end from benefiting or if you raise the floor at the bottom end before the benefit, the whole concept of pay-related is certainly open to question.  There could be a strong argument made that contributions into the pay-related scheme should begin only at the level of pay from which he would benefit; if there is a tapering off at the top end, possibly there should be a tapering off of the contributions there also. Once we start making movements at either end of the scale the scheme will be open to criticism by employers, who contribute quite a lot to it, and by employees who also contribute and who now have reservations about the benefits of the pay-related scheme, principally because they are taxed on the pay-related element before the actual pay-related or income tax is taken from their wages.  This is double taxation.  The farming community have used the same argument regarding the health contribution on the basis that allowances are not made for capital investment.  It is a levy on an income.  If you talk about pay-related as being a levy on an income, we must apply the same principle under that heading as well.</P>
    <P>Last year we made changes in this regard to remove the anomaly of people benefiting more by being out of work than by working and contributing to the system.  Something needed to be done to ensure that there was no disincentive for people to go to work.  This is why I am so pleased that within this Bill we have new sections which open up a whole new spectrum within the social welfare code of <Col N="633" /> incentives to people to do something to help themselves.  One of these is the enterprise allowance scheme which does not penalise somebody for being a small entrepreneur or somebody who is unemployed and has an idea that he could possibly use it to better himself, to make a living and possibly to start a small industry. I know people who have done this succesfully under the guidance of the county council and with the help of the Youth Employment Agency, AnCO and other agencies.  I am delighted that people can now do it under this scheme and that the Government has extended it.  It has been such a success that it deserves all the support that the Government and indeed all parties within the Oireachtas can give to it.</P>
    <P>Pay-related benefit payments as a result of redundancies or otherwise can be used as a lump sum to invest.  I hope that the Minister for Finance will treat this kind of input in the same favourable way as we are now treating risk capital in the Finance Bill coming before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the near future.  If people invest money which will create employment they are treated favourably, thus ensuring that there is an incentive to invest money.  This incentive, I hope, will also be available to unemployed people who have lump sums available to them under redundancy payments and the pay-related scheme.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement has been talked about for some time.  I am glad that we thought of the idea.  Unfortunately, a general election intervened between our first intention to initiate the scheme and the bringing to fruition and I know the parliamentary draftsman had some problems in this area.  Senator Fallon, in making a very reasoned contribution to the debate, expressed reservations that perhaps this might be abused by employers and that the real way to tackle this problem was to have a minimum wage paid to people which he felt would solve the problem.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement and our party as a political unit have looked at this question of a minimum wage.  On the deepest examination of the problem there is no doubt whatsoever that the <Col N="634" /> moment you have a minimum statutory wage it becomes the maximum norm. People who feel that they would benefit from a minimum wage would soon realise that it is the maximum wage.  This is why this scheme is called the family income supplement.  People at work with one child could be earning the same wages as a person with ten children.  Surely there is inequality here?  The employer does not necessarily have any responsibility for a man working for him in the number of children that he has to support, or his ability to support them.</P>
    <P>This is why the family income supplement is so important in that it starts for the first time on the lower end of the scale for people who are employed at an income of £96 per week with one child and increasing upwards with the number of children for which that person has responsibilities to maintain.  Because of this I hope that no employer will abuse this family income supplement.  I hope that a parent who has a large number of children and getting a family income supplement from the State will not mean that he would get a lesser amount of pay; this would not be acceptable.  The trade union movement will not accept it and it is certainly not what the Government intended for this particular family income supplement scheme.  It is intended to help people at the lower income level with larger families to try to overcome the problem which has arisen in the past when it paid people with large families to be unemployed.  When tax consessions and the benefits from reduced differential rents of local authority houses and all other concessions are taken into consideration, there were times when people with large families were better off on unemployment benefit and pay-related than if they were at work.  This supplement is paid to people only if they are at work.  It must be seen by everybody who studied this problem of small incomes and large families that people must have an incentive to work.  I look on it as only the first step and we can only see how beneficial it will be when it is in operation for some time.  I suggest that after 12 months or two years of operation the Minister and his Department look at <Col N="635" /> how it has worked to see if it has met the problem applicable at present in that category of income earner.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the section that deals with the movement into land leasing or getting away from the conacre system which has been the scourge of all land lettings for so long.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State responsible is doing something constructive, and I hope that a Bill will be initiated in this House soon to stimulate an interest in the whole concept of land leasing.  When we applied the means test under the Social Welfare Act at present to people who have let their land under conacre, there was a disincentive to do so simply because the capital value of the land was taken as a means of assessment for social welfare purposes when the correct means of assessment would have been the income which that land could have earned if it was leased to somebody on a long-term basis.  It is a most welcome section, and I hope that the person who owns the land and leases it will benefit and will not be penalised by the social welfare code; that the people using the land will have a genuine means of income that will also be subjected, if they so wish, to the social welfare code if they feel that the income from the land they have let is not sufficient to maintain them in a reasonable degree of comfort.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, has made a public announcement to this effect.  We did not initiate the review of the PLV system that was outside our control, but we must accept the fact that the courts found it unconstitutional and other means of determining people's income had to be decided.  How can somebody's income be decided based on the valuation if that basis is found to be unconstitutional? This House and the other House were left with no alternative but to implement a scheme of assessing people's means and their profits or otherwise from small holdings.</P>
    <P>We got an assurance from the Minister for Health that in the implementation of the review of people who, for the first time, were in a low valuation basis the <Col N="636" /> people at the top of the bracket would be the first to be assessed.  Unfortunately, I am told that when inspectors from the Department were in the area they subjected smallholders with £5, £6 and £7 valuation to a means test when they should have known that very few people in that valuation bracket would have an income that could sustain a wife and family anywhere in the western counties. The Minister will have to tidy up the means of assessment for people under the various headings of health boards and social welfare.  Otherwise there will be anomalies which any system will throw up and people will then be unhappy about being assessed in a different manner from that used by a different section of the same Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the role of so called employment exchanges; they are generally termed to be unemployment exchanges, because that is where unfortunate people have to queue in the rain, under a system which is degrading, to sign their names.  That is unacceptable, and we have not made any effort to ensure that proper facilities are available to people who have to degrade themselves when signing on at unemployment exchanges.  I always felt that the role of an unemployment exchange was to ensure that an effort would be made to place people in employment if it was available in the area.  I gather that that role has now been taken on by Manpower, who register people in different categories of unemployment as being available for work and the two agencies should work closely together.</P>
    <P>The payment of employment officers should not be dependent on the number of people registered for unemployment. In other words, the number of people unemployed at a particular exchange determines the level of remuneration of the person in the employment office.  The reverse should be the case. An incentive should be given to each employment officer in the exchanges who manages to procure a job for a person who is signing as being eligible and available for work on a particular day.  That should be their role.  If we move towards <Col N="637" /> that we might make some impact on the black economy as it is commonly and unpopularly known.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon made the suggestion that people abuse the system to the extent that they can sign at five or six exchanges in the one city on the one day and draw allowances from each of them.  If that happens &mdash; it is possibly an exaggeration &mdash; the Department should look into it. There have been complaints that people who are working are signing on.  That is an abuse of the system.  However, I do not blame the recipient of the social welfare system, I blame the employer who allows that system to go on simply because he has a vested interest in either not reporting the situation because he benefits; he has cheap labour available to him, he has no responsibilities about paying PRSI contributions, deducting PAYE or registering his enterprise and so on when he knows that the person he has working for him is already signing on at the employment exchange.  Even if it was reported by the employment exchange, by a member of the Garda or by an officer in the Department of Social Welfare and even if the person is found to be working no action can be taken legally to stop the abuse of the system unless the employer is prepared to state that he was employing the person.  That is putting a tremendous onus on the employer, and unless they are prepared to accept that onus the system will be abused.</P>
    <P>I am making these comments so that the Minister will be aware of my views on it.  I will fight to ensure that a proper level is paid to people who genuinely are unable to work, who cannot get work or who have been made redundant.  I hold no brief for those who play the system for their own benefit whether they are employers or employees.  I cannot be fairer than that, I am speaking from experience and I hope the Minister will take my comments in the spirit in which they have been given.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the abolition of old age pension committees.  I have been a member of a committee for many years and they have been working on a voluntary basis.  I have always had the gravest reservations about our functions. <Col N="638" /> Firstly, applicants should not be expected to appear before us and disclose their private lives, private incomes and assets, no matter how small, where they were and the amount of money available, information that was already available by law to the investigating officer.  I always thought it was degrading to expect people to give this information to elected politicians who always proposed that a higher rate of pension would be payable.  Of course they would say that because it was their constituent who was before them. They always ask the appeals officer to review the case and propose that a higher rate of pension be payable.  Recognising that that odious system of means goes on anyway in the case of non-contributory pensions, it is sufficient to have to disclose that information in confidence to a deciding officer.</P>
    <P>I hope the system will ensure that people will be given a fair crack of the whip.  If further information becomes available to public representatives or anybody else involved in the community or social services provided by health boards or voluntary agencies, I hope the Department will be open to receive representations on behalf of people who have been allocated a lower pension than the amount to which they would be entitled.</P>
    <P>If that safety factor is there I am satisfied that the old age pension committees will serve no further useful purpose.  I often wondered what useful purpose they served apart from giving help to the people coming to them who thought they had friends there to intervene between them and bureaucracy.  They looked on the Department as an element of bureaucracy which tried to preclude them from getting what they were entitled to. From my knowledge working with the Department and Ministers the attitude always has been that they do everything possible to ensure that a person gets his entitlement.  I hope that this facility will be still available to us.  I hope there will not be any controversy about this.  The old system served some useful purpose in the old days when the poor law was there, when people literally were on the breadline and needed someone to speak for <Col N="639" /> them.  They were working under a different jurisdiction with a hand-out system, but nobody holds a brief for that kind of system nowadays.  I hope we have advanced far from that era and that people now get benefit based on their entitlement.</P>
    <P>There are many elements in the Bill which will be of benefit to people.  I hope that payments accuring to them will be of benefit to them particularly in view of the fact that the cost of living has decreased dramatically.  I hope that decrease will continue.  People must have confidence that whatever they get will have some purchasing value for them, particularly those on lower income limits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We must remember that there is a duty on every government to provide for the needs of the aged, the sick, the infirm and the under-privileged. I agree that governments during the years have used a very humane approach.  In good times we made some tremendous progress with regard to our responsibilities in this area.  Recently we have heard a lot of talk about the state of the economy and of measures that need to be taken to try to rectify the position.  At the same time I should like to impress on the Minister that we can never allow a situation to arise whereby the aged, the sick, the infirm or the under-privileged are sacrificed for the sake of monetarist policies or fiscal rectitude.</P>
      <P>The increases of 7 per cent and 8 per cent are taking effect from July while, at the same time, all the revenue demands incorporated in the budget have long since taken effect.  When we consider this we realise the social welfare recipients have little to enthuse about.  I am not going to dwell on the many aspects of the Social Welfare Bill and I am not going to criticise for the sake of being critical. Many services have deteriorated, especially in the community care area.  Great hardship is being experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of a commission on social welfare.  I wish them well and I hope that they will do their work thoroughly and as expeditiously as possible.  I hope we will not have to wait <Col N="640" /> for years for a report from them.  Many changes are needed in the system which is archaic and very complicated.  Our major problem is unemployment.  At the rate we are going we will end up with one-third of the population working to keep two-thirds of the population idle.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is the basic root of other problems in the country.  When speaking of unemployment I would like to contradict many of the statements I have heard recently that there are too many people sponging on taxpayers' money.  As a public representative for a long number of years and especially since I became a Member of the Oireachtas, I meet many young people willing and able to work.  These people are not spongers. People are willing to work, they want work and it is the duty of the Government at least to try to provide employment for these people.  At the same time, I unequivocally condemn the people who are abusing the system and there are many instances of abuses.  I am sure the Minister knows what I am referring to, namely, people who are working and living off the system at the same time.  I add my voice to condemnation of them. Social welfare officers would be much better employed in tackling many of the abuses that exist in this area than spending so much time, in many cases needlessly, investigating old age pensioners with a view to cutbacks even though they have gone through the system and have been granted pensions.</P>
    <P>On the abolition of the pension committees, I am amazed that this particular section went through Dáil Éireann almost without question.  I am not sure what was the idea behind it.  Perhaps the Minister thinks that it is an archaic system. Perhaps he fears there may be breaches of confidentiality.  I have been a member of an old age pension committee for nearly 18 years and I see the need it has fulfilled.  It creates a link at local level between the old age pensioner, the social welfare officer and the Department. I believe this combination has successfully played a very important role in the administration of the scheme since its inception.  The pensioners involved knew there were local people whom they could <Col N="641" /> approach who would guide them, assist them and be a source of moral courage to them when they were fighting their case.  I firmly believe that the social welfare officer learned a lot from these old age pension committees because the local councillor and the local people who were on these committees knew exactly what was involved.</P>
    <P>I know there are many old age pensioners in this country who are illiterate or semi-literate and who do not know what are their rights.  The local councillor, especially on a pension committee, is the guiding spirit behind many of these people.  I know many people who, on the advice of the local pension committee and the social welfare officer, at long last realised the fact that they could sign over their farm and put in an application to give them that bit of protection that they felt was so necessary.  Because of this many young people got an earlier opportunity of running the family farm or the family business and they could progress and get married.</P>
    <P>There are questions I should like the Minister to answer concerning the abolition of the old age pension committees. What will be the cost of this exercise? The members of old age pension committees were not even paid travelling expenses.  To my knowledge, they were never even offered a cup of tea.  They gave of their services free.  As I said earlier, to my knowledge confidentiality was never broken and that is very important. How many extra staff will be recruited to process the claims?  Somebody will have to fill the gap that the abolition of old age pension committees will create.  Where will staff be recruited? I think we can answer that one off the cuff &mdash; in Dublin.  What changes are being introduced into the appeals system? What type of protection will be offered to the old age pensioner whose claim may be reviewed?  To whom are these people to go now?  I am very sceptical about that. I wish to state as strongly as possible that in my opinion this is a retrograde step. Again, this is part of the centralisation type of thinking &mdash; change the system, bring everything up to head office in Dublin.  In many areas right across the <Col N="642" /> board this country is suffering as a result of decisions like this.  Membership of old age pension committees is very time-consuming. The members of the committees never received a halfpenny even in travelling expenses or never even looked for it.  It was a community type of effort, whereby people could be helped out with advice and guidance as to their rights. Old age pensioners looked to these committees for that bit of vital support and in many instances they got the moral courage to fight their case.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a special tribute to the old age pension committees who did their job very thoroughly, very effectively and very conscientiously.  In my time on the committee &mdash; I was a member of Kells old age pension committee &mdash; we never took rash or misleading decisions.  Our judgment and our views were very well respected in Dublin.  What will happen now when a case goes to appeal, when a pensioner receives clearly-worded documentation which says that a certain amount has been granted but it is on appeal?  It will be left in abeyance with the appeals officer for three or four months.  There will be no link then between the pensioner and the appeals section in Dublin.  This creating a gap which the Minister will regret.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask if anything can be done with regard to the death grant scheme? This scheme was introduced in 1970, and recently I came across what I thought were anomalies in the scheme.  It does not apply to people who were born prior to March 1901 unless in rare cases where a spouse is or was eligible under the Insurance Act.  What happens in a case like that &mdash; and we have many hardship cases &mdash; is that it goes to the community care section and the supplementary welfare benefit section.  God knows, the community care section is harassed enough and is under severe pressure without doing what we feel should be the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare.  There are not very many people left in that category.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply would be kind enough to deal with this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister <Col N="643" /> of State to the House.  It is his first visit to us wearing the cap of Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare. With the other Senators, I wish him well.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am particularly impressed with the section dealing with family income supplement, which is something that is long overdue.  As the Minister said in his opening speech, there are many families in this country who because of the low income from the main income earner of the family &mdash; the only income earner very often &mdash; get caught in a poverty trap and because of our social welfare system there was no scheme of assistance for such people until now.  The Minister is to be thoroughly congratulated for introducing this particular form of assistance.  It is a very enlightening measure and is long overdue.</P>
      <P>At a general level, in this country we are fortunate in that we spend a very high proportion of our national income on social welfare.  We pay out as much as most advanced or developed countries in relation to the net national income.  That, of course, is a reflection of our caring and our enlightenment in this area.</P>
      <P>However, on the details, I regret a number of matters were not updated at this time.  To qualify for an old age pension an applicant who has a means of £7 per week from another source is disqualified from some of the old age pension. For instance, if an old age pensioner has £8 per week of outside income on reaching the age of old age pension &mdash; and that is not very much money nowadays &mdash; he loses £1 per week of the entitlements.  If it is £9 he loses £2 and if it is £10 he loses £3 and so on until such time as he slips out of the system completely.  That system of having £7 as the weekly floor was introduced in 1973 and surely it is high time that it was updated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A figure of at least £20 or £25 per week of an outside income should be allowed to any old age pensioner to qualify for full pension and I ask the Minister to consider that matter.  I do not suppose there is a lot that can be done about it this year because the Bill has been drafted and has been passed by the other <Col N="644" /> House and it is on the point of being passed in this House but it is something that should be remembered for next year.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Higgins I am very concerned about the problem of the unemployment assistance for small farmers &mdash; it is called the small farmer's assistance or the small farmer's dole.  A major problem has arisen because of the changeover from the old notional system based on the poor law valuation to the new actual or factual system.  The problem is an administrative one.  I agree totally that people should be assessed factually for any social assistance of this kind.  At the administrative level, for whatever reason, whether it is a problem of the training of the people who administer the scheme or a problem of staff numbers or of time I do not know, there is something wrong when a social welfare officer calls to a farmer to interview him for this new factual system and the interview may last no longer than ten minutes.  In that ten minutes the farmer is expected to give a full inventory of all his income and expenses for the previous year.</P>
    <P>In fairness, no farmer, especially a small farmer who has no knowledge of bookkeeping by tradition, can be expected to give a full account of all his true expenses and his true income for the previous year.  What very often happens is that because the interview is such a cursory affair in the first instance, because there is possibly a certain amount of fear on the part of the applicant being approached in this rather rapid manner and because possibly at times the approach of the social welfare officer is not everything that is desired, the result is that a very unfair conclusion is arrived at as far as the recipient is concerned. There will be no doubt at all about the assessment of his gross income, but the putting together of his gross expenses is another matter.</P>
    <P>Most farmers are ignorant of the fact that they can claim for every possible income they dispense on the necessary running of their farm.  This information has not been made known to the farmers. The result is they get no assistance from the social welfare officer who has only ten minutes to spend with them.  With the <Col N="645" /> information he has in hand, he goes back and he processes it and he attributes to that applicant an income which is far above the actual income which arises from that particular holding.  The applicant is notified in due course that his allowance has been greatly reduced or in many cases it has been taken away altogether, very unfairly.  The appeals process starts and that process is very slow.  It now takes at least 15 or 16 weeks for a decision from the time the appeal is lodged until a decision is made.</P>
    <P>I query also the machinery of the appeals system.  I know of many instances of farmers who lodged their appeal, who gave new details of their income and expenses and yet they were never revisited by an official of the Department. They were written to after 15 or 16 weeks and told that a deciding officer or an appeals officer in the Department of Social Welfare had upheld the original decision.  Surely that is not fair.  The Minister may say that is not happening but I know for a fact it is happening.  It is not at all a satisfactory system of appeal.</P>
    <P>What must be done immediately is that all farmers who are to be assessed for the factual assessment should be given at least 21 days notice that an assessor is to come to them in order to give them a chance to prepare the full inventory of their expenses and their income.  That is only fair.  Most small farmers are not on &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; or doing work on the side.  They are working on their farms eking out a very meagre living, and there is nothing wrong with giving them notice of at least three weeks.  Each recipient should be circularised with a full and comprehensive list of all the expenses for which he can claim.  Let them show vouchers and receipts for their expenses, but at least they must be made fully aware of everything they can claim for, because in these unsatisfactory interviews which they face in this initial examination a farmer is likely to lose his benefit.  He has to go through the appeals process and wait for three months to have his payments restored.  As the previous speaker said, it is all right saying he will get back the benefits in arrears, but justice delayed is justice not done.  I urge in the strongest <Col N="646" /> possible terms upon the Minister that these two main points which I make are taken into account: that all farmers who are to be assessed, must get due notice and that they are to get a full and comprehensive list of all the expenses for which they may claim.  Furthermore, whether it is to be solved by increased staff or whatever, when a social welfare officer calls he must be prepared to spend a longer period with an applicant.  Very often he should be in the role of an adviser.  It should never be the aim of the Department to deprive somebody of money to which they are entitled.  Very often the impression that is given is that the sole purpose of an officer's visit.is to take away money, not to advise and to establish entitlement, which is what should be their real role.</P>
    <P>Also bear in mind that the small farmer's assistance has a very beneficial economic side-effect in that really it is an income supplement.  Most farmers, 99 per cent of them, use their unemployment assistance beneficially in that not alone do they supplement their own family income from it but they use portion of it to reinvest into their farm.  We hear a lot of talk about the people who abuse the system, but they are a minuscule minority.  The majority use the system properly.  Take this assistance away from them and you beggar them on two fronts.  You take away from them a source of investment in their farm which, in turn, helps to generate an income from their farm.  By taking away the assistance you are taking away a vital part of the family income.  To repeat, you beggar them on two fronts, and you do the country no economic good either.  I ask the Minister to bear all of these things in mind, especially those points which I have made on smallholders' assistance.</P>
    <P>There are many things I would have liked to say but they have been said by other speakers and it is unnecessary for me to repeat them.  Again, may I say I welcome totally the Bill.  We have given 7 and 8 per cent increases across the board and this will be well in line with inflation because I hope by this time next year we will be going into a period of 5 per cent or less inflation per annum.  I <Col N="647" /> feel that the percentage increases this year will be more than adequate to meet the rate of inflation or to maintain living standards for all social assistance recipients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with other Senators in welcoming the Minister of State to the House on his first official visit.  This whole area of social welfare is a complex and difficult one and I am not an expert as regards all the regulations and details.  Most people would agree with the Minister that it is opportune to review the whole welfare system.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask a few questions and to make a few comments regarding the Bill.  May I first of all ask the Minister if he can advise me of the position of a person working on a week-on-week-off basis, a situation which has become reasonably widespread since the changes in social welfare payments came about for people working a three day week?  I understand that in order to get a social insurance credit a person must sign on for the six days of the social welfare week. This social insurance contribution week, I believe, begins on the day of the week coinciding with 6 April of that contribution year.  Persons on a-week-on-week-off situation work from Monday to Friday; therefore they are unable to sign on for the full six days of either social welfare week, that is the week ending on the Tuesday and beginning on the Wednesday at present, or ending on Thursday and beginning on Friday after 6 April. Do such people get a social insurance credit or have their employers been instructed to mark their social insurance record card with two contributions paid? I have been informed that an employer cannot record 52 contributions paid for 26 weeks' work.  Does the social welfare system credit these people with the other 26 weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an Adjournment Debate in the other House when the Minister dealt with raising the floor from £36, to £43, section 7 of the Bill, I believe he also stated that the pay-related element of maternity benefit would be reduced from 80 per <Col N="648" /> cent to 70 per cent.  What is the position now in this regard?</P>
    <P>I believe also that the situation is such that if somebody who is signing for social welfare signs off for one day they will lose their credit for the whole week.  The situation seems to be to discourage the unemployed from trying to find even one day's work.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been made of the queues signing on at social welfare offices.  I join in those criticisms, because I feel that a long line of people waiting, exposed to the elements, is undignified.  I would like to see some progress being made in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the leasing of land. I welcome this, along with the other Senators. But I would like to ask what the Land Commission are doing at the present time with regard to the transfer of land.  They seem to have reached a static situation.  I feel some progress would have to be made in this area also.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to increases of 7 per cent and 8 per cent in benefits.  He also stated that there would be an inflation rate of 5 per cent in 1985.  I am wondering if this is too optimistic.  I would also like to point out that the 7 per cent and 8 per cent will not apply for all of the year since it only comes into operation sometime in July and August.  I welcome the family income supplement scheme but I note that the supplement will be calculated in each case as one quarter of the difference between the family's actual income and the appropriate upper level of income for the family size in question.  The ideal situation would be where the full difference would be made up, and we will all be happy only when this is possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the abolition of old age pension committees, I would like to put on record my appreciation of the hard work they have done down through the years.  It was voluntary work.  I accept what has been said, possibly it was somewhat insensitive to have claimants going before the committee and making full and general confessions.  At the same time, all those members were very dedicated. They worked hard without payment of any kind.  I am somewhat saddened <Col N="649" /> to see them go, because they fulfilled a difficult task.  With the situation as it obtained with people being called before the old age pension committee and meeting people they knew, it was certainly difficult to expose all of the details.  I would like to pay tribute to the work they have done down through the years.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider allowing a set off to the extent of perhaps £30 per week for a home help for invalid persons over 70 years of age in the reckoning of means for a non-contributory pension? These people at the end of their days deserve not only our sympathy but above all our help.  It is only right and just to make an allowance for a cost which cannot be avoided.</P>
    <P>The fringe benefits of free electricity allowance, black and white television licence and free telephone rental are linked to the social welfare pension.  Those who do not qualify for a pension from the Department of Social Welfare do not qualify for the fringe benefits.  At present a person can have a means of up to £42 &mdash; £44 from July &mdash; and qualify for some amount of non-contributory pension, thereby qualifying for these fringe benefits. It is unfair that a person who is £1 or £2 over the limit is deprived of all of these benefits.  In situations like that &mdash; where their means are above that limit &mdash; would it not be possible to allow these fringe benefits with an appropriate deduction for the amount by which they would be above the limit in order to qualify?</P>
    <P>With regard to telephone rental allowances for invalids and old age pensioners where there is another person staying with them and looking after them, often through necessity rather than have them committed to a hospital or institution, they should have a free telephone rental allowance.  They should not be penalised for having a good friend in this period of need, particularly as, in the words of the poet, &ldquo;The poor make no new friends.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every individual is entitled to an income which ensures a reasonable standard of human dignity.  They are entitled to this as of right.  With the other Senators, I feel there is nothing to be ashamed of for those who have to depend <Col N="650" /> on social welfare, but in so far as there is failure in this regard, society itself should be ashamed.</P>
    <P>I conclude by welcoming the Bill in so far as it is an improvement.  I hope the comprehensive review the Minister has in hand will bring us fully along this road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first of all extend the usual words of welcome to Minister Pattison.  I hope he will be there for a long time to come.</P>
      <P>The present sum total of social legislation is a tribute to all parties, not just to one or two or three; it is the sum total of the desire of everybody to do what is possible for people in need, and nobody can claim any special concern in looking after those people.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill probably touch every house in the country in some form or other.  I firmly believe that because peple who are unemployed are neither sick nor, in the terms that we understand it, in need of welfare this whole area of unemployment is a matter proper to the Department of Labour. The very fact that people are paid through the Departments of Health and Social Welfare would suggest that there is something wrong with them other than the fact that they simply have not got a job.  In other words they are answerable, with all due respects to the Minister, Deputy Desmond, and the Minister of State, to the wrong Department: they should be answerable to the Department of Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised the matter of employment exchanges before in this House.  It seems to me that while the Departments of Health and Social Welfare over the years displayed tremendous sensitivity in dealing with people, such as prisoners' wives, deserted wives, unmarried mothers, to ensure that the benefits payable to them are not easily recognisable by shopkeepers and banks and so forth and ensuring that these cheques, All of like, are anonymous cheques.  All of these developments are very welcome because they maintain the dignity of people.  The prisoner's wife or the unmarried mother retained their own dignity and sense of worth.  But we fail to do it <Col N="651" /> with the unemployed, and we keep on failing to do it with the unemployed.  I still do not understand the reason for this and why we simply will not face up to this problem.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to queues of people outside not alone employment exchanges but sort of shops and houses in every village and town in Ireland.  In my own constituency in Cork one would think that there was a major accident on a Thursday when you have hundreds of people queueing up to get their assistance.  What lies behind the demand of the State that these people produce their bodies once or twice a week?  There is no work available at the moment, so you are demanding that people show themselves for something which is not there &mdash; work.  I fail to see why these payments cannot be made like other social welfare payments are made. In money terms we probably pay far more public moneys through the post than we do over the counter.  But you have this absolutely idiotic and degrading system where people have to queue right around blocks in some cases in hail, rain or snow to get what is essentially their own money.  It is absolutely degrading.  Some Government at some time will have to face up to it, because there is no longer any logical reason why it would be so.</P>
    <P>Some people say that there is a percentage of people drawing social welfare benefits who do not want to work.  In the present context you could probably give them a medal for social service because they will not grab a job that so many other people want.  Therefore, even the spongers, in so far as people who do not want to work are so described and who are a tiny minority, are giving a sort of service.  It sickens me when I hear people talking about some man or woman ripping the State off for £10 or £20 and then you see stockbrokers, doctors and lawyers ripping the State off for hundreds of thousands of £s and they are received in the most respectable of places by prelates and Government dignitaries and so on. They are the real spongers in society, not a guy who decides to do a trick in Gardiner Street and do it somewhere else.  I <Col N="652" /> do not condone this but it should not bring down the wrath of officialdom for such a pittance.  I suppose if this particular double act displayed a little more ingenuity it would probably earn more money somewhere else.</P>
    <P>The question of people queueing up for their own cash in this age of technology will have to be looked at.  I suggested previously to another Minister, and I am suggesting to Deputy Pattison, that the time to bring the employment exchanges into the 20th century should begin, because we have done it with everything else.  The employment exchange is now misnamed.  It is not an employment placement agency; it is where you simply get money because you are out of work, and therefore you should get that money through the post.  Why should one have to queue?  From my own personal experience I can say that traumatic as losing your job is, the idea of facing this signing twice a week is almost worse, and people fear that sometimes more than they actually fear the loss of money.  Yet we do nothing about it and the same old system goes on.  The only difference today is that we have many more people queueing up.</P>
    <P>The black economy has been mentioned. Successive Governments have driven people into the black economy in many ways.  If you consider a situation where a man, wife and a number of children who has a £95 tax free allowance is picking up from the exchange on a certain level of benefit about £70, and he is offered a job for x number of hours a week, possibly doing a night's work for which he gets £20, he still has not reached a level in terms of income at which he would be subject to taxation.  Yet, he cannot do this.  You have inspectors going around pubs looking for men doing nixers in bars.  They are probably not earning any more &mdash; they are probably earning less &mdash; than they would be entitled to in a full-time job, given their tax free allowance situation.  They are actively prevented from improving their situation, even marginally.  To people on social welfare there is an extra £20 that they get which they cannot declare, so we are driving people into the black economy <Col N="653" /> for marginally improving their circumstances. Again this is something that ought to be looked at, because the black economy is not a lot of men fixing cars for beer money in some back street; it is a guy who is on a minimum amount of social welfare who sometimes is able to get a few hours' work a week.  Why should he not be able to declare it?  Why should he not be able to come within the legal system?  Why should we make a criminal of him simply because he wants to improve his own family situation?  If that particular extra income still does not bring him into the tax bracket what is the problem?  When we talk about the black economy we talk about people like that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the abolition of the pension committees.  They are relics of another era, the era of the Big House.  We have often spoken about the fact that if Members of the Oireachtas spent a little more time on legislation and less time in trying to persuade people that they are getting them benefits they are already entitled to, we probably would have a better country.  I welcome the fact that these committees are disbanded and the citizen can, as is their right, deal directly with the State.  The only problems about dealing with the State is that they produce so much literature and booklets and so on which are so full of gobbledygook that it is very hard for ordinary people, and especially old people, to understand. Certainly the Minister would do a great service if he simplified some of the documents that emanate from the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  I understand in Britain there is a huge hidden surplus of people who do not claim &mdash;millions of £s.  I have not seen anything mentioned in any speech so far that there are unclaimed millions left in the Irish Exchequer simply because people do not know what their entitlements are.  In effect what we do in this country is to set up all sorts of agencies for people to actually fall through the trap door.  Sometimes they fell through the trap door because nobody gave them the map of the minefield and explained that there were entitlements they could get.  So I would appeal to the Minister that not only in his Department but in every <Col N="654" /> Department in the State we should produce documents and leaflets etc.  which the ordinary person can understand, down to the lowest common denominator.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to comment briefly on mental hospitals around the country, the cinderella of the service.  I think that while we have the flagships, the regional hospitals which are beautifully laid out and done up and where you get menus for every meal and so on and so forth, we have cheek by jowl with that sort of system, hell-holes which still exist.  I know that the mental hospital in Cork is such a place.  The improvements in it over the years have not been great. I pay tribute to the staff who work there because they work there under Victorian conditions.  For anybody going through the Cork Mental Hospital, especially the old male part which is still in use, would think they were living in another age.  I would sincerely hope that under this administration the question of the mental hospitals in particular would be looked at even at the expense perhaps of our general services.  I just thought I would try and slip it across you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to know where to begin when you talk about a Social Welfare Bill because there is so much referred to in it.  There are so many dimensions to a problem being addressed by it.  There are so many attempts to deal with so many extraordinary things and for reasons that I still believe are more historical and more to do with the lack of the concentration of a Ministerial mind for a long time on it, the social welfare legislation and the whole social welfare system seem to me to be one of the most <Col N="655" /> extraordinarily complex ways of transferring funds from those in our society who have more into the hands of those who have less.  It seems to me that it is extraordinary that there is such complexity about the basics of subsidies we give to the poor through incomes by comparison with the relative simplicity of the subsidies we give to the middle and wealthier classes.</P>
      <P>Senator Magner in his own extremely eloquent way talked about the treatment of the unemployed, but you can contrast the treatment of the unemployed or the treatment of other people through social welfare and through the complicated assessments of means, and particularly &mdash; and I have to go back to what Senator Magner said about the unemployed &mdash; the procedures that are used therewith. The way in which I get a subsidy to pay for my own house, for instance, or the way I was subsidised generously and heavily by the State throughout my third level education.  It is done simply, by the transfer of funds, and in the case of universities a large amount of money is handed over once a year.  It is more or less accepted that they will not defraud the State.  But the poor individual at the bottom of the heap who is not getting any extra assistance to enable him to do better but who is getting the minimum that will keep him alive, is subjected to the most extraordinary rigorous assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought in fact that this only applied to the unemployed, but a near relative of my own recently had to apply for the old age pension.  I think she nearly stopped and pulled out of the whole thing and almost chose to live in poverty because of the number of extraordinary, not deliberate but necessary and consequential humiliations that she had to go through, in terms of assessment of means, assessment of property, assessment of various other things and the questions that are asked.  You have to remember that you are talking about old people.  Very often old people have very little left except the sense of their own dignity and the remembrance of what life used to be and the remembrance of the fact that they used to be people with a contribution to make, and when at the <Col N="656" /> end of their days they are subjected to such an ordeal they do not understand it. This, I emphasise, is not a criticism of individuals: it is a criticism of the fact that we as a society have not got around to reorganising it.  There is also the extraordinary emphasis within the whole social welfare system on the prevention of fraud.  One would really believe that the first and fundamental training given to everybody dealing with social welfare and with the administration of social welfare and with the payment of social welfare is how to avoid fraud under every possible circumstance and how to defy the ingenuity of an imagined horde of marauding social welfare recipients seeking to devour vast quantities of the community's money if they are not caught at every possible opportunity and tripped up at every second step of the way.</P>
    <P>That is probably epitomised by a practice I know exists in some labour exchanges, if not in all, which is that when somebody is being given his unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, you first sign the receipt and then you get the money.  That is the ultimate precaution and the ultimate indication of the actual values that are still running through the entire social welfare system, that somebody should be asked to sign a receipt for money before the money is actually in his hands.  That is just a practice which has developed.  This sort of practice runs through the whole thing. The insensitivity, for instance, that is running through the system, the lack of emphasis on need to be sensitive, on the need to care and respond is epitomised by a little happening in Cork.</P>
    <P>There is a new and very well-appointed women's labour exchange in Cork with beautiful doors leading out on to Washington Street and a handwritten note on that door says: &ldquo;Entrance at rere&rdquo;.  As it happens if you go past that labour exchange before it opens, you will see a long queue of women outside, but they are not consigned safely to the rere.  I am sure this was not a deliberate attempt by somebody to humiliate: I am absolutely certain of that.  What I am equally sure of is that we have a philosophy of welfare in this country and I suspect in many other <Col N="657" /> countries, a philosophy of welfare which is so orientated towards treating recipients as potential frauds that the system never thinks of them for what they really are and which should not have to be said in a place like this, that they are people who are down at the bottom and have very little left.  That is really where an enormous amount of reforming zeal could be exercised even if one accepts &mdash; and I do not &mdash; that there is no more money available, but even if one accepts that we cannot expand the income supports and the income levels and the income assistances that are available through social welfare, there is a vast amount that could be done with relatively small sums of money.  After all, 1 per cent of social welfare expenditure is of the order of £10 or £15 million now &mdash; an expenditure of that order.</P>
    <P>Even with that much expenditure, even that much invested on training, invested in research into the needs and perceptions of people, research into how do recipients perceive the service that has been delivered to them, what do they find wrong with it?  What do they want from it?  How do they want to be treated? How do they feel they should be treated as distinct from how we think they should be treated or how things should be done for them as distinct from how we think things should be done for them; asking them what do they need.  A simple questionnaire, given out to every single unemployed person could be produced &mdash; what do you think of the labour exchange?  I suspect it would be mostly an unprintable four or six-letter word from what I have heard of people's attitudes and considerations for labour exchanges.</P>
    <P>There is so much that could be done with a small amount of money, so much that could be done to humanise the whole thing.  Why in the area, as Senator Magner has said, of the unemployed, one of the major burdens on the social welfare system &mdash; and there I am falling into the same old trap that everybody else falls into, talking about the unemployed as a burden: they are not a burden; they are a responsibility and they are a necessary part of our social responsibility and a dreadful shame and reproach to us all <Col N="658" />&mdash; why is it that we persist with a system like that?  I would like to speculate that we as a society have been intimidated and hypnotised by the most extraordinary campaign of insult to the unemployed that could ever take place in our allegedly compassionate and Christian country. There are a number of strategies involved here all of which relate to the need to keep the unemployed (a) at a restricted level of income, and (b) at a restricted level of self-respect.  I think unfortunately the first campaign has been enormously successful and the level of income of the unemployed is extremely low.  I do not think anybody disagrees with that.  Inside the long ranks of the unemployed are the great mass of unemployed young people who get nothing, 25 per cent of our young people in Finglas who are unemployed and who got no assistance from the State, some of them because they were living at home with parents who had a job and, as the Minister knows, there is a means test involved in that case.  Incidentally, the document of clarification which I got from the Minister's predecessor &mdash; I emphasise that this was meant to clarify matters; it was not the original document &mdash; was so complicated that although I am numerate and have a university degree to suggest that I am extremely numerate, I spent half an hour re-reading this document of clarification to determine how you assess means for somebody under social welfare and I still do not understand that document. It had a complex of subclauses, &ldquo;whereases&rdquo; and referrals that absolutely flummoxed me.  If the Minister could do no more in his period in office than rewrite the document which clarifies the assessment of income for people getting what is usually taken as a &ldquo;benefit in kind&rdquo; for people living at home, if that could be rewritten in a way that Members of this House &mdash; not to mention the unfortunate unemployed and in particular the unskilled and barely literate, could understand &mdash; it would be a major contribution to social justice.  We would at least then begin to see if people were getting their entitlements or not.  Otherwise, one begins to suspect a conspiracy to confuse which is necessary in order perhaps to <Col N="659" /> prevent people from getting to know their rights.  I do not know whether it is true or not.  That attitude to social welfare, is represented by that sort of approaches and values &mdash; for example, the locking of doors and the transferring of people around to the back, the unpainted labour exchanges and the massive sign dominating most labour exchanges which does not tell you where to go for what you want but says: &ldquo;No Loitering.&rdquo;  That philosophy is a part of our philosophy of why people are poor and about poverty in a society.  I do not think things exist by accident in a complex society nor do they persist by accident, and I do not think we can say that it is because we forgot.  It is because we have priorities, values and needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking, in the context of the Bill and of social welfare generally, about the extraordinary ambivalences or confused thinking whereas on the one hand we have the best of aspirations and motivations and on the other hand we have all the manifestations of a poor law mentality in the way the services are delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred in quite clear language to the problems of poverty and particularly of marginal groups.  It is only right that when we are talking about social welfare, poverty ought to be referred to in a ministerial speech.  I am glad that this Government, in however minuscule a fashion, have recognised at last &mdash; this was never too popular and is still not too popular &mdash; that unemployment is a form of poverty because it is very fashionable in Irish political circles, whoever is in Opposition, to regret the fact that social welfare increases were not X per cent higher than what was given. However, when you ask someone to be specific they go on almost inevitably to talk about old age pensioners, leaving the unemployed to one side, as it were.  When people talk about social welfare recipients you hear them talking about children's allowances or old age pensioners <Col N="660" /> or widows but there seems to be still some deep-seated reservation in Irish political life about identifying the unemployed as a group within Irish society who are poor by any definition.  It is partly an unwillingness to face up to what I do not accept to be inevitable but which many people do, that is, the permanent nature of unemployment, or perhaps it is an unwillingness to face up to the fact that the difference between the unemployed and many other marginal or poorer groups in society is that unemployment spreads across all ages and all sections of society to some extent and because it affects young people in particular.  The poverty of the unemployed is a potentially destabilising poverty.  It is true but tragic that one could ignore the poverty of old people forever and society's stability would not be affected in the slightest.  It is a good measure of our compassion and concern that in spite of that fact we do have some care and a reasonable degree of concern for our old people.  There are, of course, glaring exceptions, in particular the housing conditions of many old people living on their own, but at least we do have a considerable concern for them.  However, there seems to be a considerable fear in our society about facing up to the problem of unemployment as being fundamentally a problem of people who because they are not employed, because we cannot give them jobs, are now very poor.</P>
    <P>To complement what Senator Magner said about the peculiar ambivalent attitudes, about the scrounger stories, about people living it up on the dole and so on, stories much beloved of certain newspapers, let us recall what the Minister said recently in the Dáil.  He said that the average payment to a person who is unemployed &mdash; that is by way of dividing the total payments among the entire number of unemployed people &mdash; is £47.70 per week.  How dare anybody in a well-paid job, and I am particularly talking about journalists who are paid nearly as much as the Members of the Dáil, whatever about Members of this House, talk about people living it up on £47.70.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> Poverty seems to be the underlying issue when talking about social welfare. I have talked enough about the scale of unemployment, but it needs to be repeated that poverty will not be remedied by income maintenance alone, because if one were to deliver social welfare benefits that were even twice the present rates and maintain the present quality of delivery, quality of service, appeal system and other procedures, one would still end up with a sub-group of people who were less equal than the rest of us in their perceptions of themselves and in society's perception of them, because poverty is as much about powerlessness as it is about lack of resources. It is about a sense of not having control over one's own life, of not having any security in regard to one's own life and to being at the beck and call and, to some extent the disposal, of other people as to how one gets one's income, how much one gets and what one does when not under the scrutiny directly of those people.</P>
    <P>Effectively the whole availability-for-work clause which people are required to meet to quality for unemployment assistance is an attempt to regulate not just what people do for two hours of the week, but for the entire week and the entire year.  I am glad that Senator Magner emphasised this extraordinary requirement that people must be available for work.  In a society where work is patently not available, it is ridiculous to keep on insisting that people must be available for work.  I know he was joking, but there is something to be said for the fact that people who decide not to be available for work because they want to do something else, whether it be of a working nature or a leisure nature, should not be penalised but should be seen to be what they are, creative people making the best of a difficult situation in which society cannot give them work and to whom the State can only give a minimum level of income support.  Instead of harassing them we should assist and commend them.</P>
    <P>I have proposed before that, for young unemployed people particularly, if after six months we cannot give them jobs, we <Col N="662" /> should send their unemployment assistance to them once a week through the post, forget all about this signing on and means testing and say to them, &ldquo;We are sorry but that is all society can do for you. That is your £30 a week.  Go and do whatever you like with it and do whatever you like with the rest of your week.&rdquo;  Let us get away from this situation of humiliating our young people by a whole procedure of signing on and all sorts of other qualifications.  Tell them to find themselves part-time jobs, or to attend adult education classes.  There are a whole lot of areas of work and a whole lot of things that need to be done.  That is a complete reversal of the existing philosophy but it is a necessary reversal if we are to do anything about the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>All of these questions go back, as I have said, to the question of power, the control of power and the fact that the quality of delivery of service represents society's preception of how powerless the people are who are in receipt of social welfare.  It is because of this powerlessness that I think the word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; should be abolished from our language and the word &ldquo;oppression&rdquo; substituted. Poverty is not an accident.  It is a consequence of the way our society is organised and the fact that social welfare cannot deal with poverty is a consequence of the way our society is organised.  The fact that people's incomes must be so much less from social welfare than if they were working is a consequence of the way our society is organised, as is the fact that people must be treated the way they are when they are unemployed.  All of this is a direct consequence of the way we have chosen to organise our society.  People who are poor because of the way society is organised are oppressed.  They are the victims of our own success.</P>
    <P>In terms of what is being done in this Bill, certain points should be put on the record.  Regarding rates of social welfare assistance, if we take the payment for each qualified child in excess of five we find that what we give an unemployed person to support his sixth child is £5.80 per week.  That is about the amount I paid for my meal this evening in the <Col N="663" /> Oireachtas Restaurant.  It is the amount we as a society believe is sufficient for an unemployed person to support a dependant child for one week.  I do not say this to score a cheap point &mdash; I apply it as much to myself as to anybody else &mdash; but it represents a most extraordinary set of priorities and a most extraordinary confusion of values.  It may well be that this is all we can afford, but I wish the Minister would stop talking about how a 7 per cent increase represents £1.60p or £1.90p per week.  The truth is that if what all of us in this House and in the Dáil would regard as a generous increase in social welfare were to fall out of our pockets, we would hardly bother to bend down to pick it up. We should recognise the fact that the very best we are doing with social welfare is maintaining the poor at a minimum level of poverty rather than at a level of dreadful and destructive poverty.  Therefore, we must get away from quoting figures about increases in social welfare in cash terms which are nothing more than buttons to those of us who have jobs and who are relatively well off in society.</P>
    <P>May I, in the context of the Social Welfare Bill, appeal to the Minister to look to all the other dimensions of social welfare, to the remoteness of the decision-making process?  It is, whether people have realised it or not, no longer necessary to send documentation by hand post to Dublin in order to deal with a centralised system.  There are things such as centralised computers which the banks have used to enable those of us who have money in banks to extract it by remote control 24 hours per day.  It should not be beyond the wit of the Department of Social Welfare to develop a similar system of visual display units in every social welfare office in the country so that decisions would not have to await manual transmission to Dublin, centralised decision-making and manual transmission back down the country.  Questions of decentralisation do not arise.  It is simply a question of using the available technology and the question of whether it is centralised should not matter any more.</P>
    <P>It is with extraordinary rigidity that we administer our social welfare codes.  It <Col N="664" /> may well have been a necessary consequence and position when we had small unemployment and when our resources were very limited.  The sort of rigidity that applies to the unemployed now makes a mockery of the facts of unemployment in our society.</P>
    <P>The appeals system in social welfare deserves and needs detailed examination by the Government.  The appeals system is not one which would strike any appelant as being fair and just.  It is impossible to convince somebody who is having his appeal heard by an officer from the Department of Social Welfare that he is getting a fair hearing.  It is impossible to convince somebody who cannot be confronted by the person who has the information on which a decision is being taken.  It is impossible to convince somebody who does not know why in precise detail he or she is being refused benefit. He or she would be told that it is because they are not available for work but the precise reason why that is adjudicated will not be communicated to them.  They will not know it is because, if one is a woman and has children or because one was seen working.  Nothing as precise as that will be communicated.  One gets a form on which a list of options will be available.  Most of these options will be struck out and one will be indicated but one will not know the evidence against one.  It astonishes me, but apparently it is true, that the courts have accepted this system as being constitutional and legal.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the issue of reforms, a small pet issue of mine, but one that produces enormous human suffering, is the insistence of the social welfare system that persons applying for benefit must supply an address before they can qualify for benefit.  I know a pregnant girl living in a car in this city who has been refused supplementary welfare allowance simply because she has no address.  There are no mitigating circumstances.  There is a decent, well-intentioned community welfare officer in Dublin who knows the girl's circumstances, who knows she needs support but who does not believe he is entitled to give that girl supplementary welfare because she has no address.  It is as simple as that.  Friends of mine in the <Col N="665" /> Simon Community have offered to sign a form saying that she stays at their place but the supplementary welfare officer, unfortunately, knows that she does not live there.  Because the girl has no address, she has no income.  That is not satisfactory.  Last year, the Minister explained here that there was no policy of refusing people but that it was administratively necessary that people should have an address.  I do not think that administrative necessity should come between anybody and the basic income that supplementary welfare or social welfare can give them.  May I ask, again, that that whole area be re-examined?  As poverty bites deeper, and it has bitten deeper quite dramatically, as the population of the night shelters indicates, there will be more people who are marginalised and left without benefit.  The Minister, in his introductory remarks, referred in particular to people who are marginalised. Who could be more marginalised than the people who no longer live in any sort of fixed address or accommodation? They need to be supported and assisted.</P>
    <P>There is one other area that needs to be commented on but I do not wish to be misunderstood on it.  I am impressed by the numbers of rural Senators and Deputies who have discovered the inequities of the social welfare system since it began to bear unfairly and quite unjustly on members of the farming community. These Deputies have discovered how unfair the means test is and how humiliating the procedures for investigating people's means are.  I would hope that this new discovery of the reality of what it is like to be on the dole &mdash; something that has been experienced by people in urban areas since the inception of unemployment assistance &mdash; would be communicated to those organisations outside this House, in particular farming organisations who have had many rude, offensive and hurtful things to say about the unemployed.  All that has happened is that the rigours of an unfair, unjust and humiliating system which people in the farming community escaped from have now descended on them as well.  I agree with every single proposal that has been made to alleviate that hardship and <Col N="666" /> humiliation on them but I am saying simply that the humiliation they are experiencing is no different from the humiliation that many others experience.  It should end for everybody.</P>
    <P>I must say in passing that if we had not increased defence expenditure by 13 per cent in 1984, we could have increased social welfare aid by 11 per cent in 1984. I have no doubt as to where my priorities would have arisen.  The system is so in need of overhaul in terms of training, premises, style of delivery, in terms of introduction of modern technology and in recognition of realities, that there is a vast amount to be done by a reforming junior Minister or senior Minister or by the Government.  With relatively little money, £10 million or £15 million or one per cent of social welfare expenditure, put into training and quality of service delivery could transform the style and the manner in which people receive particularly unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>It would leave behind forever the idea that somehow or other the unemployed are at fault for what has been done to them.  They are not at fault.  One has to suspect that if somebody does not do something soon about that appalling system of successive and apparently planned humiliation we have to believe that the reason for not doing it must have something to do with preventing the unemployed from standing up for themselves, and that will not succeed.  Finally, may I yet again appeal for a fundamental reform of the style and quality of delivery of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Minister on his first visit to this House. He is a long-standing colleague of mine in the Labour movement.  I wish him well in his work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social welfare concept, like many of the concepts that have come out of the European situation since the Second World War, is a concept of redistribution of wealth.  The second element in the social welfare concept is, of course, the humane treatment of people who cannot look after themselves &mdash; the poor, the <Col N="667" /> under-privileged, the sick and the unemployed for whom we cannot produce jobs and who therefore have no income.  The redistribution element is not fully satisfied by the levels of benefits that are paid. Having said that, I am not disappointed, because the Minister and the Department did what they could within the resources available.  Nevertheless, it must be said that in terms of keeping pace with inflation Social Welfare recipients are not better off.  They will be relieved and they will thank the Minister and the people who care about them will thank him also. However, the Minister is to be complimented to that degree only.</P>
    <P>The test of a civilised community is how it treats its poor and under-privileged people, the sick, families with young children and so on.  On that criteria the Republic passes the test fairly well. We need not hang our heads.  I was very sad at one experience I had in America in 1962.  The late John F. Kennedy was introducing a system called Medicare, and all that that meant was that old people would receive the finance to look after their pharmacy bills and their medicinal needs but, the greatest antagonist in America at that time was the American Medical Association.  In other words, they did not pass the test of a civilised community.  The situation has changed somewhat.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with Senators Ryan and Magner in what they have to say about the appalling things we see, the buildings that should be demolished, buildings with broken windows, with a lack of any proper facilities but outside which we see queueing, the unfortunate people who are unemployed.  That is degrading.  It is not right.  On that test the Minister gets a zero marking from me. Something will have to be done about it. I should not say that vaguely.  I say demolish these buildings or paint them and put them in proper order so that those who must use them are treated as human beings.  These people are our brothers and sisters and we will have to treat them better than the way I see them being treated in Dublin.  There should be <Col N="668" /> waiting rooms provided for them in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I was chairman for a long time of what was then the National Assistance in Northern Ireland.  Arising from the rural Senators' stories about means tests, farms and so on, I should like to tell a humorous story.  A farmer who had a bull calf told his wife he was going to the fair and that the bull calf had to be tied up because when the national assistance man came he must not see the bull calf. He would count the eggs, hens and so on in relation to a means test but the bull calf should not be seen by him.  However, the animal broke the rope and was seen by the officer.  About a week later when the farmer received his national assistance payment he noticed that there was an increase and he said to the postman, &ldquo;Johnny, there is a big rise in this payment.&rdquo; The postman replied, &ldquo;That is for the bull calf&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking, and there are a few matters I should like to refer to.  We are discussing this Bill against the background of very serious unemployment and deprivation in many urban centres.  We have the highest number ever unemployed and the highest number of people depending on social welfare assistance.  The social welfare bill has been increasing yearly.  The Minister said this morning that it is the task of the social welfare system to identify groups of people with a high risk of poverty and to provide direct income support related to their need.  I am sure we all agree with these sentiments and would support any measure taken to help the needy and eliminate poverty if that is possible.  Moneys for such purposes are got through systems of taxation and also from contributions which are levied on workers through the PRSI system.  Both employees and the self-employed are levied on the basis of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill changes the method of assessment of income from leasing the land.  This is a welcome change.  We would all share the Government's concern that it encourages the greater use of medium-term land leasing as part of its policy in relation to farming. <Col N="669" /> I note that the section provides that where land has been leased with approval of the Land Commission the lessee's means for social assistance purposes will be calculated by reference to the profits from the money he receives from the lease per year rather than by reference to the capital value of the holding.  Many farmers are concerned about the fairness of these assessments and they are concerned also about how their income is assessed for entitlement to unemployment assistance, that is, the farmers' dole.  Farmers living in a ten- or 12-acre holding and even on up to 30 acres of poor land need social welfare assistance to provide them with a decent living.</P>
    <P>The farmers are also concerned at how farmers' incomes are assessed, especially by the Departments of the Environment and Education. The Department of Health, too, use two definitions to respond to farming incomes.  For example, when assessing small farmers' entitlement to medical cards, the only expenses taken into consideration are in relation to feeds and fertilisers.  The health boards do not treat as deductible outlets such as capital expenditure on machinery or the depreciation of such machinery or bank interest on development loans.  Yet when the Department of Health calculate farm income for the purpose of liability under the various income levies such as health contributions, employment levies and others they allow interest rates for farming purposes such as capital expenses and they exclude all forms of depreciation including capital allowances for machinery, fences, roadways and buildings.  Reform in this area is necessary to ensure that farmers are just asked to pay what they are capable of paying.  In this instance I am sure all farmers, especially farmers who would be assessed reasonably in accordance with their income would be willing to pay the levies imposed on them.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not mention the need for a complete restructuring of the social welfare services.  There are some changes introduced in social welfare services in every budget.  We now have a patchwork of <Col N="670" /> legislation vulnerable to all kinds of abuses and fast becoming of little benefit to those for whom it was intended.  It is obvious that for many years there have been defects in social welfare.  Whilst one must sympathise with the Minister and his officers because of the many anomalies that exist in social welfare, the time has come for the Minister to take drastic action to alleviate the abuses, even if it means restructuring the whole system.</P>
    <P>Abuses have been mentioned today.  I listened to Senator Magner earlier speaking about abuses and who the real culpits are.  I will refer to experiences in my own area.  When an unemployed person drawing social welfare assistance or dole calls to his local area, which is degrading, he signs for the dole and then presents his document at the post office and receives his payment.  That worker after receiving payment will continue working for the remainder of the week.  Whilst he is not to blame, I feel the person employing him is the real culpit.  Not alone has that employer cheap labour, because he is employing a man who is drawing the dole and who is employed illegally, he is also evading the payment of PRSI and PAYE.</P>
    <P>We are discussing a case locally where a man had embarked on a distributing business.  He could afford to sell his product cheaply.  We calculated that he would have approximately £400 or £500 per week.  We thought this was very little considering that he had the upkeep of a lorry to distribute the goods.  Somebody said: &ldquo;Well he had not to pay the lorry driver much because he is drawing the dole&rdquo;.  This is something that will have to be tackled to ensure that these abuses are eliminated.  It is not encouraging people to work when they can get away with that.  It is also not encouraging employers to employ people, pay them a decent wage and pay their PRSI and PAYE.</P>
    <P>I welcome the various increases in social welfare allowances, also the increase in the children's allowance scheme.  I also welcome the provisions that when a father is away the mother is entitled to draw the allowance.  The mother is the person who should receive this allowance because she is the provider in the home.  In section 3 I welcome the <Col N="671" /> increases for old age pensioners, widows and other social welfare beneficiaries, but some widows who are living alone and may not be in the best of health are not entitled to free telephone or free electricity. I would like the Minister to examine this matter and make some provision at a future stage to grant those widows such facilities.</P>
    <P>Part IV, sections 18 to 30, provides for the abolition of the old age pension committees and the assignment of their adjudication functions to deciding officers appointed by the Minister.  Whilst Senator Magner welcomed this I am opposed to it.  This is another example of bureaucracy taking over from democracy.  It is not the first time the Government have demonstrated that bureaucracy is taking over democracy and therefore undermining democracy, which is bad for the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the dole system mention was made that the processing of claims was delayed.  I am not sure if the new system will expedite the finalising of such claims and will the claimants get the fair adjudication they got heretofore under the old age pension committee system. Their work was completely voluntary. I am sure they did it fairly.  The Minister admitted that when he complimented them on fulfilling their duties down the years.  The abolition of the old age pension committees puts undue expense on the State as there will have to be extra adjudication officers appointed. Will there be extra expense incurred in paying extra adjudication officers who will replace the old age pension committees?</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for the abolition of the post of clerks to the old age pension committees and for the provision of appropriate compensation for the clerks in line with civil service practice.  This will result in the whole operation involving greater expense which will lead to false economy.  The Minister might clarify in what way he will provide compensation to the clerks.  I would also ask the Minister what he intends to do to eliminate the abuses to which I referred earlier. Whilst I welcome the increases the Minister <Col N="672" /> did not go far enough to ensure that the less well off were provided for adequately and also to ensure that action is taken to eliminate abuses completely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>My main purpose in rising to contribute on this measure is to elicit from the Minister the information as to when he will bring before the two Houses the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1984.  Like a number of other Senators I appreciate the circumstances in which the Bill is drafted to implement certain budgetary decisions, but like my colleagues I feel there is an urgent need for much more radical and significant changes in the substantive code which we call our social welfare code and also, as has been said so eloquently here this evening, in the whole manner and approach to those who are the recipients of social welfare in our society.</P>
      <P>The case for much more substantial change has been made and repeated with increasing frequency over the last few years.  Now in the first quarter of 1984 it was never more urgently needed.  We have to do some of that work because of our EEC commitments.  We are required by December 1984 to remove the discriminations against women which are still part of our social welfare code.  It is a pity that we seem to be going to wait until the last moment to implement our obligations under the Treaty of Rome.  I would have preferred if we could have given some indication that we were going to implement these changes because they are necessary and desirable changes in a modern Irish society and that we would do it ahead of the EEC deadline of December 1984, after which we risk having proceedings brought against us by the EEC Commission before the court in Luxembourg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those changes will be significant in a certain area.  We will be required to remove the overt existing discriminations against married women in the social welfare code.  The first of these is the whole concept of dependency.  That concept runs through the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 1981 which consolidated the earlier law.  It is not always appreciated, even by elected representatives, that the <Col N="673" /> legal concept of dependency is different for a married man and a married woman and that it is part of the status of being a married woman.  I have said that before in this House.  As a married woman I am legally dependent on my husband, and so is every other married woman in the country.  This has consequences then which carry through in our relationships with our husbands, our children and any financial consequences which may flow from that.  That is the first basic change which would have to be made.  The other legal discriminations would also need to be removed.</P>
    <P>There are other unacceptable discriminations in our social welfare code.  There are discriminations which affect men in our social welfare code.  The Minister, in introducing this Bill this afternoon, referred to the general background in his speech and referred to the kinds of developments which took place over the years and that certain categories were recognised. The categories of, for example, the unmarried mother, the deserted wife and the single woman.  It is now evident that there is a very serious discrimination against men who have responsibility for young children, widowers, deserted husbands, men who find themselves in a situation of having primary responsibility for young children if they do not have the possibility of being in full-time employment. This is something which must be of very serious concern to us.</P>
    <P>There is also, even within the categories that have been recognised, as for example, the category of the unmarried mother, a discrimination in the fact that we have never provided for a benefit as well as an assistance allowance, given that that is the normal structure of, for example, a deserted wife or for a widow. There is only the allowance for the unmarried mother.  There is no possibility for the unmarried mother having access to the category of a benefit even if the particular mother was in insured employment for many years before she had a child.  This again is an unjustifiable discrimination, a sort of carry over from previous attitudes, and one which should be changed.</P>
    <P>There are existing discriminations. <Col N="674" /> They are more than anomalies.  They are unjustifiable discriminations in our social welfare code, some of which, as I said, we are required to remove by the end of this year under our obligations as a member of the EEC.  In any case they are matters which should be addressed and which should be part of a Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill.  The sooner we get a Bill of that kind before us the better.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the urgent representations which were made by a number of Senators, even this afternoon, about the whole approach and the context in which people apply for and receive allowances or benefits under our social welfare code.  I endorse everything that has been said and it is not necessary to repeat it.  I will go further in some instances and say that the whole appeal system needs to be looked at as a matter of urgency.  To begin with, there does not appear to be any proper appeal structure from a decision refusing somebody supplementary welfare.  There is no proper system of appealing from that that could be in any way described as an appeal system.  This must be looked at as a matter of urgency.  Even the appeal system which exists is very secretive, very internal, very much gives the impression of a system having an internal appeal against itself and no evidence of what lawyers would call the rules of natural and constitutional justice prevailing so that the person knows the ground on which he or she is being refused, has an opportunity of making representations, has an adequate hearing on it and knows the reason then for the ultimate refusal.</P>
    <P>We should look again at even the composition of the appeal system, whether one person is the appropriate way of doing it or whether we should have a panel of more than one person in order that there would be confidence that it is objectively constituted and at least partially independent from the deciding officer, and that the person would have adequate opportunity to make the particular case.  It is the very wide experience of social workers and of those involved in a voluntary capacity with the sectors in our society who are particularly dependent on social welfare that there is a qualitative <Col N="675" /> difference between the position of a person on his or her own going into whatever office it may be or queuing up behind whatever window it may be, and the person who is assisted by the social worker or some other skilled or semiskilled person who can argue the case or indeed a politician to advocate the case for that person.</P>
    <P>This is a reflection on the system, that it is only if a person has somebody to argue the case the person is likely to get what he or she is legally entitled to and entitled to also for important social reasons.  We cannot be happy at the moment at the way in which the whole system operates and, as has already been said, there is far too much pain, humiliation and undermining of the confidence and even of the sense of the personal worth and significance of so many of the people who are dependent on and affected by the manner in which people receive their entitlements under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>We need a reforming Minister and Minister of State.  I believe we have a reforming Minister and Minister of State and that they will get a very warm welcome from this House and from the other House when radical proposals are brought forward.  Some of these require legislation.  Quite significant steps could be taken without the necessity for legislation, either by changing the detailed regulations and the approach in those regulations, and even by setting out markers of what the approach is to be and what the emphasis will be.</P>
    <P>There are indications that we will be changing very dramatically our approach in this area, and this is referred to in part by the Minister in his speech in the commitment to the commission for the reform of social welfare and also to the interim board to advise on the approach to combating poverty in our society.  If we are genuinely committed to change in this area we are not just talking about trying to ensure if we can that there are percentage increases which either totally protect recipients on social welfare or at least lessen the economic burden on them at a time of high inflation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" /> We are not talking about that kind of jigging of percentages.  We are talking about a new approach to poverty in our society and a commitment to changing the balance which, at the moment, is resulting in a polarisation.  It is resulting in a worsening of the situation for those who are dependent on social welfare income and those who are employed and have the benefit of an increasing distance being placed between them in real terms and those in receipt of social welfare.</P>
    <P>All of us who are involved in any representative capacity know that we are witnessing in Ireland in 1984 a greater, harsh, grinding poverty than was the case a decade or half decade ago.  We know that there are more families driven to the brink, of the family being either broken up or very seriously affected by the situation, women who have a very high dependency on valium and other drugs, who have a decreasing ability to cope, who are frantic and do not know how to get their voice across as to the situation in which they find themselves.  We all know of areas which were thought to be areas where you would not have this kind of incidence of real poverty and deprivation and panic on the part of a very large number of people because they cannot cope with the mortgage repayments and with the cost of living, they cannot pay the electricity bills and they cannot get from the system itself an adequate understanding of or response to their problems.  We have a deteriorating situation for a large number of these families and we have an urgent need for substantive reform and for a change of approach in our social welfare code.  I urge the Minister of State who has listened to the debate in this House this afternoon to bring before the House proposals which will really affect so many people in our society who are the most urgently in need of signals of change.  They need to see and know that we are going to change direction, that we are serious about doing it and that we regard it as possibly the greatest social priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few comments with regard to the contents of this Bill, which I welcome.  I welcome the <Col N="677" /> increases in allowances and benefits payable under the 1981 Act.  I welcome the introduction of the new family income supplement and I also welcome the abolition of the old age pension committee system.  This system was introduced at the beginning of this century in an age which was socially and politically totally different from that in which we now live. The system has outlived its usefulness. Having said that, tribute must, of course, be paid to all of those who participated in that system over the years.  Nevertheless, its functions are now outmoded, and I am glad that the Minister has decided to bring about its early abolition.</P>
      <P>I would like to join with other Senators in expressing the view that the social welfare system as we now have it is becoming increasingly complex.  It is, to my mind, unfortunate that that system for those who are least able to cope mentally or materially, should be so complex.  I urge the Minister, his Minister of State and his advisers to take steps to simplify this system, to make the system more meaningful for those who have to approach it and to make the system one which those in need can approach understanding what they are approaching.  There is a complete blank wall between the operation of the system and the people who benefit under that system.  None but the most intrepid explorers can find their way around the existing consolidated social welfare code.  It is incumbent on the Government, who are committed to reform and committed to help the less well off, to see, over the next three-and-a-half years of office, that steps are taken to ensure that the system as it exists is meaningful for those who have to avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also mention that in 1981 we had a consolidating Act which consolidated the social welfare law as it then existed.  Some system should be introduced whereby every year a composite Bill is introduced so that all the extant law dealing with this can be found in one volume.  Such operates as far as the Income Tax Acts are concerned.  Additional printed pages are made available every year so that you can find your entire statutory code in one volume.  I cannot <Col N="678" /> see why that is not also done in relation to the social welfare legislation.  The Bill before the House today is, by and large, a Bill which amends the 1981 Act and subsequent legislation.  That is a step which could be benefically taken.  It would be of tremendous help to those who have to administer this system.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to something else which is a matter of concern in the constituency I come from, that is the question of the administration of unemployment assistance so far as it affects small farmers.  I am referring to what is frequently referred to as the small farmers' dole. The first thing that should be said is that that title should be removed, consigned to oblivion and should not be used any further.  So long as we use that title we will have the difficulty we experience. That particular system and that particular allowance should be seen rather as a grant in aid of agriculture in the most depressed part of the country.</P>
    <P>My experience dealing with people who have had problems with the assistance payable to them leads me to believe that this assistance, by and large, is used for the development of agriculture in the most depressed part of the country.  The sooner it is seen as such the better.  The sooner the people who get this allowance are given some credit for the work they are doing the better.  It seems to me an appalling situation that somebody who develops from nothing, who becomes productive on a small depressed agricultural holding, and who does so with the aid of this allowance, should then be penalised by the system.  That is something which I, as a supporter of the Government, do not approve of and I call upon the Minister to see that it is radically changed.  So far as this system operates in the western counties it must operate as an incentive and not otherwise.  That is precisely what is happening at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that I avail of this opportunity to dispel the untruths that are being perpetrated in the west of Ireland by members of the Opposition who are traversing the country and who are saying the Government have taken steps to ensure that the small farmers lose <Col N="679" /> their dole.  That is what is being said.  I am very surprised at some of the sources who have uttered this untruth.  That lie should be nailed.  The point should be clearly made that the reason why we have a changed system is as a result of a High Court action brought by the Irish Farmers Association at the behest of County Wexford farmers.  The High Court decision was that the system was unconstitutional so far as it operated under the Social Welfare Act.  The point should be made quite clearly that the change from notional to factual assessment was not a change brought in by the Government but was rather a change which was necessitated because of a decision of the High Court.</P>
    <P>I wish the people perpetrating that untruth would cease to do so.  Having said that, my crib is that the factual system is administered in a most appalling manner.  This is where the big difficulty arises.  In recent months we have had many people bringing to light the difficulties in the administration of the system. I know that many representations have been made to the Minister, the Minister of State and his fellow Minister of State.  I hope that those representations will prove successful and ensuring that this system is administered differently in the near future.  At the moment it is administered somewhat like the nineteenth century poor law was administered, and it is not administered in any way that represents the kind of thinking that we would like to have in the latter years of the twentieth century.</P>
    <P>It is totally unacceptable that somebody should be faced with a social welfare officer calling to his house unannounced without an appointment who should then demand the most precise and detailed information from that person.  There is in this country what I would term the very good nest egg system.  I know, operating as a lawyer and politician in the west, that there is nobody in the west of Ireland who does not have something under the mattress for the rainy day.  When approached by the social welfare officer the immediate reaction is what is under the mattress, which may be very <Col N="680" /> small, but which is there for ultimate protection.  As a result of the confusion that is created, due to the unexpected call, frequently made by an inexperienced person with the minimum of courtesy, the person visited is forced into giving, not purposely but perhaps by omission, incorrect information.</P>
    <P>In so far as this system is operated the initial call by the social welfare officer should be announced.  This is one vital change that is necessary.  I will go further and say that the person expecting the call should be advised of the allowances and the expenditure that will be taken into account in the assessment and should be given some indication of the basis upon which the ultimate allowance will be assessed.  At the moment total confusion exists in this area.  There appear to be differences in regard to the basis of assessment as between one deciding officer to another and a confusion that is totally unacceptable.  I ask the Minister to take immediate steps to try to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>I also share the view expressed by Senator Robinson in relation to the appeals structure which exists in so far as the small farmer's allowance is concerned.  It is a little bit like going to law with the devil and the court being in hell because the general feeling is that you will get nowhere anyway.  Furthermore, people get no positive indication of how their appeal is determined.  They simply get a slip of paper indicating the sum which they are deemed to be earning for the purpose of the Social Welfare Act.  When a determination is made &mdash; either at first instance or on the basis of an appeal under these Acts &mdash; in relation to an application for allowance the applicant should be told precisely how the sum which he is deemed to be earning is assessed.  That is the barest minimum which should be provided to allow the administration of this area of our social welfare code in a way that will have the confidence of the people who most frequently have recourse to it.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to another matter. I should like to compliment the Minister on certain changes which were introduced <Col N="681" /> recently in the disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue.  I should like to compliment the Minister and his assistant Ministers on the changes which were introduced in the disabled person's maintenance allowance recently which ensured that payment of unemployment assistance will not have the effect of debarring somebody from receiving this allowance.  I do not think many people were affected by this situation but certainly the Minister responded to the cases which were brought to his notice.  This change has been effected and the health boards are now able to make the payments which were necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to refer to another matter which I feel reasonably strongly about.  It is not strictly covered by the Bill but I trust the Chair will allow me to raise it; it is the administration of the old age pension system.  It seems appalling &mdash; in the kind of democracy we are lucky enough to experience in the mid-eighties &mdash; that when people reach the age of 66 years they should have to go through a rigid inspection by social welfare officers for the purpose of determining whether they are entitled to an old age pension. I would like to ascertain from the Minister the cost to the Exchequer of allowing everybody on reaching the age of 66 years to receive an old age pension automatically. If the cost is not unduly excessive it should be provided.  When senior citizens reach that age &mdash; irrespective of means &mdash; they should be assured of a pension and should not be subjected to social welfare officers going through their means checking out what they have.  Furthermore, the system as it operates at the moment creates another difficulty, a difficulty which I experience frequently in the west, when people tell me that they are making what I can only regard as improvident transactions, transferring farms of land to their sons or daughters or sons-in-law or daughters-in-law just <Col N="682" /> for the purpose of ensuring that they get an old age pension.  We also know of situations where people transfer money and savings to ensure that they may become entitled to this payment on reaching the age of 66 years.  Some people are afraid to allow money to come into accounts which can be detected for the purpose of receiving this benefit and they resort to means which may be illegal. Money is frequently spirited across the Border to avoid or evade detection.  It is not something that we condone but it happens and is detrimental to our economy.  If the old age pension system could be administered along the lines I mentioned that would be avoided.</P>
    <P>The social welfare system must guarantee welfare to those in need in an efficient way.  It must allow the system to operate so that those approaching it can do so with dignity.  Those administering it must treat people at all times with courtesy and understanding as those who approach them are frequently not able to defend themselves.  In relation to completing forms and making applications, the simplest procedures possible should be introduced.  I agree with the point made by Senator McGonagle, that very frequently people have to make application in buildings which are not fit for occupation or for entry by humans.  In so far as the system operates in an outward sense it should operate in a more pleasant way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the increases which it introduces.  I hope that the Minister will take steps to ensure that the system will operate in a more humane and meaningful way in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should <Col N="683" /> like to begin by expressing my thanks to the Senators for their kind words of congratulations to me and best wishes on my first visit to this House.  I assure them I will do what I can and co-operate fully with them, particularly in the area of social welfare.  The debate this evening on this Bill has been a very helpful and valuable one.  It has certainly shown there is a vast reservoir of informed knowledge and expertise in the whole area of social welfare legislation, administration and practice.</P>
      <P>I have said already that I realise much work has to be done to bring our social welfare system up-to-date.  As I said in my opening speech, the Commission on Social Welfare has been set up and one of its principal tasks will be to do that job.  Some speakers in the debate referred to the fact that I had said it would take about two years for that body to issue its findings.  I do not think that is unreasonable having regard to the vast area which has to be covered and all the intricacies of the system.  Senators will appreciate that from their contributions here today.  Although there were many valuable contributions, nevertheless one could say also that we only scratched the surface of the problems today.  Every effort will be made to ensure that the commission will have all the matters examined and its findings issued within the two year target and if it does that it will be doing a very good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be impossible for me to deal with all the specific items that were raised during the debate.  The debate was on the Social Welfare Bill and I will deal with a few general points.  The main consensus was that the level of increases provided for in the Bill were not regarded by many Members as adequate and many of us would not disagree with that.  Having regard to the resources available in a time of severe recession and the fact that the increases are intended to maintain the value of the existing levels, the provisions for increases are not really that bad. When people see the queues lined up outside exchanges &mdash; this was referred to today, and I shall come back to it &mdash; they ask where does this country get all the <Col N="684" /> money to pay all these people?  At times, I suppose that is somewhat of a mystery to us.</P>
    <P>With rising unemployment there is a decreasing number of contributors to social welfare, through either the contributory PRSI system or the taxation system. As people leave work they cease to be contributors to the system and cease to be taxpayers and most of them become beneficiaries of the scheme.  There is a net loss of input into the funds while, at the same time, people benefit from the scheme.</P>
    <P>The question was asked why the increases were not given from an earlier date.  At times we can be misled about the effect of dates of operation of various increases.  As a former trade union official, I had this difficulty at times in negotiations because I found that workers who were members of the union were sometimes over-influenced by the date of application of an increase rather than the amount of the increase.  I used to make the point that an increase at a future date is preferable to two or three months back money because what you get in the increase you hold for ever.  It is far better to try to build up the increase as much as possible rather than to reduce it slightly in order to spread the money from an earlier date.  When Senators look into that they will see the validity of what I said.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon asked how long can we afford the expenditure on social welfare? As I pointed out, the total cost of increases provided for in this Bill amounted to about £68 million this year. These increases will be given effect to without any increase whatsoever in PRSI contributions and without any change in food subsidies even though it was generally expected by some people, particularly in the Opposition, that food subsidies would be reduced this year.  The fact that they were not is a built-in safeguard particularly for social welfare recipients.  It would be very easy to have given a ten per cent increase in social welfare payments by partially dismantling the food subsidies.  It might have looked better for this Bill to have provided for increases of 10 and 12 per <Col N="685" /> cent but that would be merely window-dressing. If it was done at the expense of, say, saving money on food subsidies, the social welfare recipients would be worse off.  It is our aim to ensure that the value of the increases is maintained.  With a diminishing number of people in a position to pay taxes and to make contributions it is not that easy to redistribute, which is the essence of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly, with the remarks made by Senator Fallon and other Senators about the family income supplement. It is a scheme the administration of which we hope to keep very simple.  Neither do we want a complicated system of investigation.  However, there will have to be some checks on the system and the detailed administrative arrangements will be provided for in regulations which will be published later this year.  However, it is the intention definitely to keep it in simple, administrative terms and not to have a scheme that cannot be understood.</P>
    <P>Coupled with the comments on the family income supplement were arguments that it should be extended to self-employed people, to small shopkeepers and others like that.  The scheme has to be confined to employees in the active labour force and self-employed persons are not in the scheme.  The main objective of the scheme is to maintain the incentive to work, particularly in the case of low-paid workers and those with a number of children and, at the same time, to give them a decent income.  Obviously when the wage they are earning does not give them a decent income and livelihood for themselves and their family, it is necessary to bring into play the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the self-employed would pose major problems in establishing their eligibility including, of course, quantifying their means.  It would bring us back into the whole area that came under some criticism today, the area of means-testing, and the verification of their means would be extremely difficult. It would involve much additional staffing and the more money that has to be spent on administrative matters, such as extra <Col N="686" /> staffing and so on, the less there will be available for distribution.  It is hoped to keep the scheme as simple as possible.</P>
    <P>The question of a national minimum wage as an alternative system was referred to by Senator Fallon and other Senators.  Again, this is a difficult area and I do not intend to go into it.  In the past the old Agricultural Wages Board was established to set down the minimum wage of farm workers.  In arriving at the minimum wage the Agricultural Wages Board had to take into account the ability of the medium-sized and even the poorer farmer to pay the minimum wage.  They set a wage having regard to the ability of the poor farmer to pay.  In practice, it turned out that the minimum wage became the maximum wage and the biggest farmers in the land paid the legal minimum wage.  I had a lot of experience with that because in those years I was a trade union official and I found it was very difficult to do anything about the situation when you saw a big farmer who was employing many farm workers and who was paying them the legal minimum wage.  He was not breaking the law so one could do nothing about it really.  It tended in those years to depress wages that in some cases, but not all, should have been higher.</P>
    <P>I want to deal briefly with the matter which has been referred to as the small farmers' dole.  There is a new arrangement &mdash; it has been recently introduced &mdash; whereby each applicant now receives an advance notification.  I am referring to applicants for unemployment assistance or the small farmers' dole or the people who are due for review arising from the High Court and Supreme Court decision. They are now notified in advance that the welfare officer will call and they are told exactly what they should have prepared for the social welfare officer.  For example, they are told what gross income consists of and what expenditure is taken into consideration.  This expenditure consists generally of sums expended on the following: stock replacement, animal feeding stuff, A1 and veterinary services, animal medicines, feeds, fertilisers, machinery and plant maintenance and depreciation, farm building and fencing <Col N="687" /> repairs, electricity, petrol, diesel, transport and haulage, interest payment and bank borrowings for farm purposes, hired labour or machinery rent, levies and other such charges and any other item as may be appropriate.  They are told in advance what week the social welfare officer will call and are told to have all this information ready as well as details of their income.  In the main this would consist of things like sale of stock, crops, sale of milk, wool and other produce together with receipts in the form of agricultural grants, subsidies and receipts for the letting of land, hiring out of machinery or from any other source. That new arrangement should meet some of the problems that have been experienced in this area.  As Senator Ryan has said, the system has now been extended, arising from the court decision, to applications from smallholders for unemployment assistance.  That system operated in respect of every other applicant for unemployment assistance down through the years.  It is new to the people it now affects, but it is not a new system.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Senator Higgins and Senator Durcan make the point about the change of name of the scheme from the small farmers' dole. They maintained we should not call it that or unemployment assistance because, as Senator Higgins said, these people are fully employed.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan said that the money was a form of assistance towards agriculture. It poses the question in the long term as to whether the Department of Social Welfare should operate a scheme of this kind.  Should it not be the Department of Agriculture?  There may be some point in looking at it from that angle, because as Senator Higgins said these fare deal with assistance for people who are unemployed.  The original purpose was to assist small farmers in the west of Ireland and now people want the name changed.  They want official recognition that it is not really unemployment assistance, that it is a form of agricultural support.  That is what it always was, but the Department of Social Welfare <Col N="688" /> because of their facilities and structure were probably the best Department to operate such a scheme.  If it could be looked at in the context of some kind of new scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture it would resolve many of the problems that surround it at present. Obviously there are misunderstandings about the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the facilities at employment exchanges and other facilities for claimants.  I agree that many of the employment exchanges throughout the country require to be brought up-to-date, renovated in some cases and new premises to be provided in other cases. There are a number of plans to build new government offices which would incorporate employment exchanges but some of those have been subject to delay because of the recession.  I want to assure the House that I will do everything possible to ensure that adequate facilities are available in the premises used by applicants for benefit or assistance.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word of appreciation to the Department of Social Welfare staff in some of the employment exchanges who work under enormously difficult conditions, in totally inadequate and unsuitable buildings.  With such a volume of claims to be dealt with they do a marvellous job.  They are sometimes criticised, but one must consider the large number of people who go through the offices every week and the amount of money that has to be paid out.  Generally the system runs fairly smoothly.  In the light of the kind of conditions staff have to work in, we all own them a debt of gratitude for their work.  There are other groups of workers in other areas who would not put up with the working conditions in some of our employment exchanges.  I am concerned to get better facilities for claimants but I am equally concerned about the people who have to work long hours in those buildings.  I hope we will get improvements in that area as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the proposal to abolish the old age pension committees. I covered that question fairly adequately in my opening statement.  Questions were raised about compensation for the old <Col N="689" /> age pension committee clerks.  Section 12 of the Bill provides for compensation for the clerks on the lines which apply to part-time, non-pensionable officers in the Civil Service, that is, one week's remuneration for each year of service up to 15 years and two weeks for each year in excess of 15 years up to a maximum of 78 weeks remuneration.  The total cost in this area will be £55,000.</P>
    <P>A question was also raised about the cost of the abolition of the old age pension committees.  It is estimated that the cost of the old age pension committee system at present is £190,000 per year. Staff will be needed at headquarters to take over the deciding function of the committees and the cost of that staff is estimated at £74,000, giving a net saving on the proposal of £116,00.  The saving in the first year will, of course, be somewhat offset by the necessary compensation to the clerks of the committees.</P>
    <P>I am aware I have not replied to some specific questions raised in the course of <Col N="690" /> the debate and I hope I will be in a position to answer those questions on Committee Stage.  I want to assure the House that if any Member wishes to obtain information or clarification on any matter, he or she should feel free to contact me or any official of the Department, who will give every help and cooperation.</P>

      <P>The amendments that we had tabled on this were meant to try to get the date of implementation of this section transferred from July back to 5 April.  It is extremely important that beneficiaries in the social welfare section do not lose benefit for four months, and even though I can see and understand why the Cathaoirleach overruled the amendments I still feel that we should apply the benefits which are available under this section on 5 April and so give a reasonable increase to the people who are genuinely in need.  It mentions specifically disability benefit, unemployment benefit, maternity allowance, deserted wife's benefit, invalidity pension, retirement pension, injury benefit, disablement gratuity and disablement pension. If one looks at the rate of inflation and if one looks at the cost of living I think it is disgraceful that these people who are in grave need at this stage should have the implementation of this section postponed or only being implemented on 5 July.</P>

      <P>But the thinking behind it is very simple, and it is a feature of this whole Bill that it says that where the people are asked to contribute by way of extra finance and so on it is done immediately: where the Government are giving out extra increases it is done at a late stage of the year.  That is a break from the tradition, and certainly we would oppose it and object to it.</P>

      <P>I join with the previous speakers in regretting this re-established principle.  It was one of the major steps forward in recent times that the date of application of various increases in benefits was brought forward to April.  To move it backwards again is regrettable. It distorts a lot of the claims about what are percentage benefits, and indeed it has reflected backwards.  Some of the real gains, as distinct from the standing still of people in social welfare, have been lost by virtue of this new principle, and I greatly regret it and I support the last two speakers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to support the request for the earlier payment of those benefits.  Even the Minister, <Col N="693" /> who is a trade union official himself, will agree that in any negotiating or in any wage-fixing agreements more often than not payments are made retrospective rather than postponing them as has been done under this section here tonight.  I see no reason why payments could not be made in April.  I know, of course, that it would involve extra work in the Department in getting the payments adjusted and getting books ready for despatch to recipients of social benefit and so on.  There are sufficient staff members available there to do this work, and when it was done before in previous years I see no reason why the present administration could not agree to have those payments made in April.  It is very hard to explain to people who are in receipt of social welfare that they have to wait until next July or August in order to get the 7 or 8 per cent increase granted whereas in the meantime prices are escalating and we were told recently that inflation at present is running at about 10 per cent. When those benefits come into effect they are no use to those recipients.  I would certainly appeal to the Minister to have those payments made in April as requested in the amendment which has been rejected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had dealt fairly fully with that question in my reply to the Second Stage.  I shall repeat for the benefit of those who were not here at that stage some of the points I made on this aspect of the matter.  One is of course the question of resources in the extremely bad recessionary period and the fact that there has been no increase in PRSI contributions to finance the increases now being given.  There is also the fact that food subsidies are maintained contrary to the expectations of many, particularly of the Opposition parties that they would be dismantled to some extent.  I pointed out that it could be an easy bookkeeping exercise and windowdressing exercise maybe to save something on food subsidies as was expected and give an increase to social welfare recipients but they would not have ended up any better off.  They might <Col N="694" /> in fact be worse off, because any removal of food subsidies would have resulted in increased costs overall.</P>
      <P>I also pointed out my experience as a trade union official on this point, that when one is negotiating for increases and when one knows there is only so much available in the current year and you know the total sum available and if you decide to accept the increase from a back date or from a current date the percentage rate of increase will be much lower and the longer you can postpone the increase, the higher will be the percentage rate because you will be dealing from the same amount of money.  Once you get the percentage increase you hold it and next year there is a percentage on top of that increased amount.  For example &mdash; I am not making a case for this &mdash; if the Department and I were to say that the total amount of money available for increases to social welfare recipients will be deferred until December, then we will grant the total amount of money, I have not done the mathematical calculation but it would probably amount to 20 or 25 per cent of an increase.  That would be a great thing because they would hold that 25 per cent of an increase and they would get some more.  In times like this when it is very difficult to get additional resources one must use the amount available to the best effect and one could argue for a postponement still if the people could afford to wait.  But of course they cannot afford to wait.  I agree with Senators who point out that people should get their increases earlier, but it would mean that for the same amount of money it would be a lower percentage. So, it would be in the long term interest &mdash; not in the short term interest &mdash; of social welfare recipients to defer it further. It would amount to a bigger percentage increase and they would hold that for as long as they were receiving that benefit.</P>
      <P>For those reasons I would hope that the House would agree to this section.</P>

      <P>There is an amount of money available for payment.  Irrespective of when that amount is paid that is what is going to be paid anyway.  The <Col N="695" /> person who is going to get the benefit would prefer to get the benefit now, I am sure.  I would like to know how it would benefit somebody to hold off payment of benefit from now until 1 July rather than get an increase of 7 per cent now.  The Minister did say there is no increase in PRSI contributions.  The next section says there is an increase of between 0.1 and 0.4 per cent.</P>

      <P>No, I just wanted to ask the Minister about the payment of unemployment assistance which comes under this section.  Because of the different systems of assessing the means of recipients of this assistance many people have lost out.  They have either been reduced in the amount of benefit being <Col N="696" /> paid to them or they have been disqualified entirely.  I would like to ask the Minister, in view of the changes he now proposes to make in the system of assessing those people's means, if he would go back to those people who have lost their benefit and have them reviewed again under the new proposals he hopes to initiate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Just before the Minister replies to that I would agree that if there were anomalies under the previous assessment they should be looked at again.  Could I ask the Minister for a confirmation or otherwise of something stated in radio recently?  It was that in the process of means-testing small farmers in particular one of his officials publicly admitted that if they were not satisfied with the information available from the person being investigated they went next door and asked the neighbour.  Surely, if we talk about a supergrass system, that is the supergrass system of all time.  If you will excuse the pun, if you are not satisfied with the amount of grass the nextdoor neighbour says he has, you go and ask the supergrass how much grass he has.  I hope the system used will be the person's goodwill and good faith in the information avaialble and there should be no spot-checking with neighbours to know if a claimant is telling the truth.  I was amazed and quite disheartened that a public official admitted that they do that.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that if that happened in the past it will stop forthwith.  I certainly do not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>On Senator Hussey's point about the notification that is now being sent to applicants and to people who are about to be reviewed, it is not really a new means of assessment; it is not a new system of asessment.  The existing means of assessment remains.  It is just a letter that will go to these people in advance of the social welfare officer calling to them, to let them know the particular week the officer will call and to let them know in advance what information he will require.  That has always been the case except that now this letter goes also.  If any Senator feels that there <Col N="697" /> is any applicant or claimant who has new information that perhaps the claimant overlooked at the time of the investigation, then it is open to that person to ask for a review on the basis of that.  I am sure anybody in that position will ask for a review, if there is new information or if there is anything which they feel was not taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>On the question raised by Senator Ferris, it is normal practice for an inquiry to be made from a neighbouring farmer or a neighbouring person where there is, for example, a letting of land.  If the claimant has land let or is land leasing himself the other farmer has to be interviewed in connection with that.  There is no practice other than that.  That is the only practice which is followed in relation to calling on neighbours.  It is in order to get information relative to the claim only in cases where they have land set or perhaps other dealings of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister one or two questions on social assistance payments.  I was going to mention it on the Second Stage but I think it is more a Committee Stage question.  I was interested to hear Senator Brendan Ryan speaking about the difficulties of assessing people and the fact that certain people in rural areas now have difficulty which is highlighting this fact.  That is true.  Anything which can be done for any person who is receiving social assistance to make the system more understandable to them is worth while.  Arising out of the proposal for new rates for social assistance payments under section 4 of this Bill, I would like to welcome what the Minister said about his intention to ensure that people &mdash; in the western counties in particular who are in receipt of what is termed farmers' dole &mdash; will now be given advance warning of the coming of the official to investigate it, <Col N="698" /> even if that warning does not include the exact time.  At least he will know the investigation is under way and he should be preparing the information.  We should recognise that there is a fundamental difference between somebody whose income is being assessed and who has no income at all and a person whose success depends on proving that the small venture he has &mdash; which is a small farm &mdash; has achieved a certain level of profitability in the preceding year.  The level of information and expertise is obviously entirely different.</P>
      <P>The Minister was talking about small farmers' dole.  Where re-assessment is made and it is found that the level of assistance will be reduced or even abolished completely because of an excess of means assessed by the social welfare officer, is it intended from this on that the social welfare officer make available to the applicant the calculation of the social welfare officer in arriving at what the actual means was?  For instance will there be issued a statement such as, &ldquo;your income was £5,000; your expenses were A, B, C, D, E, F, G and I assess that you had such and such income and that qualified you at a lower level or disqualified you completely&rdquo;?  I think that kind of information which is essential should be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a valid question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not done exactly that way because it is not done strictly on an accounts system.  The social welfare officer discusses with the applicant all the circumstances in relation to the claim and the circumstances of the applicant.  It is not strictly a bookkeeping exercises, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to spell out in an accounts system to how the figure was arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree at all with the Minister.  The legislation which forms the basis of the new rates we are putting in under section 4 of the Bill quite clearly states that there is to be an assessment of the income of the individual.  The only way an assessment can be made is that <Col N="699" /> somebody estimates a person's income, writes it down, estimates items of expenditure under various headings and arrives at the conclusion that the person's net income in respect of the preceding year was a particular sum and then arrives at a decision whether that is above or below the appropriate threshold.  I accept that we are not looking for an audited set of accounts but somebody has to make a mathematical assessment because the answer is mathematical.  If a person is in receipt of an estimated income in excess of the threshold he does not get anything.  If he is below the threshold he gets the dole.  So if somebody arrives at a mathematical conclusion he can only do so in two ways.  One is by picking a figure out of the air and the other is by subtracting one figure from another.  I should like to ask the Minister whether in those circumstances he will give further consideration to the question of supplying people whose means are being reduced with a statement of what the deciding officer or the social welfare officer's assessment of his means for the preceding year was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>To follow the point further, we initiated legislation last year which brought everybody in the farming sector into the tax net for the first time irrespective of rateable valuation.  On 5 April this year by law every farmer in this country from 50p valuation up to the maximum valuation will have to produce evidence to the Revenue Commissioners of what, in fact, his trading income is.  Surely that is a sufficient basis to determine whether, first, he is entitled to a medical card, and, secondly, to determine his health and social welfare contributions and entitlements. The whole thing can be done with one clear sweep of administrative readjustment within the Department and we can avoid people going around the country counting the chickens and so on.  We can forget all that kind of assessment if we have figures.  We have brought everybody into the net, and rightly so.  If people's incomes are above a certain level they will pay tax on them.  If their incomes are below a certain level and they need a <Col N="700" /> supplement we will give it to them.  That is the way to proceed.  It is the way to eliminate a lot of the problems that we all have as legislators and it will not discriminate against anyone.  I hope the Minister will give an assurance that his Department will look at this seriously in consultation with the Department of Finance which deals with the Revenue Commissioners.  That would meet Senator O'Leary's objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Leary's request is very reasonable.  It is only right that people on whom an assessment has been carried out would know exactly where they stand when that assessment is completed.  All they get from the Department of Social Welfare is a letter telling them that as a result of a review, their means exceed the statutory limits, which in their case is such a figure.  They are not given any breakdown with regard to their income or expenses.  Last week I was speaking to a local person who was disqualified.  He was in receipt of £67 per week.  He is a married man with five children.  He was disqualified because he was sending milk to the creamery and he is convinced that the cost of meals and fertilisers to feed those cows exceeded the amount the officer had down as his assessment of income or means.  He was completely dissatisfied with the way the matter was dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Minister about this because in reply to the Second Reading of the Bill he said that certain items were being taken into consideration, such as the purchase of diesel, of fertilisers, of meal and of farm equipment as well as all the veterinary expenses.  There are many farmers who have been assessed and who did not know they were entitled to submit an account of those expenses. Those who knew and who had those bills available found that the social welfare officr was not interested in them.  That is what I have been told.  There is no use giving advance warning to these people that the social welfare officer is coming out to assess their means.  That will achieve nothing except a week of restless sleep for the unfortunate recipients of social welfare.  If they are not to get a <Col N="701" /> breakdown of how they are being assessed of what they are allowed to claim for and so on, the exercise is absolutely useless.  I can see no point in giving these people advance warning if there is not some change in the system of assessment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to the points that have been made by Senators O'Leary, Ferris and Hussey.  It is only basic justice we are talking about here.  The method of assessment is fair enough, but what we are talking about is a method of rejection.  If an application is being refused, it is only just, fair and proper that the assessment on which that refusal is being based is made available. Otherwise we cannot establish that the costs the applicant was entitled to charge against his gross income were fully taken into account.  Unless that information is made available, the value of appealing a case is questionable.</P>
      <P>I might say, that the experience we had on the old age pension committees was that where smallholders were being assessed for old age pension purposes it was very evident that full acknowledgement and full account was not taken of justifiable costs in the assessments made by social welfare officers in calculating means for pension purposes.  I am satisfied that the only way we can ensure justice is done and that full account is being taken of the allowable costs that have been circulated is by the production of the assessment made by the social welfare officer.  Unless that is done there is no way we can ensure that justice will apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speakers have raised a very important issue and one that I would be remiss by not commenting on.  Can the Minister not at least undertake to assess the whole procedure by which means are assessed, not just for smallholders but in general, because there are questions, issues and principles being raised here about the method by which people are approached, what are allowable expenses and so on?  It is a complete snakepit for anybody outside of real experts to determine what is and what can be assessed. <Col N="702" /> Perhaps in the case of smallholders it is simpler but as I said in the case of many other people who have to deal with these similar things the problem is still the same.  Ultimately there is the question of the deciding officers.  People trouble themselves to appeal but there is still the problem of the inadequacy of information.</P>
      <P>Without costing the State any extra in expenditure and without in any way facilitating fraud the information could be made available to people in advance of an assessment of their income and prior to an appeal.  Also, information made available to people subsequent to an appeal could be very useful.  One cannot help suspecting, when there is this apparent clampdown on what seems like a reasonable demand for information, that somewhere along the line there is an arbitrary regulation that is not based on the real assessment of income but more on some sort of rule of thumb which is used to give people guidelines for what it is admitted is a fairly complex field.  Can we not at least have the detailed information made available on the basis on which decisions are made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

      <P>I agree with what has been said.  How can one find out why a demand is turned down?  Are full details as to why a person was turned down for benefit available to him afterwards?

    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">

      <P>The only point I should like to make at this stage is that I would like the Minister to give an assurance that all these social welfare officers going out would inform the people as to what they should be claiming for.  I have known of many cases, and in some instances involving pension committees, where people have acted in a sneaky fashion and got the wrong information.  One would think they were trying to justify their existence as officers.  I regret the passing of the pensions committees.  They were able to make certain discoveries.  I would like if we could have an assurance from the <Col N="703" /> Minister that these social welfare officers when they would go out would inform the people as to everything they could claim for.  If all of us knew that this was going to be done, we would be quite happy.  I am sure there are many people who were refused benefit on the basis of information supplied by the social welfare officer, who never complained to any public representative, but who probably just grinned and bore it, so to speak.  It is only when they meet somebody with the same means as themselves but whose application has been successful that they realise there was something wrong in regard to their case.</P>

      <P>May I just broaden the section and hope that as a result of this discussion on the situation whereby farm incomes are calculated by several Government Departments each having their own criterion, the Department of Health using two, the Government would set up a committee within themselves to once and for all iron out the exact definition of farm income and let that be the guiding light for the future?  Perhaps the Minister will take back that message to the Government this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>That last point was precisely the point I was going to make, because a number of Senators have referred to the method of assessment by the Revenue Commissioners.  Of course they have their own way of assessing.  The Department of Social Welfare operate within the terms of the Acts and within the regulations but these are not the same as the Acts under which the Revenue Commissioners operate.  Section 145, subsection (1) (c) of the Social Welfare Act requires that in calculating the means of a person for unemployment assistance purposes account must be taken of the yearly value as obtained in the prescribed manner of any advantage accruing to him from the use of property other than a domestic dwelling or a farm building owned and occupied, furniture and personal effects which is personally used or enjoyed by him.  The legislation specifically mentions any advantage accruing, and that is what the social welfare officer <Col N="704" /> has to get information on.  The deciding officer then makes a decision on the basis of that information and of course that decision can be appealed to an appeals officer.  It has never been the practice to provide details of the expenses taken into account in the assessment.  The assessment is not a precise mathematical exercise. The deciding officer estimates the value of the farm and determines the entitlement to assistance having regard to the means that have been furnished by the social welfare officer.  Having said that, I will have the points made by Senators considered.  That is all I can say at the moment.</P>
      <P>The unemployment assistance operates on that specific section which in itself is possibly a bit vague and it may be to people's advantage that that is the case. Would a more hemmed-in provision prove to the applicant's advantage?  It would enable perhaps the making available of the kind of information that Senators now require to be furnished to claimants.  It is really the deciding officer who, on the information which comes from the social welfare officer, has to decide on the advantage accruing.  That is provided for in the Act.  It is peculiar to the Social Welfare Act.  I wish to assure the House that the observations made will be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the advantage to be gained by owning a property other than the main residence, surely the only way a social welfare officer can judge the gain or the advantage is to get details of whatever stock are on a farm, the value of crops and then to subtract whatever is the amount for expenses.  If, as the Minister has said, the situation is imprecise, we have different assessments of what the real value is.  The only advantage gained is that of profit.  There has to be an excess of incomes over expenses and that surely must be a precise figure. The Minister did not answer the question as to the entitlement of the person being assessed to the information afterwards as to why he was turned down and equally who else is entitled to that type of information if somebody is turned down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="705" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I greatly appreciate the Minister's careful explanation of what the situation is.  I do not disagree with him at all but what I am trying to bring about is a new situation.  I agree with the Minister that it is a long-standing tradition preceding by a long time this particular kind of assessment of the farmer's dole.  It has been built into the social welfare code for many years but I should like to say to the Minister that he should not underestimate the determination of Members on all sides of this House in this matter.</P>
      <P>There will have to be a change in the way a farmer is assessed for dole.  A farmer after all is a small trader and that is where the problem arises.  What is applied to him can be applied in principle to anybody else but in his case there are many different headings of expenditure. When a farmer's dole is being disallowed or reduced, a situation must be brought about where he is entitled to the information on which the decision is based.  He is entitled to see the mathematical numbers put by the social welfare officer and used by the deciding officer in deciding the case.</P>
      <P>I understand very well that the social welfare officer's figures may not be exact. I am not asking that they should be exact. I understand that there would be an element of estimate in it because the person may not have the accurate information but at least, if the document is available it gives the applicant the opportunity of deciding whether to appeal.  One finds in more than 50 per cent of the cases that when faced with the hard facts the applicants have to agree with them.  In other cases they will give receipts to the appeals officer to prove what they are saying.  I have no objection to the document produced, which must be produced by the social welfare officer and used by the deciding officer, forming the basis of assessment until it is disproved.  At least, one knows where one starts from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for stating what the position is but there is nothing in the regulations which forbids what I am suggesting. It is merely a matter of administrative practice but he should not underestimate the determination of Members <Col N="706" /> on all sides of this House and of the other House to bring about a change in the situation.  This is a non-political issue and there is no item I have seen in my short time in this House which has untied Members on both sides of the House more than the injustice which has been done to these people because they are being denied the information on which to base an appeal.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan says other people are also being denied this right.  Everybody must get the information on which he can make whatever appeal is necessary. When this is done, one will find that most of the appeals will melt away like snow in the month of May because very often there is no basis for the complaints, whereas if one hides behind a cloak of secrecy, the people concerned and their families will go to the grave in the belief that they were done out of money by the Government.  I am sorry there is not a Cabinet Minister present to hear what is being said.  We are talking about a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are now proposing to abolish the old age pension committees and leaving this matter for the deciding officer as well.  Will the old age pensioner be entitled to the same information?  If somebody comes to the conclusion that an applicant's means are in excess of what would entitle him to a full or to a reduced pension, he should be given the information as to how the assessment was made. It is not that we think there is a fantastic amount of money to be gained by applicants in this matter but there is involved a sense of injustice which is almost as important as the monetary factor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Leary has said what I should like to say but he has said it with more eloquence.  We are indeed united on this issue.  I find the whole idea of anybody having his means assessed in this sort of imprecise, indefinable, nonmeasurable way and, therefore impossible to compare by any objective standard, to be totally unsatisfactory.  May I appeal to Members of this House not to confine their interest in this issue just to the recipients of what is called farmers' dole?  The same difficulties have been <Col N="707" /> experienced for a long time by the unemployed. Precisely the same issues arise.  I hope to achieve some significant progress on this.</P>
      <P>If we are to make progress on that issue, may I appeal to the Minister that in any attempt to help people he should ensure that what is issued is in language and in a format that are understandable. I have mentioned a document of clarification regarding assessment of benefit-in-kind from living at home.  I have read it six times and if I read it another six times I would still be confused.  The people for whom it is intended may take a different point of view.  There is no point in trying to clarify something in a way that confuses us further.  The duty of large organisations, particularly large Government Departments, should be to clarify matters in a way that is clear to those who understand them already.  We should try to remember that we are clarifying matters for people who do not understand them and who may well take a different point of view.  Therefore, the clarification should be written in simple English and in ways that people with reasonable intelligence can understand. I appeal to the Minister to look at the document of clarification which was issued to Members of the Oireachtas on that particular issue last year.  It is a model of how not to do things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious from the Minister's response to all the pleadings from each side of the House that in addition to income which can be assessed in a mathematical way, taking input and output costs and subtracting one from the other, there is an advantage accruing from owning property with the exception of the home or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To bear out Senator Ryan's point, this applies to the unemployed children of people living in urban and rural areas, who are themselves assessed as having some advantage by reason of living in their parents' home.  That is even applied in different ways, depending on the kind of home one is living in, for example, whether one is living with four, five or six children, or if one's father is better off <Col N="708" /> than others.  It is all in the hands of the deciding officer.  Because of this peculiarity in the Social Welfare Bill which allows the assessing officer to give an advantage accruing from the ownership of property apart from the income from it, the anomaly has arisen.  It does not need an amendment to this Bill to set it right.  Senator O'Leary started off on this and I tried to tease it out &mdash; by having it done on accounts.  Apparently under the present legislation you cannot just do it on accounts because you must take into account this other section.  We are asking the Minister that at least the applicants are advised under what grounds they were either given the pension, it was reduced or increased.  If they knew that they would then be in a position either to appeal it or otherwise.  It is not unfair of the Members of this House to ask the Government to ask for this.  It can be taken as the unanimous wish of this House that we are asking the investigating officers to help people and not to actually go out with the intention of disqualifying anybody but to help them to get what they are entitled to.  If that is the attitude of officers, they will be welcomed in people's homes.  They will be able to sit down and explain what is required of the applicant and the decision, when it is finally made, based on the income and the advantages.  If all that is set down, the people will accept it, otherwise, we could be doing an injustice to a lot of people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I wish to make.  One will be re-emphasising something which I said earlier, but a new element, as far as I can see, has come into the calculations since I spoke last, that is, the Minister has told us that the social welfare officer must take account of what will appear to be an advantage. Therefore, I am concerned that not alone were we earlier trying to establish the right of an applicant to know on the question of means why his claim was rejected but now there is an element that is totally new to me brought into the scales here. This is the apparent advantage.  How does an individual, social welfare officer or any of us, measure an advantage?  We have got to be clear on this.  Is there some <Col N="709" /> standard set of guidelines set for doing it or is it left to the individual assessment or opinion of each social welfare officer to measure what would appear to be an advantage?  If it is, obviously there will be wholesale inconsistencies there.  My attitude is that not alone are we looking for a disclosure of the calculation on which an applicant was refused his entitlement, as it were, but we would also want to know, if this advantage element is brought into the calculation, how this is measured.  Is it measured because, for example, there is pride about a home, a yard, outoffices, the appearance of the family, if they have, for example, the appearance a well-kept home can give? Would that seem to be an advantage element? I have got some information which I think more or less helps me on that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>It has helped to clarify what I was seeking but it does not alter the basic argument that I am making, that is that the measuring of this advantage is very much a matter for the investigating officer and, therefore, we would need to have a standard approach to this.</P>
      <P>The other point is reiterating something I said earlier.  There is little point &mdash; this is probably being done with the best goodwill in the world &mdash; in the applicant receiving a notification a week ahead of the visit of the social welfare officer informing him that he is entitled to put into the balance sheet the following allowable costs.  There are 18 or 20 of them mentioned on the list.  There is no point informing him he can do that if, at the point of refusal he is not in a position to be satisfied that what he submitted was genuinely taken into account.  The only way that that fear &mdash; it is a genuine fear &mdash; can be satisfied is by a disclosure of the assessment on which the refusal is based.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another group of people who are being discriminated against here, that is farmers' sons who apply for this unemployment assistance. <Col N="710" /> In their case they are being assessed with the value of board and lodgings on their fathers' farms.  In many cases they finish up with maybe no dole at all or else they are granted a sum of £2.50 a week, which I have seen, whereas, a pal down the road, who is the son of a building contractor or a shopkeeper, can come out with £24.50 a week.  That is entirely wrong, because if the farmer's young son could get employment he would not have to depend on his father's farm to provide him with board and lodging.  A serious look should be taken at that because it is discriminating against those young fellows who are not needed on their fathers' farms.  If they could get jobs away from the farm they would be gone, but because they cannot get employment what are they to do?  They have to stay at home and hope that their father and mother will provide them with the wherewithal to live.  They are being deprived of the dole because of that.</P>
      <P>Is there any liaison between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Agriculture in assessing the number of stock a particular farmer has when this assessment is being carried out?  Some of those social welfare officers arrive on farmers' doorsteps armed with figures as regards the number of stock they have, the cattle that have been sold at a mart and so on.  They are getting that information from the Department of Agriculture or there are many supergrasses around on whom they are relying to give them this information.  I would like the Minister to clarify that.</P>

      <P>As I said previously, the points raised by the Senators in relation to the issue of information regarding assessments will be considered.  I should point out that the section of the Act I quoted is there since 1933.  It was included in the Consolidation Act in 1981.  I am sure Members of this House and the Dáil gave every consideration to those Bills when they were before both Houses.  I take the point that the passage of time gives rise to new situations and consideration will have to be given to the points raised here.  In relation to the point raised by Senator Hussey, in the case of <Col N="711" /> matters like the headage grants, official information is available to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>The Minister is saying that information about the amount of money which has been paid by the State to a farmer is available to the social welfare officer.  It is an inevitable consequence of this.  I do not see anything wrong with it so long as the information is restricted to being used for a relevant purpose.  The assessment of a person's <Col N="712" /> entitlement under the Social Welfare Act is a relevant purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no general rule, but one can envisage a situation where a social welfare officer, in pursuance of his duty, will need to get receipts from farmers of any grants, any subsidies they received.  It simplifies the matter if he goes to the local agricultural office and gets the information before calling on the farmer.  He then just has to have it verified. I assume in that situation he would not look for documentation from the farmer.  I would not foresee any major problem in that area.  In fact, it may be helpful in particular cases.  There is not a general rule that they should do this.</P>

      <P>I would have no objection to the officer being made aware of the amount of money being paid in headage grants and so on.  That can be verified without any problem.  I would have serious reservations about the Department of Agriculture giving information on the number of stock owned by a farmer at any particular time.  I know that they refused to do that some years ago in relation to the health boards.  The health boards, in assessing a farmer's means for qualification for a medical card, asked for that information.  I am surprised to hear that this system has been changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to go back to the original question as to who is entitled to get information after an assessment is done.  Is the proposed beneficiary entitled to it?  Would a Member of the Oireachtas be entitled to it?  Is the information available to anybody?  Reference was made to the farmers' dole.  We should try to get this whole area away from the Social Welfare Bill and treat the income supplement that a small farmer gets as an income supplement because he lives on a small farm and much of what we are discussing here tonight would be taken <Col N="713" /> out of the realms of probability, possibility or advantage gained.  It is a complex area which is not suitable for discussion in terms of other social welfare benefits. We must decide whether we want to keep people on small parcels of land which are totally uneconomical or do we want to have those parcels of land amalgamated into ranches and do away with what was the basis of the growth of our economy in the beginning?  Unless we do that in the end we will be continually arguing here as to what should or should not be given to small farmers.  That is for another day.  I would like to know who is entitled to get details of asessments which have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been the practice to give the information.  The claimant gets the result of the assessment and is told the amount of means assessed against him or her.  That is then subtracted from the fixed figure of benefit and the difference is got.  Consideration will be given to everything that has been said here.  It is not generally the intention to have the assessments changed with every fluctuation of income that the applicant would have.  Unless the claimant applies for a review, having regard to some significant change in the person's circumstances, or alternatively, if the social welfare officer discovers something that should be reinvestigated.  As a general rule the assessment lasts for approximately three years.  The practice that the House is advocating would give rise to many changes.  If the system has to outline everything in detail &mdash; I am not arguing against that &mdash; I am merely pointing out that it will entail another layer of administration in the social welfare system in order to do that.  I am not arguing against the points made.  From what Senator O'Leary said I am well aware of the feelings of Members of this House and the other House on this subject.  I am sure all of these matters will get full consideration to see if the views of Members can be met in some way and at the same time would not create another administrative bottleneck and backlog. We are trying to get rid of backlogs in the Department not create further backlogs <Col N="714" /> and bottlenecks in administration.  It is certainly the intention of all of us to improve the system.</P>

      <P>I would be happy, arising from the discussion, if the Minister would bring back to the Government what I said on the whole area of farm income and the criteria with all the different Government Department's involved, Education have one system, Health have two systems, and Environment have another.  It should be established and defined once and for all how farm income is defined. I want to make the point, arising from this discussion, that the farmers' dole is a misnomer in many ways because the people concerned are not unemployed. They are small farmers in need of money to keep them ticking over.  There is a very valid case that what they should be getting is not social welfare but a Department of Agriculture subsidy.  That is worthy of consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the Minister of State he has been as forthcoming as possible on this.  I take it from what he said that he is bringing back all the views of this House to the Government.  Would he also bring back to the Government the view that something must be done in this area?  I do not accept that it will create any administrative problems.  The information is available to the deciding officer and all he has to do is communicate it.  In the form of the decision he gives a person be might as well write down: &ldquo;You are disallowed because...... or disallowed because......&rdquo;  All Members of this House should get together in a motion to request that this is done if that would facilitate the Minister of State. It is not his fault that the Act is worded in the way it is.  He now knows the problems and this is our desire and if it does not happen we will be warning the Department of Social Welfare that this is how we would like to proceed.  I propose that we move to the next section.</P>

      <P>I must apologise to the Minister on this one.  He said that an assessment has not generally been given to the person looking for the benefit.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not grown.  The practice of not doing that is always there. If he studies the section of the Act which I quoted there, the Senator will appreciate that it would be difficult to spell out in exact detailed figures what one is looking for.  That is what we have to consider. That is what I said over and over again on the section.  It is one of the things that I will have to consider fully to see if there is any way in which it can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought we were getting to some kind of conclusion on this until the Minister got up.  There is nothing in the Act which forbids the Minister giving the details to people.  If the Act imposes an obligation on the social welfare officers to put a value on &mdash; that is what it is &mdash; a benefit which somebody is getting, somebody has to produce that catch.  Somebody has to say that living in that house is worth £5 a week to the person or it is worth £4 a week, or owning that piece of property is worth £1 a week. Somebody does that.  It is purely an administrative decision and we want the administrative decision changed.  Otherwise, whether they are or not, people do not think they are getting justice.  It is as important sometimes to think you are getting justice as getting the money in your pocket.</P>

      <P>The section states that the contribution to be paid by the employers is to be increased by between .1 and .4 per cent and the occupational injuries fund is entirely financed by employers' contributions and by fund investments.  Could I have the details of the employers' contributions for last year, the income from fund investments and why this fund is in danger of going bankrupt as it just says to maintain the solvency?  Is it because last year the funds in which the moneys were invested did not come up to scratch or was it because there was not enough money put in by the employers in the first place?  To say that it is financed by fund investments is not something that I would accept without knowing what these funds are.  I would like to know where the money came from last year, how much came from the fund investments and how much came from the employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously in any fund of this nature the contribution to it has to fluctuate from time to time.  Section 6 provides for an increase of .1 per cent in the employers' contribution to the occupational injuries fund, as announced in the budget statement of 25 January last. On the introduction of the PRSI contribution system in April 1979 the rates of contribution was fixed at .45 per cent. The rate temporarily decreased to .3 per cent in April 1981 in the light of accumulated reserves in the fund.</P>
      <P>It is now found necessary, in order to maintain solvency in the fund, to increase the contribution rate by .1 per cent.  If no change was made in the rates the fund would be virtually exhausted by the end of March 1985.  The increase will take effect from 6 April 1984 and will yield £3.7 million.  The investments that finance the occupational injuries fund amount to £1.253 million.  The total fund is £24.469 million.  Those are the 1984 figures.</P>

      <P>It has been said that in each year the floor for pay-related benefits is increased and that this year it is necessary to increase it from £36 to £43. This means that a certain number of workers will lose benefit.  I would like to know is the rationale, apart from just increasing it &mdash; it has been increased before &mdash; just to save money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>When the pay-related benefit scheme was introduced in 1974 the proportion of the reckonable weekly earnings used in calculating the rate of benefit was disregarded.  This disregard or floor was set at over twice the prevailing rate of flat rate benefit at £14.  It remained unchanged until 1981, even though the rate of flat rate benefit was significantly increased in the meantime. If the floor had been increased in line with the formula used in 1974 it would now stand at £74 per week.  Under the 1981 (Amendment) Act the floor was automatically linked to the maximum rate of flat rate of DB and UB rounded to the nearest pound at the beginning of January each year.  This provision was removed under the Social Welfare Act, 1983 when the floor was set at £36.  It is now being increased to £43 in order to keep the overall level of benefit in proportion to the earnings they are intended to replace.</P>
      <P>The change will apply to periods of interruption of employment commencing on or after 2 April 1984 so that no existing claimant will lose benefit and it will only apply to the periods of interruption commencing on or after 2 April 1984.  It will result in savings of £2.8 million in 1984.  There is no increase in the level of the earnings ceilings up to which pay-related benefit is payable.  At present this is set at £220 per week or £11,000 per annum.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the leasing of land.  The present system of assessing means from land favours short-term letting. Under this section the means of the lessor for social assistance purposes is not going to be calculated by reference to the capital value of the holding but on the basis of the profits from the lease.  I wonder if this will be any advantage, because we have experience before of the EEC farm retirement scheme which was a complete failure because the pension that he got from the Land Commission for his land was assessed against him, he was disqualified from social benefits and also lost his medical card and so on.  Could anything further be done under this section to encourage elderly farmers to hand over the land to younger farmers?  Unless there is a guarantee to those people that in the event of their handing over their land for a number of years to a younger more progressive farmer they will qualify for their old age pension, medical card and so on, the system will never be a success because the old age pension, free travel and the medical card mean a lot to them. <Col N="719" /> If they think for one minute that they are going to lose those benefits by handing over their land to younger and more progressive farmers we will have a problem in trying to encourage them to do so.</P>
      <P>This section should be gone into in great detail to ascertain if there is anything further that could be done to encourage farmers who are no longer able to work their land to hand it over to younger and more progressive farmers.</P>

      <P>We should welcome this section.  It is an exact replica of the argument we are putting up in relation to the other case.  I am surprised that Senator Hussey feels that it might be a disadvantage. The real advantage in this section is that it does not add this advantage to the ownership of the land that is leased on a longer term.  It stimulates longer term leasing and the benefits accruing from it are the genuine profits arrived at from its leasing.  It is the argument we were making in the previous section which delayed the Minister for an hour or so.  It is no disadvantage for the owner of the property.</P>

It is important to deal with it in this legislation too, because we have been using a different way of assessing the ownership of that land up to now and this is a breakthrough.

      <P>Section 10 extends to mothers as well as fathers a concession contained in the principal Act whereby children's allowances are paid to children who live outside the State and in respect of fathers and mothers who are employed in the service of the Government outside the State, who are employed by the State outside the State or who are employed by an international organisation outside the State.  I fail to understand why this country should pay children's allowance to men and women and their children in the service of an international organisation who are living outside this country.  It is bad enough to be paying children's allowance to people who do not need it besides paying it to people who are working in the World Health Organisation, the International Labour Organisation and the United Nations.  That is absolutely crazy.  I am certainly not going to ask the Minister to change it at this hour of the night but he should take a note of it.  I do not think we should be paying social welfare payment in respect of somebody who is not being paid by the State and who is living abroad.  We will be paying it for President Nixon's children next, or somebody like him.</P>

The section <Col N="721" /> refers to a person who is engaged in full-time employment, where such a person is a married person living with or mainly maintaining his or her spouse and the child.

      <P>I am satisfied it is a family income supplement whether it is a one or two parent family.  It is based on the family unit and I am glad that the Minister has confirmed that when this comes into force, is it the gross pay or the net pay after deduction of PAYE or PRSI?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The limits are set at gross pay.  To clarify the previous point, I should say that payments under this scheme will be made to families with children where at least one parent is engaged in full-time employment. Accordingly, where a single parent, such as a widow, a deserted wife or unmarried mother, is working and the family income including any social welfare payment other than children's allowance is within the limits of the scheme, that family will qualify for a family income supplement.  In the case of a two parent family who are unmarried the supplement would be payable to whichever of the couple is receiving children's allowance in respect of the child or children. In that situation any income of the other member of the couple would be ignored because the definition of family does not include persons other than the claimant's spouse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>This section enables the Minister to adjust payment of a family income supplement where it is payable concurrently with unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit or retirement pension.  The concurrent payment of family income supplement with, for example, unemployment or sickness benefit would be contrary to the objectives of the scheme ensuring through the family income supplement that recipients are better off working than claiming social welfare benefits. However, illness can occur at any time and does not normally result in the termination of employment.  It would be unreasonable, therefore, to terminate the supplement immediately a worker claims disability benefit.  In any event, the frequent adjustment of family income supplement payments arising from short spells of sickness or unemployment would give rise to considerable administrative difficulties for the Department. The precise arrangements for withdrawal of supplement in the event of qualification for unemployment or disability benefit have yet to be determined.  It is proposed by the insertion of a new subsection in section 130 of the Consolidation Act to give the Minister power to adjust family income supplement payments in cases where it is concurrently payable with the payments mentioned. The regulations will require the approval of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I did not speak on Second Stage but I want to state that I do not agree with the doing away of the local pension committee.  I accept Minister Pattison's long service in local government and at national level but I do not know who advised him to put in this section.  I know him for some time and he is a man who does his own thing. Knowing the service these people give and listening to the long discussion on section 3 &mdash; layers of administration to get a report back to the person to tell them why they were knocked &mdash; here we are doing away with the vehicle that the person had to go to, their local representative.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Pattison, spoke about the cost involved.  Would the Minister say what system he is replacing these pension committees with?  He gave figures of what it costs now and what it cost previously.  These local committees cost nothing.  The people who served on them for a number of years were all voluntary members.  They did not even get travelling expenses, just in case we are accused of getting them a few times over.  I oppose doing away with these committees.  I do not think any politician who served on them benefited in any way or used them. I never saw party politics being played on those committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senator Howard will bear me out on that with regard to Clare.  He knows the men who served on those committees for a long number of years.  I will go so far as to have the cheek to say that the Minister made a mistake in doing away with them.  It was a bad decision. There were ordinary county councillors, those elected by the people, on those committees.  Could the Minister tell me who is going to do the work of these committees?  They were on a one to one basis with the person who had a problem. In all my 34 years in Clare I never saw party politics being played with that committee. I am sure the position in other constituencies was the same.  I think this is a mistake.  It is not a good enough reason to say that because they are a long time there they are wrong.  Perhaps if we <Col N="724" /> held on to some of the things we had in different legislation we might be better legislators today.  We were confused a short while ago about voting at Second Stage.  If I was the only person on this side of the House to vote against doing away with those committees I would be here on this side of the House doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>To a certain extent, I agree with Senator Honan about old age pension committees.  When I sat on one of these committees on Monday, it was said that we had no power and that is true.  However, it did not cost anything. People came along, not necessarily from the county council, but from different parts of the county.  There was always somebody who knew a Mr X or a Mr. B as the case may be and was able to give some information.  During my time of over 20 years on a pension committee there were times when perhaps the wrong information was given to pensions officers and people were rejected.  When we appealed it again we found that these people in fact got their pensions. Strangely enough, some applicants for old age pensions do not want to give the true story to a pensions officer.  I have known people who made out that they were better off than they were.  I am sure many people have had that experience. People did not want to disclose how poor they were.  I have had cases where people gave the wrong information to pensions officers, disclosing certain earnings which debarred them from a pension.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister has his own good reasons for abolishing these committees but they were not costing anything and so long as people were prepared to turn up of their own free will and give whatever information they had in relation to the people who were accepted or rejected as the case may be, there was a lot to be said for it.  It is not good to abolish them at this stage.  We are not saving money by doing so.</P>

      <P>I admire Senator Lennon's spirited contribution on behalf of these committees.  I know he has been a member of one.  I have an open mind about <Col N="725" /> the subject.  I spoke on it earlier today.  I have heard the pros and the cons regarding the system.  I object to people having to degrade themselves in front of politicians and baring their soul as part of a process.  Members of the committee purported to have some function which they really did not have, as statutorily they had no function.  The only function they performed at times was to delay the actual allocation of the pension.  We took steps to make payments subject to the approval of the committees at one stage, but even then the appeals system which we triggered off created a problem.  Local politicians and others gave their services free on behalf of applicants, and it did not cost the State anything.</P>
      <P>There is another cost factor involved, the tying up of officers within this framework. It costs about £200,000 a year and we must ask whether that sum is justified. After today's discussion we will have the information we are looking for &mdash; and as long as there is a safety valve for us or for somebody in the community whether it is a social worker or community service officer to enable them to approach somebody in the Department to make sure that information is properly processed and that all relevant information is available we should do away with the charade of purporting to be able to do something for people.  I do not think there has ever been a case where somebody got more by going through this process.  If the Leas-Chathaoirleach is aware of cases of that nature I would like to hear of them.  I have been involved in this for a long time and I have never seen a case where we could influence the deciding officer unless the person withheld information which they rarely did especially if it was going to benefit them.  They always try to withhold information which will be to their detriment.</P>
      <P>The investigating officers already have the power to go to banks and anywhere else to get all the information they need to make a decision.  I do not have very strong views one way or another but we should streamline the system, because the sooner people get their pension when it is due to them the better.</P>

      <P>I have no strong feelings either on this matter, but in abolishing the old age pension sub-committees we might be making the system more bureaucratic and making it most difficult for the applicant to get in touch with the officials of the Department to find out the situation regarding his application for old age pension.  The old age pension committees have very little power.  I served on one for a number of years and I can truthfully say that during my time the committee never succeeded in granting a pension to any applicant unless the social welfare officer had already recommended it, so I could not claim credit for getting a pension for somebody who had not already been granted it by the social welfare officer.</P>
      <P>There are certain cases where information which is not readily available to an officer could be made available to some member of the local committee.  Since they were not costing a lot of money to maintain they should be left there.  I do not think they are going to speed up the granting of pensions to anybody because the social welfare officer has to investigate them, and, in some cases, as Senator Ferris pointed out, the pension committees could be a means of delaying the granting of the old age pension because if they go against what the social welfare officer has granted and grant a greater pension than that the next step is an appeal by the social welfare officer which will delay the pension for a further period.  In some cases they will grant whatever rate of pension the social welfare officer has recommended and if the applicant is not satisfied he has the right to appeal after six months.  That happened very often.  I see no reason why they should be abolished.  There were no expenses except for the clerk's salary, which was not very large.  A few years ago it amounted only to a couple of hundred pounds per year and I suppose it is much the same since.  I am afraid that the abolition of these committees would make the present system more bureaucratic. The Minister should seriously consider this before he abolishes them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I also regret the abolition <Col N="727" /> of the old age pension committees.  My experience in these committees has been that they serve a purpose and achieve results.  In my ten years' experience I have never seen an applicant demeaned by coming before an old age pension committee to discuss his situation.  If the disclosure of assessment by pension officers bears fruit then perhaps the situation will not deteriorate to the disadvantage of the applicant.  I saw results being achieved by old age pension committees when committee members could ensure that allowable costs were admitted.  On every occasion it met following a discussion with the applicant at least something emerged which could affect the assessment made.  If the Minister can succeed in delivering what he virtually promised tonight, that he will work towards influencing the Government to ensure that there is a disclosure of assessment by social welfare officers, we will possibly compensate for what will be a loss to the community.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say where the deciding officer will be based? There are many supervisory welfare officers throughout the country.  Will they be deciding officers or will it be somebody working from the Department of Social Welfare in Dublin?  I may be wrong, but my calculation is that the compensation being paid to clerks of committees is something like £150.  If that is the case it is a paltry sum indeed.  Am I right in assuming that the compensation to each of the clerks of these various committees will be in the region of £150?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point is regarding the deciding officer.  There is a long-established procedure for dealing with other claims.  I suppose the nearest kind of a claim to a non-contributory old age pension is the non-contributory widow's pension.  The new provision will mean that the non-contributory old age pension will be subject to the same procedures as a non-contributory widow's pension. The deciding officers are based in Dublin. The case will be investigated like a non-contributory widow's pension and then <Col N="728" /> go to Dublin for decision by the deciding officer.</P>
      <P>On the other point, I mentioned figures earlier in the debate as to how compensation for clerks will be calculated.  It will be calculated in accordance with the agreements laid down for similar categories of people in the service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">

      <P>Does the Minister not think I have a fairly valid point in asking that the deciding officers be based in the country?  After all, we are eliminating the pension committees which are rural based.  There is a very strong case to be made for allowing the various supervisors down the country to act as deciding officers in this case rather than send everything back to Dublin.  It is something the Minister might consider.  It is a fair request, even at this late hour.</P>

He is a solid Carlow-Kilkenny man and I am astonished he should think that the bright sparks in Dublin are going to solve our problems.  The Minister gave a figure of £190,000 but I do not know what he was talking about.  I was in the Chair at the time and I had to stay quiet.  What is the change going to cost?  As a sensible Minister, why is he convinced it is going to be better?  I think the Minister is wrong.</P>

      <P>The Council for the Aged have been examining in detail all aspects of the aged, their conditions, their incomes and everything affecting <Col N="729" /> the services for the aged, and their report will be out soon.  They who have studied the whole situation and have put in a tremendous amount of work recommend that the committees should go. One has to take some account of a specialised council who devote much of their time and energies to the matter and who have carried out considerable research.  We have to take note of their recommendations.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, the cost of the old age pension committee system at present is £190,000 a year.  Staff will be needed at the headquarters to take over the deciding function and the cost of that staff will be £74,000, giving a net saving of approximately £116,000.  In the first year there will be the necessity to offset the cost of compensation to the clerks of the committees. I think the compensation figure there will be £50,000 to £55,000.  The method of compensation is in line with what applies to part-time, non-pensionable officers in the Civil Service.  It is one week's remuneration for each year of service up to 15 years and two weeks for each year in excess of 15 up to a maximum of 78 weeks.  The total will be £55,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise this matter.  While it is a very specific problem it is one that deserves an airing.  I will go through what I had intended to say with the utmost brevity and in a fairly abbreviated form.</P>
      <P>There is an accumulation of evidence, and indeed the Minister's office have a report to this effect, of inadequacies in the areas of follow-up for people who are being discharged from hospitals.  The Minister has the report.  &ldquo;Homeless and Vulnerable&rdquo; produced by the Simon Community national office.  The problem is that significant but not enormous numbers of people are turning up at shelters and hospitals around the country.  They are discharged from hospitals and, considering the accommodation they are moving to, are not at all fit to handle that accommodation.  The Simon Community report in Cork dealt with one person who was discharged from hospital and who could hardly walk when he arrived at the doors of the night shelter, and of another person who, complaining of severe backache when he was discharged from hospital, took to his bed for two-and-a-half weeks before he could do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A problem has arisen because of the change to community-based medicine in the sixties.  It was of itself a very worthwhile, important and positive adjustment but in the process of doing so it lost sight of certain vulnerable groups who almost by definition are not suitable for this development of community medicine because they do not have a community. <Col N="732" /> Those are the people I have a certain interest in, the homeless.  There is only a very limited amount of information available on this failure in community-based medicine to deal with the homeless.  Dr. Ferdnandez, who is operating a programme for the homeless in St. Brendan's Hospital, has written as follows:</P>
    <P>Our programme has come across chronic long-stay hospitalised patients who have been discharged from prolonged institutionalised care to nonexistent community care facilities and often without rational follow-up plans by discharging personnel.  Many such individuals are clearly incapable of surviving in the community.  In time, there is likely to be a greater demand for this type of facility and we are forced to confront the inevitable ageing of those able-bodied mentally ill who, devoid of community support, were placed outside the hospital during the rush to community care.</P>
    <P>This is a comment by the only medical specialist in the area of hostel care for homeless people and of their after-care.</P>
    <P>To our knowledge there is only one formal study of after-care for discharged psychiatric patients.  This is by Petrina Keane and T.J. Fahey.  It appeared in &ldquo;Psychological Medicine&rdquo; in 1982, Volume 12, under the title &ldquo;Who Receives After-Care&rdquo;.  It showed that of the people discharged under this community-based programme only 8 per cent actually improved their condition after leaving the psychiatric hospital and a frightening 40 per cent got worse.  There is also evidence from work done by the Medico and Social Research Board that homeless people are discharged quicker from psychiatric hospitals than members of the settled community, whereas one would imagine the alternative would be the case.</P>
    <P>The matter I was trying to raise, when the hour was more sane and when we were all less exhausted, was that what are defined and described as community-care programmes are not working for people who do not really have a community to come from or to go to.  It is because of this a group I am associated with, the <Col N="733" /> Simon Community, made some inquiries from health boards on what were their follow-up procedures for homeless people and the replies were quite illuminating.</P>
    <P>One hospital in the North-Eastern Health Board area pointed out, &ldquo;We regret we are unable to make adequate provision for these patients who are discharged.&rdquo; In other words, people are being discharged into the community who are known to be homeless.  Another in the same area advises, &ldquo;There are no provisions for homeless persons on discharge.&rdquo; In the southern region, someone associated with the Cork Simon Community reported, &ldquo;The social worker attached to the North Infirmary in Cork faced quite regularly the problem of discharged patients with nowhere to go.  There were no facilities for alcoholics and there is no dry-out unit in Cork.  No special provisions were made for homeless people and no social workers were attached to the hospitals in the region.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As a result, homeless people, as those involved with them suspected, were left to fend for themselves.  Therefore, the problem arises that many people coming to psychiatric hospitals or night shelters have illnesses that, in ideal circumstances, would require hospital treatment but because of the development of community-based medicine and because they are not part of the community either, they are not in receipt of any assistance whatever.</P>
    <P>We have talked in one 12-month period about 78 psychiatric illnesses, 43 TB cases, 30 cases of ulcers, 30 cases of chest infections, 22 cases of heart disease and 15 cases of skin infections.  These are people who cannot be catered for adequately through the present community care programmes.</P>
    <P>The issue here is that certain illnesses which should be treated through a community programme are not reaching people because they are outside the community. Certain people who, because of the accommodation into which they would be discharged, should be kept in hospital for longer periods are not being kept because of the emphasis on <Col N="734" /> community-based medicine.  Efforts have been made to cope with this problem. The magnificent model done on a fraction of a shoestring is what Dr. Fernandez has achieved in St. Brendan's.  He developed a comprehensive system of pre-discharge checks.  I think they are a model and should be put on the record.  They will not discharge patients until they have been checked for the availability of medical cards, clothes, income, accommodation, a letter for the labour exchange, notification of general practitioner and so on.  It is so self-evident one would think that it would be normal practice but to my knowledge there is only one hospital in the country which operates a comprehensive pre-discharge programme like that.  That is St. Brendan's Hospital and it is to their credit.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Department encourage other health boards and hospitals to pursue this matter with what the Minister referred to in his speech earlier today as a marginal group, identify the gaps in their programmes and develop the sort of check lists I have just referred to.  The medical problems of homeless people are problems that until recently went without notice.  In 1975 there was a report written by a nurse and a doctor working with homeless people and the illnesses of 638 homeless people were documented.  The authors reported in 1975 that most of those ailments had never been properly treated and untold misery was being caused as people were let loose into a hostel network, substituting one form of institutionalisation for another.  Their physical and mental health, bad at the beginning, ended up in ruin purely, in many cases, to satisfy gross overall statistics for the depopulation of mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>What was serious in 1975 is probably even more serious today.  A real effort is required. The Minister has a detailed report at his disposal on this issue and I urge him to take action that is required.  The cost is not significant.  The real requirement is recognition of the problem and the provision of a check-list system like the one that is now operating in St. Brendan's Hospital.  It will enable the sort of occasional near-tragedies that occur to be <Col N="735" /> avoided and it would ensure there was a programme of follow-up for people who would otherwise be discharged, not into the community but into a subsection outside the community, that is, the hostel network and all the consequences for their health as a result.</P>

      <P>I wish to refute the statement that the community care services are remiss in carrying out their duties relating to the follow-up of homeless persons following their discharge from psychiatric or general hospitals.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health conducted a survey in 1982 into the incidence of tuberculosis in district psychiatric hospitals, as a result of which it was established that the director of community care and medical officer of health, or a member of his team, is involved in the diagnosis, treatment and management of tuberculosis patients in such hospitals, if required.  In certain psychiatric hospitals, the involvement of the public health service would not be required for these patients because of the existence of alternative arrangements which are equally effective.</P>
      <P>In each community care area, regular out-patient clinics are available at which all tuberculosis patients who have been discharged from hospital &mdash; psychiatric, homeless and others &mdash; attend for further treatment and/or the monitoring of their condition.  In the event of a person either not attending or having difficulties in attending a clinic, the community care services make a special effort to ensure that such persons complete their treatment. This would include, for example, visits by health board nurses to hostels for homeless people and the giving of advice and encouragement to patients to complete their treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the nature of modern therapy for tuberculosis, the motivation of the individual to complete his treatment is crucial to his rehabilitation.  In this regard, alcoholics, psychiatric and homeless persons pose particular problems and <Col N="736" /> difficulties for the community care services.  In very many of these cases, the motivation required is absent.</P>
    <P>The basic difficulties in getting the individual to complete his treatment regime is further compounded in the case of the homeless by the very nature of his existence. The movement of homeless tuberculosis patients between hostels within a community care area and between community care areas is an extremely difficult situation with which to contend, but the community care services have gone a long way towards minimising the difficulties by establishing liaison arrangements between the hostels and the services within community care areas and between the areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to phychiatric patients particularly, I should point out that many of the long-term patients in our hospitals are there because they have nowhere else to go.  Health boards before discharging patients have regard to their social and other circumstances and to their ability to maintain a reasonable existence outside hospital and do not press for their discharge.</P>
    <P>Follow-up services for persons discharged from psychiatric hospitals are available by way of out-patient clinics, day centres, day hospitals and hostels. The extent to which these community facilities are available varies as between health board areas, and the further development of these facilities will continue to be the main objective in the psychiatric service for some years to come.</P>
    <P>Psychiatric out-patient clinics are well developed in all health board areas.  The clinics are held in towns throughout the catchment area of each psychiatric hospital so that people do not have to travel long distances in order to attend these clinics.  Out-patient clinics are an important follow-up and maintenance service for mentally ill patients who have been discharged from psychiatric hospitals, and about 36,000 patients attend these clinics each year.  Day facilities and hostels for the mentally ill have also been developed to varying degrees in all health board areas.</P>
    <P>A special study group has been charged with the task of drawing up a realistic <Col N="737" /> planning framework for the future planning, development and expansion of our psychiatric services.  This study group will be reporting to the Minister for Health this year and its report will set out quantitative norms for the provision of various community psychiatric facilities, including day facilities and hostels.  The study group will also recommend the ideal model for the delivery of psychiatric services and it will set out the practical steps required by the health boards to move towards the recommended model of service.  I am very hopeful that the establishment of standard targets for the provision of services will help to even out the unacceptable regional variations which are to be found in the range and scope of services at present.  I might add that the study group is generally agreed on the need for a marked intensification and expansion of our community psychiatric services and a reduction in the dominance of the hospital within our existing pattern of services.</P>
    <P>The setting up of hostels and other types of accommodation in the community for the mentally ill is an essential requirement in developing a more community-oriented psychiatric service. A wide range of accommodation is needed together with varying degrees of supervision in order to cater for the different needs of mentally ill persons.  This includes supervised and unsupervised hostels, family care or &ldquo;boarding out&rdquo; and independent flatlets.  The provision of accommodation in the community has already facilitated the discharge from psychiatric hospitals of a considerable number of patients who were capable of living in the community but who had no homes to which they could return.  This was possible as a result of preparing these <Col N="738" /> patients for the demands of life in the community.  In particular, patients who have been in hospital for many years become very dependent, and they need to learn again the basic skills of daily living which most people take for granted.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need to provide adequate support services for patients who are moved from hospital into accommodation in the community. The type of support required varies depending on the level of functioning of the individual.  Some residents in community accommodation may be able to take up open or sheltered employment while others will need to be provided with occupational or social outlets, for example, at a day facility.  The study group on psychiatric services has examined all of these questions and its report will provide useful guidance and advice for medical, nursing and administrative leadership in every service area throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the community care services are carrying out their functions in relation to the in-patient and out-patient management of homeless persons in so far as they possibly can.  There are many factors which make this particular segment of the population extremely difficult to deal with, and it can be expected that problems will continue to present themselves in this area from time to time. I am confident, however, that the community care personnel have the motivation and the resources with which to respond effectively to any such difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 12 midnight until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 4 April 1984.</P>
