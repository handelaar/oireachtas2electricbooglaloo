      <P>These three amendments which, as I have explained, are really one amendment, seek to amend Section 2 of the present Bill.  Section 2 of the Bill extends the forms of investment in which the Currency Commission may hold the Legal Tender Note Fund, which is the backing for the legal tender notes in this country. Section 61 of the Currency Act of 1927 sets out and limits very strictly the forms of investment in which the Legal Tender Note Fund may be held by the Currency Commission.  Sub-section (3) of that section states:</P>
      <P>The capital of the Legal Tender Note Fund shall be held by the Commission or at its disposal in such one or more of the following forms as the Commission in its absolute discretion shall think proper and in no other form, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  gold bullion;</P>
      <P>(b)  gold coins which are for the time being legal tender in Saorstát Eireann for unlimited amounts;</P>
      <P>(c)  money in any form which is for the time being legal tender in Great Britain for unlimited amounts;</P>
      <P>(d)  British Government securities maturing within twelve months;</P>
      <P>(e)  sterling balances on current or deposit account at the London Agency or any bank in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (d) is the important one for our present purpose.  The reason for the limitation in the case of British Government securities to these which will mature within twelve months is this: in addition to its being necessary that the forms of investment in which the Legal Tender Note Fund <Col N="12" /> and, indeed, the Note Reserve Fund are held should be perfectly safe and, if possible, steady in value, it is also necessary that they should, to a very large extent, be easily and quickly  A time might come when a very large number of these notes would be presented for redemption, and it would be necessary that a very large proportion of the Note Reserve Fund and the Legal Tender Note Fund should be in a form of investment which could be quickly realised.  That was why Section 61 of the Act of 1927 limited the British securities in which the Currency Commission might invest to securities maturing within twelve months.  The Currency Commission have had three years' experience, and after these three years they have come to the conclusion that this limitation to British securities maturing within twelve months is unnecessary.  They desire to be permitted to invest to a safe extent&mdash;the question of safety can be left to themselves&mdash;in long-term British Government securities, as well as in British securities which will mature within twelve months.</P>
    <P>That power to invest in British long-term securities is given them by Section 2 (a) of the Bill.  The amendments which I have put down do not interfere with that power at all.  If you look at Section 2 (a) of the Bill, you will find that it deletes from Section 61 (d) of the Act of 1927, the words &ldquo;maturing within twelve months.&rdquo;  Section 61 of the Act will, therefore, read, if this section be passed, as if these words were not contained in it.  But Section 2 (b) of the Bill further enlarges the forms of investment for the Legal Tender Note Fund by adding thereto the words &ldquo;securities of the Government of the United States of America.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not wish for a moment to disparage the securities of the Government of the United States.  I am sure there are no more excellent securities than the securities of that great and rich country.  If the Currency Commission had a general power of investment and desired to go outside British Government securities, I do not suppose there is any Government security they would prefer to the security of the Government of the United States, <Col N="13" /> provided it would give them such a rate of interest as would be an inducement to invest.  At present, I am afraid there would be no such inducement. Although I do not for a moment wish to disparage or to exclude the Government securities of the United States from the power of investment of the Currency Commission, there are several objections to Section 2 (b) as it stands.  In the first place, it is rather invidious to confine this enlarged power of the Currency Commission to the Government securities of a single country.  It is rather a slur on other countries which, perhaps, are very proud of their national solvency.  Then the clause is too rigid.  This increased power which the Bill gives to the Currency Commission is confined absolutely to this one class of security.  It should be more flexible.  If they are to get increased power as regards investment of their funds, they ought to have power to invest in other forms than this.  There is a recommendation of the Banking Commission which states that the Currency Commission should, from time to time, look very carefully into their forms of investment, consider them and see whether or not it would be advisable to alter them.  For that reason, if we are going to add to the power of investment of the Currency Commission, it would be right that there should be such a power as would give them opportunity of choice.</P>
    <P>There is a third objection to the power of increased investment as it stands in the Bill.  If the Currency Commission desire an enlarged power of investment for their funds, the initiative should come from themselves and not from the Minister or the Oireachtas.  The Currency Commission was described by the Minister, when explaining the Bill to us on this day week, as a &ldquo;semi-independent body.&rdquo; Strictly speaking, that is absolutely right so far as the constitution of the Commission is concerned. But in its control of the currency, in the working out of the problems of its own department, the Currency Commission ought to be absolutely independent. It should be completely independent of all Government and political interference.  These amendments are designed to secure that if the <Col N="14" /> Currency Commission desire to extend their powers of investment, the request for an extension shall come from themselves.  On the other hand, the Currency Commission ought not to be at liberty to enlarge their forms of investment without the assent of the Minister or without the approval of the Oireachtas.  That is provided for in the amendments which I am moving. Amendment No. 1 is a consequential amendment.  Amendment No. 2 is the important amendment, and it is the amendment which I have been trying to explain to the House.  It provides what, I think, ought to commend itself to the House as the best form in which we can extend the power of investment of the Currency Commission.  (Amendment 2 quoted).  I should explain that Section 62 of the Act is the section which deals with the Note Reserve Fund as distinguished from the Legal Tender Note Fund, which is dealt with by Section 61.  That amendment will delete that part of Section 2 which gives the Currency Commission power to invest in American Government securities, and it provides that they may invest in any security&mdash;including, of course, American Government securities&mdash;which they unanimously request the Minister to give them an Order to do.  That Order is not to have effect until approved by resolution of each House.  That does in another way, and in a much more flexible way, what the Minister desires to do by the section which I seek to delete.  It gives the Currency Commission this enlarged power, provided they are unanimous, provided the Minister makes an Order and provided the two Houses are satisfied that it should be made.  Accordingly, I move these three amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise one or two points in connection not only with the Bill, but also with the amendments. As Senator Brown has discussed the Bill and his amendments more or less in general terms, I should like to be advised, since the Minister is here, as to the real position as regards our security.  Are we on a gold basis or are we not?  If we are on a gold basis, is there any security unless we have gold bullion, gold coins or coin available within our own reserves?  What <Col N="15" /> security have we that the Note Issue will always be what it is, as far as currency in Great Britain is concerned, any more than we have as regards the position of the dollar standard?  I am quite prepared to agree that, in the main, United States securities, of the gilt-edged or Government type, and British Government securities are quite good enough.  But if we are on a gold basis, what is the purpose of being on that basis when, as a matter of fact, we have no gold bullion or gold reserves in this country?  I am not in favour of working on a gold basis. My belief is that the gold basis has outlived its usefulness.  But that is another question.  That is concerned with the whole question not only of currency but of credit, which we have already discussed here.  We are only pretending we have any security as regards note value, if we have not a gold reserve within our own territory. Let us make no mistake about that.  I should like to know, now that the Minister is here, why we have no gold reserve; why we are dependent entirely on the gold reserves kept by the Bank of England.  That is the position that the Currency Commission occupies at present.  I do not see any objection to going to the United States for our reserve of credit any more than going to Great Britain.  I think they are both in exactly the same position.  That position is reasonably good to-day, in spite of all the adverse factors that are working out in what one might call the higher economic scheme of thought.  But that position may not be all right for an indefinite period.  Another point arises on that; it is an economic point.  There seems to be an instinctive dislike to trusting to your own securities within your own country, though these securities might, in the last analysis, be quite as good as British Government or United States Government securities.  It is difficult to explain clearly what I desire to convey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here an issue of £6,000,000. That is issued to the banks at one and a-half per cent.  That currency is handled and becomes a credit available <Col N="16" /> for the banks, which are able to use it at a profit of 4 per cent. or thereabouts, assuming that they are getting the 5½ per cent. rate on overdrafts.  If we are not working on a gold basis, why should we not try and operate this currency within ourselves?  I admit that there is an instinctive feeling&mdash;I share it myself&mdash;against keeping house by taking money out of one pocket and putting it into another.  There is nothing wrong with Irish securities as compared with British securities.  The Minister for Finance will remember that when we were discussing other financial matters here, I, at the request of the Ministry, withheld a certain motion.  It was argued that debate on that motion might injure the National Loan at the time.  As I explained, my argument would rather have been a boost to the National Loan.  I pointed out at that time that the Minister was giving money away. He was issuing the Loan at 93½ per cent., which was an absurd price to anyone who understood the condition of the money market at the time.  I said that in a very short time that Loan would be at a premium.  To-day the quotation is from 98½ to 99.</P>
    <P>We are operating this Currency Commission at a profit to the State of 1½ per cent.  We are discussing seriously whether we are going to have our basis of security under the British administrations or under the U.S.A.  I agree with Senator Brown that if we are going to invest for security in foreign countries, we should not be tied down to any one country.  But I should be interested to know if that point occurred to Senator Brown on the original occasion when the proposal was made to invest in British Government securities.  Is it only when American securities are concerned that the Senator wakens up to a realisation of the facts he has mentioned?  I should like to know from the Minister where exactly we stand.  Are we on a gold basis or are we not?  If we are working on a gold basis, I hold that we should have a gold reserve here and the word or bond of no other Government should have effect on our operations. A crisis may arise.  Financial crises will arise.  I should like to know from <Col N="17" /> the Minister where we stand as regards that.</P>
    <P>As regards the Currency Commission being completely independent, that is a very debatable matter.  That would be all right if you had a Currency Commission that was going to be not only absolutely and completely reliable&mdash;as no doubt we will always have&mdash;but a Commission that understood the importance of the monetary and currency question from the point of view of this country, not only the financial basis, of the working, of the traditional economic arguments, but that would he conscious of the importance of getting the best value for such notes as we would be putting on the market for the banks and of getting the best return for the State.  I should like to have the guidance of the Minister as to our present position.  We are supposed to be operating on a gold basis and we are paying very stiffly for holding grimly to that gold basis.  I hold that that is a fallacy, that we are not working on a gold basis but that we are working on the security of the British Government at present, whether that be good or bad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been delayed from before the Recess until now. I reckon that that delay has cost the reserve fund of the Currency Commission approximately £60,000.  I trust that there will not be any further delay in getting this measure through.  I am in general agreement with the amendments proposed by Senator Brown.  I think they are more flexible than the provisions of the Bill, as introduced, and they give a wider range of choice of investments.  The Currency Commission, under the amendments, would be entitled to invest in any funds which, in their judgment&mdash; which I believe is very sound&mdash;give full security and an adequate rate of interest. Whatever may have been the case when the original Currency Bill was going through, the rate of interest on short-dated British Government securities has so depreciated as to be practically worthless from the remunerative point of view.  Therefore, I welcome the extension which this Bill gives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in agreement with Senator <Col N="18" /> Brown as to the mechanism by which he seeks to attain his object.  I think it is cumbersome and will cause undue delay if it be necessary that the recommendation of the Commission should be unanimous.  I think that if the majority of the members of the Currency Commission are of opinion that the proposed security is a right and proper one in which to invest portion of the reserve fund that that should go forward as the decision of the Commission to the Minister and that it should be for him to act upon it.  I am not moving an amendment but I hope that when this Bill goes back to the Dáil an amendment will be moved deleting the provision as regards unanimity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out, particularly to the Senator who spoke last, that as the Bill stands if any changes were necessary, and if the Currency Commission wished to propose a change a new Bill would have to be introduced, which would have to go through all stages in the Dáil and here.  That would take a very considerable time.  One of the great merits of the amendment proposed by Senator Brown is that if it becomes necessary to make a change, that change can be done by order.  Two simple resolutions will be sufficient to give effect to it, which is a much quicker method than at present.  I think if it were to be made simpler, there would be one great danger.  We are all of opinion that the Oireachtas should have the final say.  I agree with Senator Brown that under the present Bill the Currency Commission must take the initiative, must use their judgment, but I think that even at the danger of a certain amount of delay it would not be wise to do anything which would prevent actual control by the two Houses.  If you accept that as a principle, I think this is as simple a way as you could get to deal with the matter&mdash;an order of the Minister can be made in a day or two, and that can be followed by two resolutions of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know if Senator Brown would be willing to leave out the word &ldquo;unanimous.&rdquo; Why does the Senator want the unanimous <Col N="19" /> approval of the Board in a matter of this sort?  If he omitted that word perhaps it would enable us to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what Senator Wilson has said touches the kernel of this question.  If it is the desire of Senator Brown to have flexibility in investments, as undoubtedly he would have under his amendment, if the word &ldquo;unanimous&rdquo; was taken out, I am sure he would have no objection to the deletion of the word in sub-section (1) and also in sub-section (2) of his amendment.  If the Senator is not willing that the word &ldquo;unanimous&rdquo; shall be deleted, I draw my own conclusion, and it is this: The investments are at present in British securities.  It will not be possible to take them out of British securities and put them into other securities unless the Commission is unanimous about it.  Therefore, there can be no change as there will be a watchdog for the British securities, and he can stop any change in investments.  The Minister is powerless unless the Currency Commission is unanimous&mdash;that is, unless the watch-dog is willing.  Supposing a change is made there cannot be any alteration unless the Currency Commission is unanimous.  In stating the case, Senator Brown did not deceive the House or attempt to deceive it.  I could gather, following him closely, that his speech clearly indicated what is meant by these amendments, and I am therefore opposed to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter has been mentioned. What is the security for our paper? Is it gold?  Indeed, it is not.  The security is British currency and, as I said once before in this House, there is a stringency of money in this country at present, and it arises from the fact that we have not our proper circulation of money even in the form of paper.  How can we have a gold basis with gold costing £4 15s. an ounce?  Senators will remember that it used to be £3 17s. 10½d. an ounce.  It is now going at £4 5s. an ounce in London, and the Australian Government is offering £4 15s. an ounce.  We are not on a gold basis, but we are tied, not to British gold but to <Col N="20" /> British currency.  Where is the gold he had from 1914?  It was gathered  the banks and by every other channel and transferred to London, and during the war we sold our cattle and our goods for paper.  As that is the position here, I hope the Seanad will examine these amendments very carefully.  If they are passed here, I am quite certain that the Dáil will not allow them to go through without full discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to Senator Brown's amendments.  I cannot foresee at present a time when any other securities than British securities and the securities of the Government of the United States would be purchased by the Currency Commission.  Nevertheless, world circumstances might change, and it might happen that there would be other countries whose financial position would be so strong that it would be regarded as advisable to purchase their securities.  Consequently I have no objection to making this power somewhat more flexible.  As regards the point of unanimity, I do not regard that as very important. There are several sections in the Currency Act that require unanimity on the part of the Currency Commission, but I have not heard yet that there has been any disposition on the part of members of the Currency Commission to block the work of that body.  I do not anticipate that in future any great difficulties will occur.  No member of the Currency Commission is there representing his own individual interests. Two members were selected from amongst the commercial community by the Minister for Finance, and, of course, they are quite independent during their term of office, and will, I hope, always be reasonable men, who will look at the public interest and not take up a merely cranky or prejudiced attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another person is a representative of the Department of Finance who will be more or less representative of the Government's attitude.  There are three other members appointed by the banks. They are not there in an individual capacity although they are independent during their term of office.  It <Col N="21" /> may be taken that you are not going to have any one of them standing out as a crank to block something which the Commission has generally come to regard as desirable and necessary.  On the other hand, supposing, for the sake of argument, it were to happen that the three members representing the banks were opposed to investment in securities other than British securities, which the Currency Commission may already invest in, I think any Minister for Finance would hesitate about making an order.  He would hesitate because it would mean that there was a substantial body of opinion against making the order, and that a certain amount of apprehension would arise if the order were made.</P>
    <P>I am afraid some Senators think that for political reasons you would have a group of members of the Currency Commission standing out against the purchase of the securities of the United States.  I have seen nothing in the attitude of bankers here, as I have had to deal with them, to indicate that they were going to take any such attitude. As a matter of fact, when one loan which we issued was raised partly in the United States, not only had we the co-operation of the representatives of the Irish banks in making arrangements for the United States' part of the issue but I think, in fact, the first suggestion that part of the loan should be raised in the United States actually came from Irish bankers.  I have no reason at all to believe that we would have representatives of the banks holding out here for British securities and nothing but British securities, no matter how plainly the facts might indicate that the time had come when it would be desirable to purchase the securities of the United States or the securities of some other country whose position would be such as to make it prudent to purchase.  I do not object to unanimity.  I admit that it might happen that some little delay would be caused by keeping the word &ldquo;unanimity&rdquo; in the amendment, but in currency it is so easy to create panic, so easy to have money rushed out of the country, because false rumours have been put afloat, that it would be in the general interests in many cases to wait a little until the opposition had time <Col N="22" /> to die down rather than to rush ahead. I do not think it will in practice make any difference whether &ldquo;unanimity&rdquo; is left in or not.  If it did happen by accident that some individual did take an individual line and simply set out to obstruct he would not be there for ever; he could be got rid of.  Generally, I cannot see that it makes any difference.</P>
    <P>In a sense the remarks of Senator Connolly and other Senators to-day indicate that it is desirable there should be wider powers vested in the Currency Commission to purchase securities outside British securities.  We have not a gold standard here; we have a gold exchange standard.  We have funds that can be turned into gold.  If anything were to happen to cause us to believe that, say, Great Britain was going to depart from the gold standard, we could amend the Currency Act.  It would not mean a very big amendment.  We could amend that Act if it was thought the best thing to do to meet the position.  If there were wider powers of investment vested in the Currency Commission, if it could have its investments scattered over Government securities of more countries than one, the position would be in certain respects much easier.  I do not anticipate that that is going to happen.</P>
    <P>As for having a gold standard, what I should really do in reference to what Senator Connolly said is to refer him to the report of the Banking Commission, where the matters he raised to-day were dealt with.  Personally, I think it would be most uneconomic for us to have gold in cellars here.  There is nothing at all to be said for that especially in the case of smaller countries which can get sufficient interest-bearing Government securities of larger and financially stable countries.  One of the great countries could not get the amount of securities that it would require, but a country like the Saorstát can get the required securities.  They are as good for every purpose as gold and interest is being earned on them. Gold would be lying idle in the cellars and money would be spent keeping and guarding it.  Generally, I think that&mdash;I do not want to go into the larger question of the gold standard&mdash;<Col N="23" /> as long as we have a gold exchange standard for all practical purposes, in our circumstances, it is the same thing as a gold standard.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given no explanation of the question he was asked as to where and why the gold that was in the banks before the Treaty was removed.  If it was useful to us then why should it not be useful to us now and why do we not try to get it back?</P>

      <P>It would be quite easy to get a great quantity of gold back here, gold value for about ten millions, or as much as we had before, but it would be a useless proceeding.  Anybody with British securities can sell them and get gold.  The gold could be kept here, but soldiers would have to be employed to guard it and it would not be of much use.</P>

I can assure the House that I have no brief for British Government securities.  My only object in making the request unanimous was to be quite certain that the backing for these notes if the form of investment were changed would be absolutely safe.  I might also point out that if the necessity or the advisability of a change in the form of the investment were to arise suddenly, it is absolutely necessary that the request should be unanimous.  We ought not to change in a hurry except on an unanimous request.  At any other time but a time like that the position will be just as it is at present.  The Minister will have power to introduce legislation and the form of investment can be altered as the Oireachtas wishes.</P>

    <P>Sub-section 4.&mdash;The fact that a consolidated bank note has been the subject of an act which is a contravention of this section shall not (so long as such note remains identifiable as a particular note) prejudice or affect the obligation imposed by the Principal Act on the Shareholding Bank to which such note was issued to pay the amount of such note on presentation nor any right or power which such Bank may have under the Principal Act or regulations made thereunder to retire such note.</P>

      <P>I move Amendment 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the words &ldquo;(so long as such note remains identifiable as a particular note)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section provides for the defacement of legal tender notes or the alteration of legal tender and consolidated bank notes, and makes it a criminal offence to do certain acts in the shape of defacing, alteration or tearing these notes.  As the sub-section stands the shareholding bank would have the right to refuse to redeem a note which was not identifiable as a particular note.  The way a note is identifiable as a particular note is by a series letter and number in two places, one is at the lower left-hand corner and the other on the right-hand corner.  It may happen, and it does happen sometimes, that both those series letters and numbers are removed from the note, and are not on it when it is presented to the bank.  The note still shows the bank responsible for its payment and its own denomination.  It is the universal custom of the banks, although, perhaps, they are not bound to do so, to redeem a note of that kind. An honest holder goes into a bank with a note that is not identifiable as a particular note but which is clearly a note on which the bank is liable, and which shows the amount on the face of it. What the amendments ask the House to do is to delete the words in brackets and to let the banks do what they have <Col N="25" /> been always doing, cash notes of that kind.</P>

I have no particular objection to the amendment.  I do not think it would do any harm and, as notice of the Senator's amendment has been given for some time and the banks concerned have not protested, I do not see that I should raise any objection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion which stands on the Order Paper in my name:</P>
      <P>That in the opinion of the Seanad the position of the flour-milling industry is one calling for the immediate action of the Executive and that control of wheat and flour imports is an immediate necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not present, but I would ask that the Seanad would consider to-day the various arguments to be brought forward as regards the position of the flour-milling industry; <Col N="26" /> to consider those arguments on their merits and, for the present, to keep their minds clear of any prejudice or prejudices with regard to tariffs arising out of the debate that took place in the Dáil within the last week or so.  I suggest they should do that, not because we as a Party have in any sense weakened with regard to our protective policy, but because this issue is entirely different&mdash;in the ordinary way &mdash;from any question as to the merits or demerits of tariffs.  When we in the Seanad debated this subject last April the Minister for Industry and Commerce said:</P>
    <P>There should be some evidence of danger,</P>
    <P>that is, of taking over mills to close them down:</P>
    <P>there should be some nearer prospect of any danger than any evidence we have had so far before we are asked to take this step.</P>
    <P>The step that was requested was a scheme of national control to provide adequate safeguards for the milling industry. The situation in April gave some of us reason to fear.  Certain firms, largely representing the flour milling ring in England, had purchased certain mills in Ireland and we viewed the position with considerable alarm. We knew that a certain line of policy had been pursued in the rationalisation of the milling industry in England whereby certain firms, including one firm that came to Ireland, had purchased mills there and closed them down.  We felt that such a position might well develop in Ireland whereby the same ring or members of it, would purchase mills in this country with a view to the elimination of competition and to the further dumping of flour here.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the same debate, asked &ldquo;Is it that there should be preserved in this country flour milling irrespective of what the product is going to cost?&rdquo; That question was answered really more effectively by a member of the Minister's own Party than by any of the members of Fianna Fáil.  Deputy McDonogh, of Galway, stressed the point that Messrs. Spillers and Bakers <Col N="27" /> made a loss last year of £350,000.  Obviously, this firm which sent large quantities of flour into the Free State were manufacturing flour &ldquo;irrespective of what it cost.&rdquo; It has been admitted by the millers' technical papers that over five million pounds were lost in the flour-milling industry in England during the last four years, so that there is ample evidence that flour was being manufactured at a loss.  When the ring in England attempted to organise the flour-milling industry there, to have flour produced and sold at an economic price, the only reasonable interpretation that we could at the time put on their activities in Ireland was that they wanted to secure a market in Ireland at an equal economic price, and to do that they must, first of all, purchase the bulk of the Irish flour mills and eliminate them as competitors. The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated further on the 10th April last&mdash;the reference will be found in the Official Debates of the Seanad, page 966, Vol. 34, No. 3&mdash;</P>
    <P>If there is a crisis I want to have it pointed out where does it arise. Is it because Messrs. Rank have come into the country, and that there is a fear that their coming bodes no good for us, that they are going to close down the mills?  If that is the case, I do not believe in that case and will not move on it...  If it is because there is a scheme being promoted between the Irish millers in this country and the Millers' Mutual Association in England, then I am going to watch that carefully.</P>
    <P>Now, I am not in a position to say whether there is any concerted scheme operating between Irish millers and the Millers' Mutual Association in England, but I wish to bring forward certain particulars of what is happening, and what has happened since April 10th last, as evidence that our worst fears were to some extent justified, or, at least, that there is sufficient evidence to justify us coming here to-day and asking the Minister if he is watching the position carefully; if that position has not crystallized to the point where his watching would suggest either direct interference or the <Col N="28" /> taking of such steps as will protect our milling industry from further encroachment on the part of the British flour ring.</P>
    <P>I went to the trouble of getting certain data from Limerick, one of the most important centres involved in the flour-milling trade.  From that data, and other evidence that I have at my disposal, I am afraid that what is happening in Limerick is happening, and is going to happen, elsewhere, only in a more intensified way.  I have not at the moment the actual figures for the other centres, and therefore I abstain from giving them, but the figures that I am going to give have been discussed at a public meeting to which the flour millers were invited, and have not been challenged or denied.  Moreover, it is quite evident from our own official returns dealing with imports that the figures are obviously correct, and that the line of policy which we dreaded and warned the Minister about last April is in course of enactment at the present time.  If it goes on at the same rate we will, undoubtedly, soon waken up to the fact that we will not have any flour-milling industry here at all. In Limerick normal employment was given in the flour mills to between 400 and 500 hands, while the annual wages bill amounted to about £75,000 a year. That was the normal thing before Messrs. Joseph Rank took a hand in the game.</P>
    <P>The valuation of the mills in Limerick is as follows: Bannatyne's, £1,955; Russell's, £1,016&mdash;giving a total valuation of £2,971.  That means that these mills contribute to the rates of Limerick £3,639 10s. 6d. for the current year.  That is a factor that should not be lost sight of.  It is a very substantial contribution to the rates of the city of Limerick.  Moreover, the activities of these mills in the matter of the import of wheat were responsible for half the total revenue of the port of Limerick, and according to the figures which have been given and have not been contradicted, half the revenue of the port amounts to £24,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Some of us have already read the report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal, and we all must realise what, in the economy of our harbours, the <Col N="29" /> elimination of £24,000 per annum must mean to the Limerick harbour authorities. Since Messrs. Rank took over in Limerick forty men have been let go. I do not know whether that number has been increased since the date that I am dealing with, namely, the 4th November. We all know, taking flour-milling on a per capita production, that owing to the development of modern machinery forty men is a very substantial number of skilled operatives to be working in flour mills, and that their productive capacity is very high.  We can get the productive capacity by taking the output of the mill for the period under review.  Before Messrs. Rank took over control 12,160 bags of bakers' flour were milled per month; 53,312 bags of retail or household flour were milled per month.  Since Messrs. Rank took over no bakers' flour has been manufactured.  In other words, there has been the elimination of 12,160 bags of bakers' flour per month since Messrs. Rank took over, while, in addition, the 53,312 bags of retail or household flour have been reduced to 44,928 bags per month.  That means a total reduction in bags of flour per month of 20,544.  Now those of us who are in any way interested in home production, and particularly in the home production of such a necessity as bakers' and household flour, will realise what a dangerous position we are drifting into.</P>
    <P>[<i>The Cathaoirleach resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>It has been argued by these foreign flour millers that there are two objections to the milling of bakers' flour in this country.  The first objection was that we did not mill a satisfactory flour suitable for bakers, and the second was that there was considerable difficulty in disposing of the red offal, the residue from the milling of bakers' flour. As a matter of fact tests have been carried out as regards the very flour manufactured by the firm that has come into Limerick, namely, Messrs. Rank, and the bakers' flour produced by the Limerick millers.  As a result of these tests it has been claimed&mdash; I cannot say as I have not the results <Col N="30" /> of the examiner's test with me&mdash;and has not been disputed, that the Limerick flour was found to be superior to the imported flour manufactured by Messrs. Rank.  Again it has been shown that there is no difficulty in disposing of the red offal, that this can be mixed with white offal and disposed of satisfactorily within the State itself. I think it is necessary to stress these technical points, mainly because we are so used to propaganda by foreign exploiters, and I regret to say occasionally by their defenders, the Government here.</P>
    <P>There is another rather sinister thing that has crept into the business of flour milling in this country and it is nothing new.  It is nothing new to those of us who have studied the evolution of Irish economic history during the last one hundred years.  It is something we are told that does not and could not occur nowadays.  We all remember in our young enthusiastic Sinn Féin days the late Mr. Arthur Griffith explaining the many and subtle methods whereby the industries of this country were injured and, in many cases, destroyed.  We know that in many cases it was necessary to have the co-operation of certain interested or anti-Irish people to make the destruction of these industries complete. But here we have an example right up-to-date this year.  It has happened since April last, and I at all events look upon it as a sinister and a subtle move in the direction I speak of.</P>
    <P>We have this position.  The firm of Messrs. Rank manufacture and sell in England a flour called &ldquo;Millocrat.&rdquo; That is the brand under which it is sold.  In Limerick we have two good brands of flour manufactured.  They were popularly known amongst Irish buyers in the area as &ldquo;Sunrise&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eclipse.&rdquo; They were sold for household use.  We find that, though Messrs. Rank are manufacturing a household flour the same as it was being manufactured, that they are now selling under their own name of &ldquo;Millocrat,&rdquo; products which were formerly sold as &ldquo;Sunrise&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eclipse.&rdquo;  We know from history what happens or what will happen as a result of that.  We know that in another year, eighteen months or two years that, perhaps, <Col N="31" /> Messrs. Rank will be defending their position as regards the position of Irish milling and will make the claim that there is now no demand for either &ldquo;Sunrise&rdquo; or &ldquo;Eclipse&rdquo; flour, and that the total demand is for their own &ldquo;Millocrat,&rdquo; which they will argue is a product manufactured in their English or other mills.</P>
    <P>Between the 4th April and the 18th October 96,000 bags of Limerick flour have been manufactured in Limerick and sold under the brand of &ldquo;Millocrat.&rdquo; That is the subtle method that has been adopted of killing the popularity of the local brands.  That method has succeeded in the case of other Irish industries to our cost, and it looks as if it is going to succeed again.  I stated earlier in my speech that the general position with regard to imports goes to prove the arguments the people of Limerick are making with regard to the sinister methods that are going on in connection with the flour-milling trade.  What do we find when we turn up the report dealing with imports for the nine months January to September? This report is available to all Senators.  It has been posted to all members of the Oireachtas, and Senators can examine the figures for themselves. Over this nine months' period the flour imports in 1929 amounted to 2,263,608 cwts., and for 1930 to 2,433,761 cwts.  That means that in that period the flour imports increased by 170,153 cwts., or by 8,507 tons.  You have there an increase of nearly 1,000 tons per month.  Something more significant, however, is to be gathered from a close study of the import list, especially if one turns to the figures dealing with the import of wheat.  For the nine months January to September, in 1929 wheat imports were 4,474,225 cwts., while for the same period in 1930 the figure is 3,680,584 cwts., showing a reduction of 793,671 cwts. or, roughly, 40,000 tons of wheat.  That is the decrease in these nine months.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil hope for a reduction in wheat imports, but we hope for that when we have carried out our policy in regard to wheat production. We do not want to see a reduction in wheat substituted by an increase in the <Col N="32" /> import of flour, and that precisely is what is happening here.  Not only that, but this increase in the importation of flour amounting to 8,507 tons does not adequately represent the decrease that is contemplated in milling because the reduction in wheat is utterly disproportionate to the increase in flour.  In other words, there is contemplated definitely and undoubtedly by the figures dealing with the imports of wheat a greater reduction in milling in this country than has yet taken place.  That is the most significant figure as regards the import list.  Now I do not know whether it is the opinion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that these points were not worth listening to by him. That is entirely a matter for his judgment, but I do suggest that if the Seanad has any justification for its existence&mdash;and some people question that very, much&mdash;it is up to the members of this House to decide whether they are going to take any active interest in the contemplated destruction of this industry.</P>
    <P>I purpose to-day to ask the Minister very simply and very directly a number of questions.  The first is if his attitude in the debate that took place here in April was justified and whether he feels that the evidence I have brought forward to-day justifies him in investigating the matter further.  Does he feel that the position has now crystallised so that the Government ought to take action, and failing that, at what period of imports and of a reduction in milling will the Minister by his grace take a hand in the game?  The Minister for Finance, speaking in this House on the 20th March in regard to the issue of foreign control of industry, a question which I raised in a debate last session, said:</P>
    <P>The disadvantage of foreign control is not such a disastrous thing in the case of an individual industry. The disadvantage arises in the case of industries doing an export trade and that are under foreign control.</P>
    <P>I disagreed with that statement at the time and I disagree with it now. I want to say quite bluntly and frankly that for a responsible Minister like the Minister for Finance to make <Col N="33" /> such a fatuous statement to a group of supposedly intelligent people is an insult. The Minister stated further:</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that there is not the slightest danger, when there is a Government here, of any foreign combine pursuing a campaign of buying up factories here for the purpose of closing them down.</P>
    <P>I hold that is the position to-day. Both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce took up the attitude that no concern in a big way of business, no ring would as an economic business proposition purchase a big factory and then close it down.  Mark you, this is the year 1930, a year of intensive rationalisation, a year in which there has been a buying up of every sort of factory and closing down.  Yet we have these statements made in all seriousness by responsible Ministers.  Were our fears justified and, if so, what is going to be done about it?  We all know what is the purpose of these big controlling groups.</P>
    <P>I want to know why the imports of wheat are shrinking.  I certainly would be glad to see our imports of wheat shrinking, but only because of our own production of wheat at home. Our fear is that there is only one reason for the reduction in wheat imports that has been revealed in the figures that I have given, and it is this: That there is a gradual process of undermining the home industry going on.  The facts and figures that I have given fully justify all the arguments that we put up in the debate in April and justify the people of Limerick in becoming alarmed with regard to the position which the flour-milling industry in that city has reached.  They justify the people in Limerick, and in other parts of the country, in fearing that the flour-milling industry in this country is going to be crushed.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the question with which I would like to deal. I do not want to labour this, but taking the long view, and the ordinary sane view, of the protection of our citizens, we have no guarantee that in any crisis that arises&mdash;I am not speaking now of a world crisis or a war&mdash; but supposing there was a big strike in <Col N="34" /> England lasting for two or three months, we have to ask ourselves what are we going to do about it if our mills get into the position of being owned, body and soul, by an English controlling ring.  Does any sane man believe that, in such a situation, we would be fed first, or even on a par basis with the people of England?  We know quite well that we would not, and it is a most dangerous thing to have to take a chance such as that when dealing with such a fundamental commodity as the food of the people.  I have given enough evidence, I think, to justify the Seanad in expressing its opinion on this matter.  If any more evidence is wanted it is available.  Spillers have absorbed and closed a number of mills in England already.  They have absorbed Leetham's of York, which, I believe, used to employ something like 2,000 people.  That action of theirs has been a disaster for York.  They have absorbed Shackleton's of Leeds, and the C. D. Mills of York.  I suppose, fundamentally, it does not matter to the British Government where flour is milled so long as it is milled in England.</P>
    <P>We ought to insist that our mills are not crushed out of existence, and I suggest, too, that we ought not to allow imported flour into this country.  Messrs. Rank have also absorbed and closed the Cleveland Flour Mills, Stoke-on-Trent; Appleton's Mill, Hull; Elland Flour Mills, Elland, and Metcalf's, Malton.  It is argued that we are undue alarmists in raising this question, the question that they contemplate closing any mills in Ireland.  The evidence that I have given shows, I suggest, that the trend is that way, and that already a very big step has been taken in the cutting out of the manufacture of bakers' flour, in increasing flour imports, and in reducing the imports of wheat.  If the people of this country are not awake, and if the Government are not awake, then I fear they will waken up &mdash;it may take, perhaps, another few months or years; that will all depend on the attitude that is evident here&mdash; and find that we have no flour-milling industry in the country.  I have put the facts before you and, as I said earlier, I regret that the Minister for <Col N="35" /> Industry and Commerce is not here. Evidently he thinks that the flour-milling industry is of no importance compared to other things.  I suggest to Senators that they ought to adopt this motion if they are really and genuinely interested at all in the food of the people and in the flour-milling industry of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion which has been moved by Senator Connolly in a speech of great lucidity and great power.  I also regret the Minister was not here to listen to the facts that have been stated by Senator Connolly.  Of course, he may be busy elsewhere.  For some months during the summer he was regulating the affairs of the whole world at Geneva. Then he came to a London meeting to regulate the affairs of one-quarter of the world.  I will speak now to the Minister's chair in his absence, and I will say that the eyes of the unwise are on the ends of the earth, and I say without hesitation that the Minister ought to be here to keep the promise to the people of Ireland which he and the other Ministers gave on this question of the mills. When the matter came up for discussion in the Dáil, they said that if the smaller mills of Ireland were interfered with they had the power to intervene and they would not hesitate to use that power.  The smaller mills have been interfered with, and I have before me a resolution from the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union of Kilrush stating the fact that within the last twenty months 2,644 tons of flour have come into the port of Kilrush. That means 3,800 tons of wheat and the employment of 70 men in Kilrush for six months of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That employment has been taken away by this foreign combination that has got control of the mills in Limerick, previously owned by an Irish firm.  That is not the only evil, for there are subsidiary industries connected with the manufacture of flour, bran and pollard.  The local mills in Kilrush, Ballylongford and other places along the Shannon, cannot receive the wheat to provide the bakers' flour that formerly was provided not only in Limerick but in Kerry and <Col N="36" /> Clare also.  Messrs. Rank, this foreign combination, may be excellent people, but still the control of the staple requirements of our people should not be in foreign hands.</P>
    <P>What have they done?  They have bought Bannatyne's mills in Limerick. Was it for the stone walls or the machinery they bought them?  No. They bought them for the sake of getting the customers of Messrs. Bannatyne's mills, and they are doing their best to get them to use English flour in substitution for Irish flour.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce ought to have been present to hear what Senator Connolly said when he informed the House that Irish brands had been withdrawn and English brands substituted for them.  Was that in order that the Irish people may get a taste for the English article and the Irish mills be entirely destroyed?  That is a big question, which was well put in this House and it ought to have been listened to by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It was his business to be here, but I will take very good care that he will hear something of what has been said or that is to be said.</P>
    <P>Why is it so important for a nation that it should have the manufacture of its flour?  Why are English firms so anxious that the supplies should be concentrated in English cities?  I will tell you why.  It is essential for any country that it should have, at least, six months' food in the country either in the store or on the stalk.  That is not a question of economics&mdash;and I have heard a lot of political economy talk in this country for the last month or two&mdash;but a question of national safety.  It is insurance against starvation. I put forward that as the main reason why we should have the manufacture of flour and the growth of wheat as far as it can be grown in this country.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce says it is a perfect absurdity to think of growing wheat in Ireland.  If it is, what about Switzerland and France where they insist that wheat must be grown, and what about the Spaniards, the Belgians and the Dutch?  Are they ignorant people? Are they influenced by the fact that there are great wheat harvests in <Col N="37" /> Canada and elsewhere?  No.  In Holland there is a law to the effect that there must be a certain percentage of Dutch wheat in the flour.  Why do they do that?  Holland is an old and great country.  It has had the advantage all through the centuries of having eminent patriots and eminent statesmen at its head.  They insist that there must be a certain percentage of Dutch wheat in Dutch flour, and the flour must be manufactured in Holland. That is for the sole reason that it is essential for the safety of any country that it must have at least six months' supply of flour or wheat.</P>
    <P>What we are advocating here is not a matter that is advocated merely in Ireland.  The growth of wheat is advocated in England by the leader of the Conservative Party.  I say plainly that he advocates it because it is essential for the safety of England. We are told that calamities, crises and wars are unthinkable.  Yet the statesmen of the world are thinking of the unthinkable, and they are providing against the unthinkable in England and other countries.  Not alone are they looking after methods of military and naval defence, but they are also considering the question of the food of the people, and we ought to consider that here also, and for this reason: We may be neutrals or belligerents. We would like to be neutrals. I venture to think that in the next conflict when it does come the neutrals will suffer most.  Scythian tactics will be employed in the next world conflict, and the difficulties and dangers of war will be brought to the doors of the neutrals who try to keep out of the struggle.</P>
    <P>Suppose for a moment that the seas were not free and the supplies of wheat to the British Isles were cut off, do you think the Irish people would get supplies in Liverpool while the English were short?  Do you think the ships coming into our shores with wheat would be allowed to go unscathed? Is it not the plainest commonsense that the submarines of the blue fleet or the white fleet will sink these ships in order to bring us in on one side or the other?  I started my speech by referring to certain statistics from the County Clare, a county <Col N="38" /> which has been very badly treated within the last ten years, a county which, owing to the machinations that are going on, is likely to lose one of the few manufacturing industries it has, the flour mills of Kilrush, which gave employment to 100 or 150 men, and here with one stroke we have the employment of 70 men taken away.  That is interference with the smaller industries in this country. The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance said the moment such a thing happened they had the power to deal with it, and they would not hesitate to use that power to put an end to the interference.  That interference is going on.  It is injuring an industry in Clare, and the Ministers who. made that promise are not here to answer the case made by Senator Connolly.</P>

      <P>I think it was at the end of Senator Connolly's speech and in the middle of Senator Comyn's that the real reason for this motion came out.  Although they asked us to absolve ourselves from any question of tariffs, they kept in the forefront the question of a tariff on wheat to prevent it coming into this country, and to try and foster the production of wheat in this country.  I do not think that the people who are trying to foster the production of wheat have really made a proper examination of the circumstances and the simple factors that affect the farming industry and the growing of wheat.  They leave out the difference in the types of land and the climate.  Our land varies from the rich grazing land to the land that has to be tilled in the mountain districts with a spade, and the system of farming varies accordingly.  There are three different systems of farming, one dependent on the other, and as far as I can see, to alter them in any material respect is going to upset the whole complex of our farming situation. They are: tillage, grass, and finally the larger proportion of the country comprising the poorer parts of Kerry and the Western seaboard, where there is mixed farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that something done in controlling the import of wheat would probably  tillage farmer.  It might <Col N="39" /> get the grass farmer to break up his land where it is better fitted for grazing stock and left as it is, but I can see no benefit of any sort to the mixed farmer, who is the most important man in this country.  A mixed farmer, in order to raise a certain number of cattle, has to divide his land into tillage, meadowing and grazing.  The man who knows his business divides his land in exact and correct proportion to make sure he has all three.  Speaking from intimate knowledge of the very sound mixed farmers in my own county, I doubt if they could till an acre more than they do.  They require their oats for feeding purposes, and they sell a little, perhaps. If they change to wheat the first thing they would lose would be the valuable feeding-straw, for they could not feed wheaten straw to their stock. The tillage farmer is not a philanthropist. If there is a tariff on he is not going to sell at a price below the tariff rate, and the result for the mixed farmers, who are the largest section of the community, is that the cost of feeding-stuffs and of production is going to go up rather than go down.  Another thing that Senator Connolly has not really considered is that the climate plays a very large part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. We are not discussing the production of wheat but milling and the imports of wheat and flour.  With all due respect, I think the Senator is not talking to the motion and that he is irrelevant.</P>

      <P>The question of climate affects a large area of the south and western seaboard and its hinterland.  During the last 14 years there has been a rainfall of 60 inches on the average, and an average of over 200 wet days each year.  There were weeks and months before I and my neighbours could take the steel of <Col N="40" /> the plough out of the ground owing to weather conditions.  We were asked to consider the situation in countries such as Holland, France and Spain, but the climate in those countries is very different to ours.  In regard to having a proportion of home-grown wheat, the situation here is also different and such a scheme would not work here.  I think if the Senators who have spoken in support of this motion had practical experience of the western seaboard and its hinterland they would realise that with 100 odd dry days on the average, which was what we had during a period of 14 years, the conditions were not favourable for the ripening of wheat, so that the wheat harvest is precarious.  In very rainy seasons a large quantity of the wheat produced is not fit for flour-milling, and the people will not eat the flour produced from it.  They will eat only the whitest flour.  I think motions such as this should not be brought forward without fuller examination.</P>

      <P>It is difficult for the Minister to be in two places at the one time.  I could not help noticing that there passed through this House a visitor of Irish blood from another country, one of the most distinguished visitors that have ever come amongst us.  I think it is right and proper when that distinguished visitor came here that he should be accompanied in his passage through this House by the Minister for External Affairs, who is also the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

I want to say a word in deprecation of the references made by Senator Comyn to the Minister, references which very few of us welcomed, when he referred to the activities of the Minister abroad. I think, and I am sure the majority of the members of this House are of the same opinion, that the Minister for External Affairs when abroad applied his great capacity for the good of this country in the deliberations which have taken place within the last few months. He gave of his best, and, if physical evidence is any indication, it was to his own disadvantage.</P>

      <P>This motion deals with a matter of great urgency.  It concerns the Fianna Fáil Party only in a general way.  I attended in the ordinary way, and not as a Fianna Fáil representative, two huge meetings of farmers in the Mansion House in the last few days.  A resolution practically the same as Senator Connolly's motion was passed.  We are told that the Minister could not spare half-an-hour to be present to discuss this matter, which is of the greatest importance and is agitating the country from one end to the other, as he had to escort through the House a well-known stranger who is a visitor to this country.

We find a Senator in the Farmers' Party defending the Minister and another Government supporter apologising for the absence of the mover of an important motion.  The Senator admits that he knows nothing about it.  If one day's proceedings more than another has utterly condemned this House as being an unjustifiable expense on the State to-day's business has done it.  I feel that there is not one Senator who can hold up his head with any dignity and say that he is justifying his existence as a statesman.  We have been condemned and criticised for arguing for the abolition of this House.

It has been stated frequently in this House that, as a matter of general policy, there ought to be an official representative of the Ministry here who would be able to speak on their behalf with responsibility.  That proposal has never been given heed to. To-day we have five items on the Order Paper.  One deals with private business, a purely formal matter.  Another <Col N="47" /> deals with the Currency Amendment Bill.  As it happens, the whole tenor of the original Bill sent here by the Government has been altered.  On the other matters of considerable importance which ought to have been discussed by the House, and as to which somebody ought to be able to speak the Ministerial mind, we are left entirely without guidance or assistance.  I think the Seanad would be justified in making a strong protest against the unsatisfactory way in which the House has been treated by the Ministry on this occasion and on other occasions. <Col N="48" /> There are matters here in which three different Ministries are affected, and in none of them is it possible to proceed because of the absence of any spokesman for the Ministers.  The motion made by Senator O'Rourke ought to be explained.  There is some reason for it, and the Ministry ought to be able to state the reason.  I move that the discussion be adjourned.</P>
