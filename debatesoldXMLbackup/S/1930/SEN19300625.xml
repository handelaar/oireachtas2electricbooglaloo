      <P>Before the business of the Seanad is entered on, I desire to make a personal explanation.  I see that in the Official Report of the Debates of our last meeting I am put down as using the word &ldquo;rubbish&rdquo; during the course of a speech made by Senator Johnson.  I should like to say that in using the word I had no intention of being insulting.  It is a word that one uses so easily in ordinary life, and I did not realise that its use is inadmissible in public debate.  As I understand it is an unparliamentary word to use, I desire to withdraw it and to express my regret to Senator Johnson.</P>

      <P>Section 12 of the original Act of 1927 makes provision by which, in special circumstances, Section 69 of the Act of 1925 is applicable to new buildings erected between March, 1927, and October, 1930.  As a consequence they get a reduction in their valuations, for rating purposes, to the extent of two-thirds for a period of five years.  It has been recommended by the Department of Industry and Commerce, by the Valuation Department and by the Department of Local Government that in the case of persons carrying out building at the present time, when building costs are so high, this very useful encouragement might be continued for a further period of two years&mdash;that is, to the <Col N="1774" /> 1st October, 1933.  That is the proposal in the Bill.</P>

      <P>This is the machinery Bill for dealing with the preparation of the special register in connection with the special commercial franchise and for the carrying out of the elections.  There are three main points dealt with in this Bill. In the first place, the City Manager and Town Clerk will be the registration officer.  He will have the responsibility of satisfying himself, when a claim is made for inclusion on the register, that the statutory conditions are fulfilled.  Sub-section (2) of Section 2 gives a clearer definition of persons entitled to vote.  The Dublin City Manager and Town Clerk will be the registration officer. The register will only be prepared in the years in which it is to be used. It will be prepared in the same way as the ordinary local government register, that is to say, the date for qualification will be the 15th November and for publication 1st June. There will be corresponding dates for receiving claims, objections and hearing objections.  When any point of difference arises between the registration officer and a claimant, it is proposed that the Circuit Court shall be the court finally to determine such claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the time for the preparation of the first register will be very short, for the reason that it is anticipated that an election will be carried out before the end of September next.  For that reason, there cannot be the same arrangements made for the preparation of the first register as for its preparation in subsequent years.  What is proposed is that persons who, under the terms of the Local Government Act, would have been entitled on 1st July to inclusion <Col N="1775" /> on the register, will be included on it, subject to their making a claim.  In the preparation of the register, except as regards the first one, there will be the usual house-to-house canvass.  The responsibility for the preparation of the register will be on the registration officer.  It will not be possible to have a house-to-house canvass for the preparation of the first register, but the work of building it up is being carried on, as far as possible, at present.  There will be publication of the fact that the register is being prepared.  Persons entitled to be on it, and desirous of getting on it, will have to make their claim.  There will be, first of all, publication of the first lists. Later there will be dates for receiving claims and objections.  As far as the time at our disposal will allow, the greatest possible length of time will be given for the carrying out of these operations.  The second schedule deals with the conduct of elections. It follows the practice of the ordinary law.  The third schedule deals with the counting of votes, and is similarly adapted from existing legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say anything in regard to the details of this Bill as I am opposed to it on principle.  There is one matter on which I would like the Minister to give us some information.  I notice that the City Manager is to be the returning officer.  Is he also to be the returning officer as regards the election of the other members of the Council, and if not, why is the change proposed?  The electorate in this case will be a very limited one, while the number of people to be elected is small.  Therefore, it seems undesirable, if it could be avoided, that the City Manager who will be so closely associated with the government of the City, should also be the returning officer for the election of these five or six representatives. I should like to know from the Minister what is the object in having him as the returning officer, because the arrangement proposed seems a rather unusual one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LaurenceONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I was not able to be present to hear the Minister's statement in moving the Second Reading of this Bill.  I would like to refer to two statements that were made in this House quite recently.  I feel it would be a pity to let them pass into oblivion without making a brief reference to them.  In the official Report of the Seanad for the 4th-5th June, 1930, column 1398, I find that Senator Bagwell is reported to have said: &ldquo; On the whole the higher the valuation the better the brains.&rdquo;  What an ideal headline such a statement as that makes for the copy books for the children of the future.  The Senator's statement, like the pilfering of Tut's tomb, takes us back to the mysteries of the past, revealing why it was and how it was that the Dublin Corporation, previous to the Reform Act of 1840, was called the &ldquo;rotten Corporation.&rdquo;  The statement, too, reveals how it was that none were elected to the Corporation except they were qualified as, and were grandiloquently known as, merchant princes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the Annals of Dublin burst the bubble of these princes.  These are the moonlighters and the highwaymen&mdash;I say these things advisedly&mdash;these are the cut-throats and genteel scoundrels who posed as men of assumed respectability and as men of wealth and men of class distinction.  The Annals of Dublin tell us that they posed as bigots both in religion and in politics, and the principal asset that they possessed was that they were Freemasons.  The Annals of Dublin reveal that these sparking-plugs of infamy were able to cheat the citizens of their property. To bear out what I am stating, there can be seen any day in the Corporation leases the names of these princely robbers, of whose interest the Minister is now so careful, still adorning some of our streets&mdash;those people who deliberately robbed the citizens of their property, because they were on a moneyed register such as we are here to-day proposing. Anyone reading the statement of Senator Bagwell would come to the conclusion that he is a deeply read <Col N="1777" /> man.  Anyone who did not know that there were some solemn and sensible people in this Seanad would come to the conclusion that we were all a lot of duds if we swallowed this piffle.</P>
    <P>There was another statement made, and it is strange how some people squeal when the shoe pinches. Senator Sir John Keane said influences are at work to prevent us from acting in an independent manner. Really, I think that was a gross reflection on members of the Seanad. It took us back, perhaps, to the days when knights were bold, and the Senator, if he is an honourable man &mdash;I am sure he is, he is not here today&mdash;will explain what he means. It is statements like these general statements which were hurled time after time at the old Corporation, and if statements like these about the Seanad are not at once nipped in the bud I fear the Minister will be compelled to send Commissioners in here and then what will happen? Why, it is awful to contemplate. Our salaries stopped, our occupation, like Othello's, gone, and our holidays lengthened!</P>
    <P>As to this commercial franchise, it had its being and has got its name from that abode of rest known as the Commercial Buildings, Dame Street, Dublin&mdash;a place which is availed of mostly by agents who have turned the City of Dublin into a dumping ground and a distributing centre for foreign goods.  A little bird tells me that in this particular abode of rest certain company meetings were hatched and invested a great deal of their shareholders' money in gramophones.</P>
    <P>I still hold that this commercial franchise is insidious and dangerous. It is, as I have said already, a direct invitation to the Communists to come on.  It is the resurrecting of class distinction in its worst form, by money, because it increases the power or votes of the moneyed class. I found that stated in the Annals of Dublin in the year 1840.  It is a very old saying that it is difficult for the leopard to change his spots.  This franchise is giving six votes to the rich man and one vote to the poor <Col N="1778" /> man.  The Minister has already lectured me on that statement, signifying more or less that I was in error. I may not have the choice language of the Minister, but I always call a spade a spade.  This money register is an insult to the citizens of Dublin. The citizens of Dublin are considered capable as a whole of electing representatives to the Dáil to legislate for the State, but the Government, through the Minister for Local Government, consider that the citizens as a whole are not capable, of electing municipal representatives except they have a number of what I might call &ldquo;pow-wows&rdquo; with large banking accounts sandwiched in between them.  It may be my ignorance of the Bill, but I have yet to learn what these choice specimens of humanity are to be called.  Are they to be known as aldermen?  Surely they could not be called councillors?  That would be too mean.  May I suggest to the Minister as a little amendment that it would be more correct if he called them bishops and supplied them with a special prie-dieu to prevent them from mixing with those elected by the common people.  I go a little further and suggest to the Minister that he might have a phrenologist's chart hanging over each showing the complement of brains each possessed according to his valuation and then men of the type of Senator Bagwell would be in their glory.</P>
    <P>The Minister in dealing with a few mild remarks I made before with reference to this franchise took me severely to task to the accompaniment of an amount of laughter from certain Senators, showing that it was their belief that democracy was on the run.  They laughed at the statement made by the Minister on 28th May, 1930.</P>

      <P>I should, like to give the Senator every opportunity, but his speech is largely one upon the Local Government (Dublin) Bill. We have already accepted the principle of that Bill and it is upon that Bill that the Senator's speech would have been really relevant.  However, if the Senator will not continue too long I will let him proceed.</P>

As I say, having been a chairman for a long time myself, I would not like in any way to transgress the rules of debate or even the rules of decency and I shall be quite satisfied to shorten my remarks. The reason I am referring to what the Minister said in reply to remarks of mine on a former occasion is that this is the only opportunity I shall have.  I certainly would not like to make the same speech over again.</P>

      <P>Thank you very much for your kind consideration. The Minister when referring to a few mild remarks of mine said: &ldquo;Whatever the British Army, the Republican Army and the, soldiers have been fighting for for years past, it is the first time I ever heard they were fighting for one man one vote in local government franchise.&rdquo;  No one admires the ability or the industry of the Minister more than I do, but, for the first time he has tripped. I did not state that the armies he has mentioned went out to fight for one man one vote in local government franchise.  The Minister knows as well as any man in Ireland that there was no necessity for them to fight for one man one vote in local government franchise as it has been a long-established principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not. The Senator suggested the principle <Col N="1780" /> of one man one vote, implying, I take it, that every man and woman was to have a vote in local government franchise.  The Senator implied that that principle of adult suffrage was established under the local government franchise for many years.  I say that is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not state that, and certainly what the Minister is after stating is news to me.  I am one who always bows to superior judgment.  What I did state was that the armies the Minister mentioned went out to leave the world safe for democracy, the main plank of which is one man one vote.  I know I am treading on very dangerous ground in stating that the young men of Ireland who joined the Republican Army were cajoled into the belief that they were fighting for the establishment of an Irish Republic, and if they discovered instead that they were fighting to establish a commercial register of six votes for the rich man and one vote for the poor man no man in Ireland knows better than the Minister that there would have been a great many deserters and few recruits.  I think it was Senator Douglas complained&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I really must ask you, Senator, to confine yourself to the present Bill, the Electoral (Dublin Commercial) Bill and the machinery established by it.  If you object to the machinery you can do so.  I cannot have a re-hash of the Second Reading debate on the Local Government (Dublin) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I cannot now deal with the point raised by Senator Douglas, but I will do so at some future date.  One of the arguments in the Dáil in support of the Bill which we are now discussing was: What about Guinness's? What about Woolworth's?  What about Burton's?  And, if I might add, what about the moneylenders and the profiteers?  Who built up Guinness's?  Mainly the staff by their energy, and the workmen by their toil.  What helped the Guinness family to amass millions and <Col N="1781" /> gain titles?  Unhappily, it was the degradation of the lowly.  Even so, have not Guinness's a tremendous voting power?  Have they not from three to four thousand employees?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one matter which the Minister referred to in the course of his statement, and, if I understood him rightly, it means that in regard to the preparation of the first register there should be no duty upon the registration officer except to publish a notice for claimants, to make a list of claimants, and then, after the revision of the list, to issue it as the list of voters. Looking at the Second Schedule, if I have correctly interpreted the Minister, I find that for lists after the first list the registration officer shall prepare in the first instance a list of voters, that he shall also advertise for a list of claimants, and after due revision that list shall become the list of voters at the election. Of course, as the Minister has said, there will be some hurry about the preparation of the first list, but I do not think that hurry will be so great as to justify a public officer not making some attempt in the first instance, from the materials at his disposal, to prepare a list of voters as distinct merely from sending out notice for claimants.  I think there are sufficient materials in the records of this city, in the valuation lists in possession of the rating authorities, as well as other books and records to enable the registration officer and the officials of the Minister to follow the ordinary course and prepare <Col N="1782" /> first a voters list, and, while they are preparing that list, to advertise for claimants, then to publish a list of claimants, and finally after a revision to issue a complete list.  I think there is plenty of time to do that.  In regard to what my friend, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, said, of course we all heard the argument that the greater the valuation the greater the brains.  Really we are very patient here.  Some of us are rather glad to hear expressions of that kind, and for my part I am glad to hear them, for when a thing like that is boasted about I rather come to the conclusion that the brains over the tongue are absent or empty.  I am not offended in the same way as the Lord Mayor was offended.  I like to hear them sometimes, as they do us good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister also to have regard to the fact that the City Manager, in addition to being returning officer, is also registration officer, having the actual preparation of the register on which the elections are held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In carrying out the duties of returning officer in connection with the franchise the City Manager and Town Clerk will be discharging the same duties as he carries out under the ordinary local government franchise.  So far as the position of the returning officer is concerned, there is no difference between the City Manager and the Town Clerk in his relationship with the electorate of the commercial franchise and the electorate of the ordinary local government franchise. The county registrar is the registrar for the ordinary local government franchise.  The City Manager and Town Clerk will be the registration officer in regard to this franchise. The reason for that is that the City Manager and Town Clerk has the machinery that enables him to check in the most satisfactory possible way the framing of the register under this franchise and without having direct access to the records that the Town Clerk will have the county registrar could not do that, <Col N="1783" /> so the simplest, most direct and economical way to have the register prepared is to have it done by the City Manager and Town Clerk.  I may also remark that the franchise for the Port and Docks Board is on a somewhat similar basis.  The Town Clerk is also responsible for the preparation of that register.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator Comyn, the Local Government (Dublin) Bill contains provisions to secure that the election must be fixed for not later than 1st October.  Senators will recollect what takes place with regard to the making up of the ordinary local government register which extends from the 15th November to the 1st June.  That period is taken up with one operation or another.  In so far as the Town Clerk and City Manager has materials at his disposal for making up this particular register, the only machinery he has at his disposal is the machinery he will operate in a normal year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has been very thoroughly gone into with the city officials with a view to seeing whether we could not make more satisfactory arrangements than we have here.  In fairness to the electorate on the one hand and the Town Clerk and his responsibilities on the other, we have come to the conclusion that it would not be reasonable to ask him to do more than we are asking him to do here.  We put these franchise proposals before the Oireachtas, for we believe there is a demand for them and that in equity they ought to be provided, and I am interested to see what kind of demand will be made in the original set of claimants for appearance on this particular franchise.  I do not know if the Senator realises that as well as the advertisements notifying the fact that the register was being made, giving the final date for claims, and the publication then of the register, there will be also a period for objections, <Col N="1784" /> a period for considering those objections, and the regular work of revision will be gone through, with as much time devoted to all that as can be spared considering the desirability of leaving the period in respect of which claims may be made as extended as possible between the date of the passing of these Bills and the holding of the elections not later than the 1st October.  If it is suggested that the complete register must be prepared without putting some responsibility on the claimants, that would be too great a responsibility to put on the Town Clerk, and as there is no intermediate arrangement you could reasonably make, the Bill has been framed with the responsibility for making a claim being placed on the person entitled to appear on the register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I understood the Minister rightly when he said in respect to the Port and Docks Board register that the Town Clerk was the registration officer.  Is it not the Secretary of the Port and Docks Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Town Clerk is responsible for doing all the original work.  I made a mistake in suggesting that he was the registration officer, but so far as making the preparation of the first draft is concerned he is responsible.  He has the material as a result of which the register can be prepared and it appears reasonable that we should make him the registration officer, seeing his staff is handling the whole thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think on that point the analogy is against the Minister, because in the case of this new franchise in the Bill before us we must recognise that the City Manager's position is one of extraordinary power in relation to the Council, that is to say, in relation to persons to be elected, and in the conduct of preparing the register he could if he were so disposed use the register to affect a subsequent election.  In view of the relations between the Council which will be elected and the <Col N="1785" /> City Manager and Town Clerk, it is not right, I think, that the City Manager and Town Clerk should have the actual executive work of preparing the register, and anything that the Minister says is only so far as could apply to the first register.  It ought not to be continued after the first register, as is proposed in the Bill.  I do not think it is justifiable. In any case, whatever the Minister said in defence of the proposal is only applicable to the first register. It seems to me to be placing the City Manager and Town Clerk in an extraordinarily powerful position, so that if he wished to misuse his power, as by a little oversight here and there, he could influence the character of the register.  We ought not to legislate in that direction.  If it is possible by any reasonable means we should have some alternative by which we could place a non-interested person in the position of registration officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in fairness the Senator ought to develop <Col N="1786" /> the point that the person in charge of the making up of the register can interfere with the complexion of that register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is easy to understand.  If the first register is made up with a certain number of names and then if the onus is placed on a person who has been omitted though legitimately entitled under the Act to be placed on the register to seek application, you are limiting the number of that kind of person who will be left on in the long run.  It is not an automatic entry to the register.  The registration officer has to make up the register in the first instance, and it is then to be left to applicants and seekers of the franchise to make their case for entering on the register. I say that the fact of throwing the onus on the individual applicant is going to reduce the number of such applicants and shorten the register, or bias it in a particular direction, if the City Manager were so disposed.</P>

      <P>Amendment No 3 to Section 19 is also a Government amendment.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 19.  Before sub-section (5) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) An agreed adjustment may provide for the payment by the City Corporation to the County Council in one or more instalments or by way of annuity of a sum in respect of the loss of benefit which will be occasioned to the inhabitants of the County as a consequence of the extension of the boundaries of the City by this Act in the case of any benefit which is limited by a restriction on the amount in the pound of the rate which can be raised for the provision of such benefit and the following provisions shall have effect in regard to every sum the payment of which is provided for under this sub-section, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) every payment received by the County Council in respect of any such sum shall be applied towards the provision of the benefit in respect of which it is paid, and</P>
      <P>(b) no such sum shall be taken into account when calculating the amount in the pound which can be raised for providing the benefit in respect of which such sum is paid nor shall the payment of such sum restrict or affect the said amount in the pound.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A normal increase of burden <Col N="1789" /> shows itself in an increase of rates. But there may be cases, such as in the working of the Libraries Committee or the Technical Education Committee or the Committee of Agriculture, where there is a limit on rating and that limit has been already attained.  The loss of area may then bring about a situation in which top limit of rating will not create the necessary funds to provide the service that had previously been in operation, and possibly the loss of service will, therefore, have to be regarded as an increase of burden.</P>

The County Dublin would suffer loss in that way, but that loss will not occur until these rates are increased, because the present limit will be extended as you go ahead.</P>

      <P>The work under the Libraries Committee is a clear case, but inasmuch as an additional burden is imposed for technical education purposes as a result of the Vocational Education Bill, that ought not to be regarded as increasing the burden arising out of the Local Government (Dublin) Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 5 to Section 25, sub-section (1).  The amendment reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 25, sub-section (1). To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;when exercising its powers to make any grants referred to in this sub-section, the City Corporation shall treat such of its employees as were previously employed by the county council, the board of health, a rural district council or an abolished body of which the Corporation is the successor not less favourably than if such employees had been employed by the Corporation previous to the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substance of this amendment was discussed on the Committee Stage.  It seeks to make sure that the new Corporation in discussing the question of allowances for superannuated employees will treat the employees of the urban districts which are being brought in as if they had been employees of the City Corporation. There is a possibility under the Bill as it stands that the new Corporation when dealing with the question of superannuation of redundant employees will make a differentiation between those employees who had been hitherto employed by the old City Corporation and those brought in under the Bill. That is to say that the Pembroke and Rathmines urban employees may be differentiated against.  The amendment is indicating very <Col N="1791" /> clearly that the intention of the Legislature is that there should be a complete amalgamation, and that the employees of the urban areas will not be treated differently because they were brought in under this Bill, and that whatever differentiation of treatment there will be will be on the merits of the individual case, and not because one was an old employee and the other a new employee.  I think it is necessary, and I believe it is also the desire of the House and of the Minister, that there should be no differentiation. Under the Bill as it stands it is possible that there might be differentiation, and I seek in this amendment that there should not be any differentiation made between the employees of the townships that are brought in and the old employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this matter was discussed on the Electricity Bill. It was there contended that the employees of the Pembroke Township, who had no pensionable rights and who were brought within the scope of the Corporation of Dublin, would be entitled to pensions.  That, however, was decided against.  It seems to me that this is exactly the same suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill actually provides that the employees of Rathmines and Pembroke will automatically become employees of the new Dublin City Corporation, and that they will then come in under the pension scheme for workmen that the City Corporation have powers to apply, and that for the purpose of the statutes providing such powers they will be entitled to count service with Rathmines and Pembroke Council towards their superannuation as if their services in Rathmines and Pembroke had been services under the old City Corporation.  So that we are bringing the Rathmines and Pembroke employees in under whatever scheme exists in the City.  My objection to the amendment is that it is unnecessary and suggests that there may be <Col N="1792" /> discrimination.  The amendment also suggests that there is a particular standard way of dealing with employees in the City of Dublin, whereas each individual case is dealt with on its merits.  It may be suggested that the employees in Rathmines and Pembroke are going to be dealt with in the same way as, say, some one particular person in Dublin is being dealt with, whereas these employees are simply being brought in under the general powers to give pensions.  It is being assured that their services in Pembroke and Rathmines will count.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister has answered any point which Senator Johnson made, nor has he removed the difficulty that is in our minds.  I understand that under certain statutes workmen in the employment of the Dublin Corporation have certain rights as to superannuation allowances and gratuities that the workmen in the employment of the added areas at the present time have not.  I think it would be a generous gesture and only fair that in the taking in of the added areas the workmen employed by the disbanded councils should be placed on the same footing as that in which the Dublin workmen are at the present time.</P>

      <P>If the Minister thinks that they are&mdash;and I should be very glad to agree with him if I could&mdash; if he thinks that that is the case, then there should be no real objection to clarifying the matter in the way in which Senator Johnson requires. I am glad to know that the Minister is willing that the workmen in Pembroke and Rathmines shall, on the amalgamation of Dublin with the added areas, be placed in the same comparatively advantageous position as the workmen in Dublin now enjoy.  I can assure the Minister that so far as I know that would be a considerable advantage to the workmen in the added areas in certain respects at least.  If that <Col N="1793" /> is the Minister's opinion then all we want is to have it clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made reference to employment under the Pembroke and Rathmines Councils. I wonder do his remarks apply with the same effect to the employees in the added areas outside Pembroke and Rathmines?  The rights of the workmen in the added areas are no less strong morally and otherwise than the rights of the workmen and the employees of the Pembroke and Rathmines Councils.  In these areas there are roadmen at present working, the men who sweep the roads and so on.  In the ordinary course they may not perhaps get pensions on retirement but the councils would keep them on while they were able to work.  On the amalgamation a number of these men will undoubtedly become redundant and unless they are assured the same sort of treatment as if they were the original employees of the Dublin Corporation, it will be open to the new City Council to dispense with their services and give them no pensions. It may be said that no rights which they originally enjoyed are being taken away.  But the withdrawal of the customary practice is equivalent to the taking away of rights which these men have enjoyed. It is to prevent that injustice that this amendment is being introduced. I know some of these men and I am aware that there are men with 30 or 40 years' service in that employment.  I know they are in a terrible state of trepidation as to what is to become of them now on amalgamation.  You cannot compel the new City Corporation to give them a pension, but we should require them to give them the same sort of treatment as they will give the old employees of the Dublin Corporation.  The new City amalgamation undoubtedly alters their prospects and their services from the point of view of security of tenure. This amendment requires the Corporation to give equitable treatment to all the new employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering why <Col N="1794" /> the Labour Senators are creating a difficulty over this section.  To me it seems quite plain that these employees, whether of the county council, the board of health, the rural council, or the urban council, will on being taken over get whatever privileges the Corporation employees at present have.  It seems to me most peculiar how anybody who has put in 30 or 40 years' work in one of these outside bodies, with no prospect of a pension, should be in a state of trepidation, now that he is about to be taken over by the Dublin Corporation and given a pension.  That is what Senator O'Farrell seems to me to be afraid of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty seems to me to be that the Minister says that under the Corporation system the case of each workman is dealt with individually.  It is proposed by the Bill that that system will be applied to all the employees of <Col N="1795" /> bodies that are being done away with.  The amendment proposes that the workmen transferred from abolished bodies are to be treated not less favourably than if they had been employed by the Corporation prior to the passing of the Act.  If the workmen are to be dealt with individually, how can you apply the argument that because So-and-So has been dealt with as an individual in one way, another man who has been working in a totally different area is to be dealt with not less favourably? The whole point is that they have to be dealt with as individual cases and not as a class.  The discussion takes place on the individual merits of the case.  The Bill gives every individual in the employment of the Corporation the same rights as the existing Dublin Corporation employees have got, and I do not think it is possible for the Bill to give more than that.  I think the Minister is perfectly right in saying that the insertion of an amendment of this sort suggests that the Corporation are going to deal differently and more harshly with individual cases that come before them than they would generally. I do not think that we have any reason to believe that such a thing will happen.  The Corporation must do what the Bill says, and that is to deal with the employees on the same plane, and that each individual will be dealt with on his merits under the new system just as under the old.  I do not see how you can apply in individual cases treatment for a general class.  That would really damage the Bill and damage in anticipation the reputation of the people who are going to administer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>This position is not as simple as the Senator has stated. There are no pension rights at all in Rathmines or Pembroke.  In the case of the Dublin workmen, the Corporation has powers to make a superannuation allowance.  In Pembroke and Rathmines the councils have no such powers.  What the Bill provides is <Col N="1796" /> that the powers of the Corporation in respect to these old workmen will apply in respect to the new workmen. That is clear, and it is clear also that as far as the individual whose superannuation is being considered is concerned, his career is considered on its merits.  That will apply in the future as in the past.  In view of the fact that the expectation of the old Corporation workman is that, at a certain period of his life, he may be superannuated and that there is no such expectation up to now in respect of the employees of the Rathmines and Pembroke Councils, I think there is a considerable risk that the new Corporation of the City of Dublin will treat old employees in one category and new employees in another category.  That is to say, they will treat the new employees as persons who never had any expectation of superannuation and the old employees as persons who had expectation of superannuation. I want it to be clear that they will be all treated on the same footing as far as that question is concerned. I think there is a real risk that there is going to be differentiation and I want to prevent that risk, if possible.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister look at the last words of the section? If the Minister thinks that there will be no differentiation it may be all right, but I believe the last words in the section do not make it clear enough.

      <P>The next amendment is a Government amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 34, sub-section (2).  To delete lines 26-36 inclusive and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;premises situate in the City or (until the appointed day) in an added urban district or (until the 1st day of April, 1931) in the added rural area and either</P>
      <P>(a)  such premises are valued under the Valuation Acts at not less than twenty pounds and are occupied by such individual, partnership, unincorporated association, or corporate body wholly for the purpose of carrying on therein any business, profession, trade, manufacture, or other commercial or industrial pursuit, or</P>
      <P>(b)  such premises are occupied by such individual, partnership, unincorporated association, or corporate body partly for the purpose aforesaid and the proportion of the valuation under the Valuation Acts of such premises which is fairly attributable to the part thereof so occupied is not less than twenty pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will remember that on the occasion of the Second Reading a question arose as to the difficulty of deciding a certain class of case, whether the persons claiming to be on the commercial register were persons who should be on the register, bearing in mind what the register was supposed to represent.  It always did appear that there was going to be a difficulty on the part of the registration officer in deciding in a particular class of case.  I think the amendments we have now here, amendments 6, 7 and 8, will remove entirely any difficulties in that particular way.  This amendment provides that the basis of the franchise will be the occupation of premises whether they be whole buildings or part of buildings, the valuation of such premises being not less than £20 and their occupation being for the purpose of carrying on any business, trade, profession or manufacture.  It means then that instead of the franchise being based <Col N="1798" /> on occupation for commercial purposes, on a building of £20 valuation and upwards, wholly or partly occupied for commercial purposes, the franchise shall be based on the occupation of premises of a valuation of £20 or upwards for commercial purposes, whether these premises are in whole or in part separately valued premises or not.  The result is that the widest possible latitude can be given to deciding whether a particular class of business is a business within the meaning of this particular Act.  I recommend the change in this section to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister on the Second Reading of the Bill referred to the extreme difficulty there would be in preparing the first register.  I think he is increasing the difficulties as time goes on.  If only part of a house of £30 valuation is used for business in respect of which a commercial vote can be obtained, that is certain rooms, how is he in the time at his disposal to make an apportionment of the valuation as between the rooms used for commercial <Col N="1799" /> purposes and the rooms that are not?  Who is to be the person to decide that question?  Is it to be the City Manager?  I would suggest to the Minister that the difficulties of apportionment under this new clause will be very great indeed, and will involve a considerable amount of time, and that perhaps in this first register at least, and in fact in all the registers that he makes up under the commercial franchise, he should avoid these difficulties of apportionment. In my judgment the sub-section that is now proposed will lead to endless difficulty.  It makes the commercial franchise even more reactionary than it was intended to be, and really it is against that extension of this commercial franchise we urged on the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly these amendments are intended to restrict still further the number of persons who are to be entitled to elect these five supermen&mdash;these special commercial members of the Council. The Bill as drafted made it possible, as was pointed out earlier, for a very considerable number of people to be considered as commercial electors. This proposes to limit that number very greatly indeed.  Following what Senator Comyn said, I, too, would like to ask who is to be the judge of what is the valuation of that part of the premises occupied for business purposes only.  Is it to be the registration officer?  If it is the Minister will now see how he may affect the quality of the register.  If the registration officer is to be the valuation authority in the matter he may decide that the valuation of one premises is to be £19 and the valuation of another premises to be £21.  The house is divided into two, one part being occupied for residential purposes and the other for business purposes. This is the person who is to decide whether it shall be £19 or £21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the amendment is unjustified. Undoubtedly it makes still finer the collection of persons who are to be in this special privileged <Col N="1800" /> position, but in addition to that it is throwing on some person unnamed the right to say what the valuation of part of the premises used for business purposes is to be.  I do not know anybody else who is going to decide that except, in the first instance, the registration officer who is also the City Manager.  I think the amendment is not worthy of support.</P>

      <P>The person who will have to decide the valuation of a particular part of the premises will be the registration officer.  He is the person who does that under the Electoral Act when a vote on the Dáil register is claimed in respect of the occupation of premises for business purposes.  As regards the difficulties of the registration officer in the matter, he will simply act through the ordinary machinery. He will have the assistance of the rate collectors and all the other assistance he receives in making up the franchise.  He has to be very careful, because if he turns down an elector who seeks to be registered, then that elector, if he desires to do so, can appeal, and the matter will be decided by the Circuit Court on case stated.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to make this matter more difficult than it is, and I assure the House that I want to be helpful, but I wonder whether the officials in the Minister's Department understand the extreme difficulty of making apportionments of valuations.  My experience has been that it is one of the most difficult things possible.  The apportionment must be made by a person who has a knowledge of the value of property. A number of professional men are attached to the valuation <Col N="1801" /> office and in various cases they make these apportionments of valuations. My experience has been that they usually take three or four months.  If I may say so with respect to the House, I do not think that the difficulties of this section are at all appreciated.</P>

      <P>The imputation is made in the objections offered to this amendment that it is going to alter, in some way or other, the class and number of electors qualified to act in connection with this commercial franchise.  Senator Comyn's objection to the amendment is that it would be difficult to carry out.  I take it that the Minister has brought it forward for departmental reasons; that he has been told that it is the easiest way to carry out what is already in the Bill.  I feel quite certain that the imputation cannot be sustained that this is an attempt to try and alter the class and number of electors who are to go on this commercial franchise.  If there is anything in that contention, Senator Johnson will be able to speak for himself, but I imagine the Minister will not admit that for a moment: that the amendment is being brought in to alter the number of the electors under this franchise&mdash;to decrease or increase them in number, and give greater privileges to those who are left.  Putting it in plain language that is, I think, what Senator Johnson meant to imply.  Personally, I cannot see that at all.  The Minister should tell us definitely whether this amendment is brought forward for departmental reasons: to make clearer what is already in the Bill, or can he contradict the imputation in the Senator's statement?</P>

      <P>The Senator is right to this extent that under the Bill originally it would be possible for a person with a six-roomed house having a valuation of £25, in which she herself occupied only one room for the purpose of carrying on a dressmaking business, to get on the commercial register.  With that possibility before us, and considering <Col N="1802" /> the classes of business that might be carried on in one room of a house with such accommodation and with such a valuation, it appeared to us that there was a loophole in the proposals we were making as the Bill came from the Dáil.  If such a thing could occur as I have mentioned it would be contrary to our conception of what the commercial franchise should be.  We said that we would have to get a firmer basis upon which the commercial franchise could be built up.</P>
      <P>In this amendment the basis that is proposed is the occupation of premises with a £20 valuation, so that the person occupying a house with that valuation and living in it must occupy four-fifths of it for actual business purposes before he or she can get on the commercial register. Because of that it does reduce the number of possible electors who will get on this commercial franchise. There will be a certain amount of reduction.  But I submit that the reduction, even to the extent to which it was likely to come about under the old system, will not be so great. Whether the reduction will be great or not it is just because it was not our conception that a person having a local government vote should also get on the commercial franchise in respect of the value of the small portion of the house in which he also carried on business.  Our conception of the commercial register is based on this: that a very large amount of rates have been paid in respect of buildings occupied for commercial and trade purposes, and in respect of which there has been no representation good, bad or indifferent in the past.  There is that reduction, but it is not a reduction that has been brought about for the purpose of narrowing down this franchise to its narrowest limits.  Our object in bringing forward this franchise at all is to give representation of a particular kind to persons engaged in business on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to persons paying rates in respect of property for which, up to the present, they have had no representation.</P>

      <P>Section 53, sub-section (6).  To delete the words &ldquo;Council shall with the sanction of the Minister&rdquo; inserted in Committee and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;Minister shall.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The insertion of this sub-section was moved by Senator Comyn on behalf of Senator Colonel Moore in Committee, and it was to delete the words in the Bill as it then stood &ldquo;The Minister shall&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;The Council shall with the sanction of the Minister.&rdquo;  This alteration of the sub-section revives the question which was discussed at considerable length on the Report Stage of the Cork Bill when a similar amendment was inserted at the instance of Senator Johnson and was reversed on the Report Stage.  The amendment inserted on the Committee Stage here serves no useful purpose but on the contrary is likely to provide a very possible source of friction between the Manager and the Council.  In moving this amendment in Committee Senator Comyn said: &ldquo;I think the amendment follows the practice that has been adopted in local government matters ever since the Poor Law Acts were passed.  The fixing of the salaries of public officials was always the function of the elected bodies, subject, of course, to the approval of the Minister, who generally secured that the employee of the Council or the local bodies got a reasonable rate of pay.  I think there is no reason why the case of the City Manager should be differentiated from the case of other officials and public bodies.&rdquo;  I think with all his vast knowledge of statutes Senator Comyn shows some inadequate knowledge of this particular subject when he made that statement.  The powers that he sought to restore to this sub-section by this amendment cropped up in the case of the Cork Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (6) of Section 10 provided that there shall be paid by the Council to the Manager such <Col N="1805" /> remuneration as the Minister shall from time to time determine, and so on.  The presumption which is made in Senator Comyn's speech that this is a departure from the customary practice is entirely inaccurate and misleading.  At the time of the Cork Bill I pointed out, at considerable length, the fact that the Minister already possessed this power in regard to many public services.  I do not think it is necessary to quote these now, but if anybody wishes to verify them he will find references in my statement to the Acts in which these powers are conferred by statute on the Minister.</P>
    <P>The motion that I made on the Report Stage on that occasion was seconded by Senator Dowdall.  I think the arguments that were most pertinent to this matter are very well summarised by what he then said in regard to this on the Cork Bill: that it would be possible for certain local reasons, possibly political, or influences arising out of impending local elections, and in a desire to curry favour with the electors, for members to propose a certain inadequate scale of remuneration in order to carry an economy scheme before the electors.  Senator Dowdall, speaking of the Cork City Bill on the 20th February, 1928, said: &ldquo;For this reason I see the force of what Senator Milroy says, that they would put every obstacle in the way of fixing the proper remuneration of a good man, whereas a man who was independent and who really worked as he saw fit and proper in the interests of the duty with which he was charged might not get such remuneration as his services would entitle him to.&rdquo;  Senator Dowdall was concerned on that occasion with the experiment in City Managership, which was given effect to in the Cork Act, and that it should not be the subject of embarrassment and unnecessary interference by which friction might arise from an individual who was appointed as Manager, having to depend upon the goodwill or possibly upon the caprice of some section of the Council.  He was anxious <Col N="1806" /> that the experiment should be given the best possible chance of success, by the elimination of all causes of friction as between the Council and the Manager.  I think the same holds good in regard to the Dublin City Manager.  You could easily make difficulties by retaining the amendment that was made in Committee and by having a different class of provision for the capital City of Dublin from that of Cork.  You could create possibly serious difficulties and embarrassment for both Council and Manager, and thereby lessen the chances of this Bill reaching a full measure of success.</P>
    <P>I think it is not desirable that that should be our object.  I think it is desirable that the fullest possible chance of successfully working this measure should be aimed at.  I think that chance of securing every possible measure of success is undoubtedly increased if the Manager is removed from this environment of possible friction which I think undoubtedly would arise if this amendment inserted in Committee is retained. For that reason I move the deletion of the words in the sub-section.</P>

Anyway, I think it is <Col N="1807" /> unreasonable at this stage to bring in a motion over-ruling what was done in Committee of the whole Seanad.  Then there is the question of right in this matter.  The matter was raised at length in the Committee Stage and it can hardly be gone into again now.  It is a question of money and the right of the people to allot the amount of money that they are to pay to the City Manager or anyone else.  The amount of money should be fixed by the people who pay.  That is how things are done in the Dáil.  The Dáil allocates a certain sum of money to go for a certain purpose and that has to be carried out.  It is not the Minister who finds the money but the very reverse, and the Minister can do nothing to alter the amount allotted. For that reason I think the Council are the body to state how much should be paid and to authorise and fix the amount.  Therefore I object to this amendment.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Senator is not speaking officially but semi-officially on this occasion.  I am greatly surprised the Minister has come forward with this amendment. He was present when the matter was discussed and he heard the argument why the Corporation should be the persons to fix the salary, reserving to the Minister the right to see that the salary was a proper one. That was the meaning of the amendment which was in the name of Senator Colonel Moore.  He heard the <Col N="1808" /> argument and he saw the Seanad arrived at the conclusion after discussion that the council and not the Minister should be the person to fix the salary in the first instance.  But notwithstanding that, he comes forward now on the Report Stage hoping, of course, to have his battalions present here who never heard the arguments but who will vote for this Government or quasi-Government amendment.  In reference to that, I wish to state that we have given constant attendance to this House and we have, to the best of our ability, endeavoured to improve legislation.  We have not been as recalcitrant as we might be or ought to be, but I say this: on three or four occasions on very important Bills, some of them dealing with the Gaeltacht and some with the country generally, amendments proposed from these benches commended themselves to the majority of this House. The Minister was the Minister in charge of some of these particular measures, and on every occasion he came forward again on Report Stage and reversed the beneficial amendments which we had carried.  Now the Minister ought to know that the best soldier is the man who accepts, in a soldierly spirit, the reverses that come across his path.  The Minister will accept nothing that he considers a reversal, even though it is an improvement in the legislation of this country.  On that ground, and apart altogether from the merits which, I say, are with us on this amendment, I for one must protest against the practice of trying to reverse on the Report Stage amendments which on our proposal have commended themselves to the judgment of the House on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice three amendments on the Order Paper in. the name of Senator Milroy, all of which propose the deletion of some amendments inserted on the Committee Stage.  The Senator seems to act here in the capacity of a quasi-ministerial wet blanket, whose mission is to damp down any attempt to do anything but talk.  Repeatedly <Col N="1809" /> he has shown that to be his great object here.  His mission is to prevent us from doing anything except, of course, talk.  Certainly I would not support the amendment that was carried on the Committee Stage if I thought there was any chance that the new Corporation would for any reason whatever pay the new City Manager an inadequate salary.  But we must have regard to the practice in the past, and it will be generally admitted that the payment of small salaries to Corporation officials could never be levelled as a truthful charge against the Dublin Corporation.  The charge was all on the other side, that they paid not only their officers but their employees exorbitant salaries.  I do not think there is any danger that they are going to pay an inadequate salary to the City Manager.  If they are inclined to be extravagant, of course, the Minister has a veto over them, and they can only pay such salary as he may sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this amendment the Corporation shall pay with the sanction of the Minister, so that he can prevent extravagance, and there is no danger, and no justification for saying that an inadequate salary will be paid.  It will, at least, give the Corporation the honour of saying what salary it shall pay.  It is really nothing more.  It is a certain power, though not a valuable power, but it gives them the same right which the Dáil has to fix the salaries of Ministers, and which this House has to fix the salaries of its own officers.  I think that at least that much might be conceded to the Corporation. Senator Milroy quoted the Cork Act, and says that we should not depart from the principle of that Act in this respect.  I would reply to him that there is no commercial register in the Cork Act, and that we have departed from the Cork Act in more respects than that.  Certainly that argument does not hold water.  I would have more faith in the City Corporation fixing an adequate salary than I would have in the Government fixing an adequate salary, because their tendency is all <Col N="1810" /> the other way round.  We had it in the Shannon Scheme, we had it in the Civil Service, and also in the payment of teachers and Civic Guards.  The tendency is to cut down, so that it is not an argument at all in favour of Senator Milroy's amendment to say that the Government is going to pay a reasonable salary, while the Dublin Corporation will not.</P>

      <P>I had not the advantage of being in the House when this subject was discussed in Committee. I would therefore like to state very shortly my reason for supporting the amendment of Senator Milroy.  My objection to Senator Moore's amendment is this: it provides that the salary of the Manager is to be fixed by the Corporation with the approval of the Minister.  I object to that because it would very likely result in an unpleasant and an indecent controversy between the Minister and the Corporation, if the Corporation did not fix a proper salary.  That is not a desirable state of affairs.  My second reason for supporting the amendment of Senator Milroy is this: what you want to do is to get the best possible Manager.  You must get the best man.  That is what you are out to do.  In my opinion you will not get the best man unless the Minister has the fixing of the salary. That is the surest way of getting the best man.  With reference to what my friend Senator Comyn said about the practice of this House in reversing on the Report Stage amendments that were agreed to in Committee, I do not agree with him that that has been the practice here.  My experience is that it is quite contrary to the practice of this House.  I would like to know what is the meaning of the Report Stage and what is the use of the Report Stage if we are not to consider amendments that were put in on the Committee Stage.  That is what the Report Stage is for.  Therefore we are not acting in any way contrary to our practice in voting for the amendment.</P>

      <P>We do not know what the salary is to be, but I presume that Gerald Jarlath Sherlock knows.  Is that the real meaning of this particular amendment?  We have already decided that Gerald Jarlath Sherlock shall be the City Manager.  As to whether he is the best man, we are simply taking the advice of the Minister in that respect, and in the future any new appointments are to be made by the Minister on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commission. Whether the salary is fixed by the Minister or by the Council it will not affect the decision of the Local Appointments Commission, so that we are equal in that respect. Whether the salary is to be fixed by the Minister or by the Corporation I am sure the salary will be named before the applications are sent in, so that it makes no difference who is to fix the salary.  The fact is the Corporation has to pay and that the Council is accepting the assurance given by the Minister, to be the supreme authority because of the fact that it fixes the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it is sufficient to say that it is the Council should be the body to determine the salary of the City Manager and Town Clerk, always subject to the possible veto of the Minister.  The very section we are dealing with proves that there is no difference whatever in respect to the selection of the best man and as to <Col N="1812" /> who shall fix the salary.  The best man will be selected by the Local Appointments Commission in future from a list of applicants for the post, and in the present case he is already fixed, presumably being the best man, so that it makes no difference in fact whether the Council fixes the salary, subject to the veto of the Minister, or whether the Corporation shall do as it is told by the Minister.  I think this body should at least stand up for the right of the Corporation, which is administering the rates of the city, and should determine such a matter as the remuneration of the Town Clerk and City Manager.</P>

      <P>I wonder did Senator Johnson at all visualise a situation in which the City Manager and the Corporation are more or less at daggers drawn, and if the City Manager's proceedings are being quarrelled with by the Corporation authorities, which is probable, with this new arrangement coming into force.  The amendment which Senator Johnson wants to adhere to gives the Corporation power to propose a reduction of the Manager's salary.  That can only be vetoed by the Minister.  I think the Senator can see that there are a number of very high class men who would not place themselves in a position where their salary, because they were doing their duty, could be reduced except there was a veto by the Minister.  The Minister in asking us to adhere to the Bill as it was originally drawn is only asking us to use our commonsense, by taking care that the new Manager cannot be put into the extremely difficult situation that I have described. The individual case at the present does not matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was one of the members present during the debate on the amendment, and I believe the division was taken at a very late hour in the evening when there were very few of us here&mdash;only eighteen out of the whole House, as many of the Senators had gone home.  Now an awkward situation is going to arise if we are to adhere to that amendment <Col N="1813" /> carried by a small majority out of a very small number of Senators present, as the Bill will go back to the Dáil with this amendment.  I think there is very little doubt but that the Dáil will then object to it and the Bill will have to come back to us again.  If the Seanad mean to adhere to their decision that the salary should be fixed by the Corporation, subject to the veto of the Minister instead of by the Minister, then a fairly full Seanad, as we have now, should make up their minds that they were going to stand for this and are going to have immense delay as a consequence.

If Senators refuse to accept Senator Milroy's amendment they will do it with the knowledge that the Bill will certainly meet with difficulties, and I think none of the Senators want that.</P>

      <P>That may be so, but I want the Seanad to consider what they are doing.  Senator Comyn made some references to reversing amendments adopted in Committee, and as Senator Brown has said, that has often been done.  What often happens is that when it comes to the Report Stage we have time to reconsider amendments, and it very often occurs that an amendment is altered by agreement arrived at. That is not the case now.  This is a clear issue on which undoubtedly a vote will have to be taken.  I am only advising Senators to remember what will happen if we decide to <Col N="1814" /> adhere to the decision of a small majority of our number that passed the amendment on the Committee Stage.  That would undoubtedly be damaging the position of future managers of the Corporation and putting this House into a most unpleasant position.</P>

      <P>I hope the Seanad will not regard me as the unreasonable type of person Senator Comyn suggests.  The Senator's Party sometimes talk of a national civil service.  That, I suppose, would mean that the control and decisions of a central authority would be accepted in the different offices, and would apply to the different positions under local authorities, in the same way as the rates paid are standardised and accepted in the Post Offices throughout the country. Without going to the length of that, we have endeavoured from time to time to standardise the outlook on the salaries that are to be paid to officials, such as county surveyors, county medical officers of health and doctors in charge of particular classes of hospitals.  In spite of Senator O'Farrell's suggestion, we have had very great differences between some local bodies as to the amount of salaries that ought to be paid in the case of some very important technical and pivotal officials, with the power of doing good work, and effecting very considerable economies because of the efficient management of the departments they administer.  Our trouble has been invariably that we have not been able to persuade them in the matter of proper salaries.  In those cases in which we have over-ruled local authorities we have taken serious exception to the amount of the salary they were suggesting for these particular classes of persons.  In the case of the city manager, as was argued pretty fully in dealing with the Cork Bill, when we have the machinery such as we have and can take a decision in the full light of knowledge of what is reasonable to be paid to people in managerial positions, that we should make the question of a <Col N="1815" /> salary the subject of discussion at the Cork City Council or the Dublin Council is entirely unreasonable. We have, as I stated, the machinery by which the salary can be suggested. To put that salary under discussion at the Council either in the first instance or during the service of the manager would only give rise to all kinds of unpleasantness and friction and things that are undesirable of one kind or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Milroy thinks to give the council the power to fix the salary may create unpleasantness between the Council and the manager.  I think it may create undesirable relations between the Council and the manager.  My idea is that it is very likely to create unpleasantness between the Council and the Department. It can create more than unpleasantness; it can create an absolute deadlock, for the Council can say &ldquo;we will not agree to a particular salary for the manager.&rdquo;  Senator Colonel Moore's amendment was brought forward in respect of the manager alone.  Out of all the officials in the whole sphere of local government, the Minister would be precluded from over-riding the Council in the matter of fixing his salary and deprived of the powers which he <Col N="1816" /> has in respect of any other council in the whole sphere of local government. In the first place, the Minister should not be deprived in respect of the manager of the power he has with regard to other officials, such as in the case of county surveyors, medical officers of health and doctors in charge of hospitals.  He should not be prevented from overruling the Council if he cannot reconcile his judgment with the judgment of the Council.  The amendment accepted on the Committee Stage would prevent that.  But why we cannot take the machinery that is there and remove the whole question of salary from the field of discussion by the Council, and of discussion between the Council and the manager, and discussion between the Council and the Minister, I do not understand.  I submit that the most reasonable position is that the Minister should have power to fix a salary, and then the Council is only concerned with whether the manager is carrying out the administration of the City properly or not, and their hands would be completely clean and untied in the matter of either reviewing the administration of the city or finding fault if it is not being properly administered.</P>

      <P>Amendments 11, 12 and 13 are intended to clear up the position with regard to rates on small dwellings.  The amendments read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>11.  Section 72, sub-section (2). After the word &ldquo;City&rdquo; in line 19 to insert the words &ldquo;which is not a small dwelling within the meaning of the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928, (No. 4 of 1928), and,&rdquo; and in lines 23 and 24 to delete the words &ldquo;the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928 (No. 4 of 1928)&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;that Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>12.  Section 72, sub-section (2). To delete lines 26-29 inclusive and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;hereinafter mentioned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>13.  Section 72.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  In the case of a hereditament or tenement in the city which, in the opinion of the City Council, is suitable for use as a dwelling for and is occupied by an artisan or a labourer and either is or is deemed by virtue of the foregoing sub-section of this section to be a small dwelling within the meaning of the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928, Section 10 of that Act shall be construed and have effect as if the expression &lsquo;eight-tenths&rsquo; was substituted for the expression <Col N="1818" />&lsquo;nine-tenths&rsquo; in sub-section (1) thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 72 deals with the position of dwellings that come under the Rates on Small Dwellings Act.  I drew attention on the Committee Stage to the effect of Section 72, and I said that the Corporation by an old Act have power in respect of certain classes of premises that were suitable for, and actually occupied by, artisans and labourers, and as to which they accepted certain control in respect of their repair and general sanitary conditions, to enter into arrangements with the owners of these houses and give them a reduction in their rates to the extent of one-fifth, provided that the rates are paid within a certain definite period of time.  The Rates on Small Dwellings Act secures in respect of small dwellings occupied by persons other than the owners that there shall be a reduction in rates of one-tenth if the rates are paid at a particular period of time.  Section 72 with the amendments proposed here secures for the Corporation the power under their old Act in respect of dwellings suitable for artisans and occupied by artisans; and even though greater than the limit of £8 valuation the council can, if it pass a resolution bringing under its definite control repairs and sanitary arrangements, continue the powers to give a remission of rates to the extent of one-sixth. Small dwellings proper of less than £8 valuation can be given a remission of one-fifth instead of one-tenth of the rates if the council passes such a resolution.  That concession of one-tenth is available to the owners of small dwellings whether these dwellings come under the sanitary control of the Corporation or not.</P>

      <P>Before Senator Milroy moves amendment 18 to Section 101 I think my four amendments to that section should be taken.  These are the amendments on the Order Paper. I will move all my amendments together. They read:</P>
      <P>19a.  Section 101, sub-section (3).  To delete the sub-section.</P>
      <P>19b.  Section 101, sub-section (4).  To delete the sub-section</P>
      <P>19c.  Section 101.  To delete the new sub-section inserted in Committee before sub-section (5).</P>
      <P>19d.  New section.  Before Section 102 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;102.&mdash;(1) Where it appears to the Minister that any local, personal, or private Act or any order relating to the existing City or to either of the added urban districts and in force at the passing of this Act contains provisions which are inconsistent with or rendered unnecessary by or adequately replaced by provisions made by or under this Act, the Minister may by order declare that such provisions of such Act or order shall not apply in or in relation to the City, and upon such order being made the provisions specified therein of such Act or order shall not apply in or in relation to the City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Where it appears to the Minister that any local, personal or <Col N="1822" /> private Act or any order relating to any of the coastal urban districts and in force at the passing of this Act contains provisions which are inconsistent with or rendered unnecessary by or adequately replaced by provisions made by or under this Act, the Minister may by order declare that such provisions of such Act or order shall not apply in or in relation to the Borough, and upon such order being made the provisions specified therein of such Act or order shall not apply in or in relation to the Borough.</P>
    <P>(3) No order made under this section shall come into force unless and until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been approved by resolution of each such House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am asking the House to take all together as they practically deal with the one matter.  Section 101 is a section which gives the Minister power by Order to modify or adapt or apply all Private Bills, Local Bills and Orders affecting the different parts of the areas which now become the new city and the different parts of the coastal borough.  The section gave the Minister power by Order to deal with these Private Bills and Orders.  That power was objected to on the grounds that it was legislation by the Department or by the Minister. The section contains a sub-section which only gave the House power during 21 days after the Order was laid by the Minister on the Table of the House to object to the Order. By a majority the House decided that that was going too far, if I may put it that way.  I was not present when the amendment was carried, when the Bill was in Committee.  It occurred to me that a distinction might be made between the sub-sections. Sub-section (2) of the section as it stands is the one that gives the Minister power by Order to adapt or modify any private, personal or local Act or Order relating to the existing city or coastal borough which may be necessary for carrying this Bill into effect.  The same sub-section also gives him power to apply to the <Col N="1823" /> whole city or the whole coastal area private, personal or local Acts or Orders which apply to any part of what will become the whole city or the whole coastal borough area.  To that extent there is a precedent for what the Bill did.  That is to say, we have already gone so far as to give the Minister power to adapt, modify or to apply.  There is a precedent for that.  There is a great deal to be said for what the Minister told us when the Bill was in Committee, that if we insist on this House giving its approval to every Order that the Minister makes, it will cause an extremely large amount of unnecessary trouble to his Department. Whether or not we were right in giving up the principle that there should be no legislation by a Department or by a Minister, we have already done so, and probably there is a very fair excuse for it, because in the complicated questions that arise in a case like this it would be practically impossible to carry on the work if the Minister had not in fact power to make an Order.</P>
    <P>When we come to (3) and (4) of this section we find that they are on a totally different basis; (3) and (4) give the Minister power to declare that certain kinds of local or private Acts shall not apply to the whole City or to the coastal borough. In other words, it gives the Minister power to repeal Acts of Parliament. That is going beyond what any Bill has done before.  I suggest that we ought not to allow the Minister to go to that extent.  Therefore I have put down four amendments. The first three of them provide that the Minister's Orders, which are purely Orders to modify, adapt or apply these private Bills, shall only come before the House in the shape of Papers laid before the House and they are not to be disallowed unless there is an order of the House to annul them within 21 days.  In reference to the orders which the Minister has to make under (3) and (4), amendment 19d provides that <Col N="1824" /> orders of that kind must not only be laid on the Table of the House, but that before they come into operation at all they must receive the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I move that these subsections be deleted.  The four amendments in my name carry out this, and I will therefore move them separately.  I move to delete sub-section (3) of Section 101.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the amendment has to be seconded, and I therefore beg to second it.  I hope the Minister will agree to, and that the House will adopt, the suggestion made by Senator Brown.  I think some of us, though we voted for the amendment proposed on the last occasion, were impressed by the argument of the Minister that a very large mass of details would have to come before the House in the case of the adaptation of a considerable number of private Acts.  By the way, I may say that there seems to have been a good deal of misunderstanding as to the meaning of the words &ldquo;private Acts.&rdquo;  The term &ldquo;private Acts&rdquo; does not mean private Acts of an individual.  It means Acts of the respective local bodies which were passed by Parliament as a result of the Private Bill procedure of Parliament in England and possibly in a few cases here.  The only Acts that can be adapted are Acts which relate to the City or the area covered by the Bill.  The adapting of the several Acts, which means the adjustment of a particular area, is not to my mind a matter which would require the time of Parliament or require a lot of explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The repealing of a whole Act is the matter we are up against in principle.  We have given the Minister power by Order, in the one case, laid on the Table of the House, which could be annulled by the House within twenty-one sitting days.  In the other case, to ask for a definite resolution appears to meet fairly the case made by the Minister on the one hand and by the House on the other.  I think it should be made perfectly clear at the same time that in neither case are we <Col N="1825" /> legislating by resolution as has been the practice on the other side.  In both cases the power of the Oireachtas is clearly maintained.  We know that the passing of a definite resolution might take up a good deal of the time of the Minister.  We know that where there is any resolution required it will be moved, but we know that no resolution will be moved unless some member of the council thinks it has a grievance and he will get a member of the Seanad to move the resolution.  I think that is right in the case of adapting actual Acts which apply to the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that this is a matter to which the Seanad on more than one occasion has given a certain amount of thought.  As far as the amendment of Senator Brown goes, if I could get the amendment with a certain amount of good will I would be certainly glad to have some modification of the position as it is at present, although I do not know that this will be the last word that will be said in regard to the whole matter at this particular stage. It will give me certainly a sufficient latitude to carry on without the very considerable amount of rather unnecessary detail and trouble involved for myself personally and for the Seanad and the Dáil under the other arrangement suggested.  I would be grateful to have the amendment which the Senator has moved as a contribution to this whole question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one thing that I think might be said in view of the Senator's criticism of the original proposal and in view of the criticism in which some Senators indulged on the Committee Stage.  Senator Sir John Keane, Senator Colonel Moore, Senator Comyn and Senator Johnson, I think, on a previous occasion all referred to a particular book written by the Lord Chief Justice of England.  Senator Sir John Keane said that taking into consideration his responsibilities and the fact that he went to the trouble of writing a book on this matter he must have thought very gravely about it.  The Senator was very drastic in his criticism of the Government <Col N="1826" /> and I was forced by the impression which his speech made on my mind to look up this book and to go through it.  It is a complete justification, as far as I could gather anything from it, of our procedure in this whole matter.  I think the Senator will find that one of the complaints in the book referred to was that in not one per cent. of the legislation in the British Houses of Parliament do they make provision for the laying of these Orders by the Minister on the Table of the House. I think that in practically every case &mdash;with the exception of the Cork Bill, if I might mention it&mdash;that is the practice with us.  There have been cases in which a prior resolution had to be adopted, but there was always something separate there.</P>
    <P>The general lines of criticism in that book, so far as I could understand them, were that Ministers in the British House of Commons are enabled to issue Orders behind the back of Parliament and that they are able to make decisions that are withdrawn from review and control by the courts.  Our provisions as they were originally drafted enabled the Minister to make Orders but the Dáil and Seanad had power within twenty-one subsequent sitting days to annul these Orders.  These Orders were certainly not doing the work behind the back of Parliament.  They were fully open to revision by the courts if the Orders went outside the very limited powers that were given the Minister&mdash;that is, to make Orders inside the limits and for the purpose of carrying out the particular Act that was involved.  We should not, I think, be driven along the unnecessary, laborious and not very logical line of thinking of what other people say about one another without knowing what they do say about one another.  We can more satisfactorily solve our own problems by looking into them themselves and bringing our own minds to bear on them.  It seems to me that that is not a thing that has been done upon this general question up to the present. Again I might say in regard to this particular amendment that I am <Col N="1827" /> grateful to have it as an alternative to what is now in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I attempted to make clear in regard to the amendment that was carried on the last occasion that it was perhaps a crude amendment.  I am very glad to have the amendment suggested in the more finished form by Senator Brown now.  I just want to reply to one assertion of the Minister. He coupled me with Senator Sir John Keane and others in having quoted in support of this particular line of criticism the Lord Chief Justice of England.  I have been rather careful not to do that.  I might have made mention of the fact that similar criticisms have been levelled at the British practice, and to a much greater degree than here, but I have recognised, and I publicly stated it in the House, that there was necessity for the Minister having power to modify and adapt certain classes of legislation.  I have never gone so far as to think that the criticism levelled by Lord Justice Hewart was applicable to this country.  I think it must be clear to the House when we are giving the Minister power, as is proposed in the Bill, to amend and to annul the effect of a private Act, so far as it may affect the City and borough, that that is legislative power which surely the Oireachtas should retain for itself.  That is all I contend, and I do not think it is true to say, as it has been said, that all the criticisms levelled against certain recent British practices are justifiably levelled against practices in this country.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should take advantage of this stage to deal with a couple of questions which I wish to raise.  A year ago, on a similar Bill, I put forward certain suggestions to the Minister to which he promised to give consideration.  I want to be more precise now because, although consideration may have been given them, an answer was not forthcoming.  It is, perhaps, a rather small question, but it is well it should be on record that there is certain tabulated information which has been made available to certain Committees, mainly, I think, the Economic Committee, and that is at the disposal of a certain number of members of the Dáil and, perhaps, of the Seanad, which is regarded as nominally confidential.  I asked whether it would be possible for the Minister to secure the publication of that information for the benefit generally of Senators, Deputies, and the public.  I will give the Minister a list of certain documents, of which <Col N="1832" /> I have copies and which, without divulging the authority, I have used, which I think ought to be made public.  I do not think that there is any privacy about them.</P>
      <P>One is a table containing a computation of capital invested outside Saorstát Eireann by persons resident in Saorstát Eireann and not resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland. The next deals with the computation of capital invested in Saorstát Eireann by non-residents.  The third table is a summary of external trade for 1927-8 or for a later year, if such information is available.  The next deals with the annual consumption of the principal foodstuffs by persons in Saorstát Eireann.  The next is the estimated quantities and values of food consumed by livestock in Saorstát Eireann in 1926-7. The next document gives the food values in calories per acre of the principal farm crops.  The next table deals with the number of persons who could be maintained for a year on the average produce of 100 acres growing the principal crops of the United Kingdom.  These tables were presented for the consideration of the Economic Committee.  There are other tables of public importance which, I think, were presented to other committees, and I am anxious that the Minister should release for public use the information contained in these tables and such other similar information as he can, without divulging anything of a confidential nature.  The more precise the information of this kind that is available the better equipped we shall be to carry on the business for which we were appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister to give consideration to the position of civil servants in respect to their periodical revisions of salary by way of fall or rise in bonus.  There is a fairly general belief, when one sees the figure 75 as the cost of living index. and when one sees that a civil servant is paid a certain basic salary, plus the cost of living bonus, that the full amount of the cost of living index figure is added to the standard basic salary or wages of the <Col N="1833" /> civil servant.  That is not correct, and if one takes the trouble to examine the Book of Estimates, page 3, it will be seen how the bonus is calculated.  It is important we should realise that there is a very considerable gap between what is commonly believed and what are the facts.  When a civil servant has a basic salary of 35/- per week, the full amount of the bonus based upon the cost of living index figure is added, but above that up to £200 per year only 60 per cent. is added.  The plea which I make is that that practice should be modified, that the facts of life should be taken into consideration, and that the full bonus should be added within a much higher range of salaries than is the case at present. I take, for illustration, the position of a civil servant with a basic salary of 35/- per week.  On an index figure of 75 he receives 26/3 bonus, making his salary 61/3.  If he has a basic salary of 50/- a week the bonus is 31/5, making the salary 81/5.  It is not true, if one makes a calculation, to say that the bonus on the 50/- is the full bonus and that such a man gets the equivalent of the increase in the cost of living added to his salary.</P>
    <P>The effect of this practice is that, as the cost of living index figure is falling, the position of such civil servant is gradually being debased, and that is especially true if he is a civil servant living in Dublin.  We know that a very big proportion of civil servants live in Dublin, and have all the conveniences as well as the inconveniences, especially the monetary ones, of residence in the city.  The cost of living index figure is based on certain calculations which I think are, in the main, quite accurate for the purpose of arriving at an index of relative prices, but unfortunately in their working out they bring, in my opinion, injustice to civil servants living in the city.  For instance, in the case of a man receiving £3 a week, including bonus, there is a kind of assumption, within the bonus calculation, that his rental will not be more than 3s. 3d. per <Col N="1834" /> week, and that if he is receiving £4 a week the rental in his case will be about 4s. 4d.  That is obviously not in accordance with fact, and, as the fall comes in bonus, his actual earnings are reduced, and his relative position is much worse than the public generally imagine.  The plea which I am making to the Minister, and which I ask the Seanad to support, is that there should be a suspension of the reductions in salaries at this stage, that there should be something like stabilisation of civil service salaries, pending a thorough inquiry into the incidence and the method of application of these bonuses.  It is correct to say, I think, that in the fairly analogous cases of bank clerks there has been agreement that below 75 there shall be no further reductions, while most of us know that there has been a suspension of reductions of salaries in Great Britain pending the Government Inquiry which is being held as to the effect of the bonus system and the general position of civil servants in Great Britain.  If the fall in cost of living which is anticipated by many&mdash;due to fall in food and commodity prices&mdash;were shown in the actual household budget of the civil servant, one might say that the case I am making is not a very strong one. If one could see a steady decline in the household expenditure of the civil servant by virtue of the fall in the cost of living index figure, then the case might be somewhat weak. But the experience of anybody will prove that in respect of a very great proportion of the civil servants&mdash; those who live in Dublin, and especially those who have come into Dublin since the establishment of the Saorstát&mdash;their household expenditure does not decline in accordance with the cost of living index figure.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when a reduction takes place in the index figure a reduction takes place in the salaries, and because of the reduction in the cost of living index figure the civil servant is actually debased in his standards. I think it is unwise that the minds of civil servants should be affected by <Col N="1835" /> the feeling that their earnings are steadily declining.  Civil servants are recruited with a genuine expectation that there will be annual increments, but the effect of the downward tendency in the cost-of-living index figure is to annul the expected annual increments and that along with other things is causing a considerable amount of misgiving and dissatisfaction in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I am making the plea that at this stage there ought to be a promise given by the Ministry that the earnings of civil servants will be stabilised for the time being, that there should be a full inquiry into the incidence of this bonus system and how it affects the Civil Service in general, and that such an enquiry should be in accordance with the practice in industries; that is to say, that there should be some collaboration and consultation with the parties who will be affected by the result of the enquiry.  I mean that bodies of civil servants who have made representations seeking to be heard by the Minister on this and cognate matters, should have a genuine opportunity to make their case to the Minister and have their grievances discussed.  I do not want to go into details about the difference between the civil servants who are represented on what is known as the Representative Council and the great majority who are not represented thereon, but there should be an opportunity given to the civil servants who are not represented on the Representative Council to be heard by the Minister on this and other matters.  I hope that it will be possible for the Minister to give a sympathetic reply to this request.  It is not proposed that there should be any increase in the charge upon State funds by this action.  The utmost that is suggested is that for the present a possible decline in the amount paid will be averted.  But the matter is of great importance. Many thousands of people are affected and I think the Minister realises that there is an amount of unrest and dissatisfaction, not due to the agitations of a few but to real <Col N="1836" /> dissatisfaction with the application of the bonus method, especially in regard to the smaller incomes and such dissatisfaction is not healthy.</P>
    <P>The only logical reply that I think can be made to this plea is that it the cost of living index figure came down to the 1914 figure, the basic salary, all would be well.  I do not know what the Minister's view may be, but I think it will be generally admitted that in the class of citizens who constitute the Civil Service there has been a raising of living standards, and that it is not thinkable, even though the cost of living index figure fell to 100, the original standard, the rate of salary would come down to the basic.  I do not know whether the Minister has an idea in his mind that those basic salaries would be sufficient if the cost of living figure came down to the 1914 figure.  I hope he does not take that view, and if he does not then it seems to me that there can be no justification for the continuance of the present cost of living bonus calculation, because it can be shown.  I think conclusively, that 35/- a week is not the whole of the household income which is spent upon necessaries or upon that class of article which went into the family budget upon which the original cost of living index figure was based. Thirty-five shillings a week will not suffice to provide a family with the commodities that are required and which are affected by the cost of living index figure.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will agree that there has to be a point at which there will be stabilisation.  I am asking that he should agree that that point has been reached now, at least pending a further enquiry into this whole question, and that he will agree to institute such an enquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise a matter that has been very much discussed in the country.  It was discussed lately in the newspapers and in the Dáil, and was raised very indirectly in the Seanad.  It is a matter of great importance, concerning the sum of £50,000 of public money. <Col N="1837" /> In 1924 an Act was passed called the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, the object of which was to give loans to industrial concerns in this country that were likely to succeed&mdash;a very proper purpose.  A company called the Industrial Trust Company of Ireland was started, with which the Government came in touch in 1926.  Large sums were being invested in this Company, and the Government asked leave to allocate £50,000 to it as part of its capital. I think another £50,000 was taken up by an American group, and about £50,000&mdash;or it might have been £100,000&mdash;was put in by other people and by the banks in this country. The matter is one of considerable importance, and as nobody knows what the actual position is, I am now asking for information about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The articles of association of this Company give a list of powers covering an immense field of action in Ireland and elsewhere.  The capital was stated to be £250,000. When the matter came up in the Dáil the President stated that the directors of the Company at that time were David Telford, James Douglas, W. Lombard Murphy, Hugh Kennedy and John Mackie.  He also stated that the powers of the Company covered practically every industrial and speculative investment that could possibly be made, either in Ireland or elsewhere, and he summarised them in the following way: Underwriting, financing investment of all kinds, lending and borrowing, banking trust, guarantee, title business, management, promotion, purchase and sale of companies, undertaking properties and other businesses, and brokerage, agency and commission business.  That is a summary of their extensive powers, and the President himself stated that one of them covered half a page of foolscap.  &ldquo;The main object, however,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is to help to finance industrial and commercial undertakings in the Saorstát, and in particular to make loans, the service of which has been guaranteed by the Government under the Trade Loans Act.&rdquo; I do not suppose that anybody <Col N="1838" /> would be likely to object to that, but it is very questionable if it was wise to hand over all these extensive powers to a company which had power to go to the London Stock Exchange and invest in practically anything that they liked.  Apparently they had that power from the articles of association, and I am afraid that they actually availed of it.</P>
    <P>The question was whether £50,000 of the nation's money should be invested in a company with such powers, and the Government, very properly, nominated two persons of integrity to represent it as directors. I presume this was entirely a commercial concern and did not affect to be a Government concern, that the Government were only concerned in so far as there was £50,000 of theirs invested in it.  I presume the two directors were on the board, so that the Government could be informed if anything went wrong, or if wrong things were being done.  Not very much was heard about this Company at least by me, until lately, when it turned out that it had got into serious trouble, having lost money both in Ireland and abroad.  In the Dáil the Minister admitted that there had been serious losses&mdash;that there had been losses in the Free State but that those losses were not comparable with the losses abroad.  I do not criticise them on account of any losses that happened in the Free State through reasonably investing to help industries, even though they may not have been very wise, because the object was good, and because investments may often go wrong, but the question is: Was it right and proper to lose large sums of money on the London Stock Exchange?</P>
    <P>The Minister gave some sort of explanation of that.  He said particularly that it was clearly understood that the money was not to be limited to gilt-edged securities, but he stated that the securities ought to have been proper industrial securities. That was a very likely and a very reasonable thing to do, because there was the large sum of £250,000 <Col N="1839" /> available, which very likely could not be properly and wisely placed in Ireland straight away, and something had to be done to use the money.  If it had been placed in proper industrial or other securities it would not really have been so very bad, although I think that such public money should only have been invested in trustee or gilt-edged securities, and I do not think it was at all wise or right to go beyond that.  However, if they did go beyond that it ought to have been put into proper industrial securities, as the Minister himself stated the other day.</P>
    <P>There are a good many things in connection with this matter that I do not know and about which I would be glad to get information; in fact, my whole object is to get information. Mr. Smith Gordon was managing director of this Company, and he has now left it and gone to England.  That has been stated, and I do not know whether it is true or not.  If it is, I think we ought to know why he left.  The Minister gave a reason why this money should be invested in England.  He said that that should be done in order that some reserve fund should be created, that the capital should be increased by speculation, or by using it on the Stock Exchange, in order to create a large reserve fund for the Company.  That would seem to lead to some difficult questions. He said that this money ought only to have been put into thoroughly safe industrial concerns, but everyone knows that fortunes cannot be made out of safe industrial concerns. You may make 5, 6, 7 or 8 per cent. in that way, but you will not earn very large sums; you can only hope to obtain good interest. But if the money was to be used as he suggested&mdash;in order to create a large reserve for the Company&mdash;that could only be done by betting and speculation&mdash;by risky methods.  It might succeed, but whether it succeeded or not, I believe that it would be utterly and entirely wrong.  No matter what would be lost or gained <Col N="1840" /> I think it would be entirely wrong to employ a person on the London Stock Exchange to buy up all sorts of non-industrial securities and lose large sums of money.  How the Company could make a large fortune unless it did speculate I do not know.  As the Minister said, large sums have been lost.</P>
    <P>At first, there was some gain and then heavy losses, as generally happens in such cases.  The directors may have done this and the articles of association might show that they had a perfect right to do so, but one of the directors might probably tell the Minister: &ldquo;There are wild speculations going on for which we cannot be responsible and we think it wise to advise you in the matter.&rdquo; The object of these things originally as stated by various Ministers was that by constructing various associations in Ireland the Irish people might be induced to put money into different concerns.  It seems to me the result has been exactly the opposite.  Every year money has been lost over the trade loans and since lots of money has been lost over this Trust people will be all the more shy about putting their money in.  It was stated by Ministers at various times that the fact that Ministers were taking, at all events, a neutral part in these schemes would give courage to people.  A great many people speculated in these.  The Minister stated in the Dáil that some of these securities which have fallen may go up again; possibly they may.  He did not seem to be very clear about it himself.  These are times when all these securities are sinking rather than going up so I am afraid it is very doubtful whether they will get right again.  Possibly all this money may be lost.  I maintain it is entirely wrong to use public money in speculating on the London Stock Exchange. If it is lost in trying to do good for the country there is something to be said for it but when they go off to make money on the London Stock Exchange I think they are taking a risky action which ought not to be taken by any Minister for Finance who wishes to act properly <Col N="1841" /> in this country.  I would like to suggest that some public investigation be made of the state of this company in which such a large sum of Irish money has been placed.  The Minister is not fond of investigations of any sort, but I suggest that he would be wise in inquiring into this matter and letting us know how it stands.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask a question about income tax.  I suppose all Senators know that if you are looking for a refund owing to the Statute of Limitations you cannot go back beyond six years.  At present the Revenue Commissioners are asking people to go back as far as twenty years.  In some cases they are going back to the time when people started in business.  I need not tell you that balance sheets going back twenty years cost a fair amount of money.  A friend of mine some time ago got a balance sheet made out and he told me that it cost something like £170.  At a time like this when business is quiet, the only people making anything out of business are the auditors and the accountants.  Between the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister they are making a very rich harvest.  I would like to know from the Minister is there going to be any finality in this matter.  Most people in my line of business who are overburdened with taxation find it very hard to pay their way.  At present they are being asked to furnish statements going back twenty years.  A great many hard cases have been pointed out in the other House of where people even lost their lives over this thing.  This thing has been overdone.  People who have made a few pounds have had it taken from them either by the Revenue Commissioners or the accountants who made up long statements.  Very few Senators here remember what happened ten or fifteen years ago or how they spent, say, £20 fifteen years ago.  If you have to employ auditors and accountants to go into these matters you have to pay those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Labour Party are <Col N="1842" /> glad to know that the staffs are making a very rich harvest.  The Minister ought to come along and see if a stop could be put to this thing.  If you appeal from the Revenue inspector you go up before these people in the Castle.  I do not think you need expect a whole lot when you go up there.  They are there for one purpose.  They have to earn their money.  They are out to get it and they will have it even in the case of bankrupts.  You can see that these even are prosecuted.  You have seen the ease of a wine merchant some time ago who was made bankrupt through income tax.</P>

What I wish to obtain is a comprehensive figure embracing not only the amount guaranteed under the Trade Loans Guarantee Acts but also the £50,000 paid for shares in the Industrial Trust Company, the additional liability (if any) resulting to the State from the issue last year of the £200,000 Debentures of the Industrial Trust Company and any other items of a similar kind arising by way of actual payment or of guarantee.  I should be glad if, in particular, the Minister would explain the position in respect of the Industrial Trust Debentures as many people are under the impression that their issue involved prejudice to the State.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise one point with regard to Vote 66&mdash;offices of our representatives abroad.  I am only referring in this case to the office of the High Commissioner in London.  I would ask the Minister if it is not possible to have some more decent equipment for the sake of the good name of the country than is to be found in that <Col N="1843" /> office.  Some few months ago I had occasion with two other public people to call to the office in London.  We were unable to see the Commissioner because he was engaged but we were shown into what I presume is the best waiting room there, where representatives from other countries wait when they call on the Commissioner. I can only say that I never saw a meaner advertisement for a country than that waiting room.  It had all the appearance of decay and bankruptcy. For a start outside you had a commissionaire who from his general make up and bearing might have stepped out from the pages of Charles Lever.  There was nothing of the smartness which one would expect in the foreign office of a nation.  The furniture was distinctly secondhand.  The rickety table too was of a very mean and cheap character, plastered with ink.  The legs of the table had made very large holes through a very cheap carpet of an ancient pattern.  There was a small quantity of notepaper.  We investigated in order to see how the place was fitted out.  There was a little notepaper but there were no envelopes; there were ink bottles without ink and there were pens that could not write.  The chairs and one old sofa were such as you would expect to see in a secondhand shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at least two people in Dublin who can prove all I say.  We felt thoroughly ashamed that this was the room into which Irish people coming from America or other countries would be shown and into which the representatives of other countries, visiting the High Commissioner on trade matters, would be invited.  This was the very room in which people would have time to look around and observe things.  I imagined that there would have been an Irish carpet and Irish-made furniture, or, at least, decent furniture made in England.  I expected there would be a few Irish pictures on the walls&mdash;perhaps some samples of the work of Irish painters, or at least some sort of decent pictures.  I thought there would be writing <Col N="1844" /> facilities supplied for people who might be anxious to write and that there would be a proper supply of literature.  There were a couple of dog-cared publications that might have been handled for weeks by coal porters.  There was nothing of the businesslike equipment that one would expect in a place like that; there was just that atmosphere that one would meet with in a second-rate business establishment.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the inner sanctum was like.  It may have been a bit better.  In my opinion the outer offices are much more important than the inner offices from the public point of view.  It is in the outer offices that a person has time to make observations.  After all, the London office, from the point of view of trade, is our most important foreign office.  If it is a question of finance it is very unwise economy.  Somebody recently said that making goods and not advertising them was like kissing hands to a girl in the dark.  Advertising badly and cheaply, as we are doing, is much worse than no advertisement at all.  This is a matter in which the Minister should make available the necessary funds in order to put the office in a decent position and not leave it as it is today, with the appearance of being the office of an absolutely bankrupt country.</P>

      <P>May I call the attention of the Minister to No. 50?</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £57,216 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1931, for Expenses of Reformatory and Industrial Schools, including Places of Detention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amount is gradually creeping up, and every year it becomes greater and greater.  Looking up an old book of estimates I observe that it is almost four times what it was in former years.  In 1919, when prices were at the peak, when everything <Col N="1845" /> was at the highest, the State at the period gave a temporary increase of 5/- a week for each child, provided the local authorities did the same.  The local authorities fully realised that prices were extraordinarily high at the time.  Now, although the rate of living has gone down&mdash;and that is generally agreed &mdash;this sum is still being paid.  The sum of £57,216 paid for the maintenance of these institutions is not all that they require.  There is added to that the local grant, and I think that is 5/-, and the State pays 7/6. I hope that something will be done to reduce the cost, because 12/6 a week for each child is entirely out of proportion to what a child costs in its own home, even a well-looked-after child.  Workmen's children are mostly in those schools, and in very few workmen's homes does the maintenance of the average child cost 12/6.  For boarded-out children at present the average payment is 5/- or 6/- a week.  They are looked after in their homes for that amount, with a very small allowance for clothes.  This amount of 12/6 seems out of all proportion to the upkeep of the same class of children in any part of the State.  I think that amount might now be reduced.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to No. 19&mdash; Salaries and Expenses of the Tariff Commission&mdash;merely for the purpose of asking him if there is any possibility of a speedy decision by the Commission on the question of duty on horse-drawn vehicles, or if there will be any alteration of the tariff on private cars.  The matter is one of very grave concern to the coach-building trade and to the workers engaged in that trade.  I think most of them have reached the point when for good or ill they would like a decision, so that they may resolve whether it is worth while continuing or going out of business altogether. I would like the Minister to give us an indication as to when that decision may be expected.  This matter has been pending a considerable time, and if there is to be no modification of the existing tariff in one <Col N="1846" /> respect, and if no tariff is going on in the other, then at least we in the business will know where we are. There is a considerable amount of unemployment in this trade.  Many of the skilled workers have already left.  So far as I can see, the dumping of horse-drawn vehicles continues to the extent that it is impossible for an Irish coach factory to remain operative.  Second-hand vehicles are being dumped consistently from the other side, and the industry is in a very bad way.  A number of concerns are carrying on in the hope that something may be done.  If there is not, they will have to adjust themselves in some way to meet existing conditions, but at least some definite decision on the matter ought be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not remember what happened in regard to the question of the tables to which Senator Johnson referred.  With regard to the bonus question I do not think I could undertake to alter the position with regard to the bonus.  To allow the bonus to stand when the cost of living index figure has fallen would be equivalent to raising the salaries or wages of civil servants.  I do not think we could agree to that. Senator Johnson will remember that as a result of the different weighting in the compilation of our cost of living index figure civil servants, since the establishment of the Saorstát, have been actually in receipt of higher sums than they would have been if they remained under the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally our index figure has been ten points higher than the British figure, the increase being mainly, if not entirely due&mdash;at any rate five points of the difference&mdash; to the conditions that obtained here when our index was established. In some cases the full effect of the fall represented by that index figure may not reach the civil servant, but I think in the majority of cases it does, very nearly if not quite to the full.  If the index figure were to <Col N="1847" /> fall to zero, instead of being 175 or 180 and we were to get back to 100, I think before that point was reached a review would have to take place, but we see no possibility of such a sensational decline taking place.  But in any decline that is likely to take place, we do not see there is any need to alter the present arrangement.  I have no means of knowing why the fall in the cost of living was not given effect to in England but so far as we are concerned our figures are still above theirs, and we do not see any reason for interfering with the normal operation and the normal effect of the present system.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson is aware of the agitation that existed for the abolition of the bonus.  That agitation did not mean a consolidation of the bonus with the basic salary.  It meant simply wiping away the bonus.  Of course, to have done anything like that would not only be unjust but would have been utterly impossible.  It would have left the salary scales at a point at which it would have been impossible for those earning the salaries to live on them. On the other hand, while civil servants have had the advantage in the bonus of any seasonal increases which have taken place or, of increases that were the result of market fluctuations I think if there is going to be any decrease following the index figure they must bear it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the points raised by Senators Moore and Hooper with regard to the Trade Loans Act, Senator Hooper gave me notice that he was going to raise the question. I got out certain figures, but unfortunately I cannot find them amongst my papers.  I think the total amount guaranteed under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act was about £330,000.  Part of that money was advanced by the Industrial Trust Company and part by other banks and other organisations.  So far as the Industrial Trust Company itself is concerned, the total liability of <Col N="1848" /> the Government in respect of that Company is the £50,000 which was invested in shares.  The issue of debentures by the Industrial Trust Company did not impose any liability on the State or the Exchequer and did not prejudicially affect the interest of the State or the Exchequer in the form of the £50,000 held in shares.  The Company was established under the Companies Act in the ordinary way, the only difference being that a State investment was made.  The directors were chosen because they were men of competence and integrity and were allowed to carry on the Company. The object of having Government directors was simply that there should be means of directing the Company's attention continually to Irish business when proper Irish business arose.  It was not with any idea that the Minister for Finance, or the Government, should intervene in the business of the Company.  I think that any attempt to do that would have been absurd, but when the Department of Industry and Commerce, or any other Department of the Government, came into touch with any Irish concern which seemed to be a concern which might properly be helped by the Industrial Trust Company, we wished to have the means of directing the attention of the Industrial Trust Company to that concern.  Unfortunately, very few cases arose in which it was suitable to direct the attention of the Industrial Trust Company to Irish concerns.  In fact, in some cases in which the Industrial Trust Company did invest in Irish concerns there were losses.  As regards other losses that were made by the Company they were very unfortunate.</P>
    <P>From every point of view it is to be regretted that these losses occurred, but there is no use in trying to pillory the directors of the Company. No good will be done by attempting to do that.  Everybody knows that the difference between the operation of any business by civil servants and the operation of business by business men is that the civil servant is not allowed to take <Col N="1849" /> risks.  The civil servant passes a minute on to another civil servant, and the latter writes a letter to another department, and so the thing goes on, until everybody is covered and there is very little danger of loss; but the opportunity of doing business, if it is an ordinary business concern, has passed away. On the other hand, business men have to take risks.  No business man, I think, ever made money who did not lose money at times.  No business man ever made money who did not take the sort of risk that the civil servant is prevented from taking.  It was intended that this Company should operate as a business concern. Business men were appointed as directors, and so far as we were concerned they were given their head.  They had the misfortune to make losses.  Many people engaged in similar business at the same time made losses, perhaps losses as heavy proportionately as this Company made.  In the case of a business man who is the director of an ordinary company which makes losses there is no one to hold him up to obloquy. There may be stormy scenes at a shareholders' meeting occasionally, but there is nobody, at any rate, to make attacks and hold him up as a person who has thoroughly misbehaved himself or anything in that nature.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, rather than in the Seanad, attempts have been made to suggest that some sort of investigation should be held into the conduct of the directors of this Company, and so forth.  If attacks of that sort are to be made, the result of it will be that no business man of any standing, no good business man with any respect for himself will go into any company or have anything to do with any company, corporation or concern with which the Government is associated, because it may mean that the fact of Government association will simply enable somebody who would not have the grounds or would not have the courage to do it outside, to rise in the Dáil or Seanad, as the case may be, and because of the protection they have there from the law of libel and <Col N="1850" /> slander, to say anything they like about that man.  I am satisfied that if he were to pursue the policy of carrying on long debates here on concerns of this character, the only effect would be to make it impossible, if we wanted to do anything of the same sort or of a similar sort in the future, to get anybody who would take part in it.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in the Dáil, the people who were directors of this Company were people of integrity and ability and business experience. You cannot have the State while either promoting or assisting in the promotion of business concerns expecting them to be run in a businesslike way.  Anything run in a businesslike way is going to be run in a way that involves a possibility of loss.  If there is to be no possibility of loss, and if it is to be run in a Civil Service way, which is entirely different, it certainly will not be effective in doing what is called business, because it is too slow.  Opportunities are bound to slip away, and good proposals will never be taken up if you have things done in a Civil Service way owing to the extreme difficulty of getting them through. As a matter of fact, when any big thing was done by the State we have almost always had to scrap the regular machinery and Ministers had to come in and take the risk.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Shannon scheme, if Ministers had not come in and taken the risk that scheme would never have gone through.  It never would have gone through if it had to be dealt with by civil servants examining everything with the detail that the ordinary routine of the Service requires and making sure that there was no possibility at all of anything going wrong.  I have nothing more to say about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that was so.  Money of the Company was invested in shares which, of course, fell.  Senator Kennedy spoke <Col N="1851" /> about the income tax position.  I take leave to doubt that people are being asked to furnish balance sheets for twenty years back.  There have been, undoubtedly, many cases in which people have been asked to furnish statements for several years past, but I do not think they were asked to furnish balance sheets since 1914.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to income tax is as I explained in the Dáil, that where a man has been, up to date, defrauding the revenue by making false returns or by concealment of his income he renders himself liable to penalties.  The Revenue Commissioners, instead of proceeding for penalties, can make arrangements with the defaulting taxpayer, but in order to make arrangements with the defaulting taxpayer they must know what is the amount of revenue of which he defrauded the State.  A man who only succeeded in retaining a very small sum might be liable to the same penalties as a man who kept back a very much greater sum, and accordingly, in order to know what penalty shall be imposed, it is necessary that the Revenue Commissioners should ascertain what a particular individual has actually kept back from the State.  The rule is that if a man's business will bear it they get as much of the tax as he kept back, plus a small fine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is established very clearly.  Further, as I said in the Dáil, the policy is that no matter what a man owes there should not be taken from him an amount that would put him out of business.  A man who owed £15,000 tax might have only £5,000 taken from him if to take more would leave him without working capital to carry on his business.  The Senator referred to a particular case of a firm of wine merchants.  The only thing wrong with the revenue procedure in that particular case was that they did not go hard for <Col N="1852" /> the tax soon enough.  If they had not listened to various excuses from the firm but had taken proceedings for the tax they would have got in before he became a bankrupt, and the Commissioners would not have come in for a great deal of criticism which was entirely undeserved, and which resulted from incorrect and ex parte statements in court.  The Revenue Commissioners should have been criticised, not for harshness in that particular case, but really for undue leniency, if I am referring to the same case as the Senator has in mind.  I do not want to mention names.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister for External Affairs was in the House and heard Senator O'Farrell's remarks about the High Commissioner's Office in London.  I do not know what was done when the High Commissioner's Office was established.  It was established a long time ago.  But certainly the policy in regard to the legations which have been established recently is to furnish them with Irish-made furniture and generally to make them an advertisement for the country.</P>
      <P>Senator Mrs. Wyse Power raised a question as to industrial schools. I have not the figures before me, but I certainly doubt that the figures given by the Senator were entirely correct.  It seems to me that the figures for the industrial schools are unlikely to be as high as the Senator mentioned.  I am not talking about a lump sum.  I am talking of the amount per child.  For instance, I know there were many cases in which there was extreme difficulty in obtaining any sums at all from the local authorities.  I remember a case in which it was impossible for the industrial schools to obtain any amount at all from the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now with regard to horse-drawn vehicles and the application on their behalf to the Tariff Commission, the report is very nearly ready.  I do not know exactly just how long it will be before we get it, but it is in a very definite state of preparation, and when that report is received by the Government it will be considered <Col N="1853" /> immediately and such action as may be necessary will be taken.</P>
    <P>I have indicated in the Dáil that if there is a unanimous and positive report the Dáil will be summoned before the end of the Recess to deal with it, and if there is a unanimous negative report it will be published. If there is a division among the Commissioners the matter will be considered by the Government as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>With reference to Senator O'Farrell's remarks about the High Commissioner's office in London, I was wondering whether he or I was seeing things.  He talked about the state of the Commissioner's office.  He said there were holes in the old and worn carpets, the rooms were untidy, there was no writing paper, and that there were pens that would not write.  I have written letters there.  I have been in the office more recently than Senator O'Farrell.  I happened to establish that office, and I purchased the furniture for it.  I was there at the institution of the office, and I was there not later than Monday of this week, so I have the latest and the earliest information about it.  I went to the office without an appointment, so that the place could not have been prepared for me.  I <Col N="1854" /> walked into the waiting room, and, to pass away the time while waiting for the Commissioner, I wrote a letter.  There was a pen that would write, and writing paper.  There is a room being used at the moment as a waiting room which is not the proper waiting room, but it is quite a good room for the purpose for which it was intended.  The waiting room proper is one of the best show rooms that any High Commissioner's office can boast of, and I do not think that there is a stick of furniture in the room that is not of Irish manufacture. There were examples taken from pretty well every firm manufacturing here, including that of one of the greatest craftsmen in the country.  One of the rooms was taken over later by the Trade Commissioner, as it suited his business to be at the end of the passage.  The other is used by the High Commissioner at the moment, because rebuilding operations are going on at the back of the building, and the noise is so dreadful that any person doing business with the High Commissioner could hardly be heard.  Hence the Commissioner moved from that room.  The office looks a bit dingy, but there is a point at which we can get rid of the lease.  We are considering the advisability of changing premises, and it would be absurd to repaper and repaint the place if we are going to leave within some months.  While admitting that certain rooms are in occupation for purposes for which they were not intended, most of what Senator O'Farrell said about the worst of the rooms is more imaginative than true.

      <P>The question which I asked last week, and to which the Minister said he would reply on the Appropriation Bill, had reference to disputes with other nations, as to the action taken by us as against that taken by the other members of the Commonwealth. South Africa said that finally we would find ourselves in a court where there was no defender. The Minister, in explaining this in <Col N="1855" /> the Dáil, said that though we had signed without any reservation we would take every possible step to make agreement before we went to the court, but it seems to me that if we cannot settle without going to court we will find ourselves going to a court which has no power to call the defendant before it.  If we had a working agreement with people most in touch&mdash;possibly there is one coming along&mdash;I feel there would be no question of disputes not being settled.  I think we might quite easily have a dispute with Canada or South Africa on the question of emigration.  I regret to have to ask the Minister to traverse ground he has already gone over, but this is a matter of some importance, and I feel sure there is a reasonable explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by the Senator on a previous occasion, and to some extent made today, was summed up in the phrase which he read from South Africa. Both Canada and South Africa declared that although they thought disputes were justiciable as between various members of the Commonwealth at the International Court as a matter of policy they would not go to that Court.  The Senator asked what would happen in the event of the Irish Free State, which had signed without any reservation whatever, having a dispute with Canada, which signed with that reservation.  What, he asked, was the good of our going to court if we could not bring the other party?  The answer takes a variety of forms.  First, the Canadians and South Africans declared, as a matter of policy, they would not take certain classes of disputes to the Court.  I am not sure that they would not allow individual cases to go to the Court which would fall within the jurisdiction of that Court. They have declared there is a justiciable value in that Court which will fall for further consideration afterwards.  As to whether the reservation of the Canadians and South Africans is legal in effect, that <Col N="1856" /> will have to be decided by the International Court.  Despite the reservation, there is a resort to the Court even if it is only on a point of the Court's jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I put it again that if the Senators examine the type of reservation allowed and the conditions which may be imposed, they apply only to a certain number of things, and certain categories of things were declared to be matters for the Court, and States could agree to go on one, two or all of those categories.  They might reserve on the question of reciprocity and for a period of years, and it is doubtful whether any other reservation on the face of the Article is possible.  I contended previously, and I contend again, and I have also the opinions of people not merely here but on the Continent most conversant with League matters, that the reservation made by Canada and South Africa is not a reservation within the terms of the Optional Clause itself.  As to the other matters, those who have read the report of the recent Conference of the Dominions will notice that a suggestion was put forward as to a Commonwealth Court, and the Conference simply wrote down the point of view that it was considered a further exploration of this matter was desirable.  That is all that was said about it.  It has advantages in some ways, and, it may have disadvantages. A great deal would depend on the composition of the Court suggested, but the whole matter is <i>sub judice</i> and I do not want to go into it.  On the net point raised, there is a reservation.  If that reservation is sound, our signing without reservation is of no avail.  If it is unsound, their attempt to put in that reservation is of no avail against us.</P>

      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of asking the Minister what is his policy towards civil aviation.  The position is this: There is an expenditure at present roughly of £80,000 yearly for army flying. There is no money being expended on civil aviation.  In nearly every other <Col N="1857" /> country the army, instead of leaving its pilots in a blind alley, passes them into the civil air service, and in time of war these men are available, as they have been kept in training. This country, in spite of the fact that there is no endowment of the air services, has produced the finest airmen, as witness that the only two successful crossings of the Atlantic from east to west were helped by Irishmen.  The only Irish civil aviation club is the Irish Aero Club, which, up to this, has had one machine available.  That machine is no longer available, and only for the bounty of one of its members it would not exist.  In every other country there is not only endowment for civil aviation, but there are arrangements whereby military aviators become pilots of civil machines. In the service from Buenos Aires to Valparaiso, the longest air service in the world, and in the different South American Republics, there are military pilots.  We do not ask much, only enough to employ a wholetime teacher, because behind this lies far more than would be generally supposed. It may seem when at the moment aviation is at the mercy of the elements that it is an extravagant form of sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important point: if within a certain time between now and the date of the Imperial Conference we do not stake our claim to approach Croydon, Croydon can declare Ireland part of the Imperial Airways.  That is to say, England can do what the London, Midland and Scottish did to the Dublin Steam Packet Company.  The policy of Croydon is safety first, with the result that there is practically no approach from England to Ireland. The safety first scheme has made it impossible to get from Croydon to Dublin except at a cost of £98.  If you do not stake a claim with some sort of Irish service it will be impossible for us to go out of Ireland to the Continent.  In return for allowing our machines to use Croydon for a jumping off place for the rest of the world we only ask the Croydon people for permission to fly over <Col N="1858" /> from Ireland.  The next parish from the West of Ireland is New York.  I think we can get a better bargain if we offer Croydon the advantage of that in return for the facility of reaching the Continent by air.  That opportunity will terminate in September. It is rather urgent that some form of arrangement should be made, and some endowment given so that we can say the civil air service exists.  Otherwise we will be shut out from the Continent as we are shut out in the ocean in ships.  That is the reason I ask the Minister to give the matter his attention, and not because I am a member of the Aero Club.</P>
    <P>Ireland ought to have access to the rest of the world by air, and considering that Irishmen have succeeded so well in the two great flights from east to west, where France and England and other countries went down, I think it is only fair that some encouragement should be given to aviation in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Civil aviation has been getting a lot of attention, and the result is that we have taken over certain duties under the International Aviation Act, and certain regulations have been made in accordance with that.  I am carrying on through the agency of the Army service in one respect with regard to regulations.  The matter of a subsidy for the Irish Aero Club was definitely brought forward, and I had hoped before the Estimates were passed that we would have arrived at a decision, but there is no subsidy at the moment.  I hope to bring the matter forward again, and perhaps with favourable results.  It has not been dropped.  The difficulty about civil aviation in this country is that there does not seem to be any public demand for air services, certainly not such a public demand as would warrant the spending of any money on it.  If money can be saved from another Vote and could, with successful results be applied to civil aviation it will be done, but that is <Col N="1859" /> the only avenue of approach to a subsidy for civil aviation.</P>

      <P>By way of personal explanation, lest the House may think I had been drawing on my imagination, as the Minister said, I have to repeat that I had two responsible persons with me on my visit to the London office.  One was an assistant secretary to one of the departments, and his language in regard to the office was very much stronger than I would attempt to use here.  The Minister claimed that he furnished the office, but if that is the best he can do in the way of furnishing I would hate to live in a house he would furnish.</P>
