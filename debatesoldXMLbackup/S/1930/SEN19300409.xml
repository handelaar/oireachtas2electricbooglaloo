      <P>Before taking the business on the Order Paper, I desire to say that there are very strong reasons why the Report Stage of the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Bill, 1929 (item 4 on the Order Paper) should not be considered to-day but should be postponed. Section 3 of the Bill (which deals with the crucial question of in camera) has been carefully examined from the legal point of view by the Minister, Senator Brown and others, and it is common ground that the legal position needs to be much more carefully explored and that, if the principle of holding the proceedings in camera is to be effective, a new section or sections will have to be drafted.  The matter is still under consideration, and, as there is no particular hurry about the Bill, the best thing to do will be for the House to postpone the Report Stage until a later date&mdash;say the first meeting after the Easter Recess.</P>

      <P>In support of what the Cathaoirleach has said, I desire to say that the position is this: when the Bill left the Dáil there was a provision in it that applications under it should be heard in camera, and giving power for limited publication. The latter provision was struck out in this House on the motion of Senator O'Farrell.  As the Bill stands at present you simply have the declaration that these applications are to be heard in camera, but there is nothing in it to prevent publication. Publication of the proceedings in the District Court would, <Col N="894" /> therefore, not be punishable as contempt of court.  As the Bill stands there is no penalty clause in it.  Personally I very much object to hearings in camera.  At the same time, I am very anxious that no Bill should leave this House without being an effective Bill.  If the Bill is to provide for hearings in camera, then I think we should take the necessary steps to see that it be effective.</P>

      <P>I agree with the course outlined by the Cathaoirleach and Senator Brown.  This is a question that bristles with difficulties. On the last occasion the Minister for Justice pointed out some of the difficulties.  I agree that the matters involved should be carefully considered so that the House may produce an effective Bill.</P>

      <P>I think that if the House were prepared to recommit the Bill it would be much more satisfactory. The Bill, I think, requires a good deal of discussion on small details.  Such discussion is strictly not in order on Report.  I think that substantial agreement could be reached, and what is mainly required achieved, if the Bill could be taken again in Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasToal" hpid="Mr. Toal Mr. Toal">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Title.  To delete in lines 10-12 the words &ldquo;and now belong by virtue of Article 11 of the Constitution to Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My principal reason in moving in this matter is to preserve, if possible, the rights which local bodies had under the various Acts leading up to the passing of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923.  Under those Acts they had the right to sell.  We are advised that Article 11 of the Constitution does not take away that right from them. By Section 34 of the Poor Relief Act, 1838, workhouses were vested in the Poor Law Commissioners in trust for the purposes for which they were then applicable&mdash;that is, in trust for the relief of the poor.  Section 40 of the same Act authorised the Poor Law Commissioners to sell and convey workhouses no longer needed and to apply the purchase money, either in the purchase or building of another workhouse or in such manner as the Poor Law Commissioners should think advisable for the benefit of the Union.</P>
      <P>We feel very strongly on this matter. We are advised that Article 11 of the Constitution does not, or should not, take away from local bodies the rights given to them, rights embodied in different Acts of Parliament.  We feel that it is a great injustice that local bodies should be compelled to keep and maintain in a state of repair workhouses that are no longer in use and which can never be turned into any useful purpose.  Many of them at the moment are an eye-sore on the face of the country.  They are white elephants on the hands of local authorities.  In the case of people anxious to start an industry in a district they might be inclined to take these buildings if they could buy them out, but they would certainly not lease them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators know, it is almost impossible to turn these old workhouses to any useful purpose.  In <Col N="896" /> the county that I represent we have four workhouses.  One of them is the County Home.  That is all right, because it is being suitably utilised. In the case of the Carrickmacross workhouse, one wing of it is set for the carrying on of a little industry, but the other portion of the building is becoming dilapidated.  The County Council is called upon to keep that building in repair.  It is obliged to do that whether or not the revenue derived from these buildings is sufficient to bear the cost of repairs.  We have another workhouse at Clones. A small portion of it is set at a rent, but the amount of money derived in that way is not sufficient to keep the building in repair.  No one would take one of these buildings on lease for the purpose of starting industries in them, but there are plenty of people who would be prepared to buy them out for such a purpose if the local body had the power to sell. In the case of the Monaghan workhouse, some local associations entered into negotiations with the Minister for Local Government behind the backs of the local bodies. The local bodies do not know the exact terms of the arrangement that was entered into.  I think if the Government hold the view that Article 11 of the Constitution governs this matter, then they must repeal Section 8 of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923.  That section empowers the Minister to sell and to hold the proceeds in trust &ldquo;for any purpose for which the land, etc., could have been used or applied by law under the county scheme or otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a great difference of opinion as to whether the provisions of Article 11 of the Constitution apply at all in this matter.  The County Council obtained counsel's opinion on the matter.  I will read an extract from his opinion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It seems to me that only the property of the State generally is within the Article and that the Article was not intended to cover and should not be extended to cover property held by a department of State in trust for special purposes in a local area.  I consider <Col N="897" /> the words &ldquo;subject to any trust then existing&rdquo; in Article 11 may be held to preserve the trust in favour of the Union.</P>
    <P>That is the opinion of a very able member of the Bar.  He has advised the Monaghan County Council that it is quite possible that a different interpretation can be put on Article 11 of the Constitution to that put on it by the Government.  He goes further and says that if the county council were prepared to test the matter in Court the chances are that the Court may hold with his view. We have no desire to have the case brought into the Courts, but we have a very strong desire to maintain the rights given to us under several of the old Acts.  We feel that it is a great injustice to us in the County Monaghan that we should be obliged to maintain and keep in a state of repair a number of these old workhouses from which we are not able to draw sufficient revenue to bear the cost of their repair.  The Minister may tell me that we have power to lease them for a period of 99 years. I do not think that is the proper way of dealing with them.  Under the old Acts the local body had the power to sell and we maintain that that right should still be preserved to us.</P>

      <P>I am quite prepared to move the four amendments together. The three remaining amendments are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>2.&mdash;Section 2.  To delete all from the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 37 to the end of the section.</P>
      <P>3.&mdash;Section 3, sub-section (1). Before the word &ldquo;lease&rdquo; in line 41 to insert the word &ldquo;sale.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>4.&mdash;Section 3, sub-section (1). Before paragraph (a) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) sell such land.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I desire to support the amendments moved by Senator Toal.  There is no doubt that it is a hardship on local bodies to be compelled, as the Bill proposes to compel them, to keep these old workhouses in repair.  If these workhouses could be sold at the present time it is probable that buyers could be got for them.  All that can be done with them at present is to lease them, and no one will take a lease of them.  If they were sold the county council or the urban council, as the case might be, would get rates out of them. The position at the present time is that the county council or the board of health must keep them in repair. There are three or four of these workhouses in the County Monaghan. The chimneys on them are falling down, the windows are falling in, and the roofs are nearly half off.  These buildings are never going to be of any use.  It seems to me that to compel local bodies to spend money putting new chimneys on these institutions and repairing the windows every time they fall in is a waste of public money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister is replying I would be glad if he would deal with the question whether this amendment, if inserted, would do what Senator Toal requires. I think this has been rather a vexed question for quite a considerable time, whether buildings of this kind properly come under Article 11 of the Constitution.  I gathered that it was counsel's opinion that it was not intended that these buildings should come under Article 11.  I am sure counsel is right, but unfortunately what we have to consider it not what was intended but what is held to be the legal effect of that Article.  It would probably be an exceedingly good thing if the county council were to take this matter to the courts and ascertain definitely whether these workhouses do come under Article 11 or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that if the Seanad were to agree with the first amendment moved by Senator Toal, the Act would then apply only to property <Col N="899" /> which does come under Article 11.  If the Seanad were to delete from the Bill the words in the amendment, then the Act would apply to property that does not come under Article 11.  That, I think, would possibly be defeating the object that Senator Toal has in view. I think it would be far better to leave the words in.  I agree entirely with what Senator Toal wants to achieve and I think it is perfectly reasonable.  Still I think it would be better to leave the words in and have challenged definitely in the courts the issue, whether these buildings do or do not come under Article 11 of the Constitution.  I think that is the only way to deal with the matter.  I would like to have the Minister's opinion as to whether, if amendment 1 were carried, it would defeat the object which the Senator has in view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter in connection with these old workhouses that I would like to deal with.  Local authorities have been held responsible for the upkeep and repair of them as well as for the payment of their caretakers.  While that is so, the claim is made that the Department of Local Government really owns these workhouses.  The point that I want information on is this: In the event of these workhouses being sold, would the money derived as a result of the sale be credited to the local authorities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is right that the money derived from the leasing of these buildings should go to the local authorities, why, in the event of their being sold, would not the capital value of them also go to the local authorities in whose area they are situate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Without committing <Col N="900" /> myself on that point, I will just say this: If at any time the Constitution were so amended, and legislation introduced, as to enable workhouses to be sold, then I cannot very well imagine the money going to any place or to any purpose except the purpose for which workhouses were originally provided.  I should say that the moneys accruing out of the workhouses in that way ought to go for the purpose of poor relief inside the area in which the workhouses are situate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was a question of taking certain property in the area of a particular board of guardians and removing to a central place, then complete responsibility for poor relief over the whole area was pooled, and to that extent the property taken did go to the relief of the people for whom it was originally intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very strongly opposed to the sale of any Government property, and particularly land.  I am strongly against giving any Government the right to make sales of this kind.  We do not know what Government may come in at any time.  A Government with all sorts of fancy ideas might come in at some time or another.  They might like to sell a piece of the Phoenix Park or the Curragh, which are now Government property and cannot be sold.  If sales of that kind were permitted they could not be gone back on afterwards.  Therefore, a Government that succeeded the one that had consented to the sales might resent the action of their predecessors and feel very much the loss of the property that had been disposed of.  I agree that it is very hard to expect the local bodies to be put to the expense of keeping these workhouses in repair when no use is <Col N="901" /> being made of them.  But I think they ought to be used for some purpose. If alterations were carried out in them they could be utilised for providing housing accommodation for the people.  Many Senators are aware that an old military barrack near the Phoenix Park is now occupied by quite a large number of poor people.  Alterations were carried out in it and accommodation provided for many families.  The same thing, I think, could be done in the case of many of these workhouses.</P>
      <P>I would not like to give general authority to any Minister to sell public property of this sort.  The fact that a certain lawyer, as the Senator has told us, has given it as his opinion that it is possible that some other meaning might be given to the wording of the Constitution than that given to it by the Government does not mean much.  You could get another lawyer who would give you quite a different opinion. If you were to go on in that way it would only result in a nice job for the lawyers.  What I object to is that land, especially, and large buildings should be sold and put out of the reach and control of the people of the country.  There is authority already to lease these buildings for 99 years.  In fact, there are houses in Dublin let for 99 years or for a lesser period.  I think that ought to be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to support Senator Moore in the statement which he has made with reference to the alienation of public lands.  The worst thing that could possibly be done is to permit alienation of public lands.  That is a matter which is as clear in constitutional history as any other question.  It leads to corruption wherever it has been permitted. The thing was so bad that there had to be a special prohibition against the absolute alienation of public lands.  That is the reason why in all cases where property is vested in the public the only way in which you can get any right to it is by lease, sometimes in the case of the foreshore of a lease for twenty-one years, <Col N="902" /> and sometimes for ninety-nine years, but the absolute out-and-out alienation of lands is, as experience has proved, one of the worst things that could be done.  The four amendments are to be taken together.  I do not differ from the opinion which has been expressed by the lawyer who was consulted by Senator Toal. I have had occasion to go rather closely into that Article of the Constitution. I think there are a great many loopholes in that Article.</P>
      <P>Whether the opinion Senator Toal has quoted is accurate or not I think, if this Bill is passed in its present form you will have a statutory declaration as to the meaning of the Article of the Constitution, because not alone have you in the Title of the Bill a statement that the lands by virtue of Article 11 of the Constitution belong to Saorstát Eireann, but you have in Section 2 an enactment that these lands now by virtue of Article 11 of the Constitution belong to Saorstát Eireann.  Therefore if the Act is passed in its present form it is immaterial what opinion is given, because any Court hereafter will be bound to decide upon the construction of Article 11 that these workhouses are vested in the State.  I think these words ought to be deleted, but at the same time I agree with Senator Moore that we ought not to allow an out-and-out sale of public lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I take note of the fact that this is the Report Stage of the Bill, and, therefore, it is presumed the Seanad has already agreed to the principle of the Bill itself.  I cannot see that the desire of Senator Toal, which is, I presume, to give effect to the opinion of counsel, is going to be effected by the passing of these amendments. Senator Comyn may be right, that this Act will be a declaration that workhouses now vested in the Local Government Department on behalf of local authorities have by the passing of this Act been declared to be vested in the State.  I am not sure whether that is true or not, but I differ with the Senator to this extent, that as a matter of law to the <Col N="903" /> layman it does not appear to me to have that effect at all.  I draw attention to the fact that the Bill, right through, does not mention workhouses&mdash;I am speaking of the Bill and not the Title&mdash;and conceivably there are lands which may be vested in the Local Government Department and which have not workhouses built upon them, and the Bill may refer to such properties as those lands, but in any case, how can the effect desired by the Senator be secured by deleting this reference to Article 11 of the Constitution?  It does not seem to me to follow at all. If the Minister will deal with this point I will be glad.  According to the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may sell, lease or otherwise alienate all or any lands or buildings which are or shall at any time be vested in him in trust for any body abolished by any county scheme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If it is thought necessary to have a declaratory Act to make it clear that all these lands and properties which are being held by the Department in trust for local bodies are being brought within Article 11 of the Constitution it seems to me that there should be a clearer and more definite indication by an amendment of the Constitution, if necessary, or by a formal Act declaring that these things are vested in the Department, and not allow them to come in by a possible inference and be subject to dispute as between lawyer and lawyer.  If the present Bill is intended to correct the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, it is the wrong way to go about it.  Perhaps the Minister would say whether his intention is to repeal Section 8 of the Local Government Act, 1923?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WalterNugentBart" hpid="Sir Walter Nugent Sir Walter Nugent">
      <NameTxt>Sir Walter Nugent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear what it is the mover of the amendment wants to accomplish. I do not share the view of Senator Comyn that it would be a dangerous thing to alienate property which was not wanted for the purposes of workhouses. I do not see any object in <Col N="904" /> retaining workhouses or any other property not required.  I am in favour of alienating such property and making something out of it, which is not being done at present. We have had too many workhouses and the cost of their administration was too great.  I have always felt that the money spent on them could have been better spent on outdoor relief.  I agree with Senator Johnson that the amendment would not achieve what is wanted.  I understood the Minister to say that under no circumstances would the money acquired from the sale of land be diverted from the local bodies.  If that is the case, then what the Senator wants to have done is achieved by the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir Thomas Esmonde Sir Thomas Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Thomas Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>My sympathy in this matter is altogether with the ratepayers.  There are many disused workhouses throughout the country, and the ratepayers have to bear the cost of their upkeep.  I do not know whether the county councils now are permitted to let disused workhouses, or whether they can sell them.  That is immaterial so far as my argument is concerned.  It seems to me that this Bill can be amended, or another Bill introduced, so as to give the Local Government Department power either to let or sell any disused workhouse or other public building.  I think that would be the way out of the difficulty.  It must be remembered that it was the ratepayers who originally provided the money for these buildings, and I would be inclined to relieve them as far as I could of the expense of their upkeep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the House will not assume there is any declaration in this Bill which will vest property in the State which is not already vested.  The only section which could in any way be construed as a declaration to that effect is Section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This Act applies to all land which immediately before the 6th day of December, 1921, was vested in the Local Government Board for Ireland under or for the purposes of the Poor Relief (Ireland) Acts, 1838 to 1914 and now by <Col N="905" /> virtue of Article 11 of the Constitution belongs to Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That will not make any of these lands on which workhouses were built the property of the State if they were not the property of the State before the Act was passed.  Senator Toal's amendment will raise the question definitely if they proceed to sell, because you could not by virtue of any condition of sale that any lawyer could draw make a man take no title.  The purchaser will raise the title at once, and the question will be decided by the courts, as it ought to be, for this is not the tribunal to decide on the construction of our Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Johnson, this Bill is not intended in any way to repeal Section 8 of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923. The purpose of the Bill is to replace the Minister for Finance by the Minister for Local Government in connection with these lands under the State Lands Act, 1924, and by doing that to do in respect of these lands what the Minister for Finance would be glad to do for other lands for which he is responsible, that is, to make arrangements for short lettings, but the main purpose is to replace the Minister for Finance by the Minister for Local Government in respect of these particular lands. Section 8 of the Temporary Provisions Act was passed on a misunderstanding that these lands did not come under Article 11 of the Constitution, and arising out of the passing of that Section 8 an order was issued by the Department of Local Government instructing how short lettings should be arranged.  In 1924 we were advised by the highest legal authority we could get that Section 8 was <i>ultra vires,</i> and that these lands did come under Article 11 of the Constitution, so that while not directly answering the Senator as to whether this amendment, if put in, would effect what was intended, I will say if this amendment were put in it would be no more operative than Section 8 is operative at present, for it would be against Article 11 of the <Col N="906" /> Constitution, and the highest legal advice on which we rely when framing our legislation is that these lands come under Article 11.</P>
      <P>If the question of workhouses and lands vested in the old Local Government Board is raised it ought to be raised as a separate matter and it would first have to be raised as an amendment to the Constitution, so with that before our minds I think the Seanad will understand there is little use in the amendment.  We do not doubt our own legal advice, but I think it would be inadvisable to put in the amendment at this stage of the Bill, and not only because there is a strong doubt about it, but because it stretches the whole fabric of the State Lands Act, 1924.  This Bill is intended to take the fabric of the State Lands Act of 1924 and substitute the Minister for Local Government for the Minister for Finance.  I hope the Senator will appreciate that we think these lands do come under Article 11 of the Constitution, and we could not make any use of this amendment, even if enshrined in legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister has taken the view he has taken.  I look upon this as a very serious matter.  It is possible if we could get other county councils to join us in the matter that we would take action in the court.  Of course, the Minister must admit that other legal advisers in the State have views different to that which he has quoted.  The Minister is advised by the Attorney-General, and I suppose he is bound to take his advice, but the view of the Attorney-General is only one legal opinion, and we have confidence in the legal opinion we have obtained.  The legal opinion we have received states that at the date of the Constitution the workhouses were vested in the Local Government Board, which had power to sell, and then reference is made to Section 8 of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, where that view is confirmed.  I think it is a great pity that the local bodies have not taken joint action on this matter.  I am surprised the <Col N="907" /> Bill got through the Dáil without this matter being questioned.  Local authorities have workhouses on their hands which they are bound to keep in repair, and they are hampered by an Act of Parliament from making the best use of them.  We are obliged to keep these workhouses, which are only eye-sores, as a reminder to us of evil days.  However, I do not wish to press this matter to a division.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;10.&mdash;(1)  Where an application is made, before or within <Col N="908" /> twelve months after the commencement of this Act, for the registration of any premises in a register of slaughtering premises and the Minister is not satisfied that such premises comply with the general conditions of cleanliness and suitability of slaughtering premises or the appropriate particular conditions of suitability of slaughtering premises the Minister may, if he so thinks fit, provisionally register such premises in such register for such period not exceeding twelve months as he shall think proper and shall specify at the time of such registration.</P>
    <P>(2)  Premises provisionally registered under this section in a register of slaughtering premises shall, while they continue to be so registered, be deemed for all the purposes of this Act to be registered in such register in accordance with this Act and this Act shall apply to and have effect in relation to such premises accordingly.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where any premises are provisionally registered under this section in a register of slaughtering premises and the Minister, before the expiration of the period for which such premises were so registered, is satisfied that such premises have been brought into compliance with the general conditions of cleanliness and suitability of slaughtering premises and the appropriate particular conditions of suitability of slaughtering premises, he may, before the expiration of the said period, confirm such provisional registration, and thereupon such premises shall become and be registered in such register as fully in all respects as if they had, on the date of such provisional registration, been registered in such register under this Part of this Act other than this section.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where any premises are provisionally registered under this section in a register of slaughtering <Col N="909" /> premises and such provisional registration is not confirmed under this section before the expiration of the period for which such premises were so registered, such premises shall, at the expiration of the said period, cease to be registered in, and shall be removed from such register and shall not again be provisionally registered under this section in such register.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment, which is a Government amendment, speaks for itself.  It is deemed to meet the case where, if an inspector considers slaughtering premises not up to the standard for a licence, the Minister may provisionally give a licence for a specified time so as to allow the premises to be put into proper order.</P>

      <P>New section.  Before Section 16 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;16.&mdash;(1)  Where owing to special circumstances existing at the time the Minister considers it desirable so to do, he may grant to any person, to whom he could under this Part of this Act grant an exporter's licence to export fresh meat and offals of a particular kind, a permit (in this section referred to as an exporter's permit) to export fresh meat and offals of that kind during such period not exceeding one month as the Minister shall think proper and shall specify in such permit.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every exporter's permit to export fresh meat and offals of a particular kind shall during the period for which it is granted be deemed for all the purposes of this Act save as otherwise expressly provided to be an exporter's licence to export fresh meat and offals of that kind and this Act shall apply to and have effect in relation to such exporter's permit accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> (3)  Section 12 (which relates to fees on exporter's licences) of this Act shall not apply in relation to an exporter's permit.</P>
    <P>(4)  There shall be paid in respect of every exporter's permit by the holder thereof at the expiration of such permit a fee (in this section referred to as the permit fee) computed by multiplying the appropriate sum as defined by rule 2 of the Schedule to this Act by the number of animals presented under such permit to a veterinary examiner for examination during the period for which such permit was granted, and for the purpose of such computation sub-rule (3) of rule 4 of the Schedule to this Act shall apply in like manner as it applies for the purposes of that rule.</P>
    <P>(5)  As soon as may be after the expiration of an exporter's permit the Minister shall ascertain and certify the amount of the permit fee payable in respect of such permit and shall issue a certificate (in this section referred to as a certificate of indebtedness) in the prescribed form certifying the person by whom such fee is payable and the amount of such fee.</P>
    <P>(6)  Every certificate of indebtedness shall be conclusive evidence of all matters purported to be certified therein and any document purporting to be a certificate of indebtedness issued under this section shall, on production thereof in any proceedings to recover the amount thereby certified to be payable, be deemed until the contrary is proved to be a certificate of indebtedness duly issued under this section and shall be admitted in evidence accordingly.</P>
    <P>(7)  As soon as may be after the issue of a certificate of indebtedness a copy thereof shall be served by post on the person thereby certified as liable to pay the fee the subject thereof and immediately upon such service the amount certified by such certificate as payable by such person <Col N="911" /> shall become and be payable by such person to the Minister and shall, after the expiration of four weeks from such service, be recoverable by the Minister as a civil debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This new section proposes to give the Minister further powers in addition to those he already possesses. Under the Bill, the Minister has power to grant ordinary licences to export, and also under Section 41 to grant special licences.  The object of this new section is to meet a situation that may arise if for any reason there should be an embargo on the export of live stock due, for instance, to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.  No matter what care may be taken an outbreak may occur, and there is always the possibility that the export of live cattle may be held up for some weeks. There are a number of cattle exporters who buy cattle each week in the Dublin cattle market in order to supply their customers in England. In the past, when an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease occurred and live cattle could not be shipped they were able to have the cattle killed in Dublin and to keep their customers supplied.  If the Bill is passed as it stands, these exporters would not be able to send their cattle across, as it would not be worth their while to take out an ordinary licence under the circumstances, but if the new section is inserted the Minister would be able to give a special permit to ship for the time being.  I do not believe that it will ever be necessary for the Minister to exercise his powers under this new section, but it is well to be prepared for any eventuality that may arise.</P>

      <P>Section 24.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Every regulation for the preparation of fresh meat made by the Minister in regard to the matters specified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of sub-section (1) of this section shall provide&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> (a)  that every animal, except swine, shall be instantaneously slaughtered or shall by stunning be instantaneously rendered in sensible to pain until death supervenes, and that such slaughtering or stunning shall be effected by means of a mechanically-operated instrument in proper repair and of a type approved by the Minister, and operated by a male person of the age of eighteen years or upwards who is, in the opinion of the Minister, a fit and proper person to operate such instrument:</P>
    <P>(b)  that all animals, including swine, penned or assembled for slaughter shall be kept in a place so separated from the slaughterhouse or place of slaughter that they are not able to see any animal slaughtered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amended form of the amendment which I moved and subsequently withdrew on the Committee Stage, for the purpose of making the use of the humane killer compulsory for the slaughter of animals except swine in slaughterhouses licensed in connection with the export trade.  The first part of the amendment is a verbatim copy of the provision in the Scottish Act dealing with the same question, but I omitted swine although I am informed that swine are sometimes killed by a humane killer of a smaller form than that used in the case of cattle.  The second part of the amendment is merely a provision to prevent one animal witnessing another being slaughtered.  It is quite simple to have a small partition or other obstacle erected which will prevent one animal seeing another animal being slaughtered, if the people in charge of the slaughterhouses so desire.  These slaughterhouses, one would imagine, are to be well-equipped and properly supervised and consequently this provision should offer no difficulty whatever.  Of course, I realise that this amendment would only cover a limited number of slaughterhouses, but I think a commencement <Col N="914" /> should be made, and I hope these provisions will eventually be included in a Bill which will be introduced making the use of the humane killer compulsory in all slaughterhouses.  The instrument most favoured at the present time is one which fires a captive bolt which penetrates into the brain of the animal causing instant death or insensibility and is returned to the instrument from which it is fired by a spring attachment.  It is perfectly safe and requires little or no previous experience.  The instrument is simply placed at the exact spot on the forehead of the animal which does not know what is going to happen, and the pressure of the trigger ensures instant death.  As against that there are one hundred to one chances of the pole-axe doing all sorts of things, the man missing the blow, the axe itself being ineffective, or the man being inexpert in its use. It has been argued by various people that the pole-axe in the hands of an expert is just as humane and as satisfactory as the humane killer. Even if we grant that contention the question might be asked: when does a man slaughtering cattle become an expert?  Only after considerable experience. Experience of what?  Experience on the living animal which is endowed by nature with all the capacity for pain and terror with which human nature itself is endowed.</P>
    <P>Even when a man does become an expert as a killer the landing of the axe on the exact spot is affected by different considerations&mdash;the state of his nerves at a particular time, the state of his liver, and the state of his general health.  Any of these things may make an expert a non-expert on certain occasions.  There is no such thing as a changeless expert, a man who never misses, any more than there is such a thing as an expert golfer.  There is nothing like taking the views of people who are themselves experts in these matters.  Here is what the late superintendent of the Carlisle public slaughterhouses, with twenty-three years' experience of the use of the humane killer, says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> I have little patience with those of my trade who state that the pole-axe and other methods are not the producers of immense suffering.  If the battering to death of an animal, the knocking out of an eye, the driving of the pole-axe into the nostrils and other parts of the head through a misdirected blow, the breaking away of an animal from the slaughterhouse after having been struck with the axe, sheep lying with three of their legs tightly bound within sight of their companions slaughtered, the jumping off the crutch, as some sheep do, when a youth attempts to stick it with a blunt knife, the hanging up of calves by hind legs till they bleed to death&mdash;if these things are not suffering then tell me what really is.  These sights are not tales of the past, but present-day realities.</P>
    <P>That is the view of a man who had twenty-three years' experience as a superintendent of the public slaughterhouses in Carlisle.  Here is what he says about the humane killer:</P>
    <P>Having given you these facts may I state my candid opinion of the humane killer?  With the use of these all this suffering among these tens of thousands of animals is swept away.  My experience is that these instruments save much time and remove all pain.</P>
    <P>The humane killer is in operation in Northern Ireland.  Its use is compulsory there and we hear no complaints about any hardship or any undue expense being inflicted on anybody.  Its use is compulsory in Scotland, in Germany, in Sweden, in Switzerland and many other countries. Although it is not universally compulsory in England, the Local Government Board some years ago promulgated a model bye-law known as Bye-law &ldquo;9 B,&rdquo; which is now issued by the Ministry of Health and can be adopted by local authorities that so desire.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" /> A person shall not in a slaughterhouse proceed to slaughter any animal until the same shall have been effectively stunned and such stunning shall ... be effected with a mechanically-operated instrument suitable and sufficient for the purpose.</P>
    <P>That bye-law has been put in force by about 60 of the principal local authorities in England, including the London County Council.  The London County Council, in a recent report, state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It appears to us that in comparison with other methods of stunning, the greater reliability of mechanically-operated instruments as the means of rendering animals, large and small, insensitive to pain has been satisfactorily demonstrated.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Admiralty set up a Committee of Inquiry to consider the humane slaughtering of animals, and it recommended:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That no man should be permitted to use the pole-axe on a living animal until he has gone through a thorough course of training, firstly upon a dummy animal, and then upon dead bodies.</P>
    <P>Anyone with any knowledge of slaughterhouses knows that butchers undergo no such training, that they start on the living animal and that it is only after mutilating scores of animals they can in any sense of the word claim to be experts.  Then having become so-called experts they are open to all the chances that are applicable to human nature, where so much depends on the conditions, such as health.  Defending the pole-axe as against the humane killer is tantamount to defending the executioner's axe of the Middle Ages as against the guillotine and the electric chair of the present day. There are 148 slaughterhouses in and around Dublin, and a fairly good proportion of them&mdash;forty&mdash; voluntarily use the humane killer. They display notices stating that only the humane killer is used by <Col N="917" /> them, and I am informed that they have secured numerous new customers as a result.  Doubtless that is making a commercial use of humane methods, but the fact that it has brought them new customers is a sign that public opinion favours the infliction of the minimum amount of suffering on animals.  I have here a letter from an eminent veterinary surgeon who is an inspector for two local urban district councils, in which he says:</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in pronouncing in favour of the pistol, as being the best method of slaughter and likely to cause the animal less dread, as the swing of the axe and the action of striking causes the beast terror, whereas the pistol can be quietly placed on the right spot on the skull, and as inspector for meat for two urban councils, I have never seen a miss with the pistol, but have with the axe.  I certainly advocate the extension to sheep, for which there is a different pistol.</P>
    <P>I am amazed to hear that the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have indicated that in their opinion it would be undesirable to make this law compulsory at the present time, solely on grounds of diplomacy&mdash;that for the Oireachtas to show certain humane considerations would cause organised opposition to the use of the humane killer, and would make it very difficult to supervise the various slaughterhouses, and that they would much prefer to proceed by the method of peaceful persuasion. If this amendment is turned down the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals will have to accept responsibility for it, after, of course, the people who may vote against it as a result.  I put down this amendment without consultation with anyone and merely from the desire to try to a limited extent to enforce the principle of inflicting no suffering that could be avoided on dumb animals.  I have been approached since by numerous members of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals expressing <Col N="918" /> appreciation of the amendment, giving it their whole-hearted support, and stating that they would approach members of this House to induce them to vote for it.</P>
    <P>In view of that I cannot understand the representations which it is alleged have been made to the Government in regard to the matter, and I hope the House will act with a full sense of responsibility, irrespective of what any society, no matter how admirable it may be, may do.  If the responsible authorities in other countries and in the North of Ireland have not felt that it was impracticable to enforce a law of this kind, I do not see why there should be any such insuperable difficulty here.  I have already had intimation from a representative of the cattle trade here that he will oppose the amendment.  As I said before, that is very largely a development of tradition, as I know having been reared in the country, that to show anything like consideration for a dumb animal is a sign of human weakness, that in order to be considered a strong man you must, to a certain extent, be brutal, be a sort of cave-man, particularly where dumb animals are concerned.  Of course I do not say that that is the general idea in the country.  I could not say that, because I come from the country myself and I would be long sorry to plead guilty to such an idea; but there is a type of man who will defend the most brutal treatment of dumb animals, who will faint if he only cuts his finger, forgetful of the fact that dumb animals are endowed with all the power and capacity for pain and terror that affect human nature.  There is nothing to gain by inflicting hardship, suffering and terror that can be avoided.  I hope the House will be as up-to-date in matters of this kind as the Governments of the other countries I have mentioned.  By enforcing this provision, as far as export slaughterhouses are concerned, we will be making a start to eliminate the brutalising scenes that are to be witnessed in slaughterhouses throughout this country, which are <Col N="919" /> now becoming obsolete because of the development of civilisation and the development of a more intelligent and a more humane point of view. As I said on the last occasion we have imposed a mountain of suffering on brute creation, suffering which presumably is avoidable, and there is no justification, good, bad or indifferent for imposing suffering on dumb animals which we can possibly avoid.</P>

      <P>I wish to oppose the amendment that Senator O'Farrell has so ably lectured us on regarding the humanity that should be exercised in the killing of cattle.  I would be sorry to subscribe to anything that would not be humane.  I have years of experience in the cattle trade and Senator O'Farrell has only heard of it.  I felt, in the course of the model language he used, that he more or less alluded to Senator Counihan and myself.  He could hardly explain why we favoured the pole-axe except that we were brought up in surroundings in which there were cattle which more or less gave a turn to our outlook in that respect.  I can assure the Senator that the greatest cruelty I witnessed occurred not very long ago during the dockers' strike we had at the North Wall.  I never saw as much cruelty as was inflicted on cattle at that time, and I did not hear of anyone coming forward from his section of the community out of motives of humanity to complain of cattle having to be sent away to Belfast and Glasgow and that were destroyed. I have had about 40 years' experience of the use of the pole-axe in the Dublin abattoir and in the Government abattoir on the Curragh, and the missing would not amount to 1 per cent. on the number of cattle killed.  I know of two cases where the pistols misfired and two men were shot dead.  The humane killer was more or less looked upon as being a great source of danger.  Everyone who had experience of it was more satisfied with the <Col N="920" /> pole-axe.  I made inquiries in the butchers' shops in Dublin last week and all those I asked were in favour of discretion being left with them to use the humane killer if they chose and to have no compulsion.  It was stated that beasts are more or less sensitive when about to be killed.  I saw the humane killer in use.  It is an admirable instrument, and personally I would have no great objection to it.  I think it is a first-class instrument and that it does not require expert practice to use it on cattle, but I think it is ridiculous to suggest that it should be used on sheep, lambs, or pigs. That is a ridiculous proposal, as it is not at all suitable for that purpose. Without being disrespectful to a good many of my lady friends who have notions about humanity, I would remind them of what can be seen in the streets of Dublin.  Let them look at the beautiful animals and birds that come from North America and that they use for their adornment.  It is like painting the lily to see how they use furs.  Does it ever occur to them that there is cruelty in that?</P>

      <P>I think they ought to leave humanity out of the matter, and that it is a waste of time to be dealing with it in this way.  People in the trade ought to be allowed to carry on to the best of their ability. I remember my good father teaching me this maxim: &ldquo;An inadvertent step may crush the snail that crawls in the evening on the public path, but humanity forewarned will step aside and let the reptile live.&rdquo;  That was the humanity that was taught to me in my young days.  Many people kill hares and rabbits, and indulge in fox hunting.  That is also cruelty to animals.  I think we should draw the line and let the people who have spent their lives at a business, and who are as interested in the humane killing of animals as anyone else, carry on as they think best.  I saw it stated that the meat of animals slaughtered by the humane killer <Col N="921" /> was kinder than that of the animals slaughtered with the pole-axe.  It is trash to think that it makes any difference.  To come back to the housekeepers, people will say that the best way to kill turkeys is to choke them and that they will then cook better.  That is another mistake. I think these suggestions are ridiculous and that people should be left to do as they wish.  I suggest that the Minister should leave it to the discretion of the trade to use the humane killer or the pole-axe, whichever is in the interests of their business.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to the amendment, not because I am brutal or callous, but because I do not believe there is any more humane method than the pole-axe.  Like Senator O'Connor, I want to take exception to Senator O'Farrell's remarks about those who were opposed to the amendment.  It was said that they were callous and had no consideration for dumb animals. I want to deny that statement, and the Senator should know that he was not stating a fact when he made the assertion.  Senator O'Connor and myself have done more within the last twenty-five years to prevent cruelty to animals at fairs, markets, railway stations and shipping yards than Senator O'Farrell and the Society he represents could ever hope to accomplish.  Something may be said for the use of the humane killer for cattle, but I have not heard any Senator who has any experience of cattle advocate the use of the humane killer in preference to the pole-axe.  They have got that idea because some members of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have canvassed them.  They have put forward a very plausible case, like that put forward by Senator O'Farrell.  But it is only one side of the question. They have not seen the practical side.  I say, as Senator O'Connor has already said, that it is all nonsense. Whatever can be said for the use of the humane killer with cattle nothing can be said for its use on sheep, pigs or little lambs.  Imagine <Col N="922" /> a little lamb being killed by the humane killer when one gash with a knife will cause its death.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Farrell mentioned that a number of slaughterhouses in Dublin have the humane killer in use.  Has he any proof that they use the humane killer?  They use it as an advertisement in order to get customers from members of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  It is a very admirable Society.  I do not want to denounce it in any shape or form, but I think it is going too far in interfering with this business.  I have no axe to grind for the butchers.  I have no connection with them, but as a representative of the cattle trade I am opposed to the amendment. I am instructed to do that by practical men in the trade who are as humane in their outlook as the Senator and the Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no sense in the second part of the amendment.  I disagree with it.  The animals cannot be conscious that they are going to be slaughtered.  It is suggested that pigs and sheep should be screened off and should not be allowed in sight of where cattle are slaughtered. It might inflict unnecessary hardship on the users of slaughterhouses to put up partitions and to carry out such regulations as the amendment proposes.  The only thing that will affect animals is the sight or the smell of blood, which cannot be completely eradicated from slaughterhouses. The smell will remain there, and so will the sight, to some extent, and I cannot see that there is any sense in the second part of the amendment.  If the House agrees to carry out the Senator's wishes&mdash;and I suppose a number of Senators who have been canvassed by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals will&mdash;I would suggest, if the Senator is not satisfied to leave it to the Minister, that an independent expert should be got to decide which is the more humane form of slaughter, and if he is satisfied, a Bill could be introduced making the use of the humane killer compulsory for the whole State.  There is no use <Col N="923" /> in making it compulsory in licensed slaughterhouses where only exported meat will be dealt with.  If the Senator will withdraw the amendment, and if the Minister will give an undertaking to have an inquiry held, I think that would be going a long way to meet those interested in the amendment and, if necessary, legislation could be introduced making the use of the humane killer compulsory for the whole country.</P>

      <P>No, it would not, because this Bill only deals with meat for export, and meat killed here for the Jewish community is not exported. The meat that is killed for the Jewish community in London is killed at Birkenhead, so that this would not affect that meat at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is unlikely.  At present all meat for the Jewish community in London and elsewhere is killed in Birkenhead, and there is no export of Kosher meat at all.  I intervened for this reason: I would like to see this question approached from the proper point of view.  I take it that everybody in the Seanad would agree that there is nothing manly at all in cruelty, and that it should be common cause that it is highly desirable that the killing of every animal should be carried out with the least possible cruelty.  The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is a very energetic and efficient body which has no <Col N="924" /> point of view other than the prevention of cruelty to animals, and I think the Seanad should have before it at this stage their considered views for what they are worth.  I do not say that the Society is infallible, but it is right that at this stage the Seanad should have them, as we got them in a letter.  I had some correspondence with the Society, and they, in fact, invited me to see the humane killer being used in a certain place in Dublin, but I did not accept their invitation, because I have often seen the humane killer and the pole-axe being used here and elsewhere.  I had another letter from Miss Edna Power, the Secretary, dated 3rd April, 1930, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;Referring to my letter to you of 21st ult. and to your reply of the 25th ult., I am desired by my Committee to place before you the reasons why they are at present opposed to compulsory legislation to enforce the universal use of the Cash Captive Bolt Pistol, throughout the Irish Free State when animals are being slaughtered for food.</P>
      <P>The pistol referred to is, of course, the expensive £5 humane killer, with the captive bolt.  There are two classes of humane killer, one which uses an ordinary bullet which enters the animal's head, and the other with a captive bolt which shoots out and comes back.</P>
      <P>Their reasons are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Because any attempt at compulsory legislation would at once arouse organised opposition on the part of the licensed victuallers.</P>
      <P>(2)  Because several hundred inspectors would be required to see that the humane killer was always used; and a check kept on its use by records of the ammunition sold. The cost of this to the State would cause its rejection at once.  It is one thing to pass an Act making a certain thing compulsory and quite another matter to ensure that the law is obeyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The humane killer, like any <Col N="925" /> other weapon, needs to be kept oiled and clean.  Slaughtermen are often careless themselves about doing so, and when the killer fails to work perfectly owing to their own carelessness, the men are apt to throw it aside and revert to the pole-axe.  Our inspector regularly visits every licensed victualler who has bought a humane killer from us and sees that his weapon is in working order; and, if not, either puts it into order himself or we get it done.</P>
    <P>Further, we have means of telling whether a licensed victualler is constantly using his humane killer or not, because we keep a register of the cartridges sold to every owner, and if he fails to purchase cartridges when he ought to require them, our inspector immediately pays him a visit, and if necessary can remove the placard which we supply him with, the display of which in his shop brings him custom.</P>
    <P>In England and Scotland the practical objections to having humane killers made compulsory are almost negligible compared with this company, because in those countries the Swedish killer can be used.  It only costs 19/-, against £5 for the Cash Captive Bolt humane killer in use here, but the Swedish killer requires a cartridge containing a bullet which fits any ordinary revolver, and for this reason we do not believe that the Government here would allow it to be used by butchers all over the country, although a few people such as O'Keeffe, the Dublin knackers, have used it for years and are still doing so.  Further, although the chance of any accident with the Swedish killer is almost negligible, yet, a few years ago a man when using it to kill an animal in England managed in some clumsy way to injure another man standing by.  This accident put many butchers against it, although an accident might not occur in more than one case in a million.  No accident can occur with the Cash Captive Bolt pistol.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" /> When the abattoir in Dublin has been reconstructed, and all the small slaughterhouses closed, then the policy of the Society might possibly change as regards Dublin and suburbs only, where proper inspection could be enforced, but they regard an attempt to force compulsory legislation on the point, to be applied throughout the whole of the Irish Free State immediately, as unwise.  In this matter the policy and advice of this Society, is summed up in <i>Festina lente</i>, and employ persuasion &mdash;not compulsion.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that many of the small butchers throughout the country do not kill enough beasts in the year to make it worth their while to spend even £5 on a Cash Captive Bolt pistol, and if this should go out of order they would need to have a spare one for use until the first one had been repaired. In such cases they would be apt to revert to the use of the pole-axe, which, being only a heavy hammer, is perfectly unbreakable. After a few years, but certainly not now, the Government would probably be able to allow the 19/- Swedish killer to be used, and it is practically unbreakable, but until then compulsory legislation to be applied outside Dublin (and perhaps other cities) is not in our opinion practical politics.</P>

      <P>That may be, but I thought it right that the considered views of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which, as far as I know, is about as efficient a society of the kind as there is in the country, should be known to the Seanad before they come to a conclusion on the matter.  Of course, there is one obvious comment to be made on this letter, and that is, that they do not seem to realise that the proposal here applies only to slaughterhouses which are used for export, and is not to apply to the ordinary butchers.  But at the same <Col N="927" /> time, even with that, there are considerations which show quite clearly and obviously that there is a good deal in this letter which is quite sound.  Take paragraph 2:&mdash;&ldquo;Because several hundred inspectors would be required to see that the humane killer was always used; and a check kept on its use by records of the ammunition sold.  The cost of this to the State would cause its rejection at once.  It is one thing to pass an Act making a certain thing compulsory, and quite another matter to ensure that the law is obeyed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I only quote that section of the letter for the reason that it shows that a great deal of consideration and, if I may say so, of wisdom is behind the point of view of the Society.  One of the points that enthusiasts always forget is that it makes bad worse to pass a law that cannot be efficiently administered, and that will lead to a reaction in the exact opposite direction to that intended.  There is the letter for what it is worth, and I think that the Seanad should advert to it before coming to a decision on the matter. With regard to the amendment, Senator O'Connor made a number of points that cannot be answered and that were quite right.  He said that there was far and away more cruelty in the killing of wild animals and birds in this country than in the killing of cattle and sheep, and cruelty that is participated in by all sorts of respectable people belonging to all sorts of benevolent institutions and that there is not a word about it.  That may be irrelevant, but it is a fact, and there is really no answer to it.  Of course, Senator O'Farrell would answer that it is better to stop cruelty wherever we can, and that that is the business before us now.  Senator O'Connor suggested that there was no great objection to the humane killer for cattle, and I think Senator Counihan more or less agreed with him.  I would suggest to Senator O'Farrell and to the Seanad generally that they should consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment covers cattle and sheep so far as paragraph (a) is concerned, <Col N="928" /> and as far as paragraph (b) is concerned it covers cattle, sheep and pigs&mdash;that is to say, so far as (a) is concerned it provides that both cattle and sheep shall be killed by the humane killer.  It may be that you can enforce with some sort of success the use of the humane killer for the killing of cattle, but I am absolutely satisfied that if you try to enforce it in regard to the killing of sheep you will fail and that you will give rise to a rather bad state of affairs where people, without very good reason, are being forced by law to use an instrument that is unsound and to evade the law with impunity.  It would be very absurd to attempt to slaughter lambs with a humane killer.  I genuinely believe that as lambs and sheep are slaughtered at present they are slaughtered with as little cruelty as it is possible to have in such an operation.  I agree that the cruelty is mainly not in the very act of slaughtering, but the surroundings, the smell of blood, the bringing of the animal into a place where, by instinct, it knows it is going to be killed, and it comes in to a certain limited extent by the use of the pole-axe in unskilled hands, where there is a miss.  I am absolutely certain that you have neither of these present where pigs are concerned, from observations of my own and from conferences I have had with veterinary surgeons and other people. There is never any chance of missing as far as sheep are concerned.  There is in their case nothing like a pole-axe, where a man would hit an eye or a nostril.  I do not believe that sheep advert to or realise what is happening, and I am absolutely certain that pigs do not.  I am certain that when slaughtering is taking place in the presence of pigs they do not advert to it, and I have watched them often in slaughterhouses in different parts of the world, in Chicago and Canada.  In England, Scotland and Ireland pigs are all slaughtered in the one way, and in any slaughterhouse where pigs are killed in the world that I know of there is no other way of slaughtering pigs.  So that you may take it <Col N="929" /> that if you apply paragraph (a) to pigs you will completely upset the whole trade, and needlessly upset it. I am absolutely certain that pigs are put out of pain instantaneously, and that when the operation takes place in the presence of other pigs the other pigs do not advert to it.  If you are used to seeing these animals killed you will see that there is no terror in the case of pigs until the act occurs.  It would be out of the question for pigs, and it would completely dislocate the present trade arrangements.  Equally, I think, it would be to a lesser extent out of the question for swine, and in view of what Senator O'Connor and Senator Counihan said, and of the letter from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which the Seanad should take some cognisance of, I suggest you would be going a long way if you would make the humane killer compulsory for cattle and omit paragraph (b) entirely, because it is not needed.  We have our regulations prepared, and so far as sheep and cattle are concerned one of our regulations is that the slaughter of sheep and cattle shall not take place in the presence of any other animals.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a word in favour of the amendment.  I have had experience for a great many years of cases in the army where animals had to be destroyed&mdash;I think I may say thousands of them&mdash;chiefly horses, oxen and mules.  I have seen every kind of instrument used to destroy these animals, and my experience is that the humane killer is far and away the best.  No suffering is caused to the animal by it, death being instantaneous, and I support Senator O'Farrell's amendment.  At the same time, I think if he would confine himself to cattle in this matter it would meet the case.</P>

      <P>I spoke in favour of the humane killer the last time this Bill was before the House, and I am of the same opinion still but in view of the letter which the Minister has read, and in view of the character of the Minister, whose worst enemy will <Col N="930" /> not deny that when he is convinced that a thing is right neither fear nor favour will prevent him from doing the right thing, I think his suggestion might be accepted.  He has had a good deal of experience and has given the matter great thought, and I think that Senator O'Farrell might agree to the suggestion that he has made.  We are all most anxious to save animals that have to be killed from suffering, and when we consider that the humane killer is compulsory in a country like Scotland, which perhaps leads the world in the matter of the slaughtering of animals, I think we might safely leave it in the hands of the Minister and that he will do what is right. Senator O'Connor referred to one matter on which I would like to challenge him, and that is with regard to the killing of turkeys.  We kill them by dislocating the neck, the quickest and most humane method, in the same manner as human beings are killed by hanging, so that there is no cruelty there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, although I do not say that that is to my credit.  I was not approached by any member of the Society in regard to this until after it was moved, and then only in support of it, so that to that extent it was not inspired; it was simply my own idea, which was a very obvious one, in view of the type of Bill we have before us.  I am very much obliged to the Minister for the manner in which he has dealt with this question.  I think he has approached it from an eminently reasonable point of view and that he has made a very helpful suggestion. The letter from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals which he read was quite obviously written under a misapprehension of the scope of the Bill.  I was speaking to a couple of members of the Society who approached me within <Col N="931" /> the last week, and I had to enlighten them on the fact that this Bill was a Bill that applied to certain slaughterhouses only.  That being the case, the whole argument about the hundreds of inspectors that would be required, the difficulty of enforcing the regulations, and so on, falls to the ground.  For instance, under Section 24 you must have inspection in connection with the following matters in any case:&mdash;The manner in which animals the meat of which is intended for export are to be assembled and penned for slaughter&mdash;that is perpetual supervision; the manner of slaughtering such animals&mdash;that is supervision; the times at which slaughter may take place; the manner of dressing, cleaning, hanging, cooling and weighing fresh meat and offals intended for export; the preservatives (if any) which may be used in fresh meat or offals intended for export; and Section 25 contains a whole series of regulations, all of which will require continuous supervision on the part of Government inspectors, without the acceptance of this amendment at all.</P>
      <P>A breach of any of these would involve penalties, and the introduction of this amendment of mine would only mean that the penalties would also apply in the case of a person who was found guilty of not using the humane killer after it had been made compulsory.  There is always the possibility of the withdrawal of the certificate of registration from a registered slaughterhouse, and that is the very best means of causing the proprietors of these slaughterhouses to use the humane killer.  Everybody has admitted in one form or other that the humane killer is preferable to the pole-axe, that it inflicts less cruelty, that it requires less experience, and that in every respect it should be used if at all possible.  I accept the suggestion of the Minister, with the permission of the House.  The Minister suggests this form of amendment:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 24.  At the end of the <Col N="932" /> section to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2)  Regulations made under this section in regard to the manner of slaughtering animals shall provide that all cattle shall, before being slaughtered, be effectually stunned by means of an efficient mechanically operated instrument of a type approved by the Minister and operated by a male person of not less than eighteen years who is certified by the Minister to be competent to operate such instrument</P>
    <P>If the Minister is prepared to accept that, as I expect he is, I hope that the House will approve of it.  I ask leave to withdraw my own amendment and to move this as a substitute.</P>

But this motion put down to carry four Bills as if we were legislating wholesale, without any consideration for the merits of these measures, is very objectionable. I object and, if necessary, will divide the House if I have sufficient support on this as a protest against the manner in which it is <Col N="934" /> suggested Standing Orders should be suspended in relation to these matters.  A very short time ago, when a most important motion tabled by Senator Johnson came on for discussion, it was found that there were not a sufficient number of members present to keep a House for the discussion.  If one wanted an argument or a reason for the abolition of this House altogether such motions as these give one admirable reasons.  I oppose the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think many of us have a good deal of sympathy with what Senator Dowdall has stated, but it is most important that there should be some sort of understanding in regard to the kind of Bills where you can wisely and properly suspend Standing Orders between the taking of the Fourth and Fifth Stages.  If a Bill has met with general consent on the Second Stage, and is one to which there is little or no opposition, then the taking of the Fifth Stage is clearly and definitely perfunctory.  That, I think, applied in the case of the last Bill.  But if there is a desire on the part of members of the House again to debate the principle of a Bill on the Fifth Stage, then I agree with Senator Dowdall that a very strong case&mdash;a case of real urgency&mdash;would have to be made before the House should be asked to take the two stages together.  I think it will be agreed that there is a great difference between the two kinds of Bills I have mentioned.  If there is no desire in any part of the House to debate the Fifth Stage of this Bill, then I will not oppose the motion, but if a desire is expressed to have the Bill debated, then I think there is a case made against the suspension of Standing Orders for the taking of the Fifth Stage.</P>

Not a single member evinced the slightest inclination to discuss the Bill on the Fourth Stage.  It seemed to me that we <Col N="935" /> would have exactly the same thing on the Fifth Stage.  It was not because I felt that there was any tremendous urgency about the Bill, but I felt that the taking of the Fifth Stage would be purely formal as the taking of the previous stage had been, that I moved the suspension of Standing Orders.  Thinking that, I felt that we might as well dispose of the Bill to-day as on the next day.  If there are any members of the House who want to discuss the Bill further I certainly do not want to deprive them of the opportunity of doing so.</P>

That is the effect of the motion: to deal with four separate Bills.  But as the Chair has taken this as a separate motion we are dealing with a separate motion.  Therefore, I think the point that is serious in Senator Dowdall's objection has been met, namely, that the motion asking the House to deal with four Bills in one division has not been moved.  We are now dealing with the motion to take a single Bill, to wit, the Military Service Pensions Bill.  Inasmuch as that is the motion before the House, I think the essential feature of the objection is removed.  I think it is not a matter that we need worry about, and that we can take the Fifth Stage of the Bill to-day as well as we could next week.</P>

    <Title>Military Service Pensions Bill, 1929&mdash;Final Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question put: &ldquo;That this Bill be received for final consideration and do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to renew my opposition to this Bill on its Final Stage.  Nothing that the Minister said in defence of the Bill on the earlier stages seems to me to meet the objections that were raised to the Bill.  He himself asserted that so far as he was concerned he does not believe that, for instance, the earlier sections&mdash;2 and 3&mdash;make any difference in the law, as he understands it, but that he wants to make it clear.  That is not my view of what is intended by the Bill, and it is not my view of what should influence the Seanad in its final judgment. Notwithstanding that I have heard the Minister's explanation in defence of the Bill, I am satisfied that the Bill is doing a thing that ought not to be done.  In the first place, it is asking the Oireachtas to forego rights which are inherent in the Oireachtas, particularly in the Dáil, in regard to the checking and expenditure of public moneys.  It purports to remove from the authority of the Comptroller and Auditor-General responsibilities which are imposed upon him by the Constitution and by the Comptroller and Auditor-General Act as well as by the general character of his office.  I think that the Oireachtas has no right to disown its responsibility in this matter.  It ought not to remove, as it purports to do, from the Comptroller and Auditor-General the powers of check upon public expenditure which it is his office to fulfil.  On that ground I ask the House on this last opportunity to throw out the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRobinson" hpid="Mr. Robinson Mr. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were a Demosthenes and were able to convince the Seanad that this Bill which has been introduced was bad for the country, I am afraid the only effect would be that some Senators who might be convinced of that would still act contrary to their convictions. One feels that it is almost futile to get up and try to convince them that this Bill is a bad one for the country because one feels that they will not act, even if convinced, according to their new convictions.  This Bill, stripped of all its trimmings, camouflage and verbiage is simply and purely an effort to prove that the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee who agreed with him, were wrong when they declared that certain papers were essential for the proper audit of the accounts.  The purpose of the Bill is not only to protect the Government in the future but to indemnify them against acts that they did in the past, whether these were accidental, intentional or unintentional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is retrospective in its character.  If the Government have done wrong things, the purpose of this Bill is to put them right legally. I want the Seanad to keep that in mind.  This matter first arose when the Comptroller and Auditor-General said he wanted certain papers in order that he might be able to audit the accounts properly. The matter came before the Public Accounts Committee and was discussed by the members of it.  The Government nominees on that Committee put forward the Government's objection to doing what the Comptroller and Auditor-General asked.  The only argument that they put forward, and this is the only defence that has been made in support of the Bill, was this: that certain people might suffer if their names were exposed.  The Public Accounts <Col N="939" /> Committee at the time took that as a fairly reasonable argument.  They agreed to the argument that was put forward because the sum involved at the time&mdash;something like £6,000&mdash;was relatively small.  In the following year the sum under this head had mounted up to about £80,000.  That put a different complexion on the matter.  The Public Accounts Committee then veered round and thought it would be better and safer if the papers asked for were given to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>Last year the amount in question was about £253,000.  This year the amount is about £208,000.  It is probable that it will remain in or about that figure for some time. That is an enormous sum of money to have involved in this matter.  We are not out merely to try and catch people.  That is clear from the fact that the Fianna Fáil members on the Public Accounts Committee were quite willing to meet the Government when a small amount of money was involved.  If a Bill were brought in to prevent, say, the Comptroller and Auditor-General from exposing these particular papers&mdash;to prevent him from allowing anybody to peruse them except himself&mdash;I think that would be fair enough.  We must not forget that the people who went into this evidence were two Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies, two Ministers and a judge.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General is an important public official.  I think it should not frighten anybody if, as I have suggested, a Bill were brought in making it obligatory on him to keep these documents secret. It might be a very good manoeuvre for us Republicans to allow this Bill to go through quietly if we were to consider merely the political advantages to be derived in the future from its passing.  I imagine it would secure great tactical advantages for us later on.  It would be there as a precedent and later on we could drive wild horses through the Constitution along these lines.  We have had other matters before us, <Col N="940" /> but nothing quite so blatant as this one.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Government did not introduce a Bill on the lines that I have suggested.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General, in the ordinary course of his duty, is like the Party in Opposition, bound, when a matter is doubtful, always to suspect the worst.  The Party in Opposition is perfectly justified in suspecting the worst, or, at least, in acting as if they suspected the worst. They are justified in doing that in order to make doubly sure, as it were, that things are put right.  It is not through any mere feeling of pernicketiness that we are opposing the Bill, but because we believe&mdash;personally, I think it is not only possible but probable&mdash;that there is something that the Government really do not want to publish.  If it was decided to give numbers in the cases of those receiving pensions, and whose names it is thought it would be dangerous to publish&mdash;to give the numbers for them and the total amount involved in their cases &mdash;with the publication of the names in all other cases, I do not think that we could disagree with that.  As I have said, it might be a good manoeuvre on our part to allow this Bill to go through quietly, because by passing it we are establishing a precedent which will afford an opportunity of going through the Constitution later on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very bad Bill.  I felt rather glad that, when the Bill was reaching its last stages, the rules of the House had to be broken through in order to admit of its speedy passage.  The Bill breaks through the Constitution.  The Minister is rather unfortunate that, in reaching the Final Stage of this Bill, the rules of the House have had to be suspended.  Has the Minister any regard for the rules of the House or for the Constitution?  When this Bill came up for consideration on the last occasion I opposed it in a speech which, in my judgment, was a perfectly reasonable speech.  I opposed it on constitutional grounds.  As Senator Robinson has said, this Bill involves the expenditure <Col N="941" /> of public money to the extent of about £270,000.  If we seek for comparisons, that is about the sum which was required for old age pensions and in respect of which there was the fall of the Government.  Of course it rose again like the Phoenix from its ashes, but still £270,000 in a small country like this is a considerable sum.  In my judgment the breaking through of principles of constitutional government is of greater importance than that.</P>
      <P>This Bill was intended to give pensions to men who had served in the Irish Republican Army and in kindred organisations before the Truce, and who continued to serve in the Free State Army after the Truce.  If any member of the Army who fought for the independence of this country is in need of a pension, I would not raise my voice to oppose it, whatever his conduct may have been in after years.  But not one of the men whom I knew in the course of the struggle ever fought for a pension or in the hope of getting one. I am greatly afraid that numbers of people who performed no service to their country before the Truce, or to anybody else, have succeeded in getting pensions.  They have come out like flies in the sunshine.  I greatly fear that a number of them have got pensions which they do not deserve and which they did not earn and which a poor country can ill afford to pay.  The Minister, in his speech in the Dáil, said that he himself was entitled to a pension but that he did not demand one.  What I say is that a great number of people have demanded pensions and have got them who were not entitled to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">

      <P>Will the Senator adduce a little evidence on that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably.  I said on the last occasion that it was not my duty to inquire into individual cases. It is not my business to do that.  I base my opposition to this Bill on the broad constitutional ground that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has been excluded from these documents. In the other House a great many examples were given of cases where <Col N="942" /> pensions had at first been refused and were afterwards granted, and the coincidence was adverted to that a general election was in the offing and supervened.  That is no part of my argument here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is your whole argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution says that all expenditure of public money must be vouched for by the Comptroller-General and that when it has been spent it must be audited by the same man as Auditor-General.  That is the practice which has been found necessary in every country for the purpose of preserving the purity of public life, because human nature being what it is, the ablest man sometime or other may go wrong. My friend, Senator Milroy, I am sure, in his wide reading of the history of this and other countries, must know that public men in former times have gone wrong, and that because they have gone wrong it became necessary to devise this machine&mdash;the Comptroller and Auditor-General. It was a great protection to Ministers, a great security, because while this officer is there and allowed to discharge his functions not alone can there be no misappropriation of public money, but there can be no suggestion against the integrity of Ministers.  He is a great protection to Ministers, as I have said, and he is also a great protection to the public.  While this State has been in existence for nearly eight years, there have been few occasions on which the Auditor-General has been prevented from doing his duty.  I do not think there has been any occasion up to the present, and I will say this of an officer whom I do not know, that so far as I can see, reading from the reports of public accounts and the audits of public accounts, that officer has done his duty with great wisdom, great forbearance and great courage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have misheard the Senator, but I gathered from what he was saying that the Auditor-General had on occasions been prevented from doing his duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="943" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I did not think he had on any occasion up to the present.  I am glad Senator Johnson intervened to emphasise that point I have made.  So far as I know, on no occasion up to the present has the Auditor-General been prevented from discharging his very responsible duties, and he has discharged them well, so far as I can see.  Now comes this Pensions Bill.  It was a highly controversial measure, because while it provided for pensions for one class of the I.R.A. it excluded pensions from another class. There was a double test for those entitled to pensions.  They must have performed services to their country before the Truce, and they must have been in the National Army after the Truce.  Soldiers of the Republic, no matter how valiant they may have been in the days before the Truce, are not entitled to pensions under this Act.  Therefore, it was a highly controversial Party measure, and it was most desirable that in the carrying into effect of that measure the greatest candour should be observed.  Now, what is done?  A board is set up, and it was attempted to suggest that that board was a court of justice whose decisions could not be questioned. Well, I think that argument was abandoned.  Of course, it was bound to be abandoned.  It should never have been put forward, because the very men who said it was a court were the men who contended that similar institutions that were advising General Macready and others were not courts.  We proved in the House of Lords that the military courts set up to advise General Macready were not courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the same rule would apply in this case.  They are not courts, but the proceedings before them are to be kept private.  The evidence taken at these courts is to be kept from the eye of the Comptroller-General. Why?  Is it to be suggested that the Comptroller-General is not a man to be relied on?  Is it to be suggested that this high officer would be false to the trust imposed upon him?  No.  The only other suggestion that can possibly <Col N="944" /> be made is this, that there are a number of people in receipt of pensions and allowances under this Party measure who are not entitled to them, and that there must be great malversation of public money. Let my friend, Senator Milroy, answer that in any way he likes.  I make no charge against anybody, because I have no information of any individual case, but I say that the concealing of these papers was the strongest circumstantial proof that there must be something very serious to conceal. We are told these papers are private documents and only to be seen by members of the Board.  They are no such thing.  President Cosgrave stated very frankly in the Dáil that the papers are in existence, that they are public documents, and that they are in a certain room.  Of course the notes were taken by shorthand writers who were paid by the State. The papers were no more the property of the members of the Tribunal than this House is the property of the members of the Tribunal.  The public documents are there which would show the Comptroller and Auditor-General whether these pensions had been fairly granted or not. There might be very extraordinary cases which would strike him at once, but he is not to see these papers.</P>
    <P>What excuse is given?  &ldquo;Oh, if he were to see these papers grave injury might be done to some people in England, Scotland, the North of Ireland, or elsewhere.&rdquo;  My answer is if a man was entitled to a pension, and if that appeared on the documents, the Comptroller and Auditor-General would have nothing to say to it.  If from these documents it appears that the man was not entitled to the pension, and that he was committing a fraud on the State, I say then that the person committing that fraud should not be protected. It has also been said: &ldquo;If you show these documents to the Comptroller and Auditor-General that will be showing them to every clerk in his office.&rdquo;  I deny that.  I deny that any person except the Comptroller and Auditor-General has the right to see these documents, just as I assert that he has the absolute right under <Col N="945" /> the Constitution to see them.  He is the man you exclude.  Who is the man you will not trust?  He is the man appointed by the Dáil, first to give warrant for every payment authorised by the Minister, and then to audit every payment made on the authority of the Minister.</P>
    <P>He is selected by the Dáil to be the servant of the people of this State.  He cannot be dismissed by the Dáil&mdash;the Dáil and Seanad must concur in his dismissal.  He is a man who cannot be a member of either House of the Oireachtas, a man set apart and protected in every way which human ingenuity can invent for the purpose of securing that he shall be an honest, upright, and efficient public servant, a watchdog of the public funds.  I have no reason to think that the present occupant of that office is unworthy of the trust which the people have put upon him, but apparently he is not worthy of the confidence of Ministers or of the Minister for Defence. My submission is that the Minister for Defence, in excluding this public officer from his duties is breaking the Constitution in a fundamental way, because when you come to the question of money, the appropriation of public funds, you come to the foundations of this Constitution, just as you do in every constitution.</P>
    <P>It is a curious thing that this Comptroller and Auditor-General has met with the disapproval of the military men and the military Ministers for a considerable time.  The most remarkable incident in connection with this office was where he disclosed the purchase of 10,000 or 20,000 periscopes.  That was the first discovery he made&mdash;somebody, in the course of the Civil War, had purchased 10,000 or 20,000 periscopes in order to enable the Free Staters to look at the Republicans. Since he was guilty of that first offence he has not been a <i>persona grata</i> in that particular Department, and now they are preventing him from seeing these documents which it is his right under the Constitution to see, which it is his duty under the Constitution to examine, and which <Col N="946" /> I think this Bill will not prevent him if he desires to have them examined, because, as I said on the last occasion, it is very hard to break through the fundamental principles and rights of the people, and even the Minister for Defence, if he desires to do so, with all his skill will find it very difficult.  These documents will, I think, become famous. They will become rather historical. We understand they are locked up, that the Minister for Defence himself has not seen them, and, as he protests, cannot see them, but I think people hereafter will be very curious to see them, and let us hope they will not find too many things wrong.  Very likely the evidence will then be forgotten or lost.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the Dáil that he would be very anxious to receive information as to pensions which were wrongly obtained.  I have no means of giving him that information. It is not my duty or the duty of any member of this House to go around and procure that information for him, but it would be the duty of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to look through the documents and examine them, to bring his experience and knowledge to bear upon them, and then when he had done that to bring in any complaints or observations he had to make before the constitutional Committee appointed by the Dáil to look into the Public Accounts.  What I submit to the House is that this Bill is wrong, that it is conceived in temper, and that it offends against constitutional principles in a vital way. No doubt it has passed through the Dáil.  It has received a Second Reading in the Seanad, and perhaps it will be passed to-day, but certainly it will not be passed without the strongest protest I can make against it.</P>

I do not think his speech should be allowed to pass without a brief explanation as to why some of us have disagreed <Col N="947" /> entirely with the views he has expressed. I will not follow him into the merits or demerits of this Bill, or the question as to whether or not some people have got pensions who should not have got them.  I have no knowledge in the matter, and I do not believe in the infallibility of a Committee or of any set of persons, but on the main issue I totally disagree with him&mdash;that it was the duty of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to see whether the pensions had been fairly granted or not. I believe his only function is to see whether the payments made were in accordance with the service which had been decided upon by the Committee.</P>

I would not have intervened were it not to make one or two brief comments on <Col N="948" /> Senator Comyn's observations, and which observations were not heard by the Minister for Defence.  Senator Comyn adopted a line of argument which, I think, is both regrettable and reprehensible.  He was willing to wound but afraid to strike.  He made the suggestion time and again that there had been malversation of public moneys, and pensions had been granted to people who were not entitled to them.  When I challenged him to produce some evidence on that point he said: &ldquo;I know nothing about that.  I have no knowledge of it.&rdquo;  Is there anything more contemptible than to make a suggestion discrediting the probity of public men, of men of administrative and executive authority, to make this insidious suggestion of corrupt practice, and then when challenged to admit that he has nothing on which to base that suggestion?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is within the recollection of those who were here what were the actual words the Senator did use.  According to the plain meaning of the words, I think it would be impossible to draw any inference from the words used by the Senator than that he wished to convey that there had been practices of the nature I have indicated. I say it is not creditable to the person who uses that kind of argument. It certainly does no good to any cause, especially to the cause on behalf of which that kind of argument is brought forward.  I was glad to hear Senator Douglas's speech, and I believe that it would be a curious position which the Oireachtas would find itself in if it placed outside of its powers the right to limit the functions of any of its servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor-General is the servant of this Oireachtas, not the dictator, and the Oireachtas, if it so wishes, has, in <Col N="949" /> my opinion, the power to limit his operations where it deems that such a limitation is necessary.  It is perfectly futile and misleading to argue on the assumption, as has been argued, not so much to-day as on previous occasions, as if normal circumstances were the order appertaining to the occasion when the grounds for these pensions came into operation.  I think it was Senator Comyn who, on the Second Reading, referred to the operations of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in England and to the careful steps that had been taken to safeguard public moneys.  But the circumstancees which warranted those steps did not exist in reference to the period with which these pensions are concerned.  Let us not forget that the particular class of pensions with which this Bill deals are pensions of the past and that the necessity for this Bill is not likely to recur as far as pensions are concerned in the future.  The Minister for Defence made it very clear, both in this House and to those who have read the Official Debates in the Dáil, that there were specific and definite reasons concerning the safety and the security of certain individuals why the information given in confidence to the Board of Assessors should be withheld from publication.  That is flippantly passed over as of no account, and the criticism of this Bill is based on the entirely misleading assumption that conditions which govern the enquiry into pensions nowadays operated in regard to these pensions. We know that such is not the case, that the circumstances were abnormal and that unusual steps had to be taken.</P>
    <P>Senator Comyn has asserted that the Board of Assessors was not a court, but the only particle of ground for that belief that he revealed was something that happened in the House of Lords.  The writ of the House of Lords does not run in Saorstát Eireann, though Senator Comyn may not be aware of that, and what happened in the House of Lords on that occasion has nothing <Col N="950" /> whatever to do with the decision of the Oireachtas, as to whether a body which it sets up shall function as a court or not.  I believe&mdash;and the contention is held by those who stand for this Bill&mdash;that it was a court, and if the Oireachtas decides that it was a court, then I assume that is the final word in the matter, and no matter what the House of Lords may have decided about other matters, the decision of the Oireachtas will stand.  I have made these points because there were arguments made in the absence of the Minister for Defence which I did not want to pass without at least some challenge. Senator Comyn challenged me to answer some of them.  Without the aid of his 20,000 periscopes, I could not say what it was he wanted me to answer, and for that reason I have to let it go by default.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that an effort is being made to give a new definition to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I think it would be a very good thing if members of the Seanad would refer to the Constitution and see who this particular individual is, and what are the functions attaching to the office.  Here is what Article 62 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Dáil Eireann shall appoint a Comptroller and Auditor-General to act on behalf of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann).  He shall control all disbursements and shall audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas and shall report to Dáil Eireann at stated periods to be determined by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to know as an ordinary layman is this, without any assumption at all of being versed in legal matters: if a controller is to control how is he to control?  If he is to report, how is he to report on that control, if records are withheld from him?  The title of the Bill states that all findings shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons and tribunals whatsoever.  Without any reference to the possibility or the probability of corruption there <Col N="951" /> is always the likelihood of error. How is he to report on that likelihood of error if he cannot get documents? If this Bill passes I cannot see any reason at all for the maintenance of the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. Hooper Mr. Hooper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to support the Bill.  I do so, not because I am enamoured of anything that would limit the general right of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to examine any documents relating to any Department.  It would be very deplorable if that right were to be limited, and in deciding my course of action on this Bill I have put the question to myself whether that right is limited on this occasion.  The answer to my mind is that it is not. It limits and it actually destroys the Comptroller and Auditor-General's right of inspection in respect of a particular class of case, and only of a particular class of case.  That is the case of persons who served in the National Forces before a particular date&mdash;I forget exactly what date&mdash; but it only applies to these people who served before that date; it does not apply to any people who served since then, nor will it apply in the future.  The question is whether it is justifiable that that right of inspection should be withdrawn from the Comptroller and Auditor-General in respect of those cases.  On the whole I think the Oireachtas might allow that to be done.  To my mind this Bill is in effect an Indemnity Bill, such as is passed in all Parliaments after periods of military conflict. In these conflicts things happen which it is not always in the interests of the State should be brought under public gaze, not merely things that are ugly and criminal but things that, if brought into the public light might have damaging effects upon the careers of people who were involved.  That I understand is the principal reason put forward why this course should be taken now.  If these Indemnity Bills are given to Governments in other countries I cannot see why our Government should be refused this <Col N="952" /> one.  I can, of course, understand the strong objection taken by Fianna Fáil to seeing men who fought and defeated them in the field recompensed in this way, but for those who supported the State at that time, and who are grateful for the services of the men who are now being recompensed, to oppose this Bill seems to me to be illogical and ungenerous.  As one who supported the State at that time I have come to the conclusion that the Bill should be supported now.</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation.  Speaking for myself and my Party in this matter there has never been any suggestion from these benches or from our Party in the Dáil that we are opposed to this measure because pensions are being received by people who fought against us. We oppose the measure for the reasons we stated clearly to-day, because we think if we were in power others would be perfectly entitled to ask that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should see that he had control of all disbursements and that they would insist on facilitating him in that way. I think it was grossly unfair of the Senator to make such a suggestion.</P>

      <P>I am very glad, of course, to hear that statement from the Senator, but what I said was that I was not surprised at the objection to this Bill which did recompense these men.  If I did him wrong by suggesting that that was his reason for the opposition I express my regret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with a certain amount of amazement to Senator Milroy's statement, because it seems to me, if his argument is logically pursued, we do not want a Comptroller and Auditor-General at all.  He spoke of the probity of public men, and while we are all reasonably satisfied that there is no undue lack of probity in our public men, we still feel it is essential that the Comptroller and Auditor-General should act, control, check and pass all accounts when they are paid, and <Col N="953" /> that the Public Accounts Committee should take up with any Department which either pays in the wrong, overpays, or does something which is contrary to the public interest.  It must be remembered that the public men referred to are the servants of the Oireachtas, and it should have control over these public men.  That is the sole reason why we have a Comptroller and Auditor-General, to safeguard the funds belonging to the public.  Let us be quite honest about this matter.  There is a very considerable feeling of uneasiness with regard to some of these pensions.  It may not be justified; the pensions may all have been granted in perfect good faith, and all the money may have been earned, even, as Senator Hooper suggested, in suppressing Fianna Fáil.  I did not know that Army pensions had yet been voted for the suppression of Fianna Fáil, or whether these pensions are being voted in anticipation of the suppression that is going to come.  We do not want to expose any pension.  We realise, as sane, sensible individuals, that pensions have been granted to certain people, and that to make the matter public property would undoubtedly inflict hardship on such individuals.  But surely there is no reason why the Comptroller and Auditor-General should not be in a position to examine and to satisfy himself that these pensions have been legitimately granted and legitimately paid; that does not necessarily mean that the names of the men to whom pensions are paid are going to be broadcast; it does not mean that the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo; is going to carry the full list.  Granted that this is an Indemnity Bill, we realise that a certain amount of ordinary discretion should be exercised, but we do not think it would be running any risk of undue publicity if the Comptroller and Auditor-General saw all the papers and the evidence on which pensions were granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say again that there is uneasiness about the granting of these pensions, about the amount of them, and that the uneasiness will always exist until all the data is at least certified <Col N="954" /> by the Comptroller and Auditor-General. The arguments that have been repeated here to-day by Senator Milroy and others do not convince us, and I submit do not convince any fair-minded people that the amounts are right, and that only these amounts have been paid. I am rather sorry that Senator Hooper dragged a red herring across the track as regards Fianna Fáil.  I did not know that they were yet suppressed, or that pensions were awarded for their suppression.  It is symptomatic, but we hope for better times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the operations of the Army against Fianna Fáil, the last information we have is dated December, 1926, some nine months after the establishment of Fianna Fáil.  At that time Fianna Fáil was one Party in a body set up in defiance of this State and for the purpose of subverting this State.  Fianna Fáil and the people who are associated with that body naturally have a grievance against the Army, which made the operations of that outside body impossible. Nothing new has been said in this debate.  The argument has mostly centred round a mistaken conception of the position of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. One Senator said that if the Comptroller and Auditor-General were not to function as he wished him to function there would be no need for the Comptroller and Auditor-General. As a matter of fact, the functions that have been attributed to the Comptroller and Auditor-General by the Senators objecting to this Bill would do away with the need for government.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General controls disbursements.  We who govern administer <Col N="955" /> this country according to the law.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General can see that I am not paying a sum to a soldier or to an officer greater than the sum sanctioned; he cannot come along to me and say: &ldquo;I do not think that you should really pay a major at such a rate,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I think that you could really get soldiers cheaper.&rdquo;  He has not the right to do that.  It is set down, either by legislation or by regulation, what should be paid under certain circumstances, and the Comptroller and Auditor-General merely sees the vouchers, and so on. He sees that so many men are serving in the Army in such a rank, that the pay for such a rank is so much, and he cannot say that it should be otherwise; he merely sees that that number is paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the payment of a pensioner is concerned, Fianna Fáil may object to the original Act, but we are not discussing that.  I have no doubt but that they do object to anybody other than their own followers getting any advantage out of the strife that took place, but the original Act lays down perfectly clearly that military pensions, that is to say, the sum that the law says should be paid, is decided by the certificate of the Board.  That is what the original Act says: &ldquo;For the purpose of calculating the amount of military service pension which any holder of a certificate of military service under this Act shall receive the military service of such person as found by the Board of Assessors and set out in his certificate of military service shall be calculated in each case according to the rules set out in the Second Schedule of this Act.&rdquo;  It shall be founded on what they find.  If the man only gave one month and the Board found that he gave twenty years, for the purpose of the Act the service for which he is to receive a pension is twenty years, not one month, because the Act says that the actual period for which he is to be paid is as set down in the certificate, and that certificate is available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General. <Col N="956" /> The Comptroller and Auditor-General exercises the same function here as he does in any normal case. The Act says that men shall receive pensions under certain conditions, their cases having been examined by the Board.  The certificates are available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and he can see whether they are being paid according to these certificates, or more or less.</P>
    <P>There has been a general misconception of the whole position.  It has been suggested that we might let the Comptroller and Auditor-General see things confidentially.  I think it was Senator Comyn who said that he would necessarily only report cases where more was being given than should have been given, or where a pension should not have been given at all.  That is not the case.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil I pointed out to a Deputy belonging to the Fianna Fáil Party, who had tried to mislead people by quoting certain things that has been referred by the Comptroller and Auditor-General to the Public Accounts Committee, but who had carefully suppressed certain things, that in each one of these cases that had been reported and made public it was demonstrated that the men had received these pensions quite rightly and correctly, and that the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General had been made on a misconception and a misapprehension of the whole position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw that. I will merely say that he quoted a certain portion and omitted a certain portion, and, to my mind, that must necessarily have had the effect of not giving people the whole truth. In the case referred to, a man who <Col N="957" /> was following his ordinary occupation offered his services in Easter Week and they were refused, but he was empowered to act in the intelligence service, and in that service was wounded.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General put that forward. The circumstances were made public. In any case that we have, if all the information were given to the Comptroller and Auditor-General he might misunderstand the circumstances, and in a case where he had a doubt he would naturally refer it to the Public Accounts Committee and it would naturally become public.  As far as I understand, in the original Act the certificate decided the period for which a man was to receive a pension.  That certificate is made available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  He also has the vouchers of the pensions that are paid to the various individuals, so that as far as the law is concerned he is exercising the functions in this case that he exercises in any other. In this I would respectfully differ from Senator Johnson.  Senator Johnson purported to indicate what was the intention of the Bill.  I think that anybody who peruses the Bill and knows the circumstances will agree that the intention is not as suggested by Senator Johnson.  Anybody who lived through that period, and particularly anybody who was intimately associated with it, knows perfectly well that it is not in the interests of the individual, but it is also not in the interests of the State, that all the details of that period should be brought out in their brutal clarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Board was set up.  The Act said that the pensions should be based on the service established by the Board.  It was specifically laid down that the Board should contain a judge or a barrister of not less than ten years' legal experience. For what purpose?  So that we would be assured that the Board would contain in its personnel somebody who was trained for the purpose of judging evidence.  The proposition now is that the one great man in the country who, above everybody else, is capable of judging <Col N="958" /> evidence, is the man whose function it is to audit accounts.  As far as the accounts are concerned, they are there, ready for him to audit.  This is a question of evidence.  I have admitted on many occasions that I quite conceived the possibility that all the evidence that was given was not true.  As I said on another occasion, as we know there is not in this country that horror of perjury which we would like to see.  But it is suggested that the Comptroller and Auditor-General, a man whose business is auditing, should go through all that evidence, and with all that perspicacity that is not given to other people, that he would be able to read a man's statement and say: &ldquo;That is not true,&rdquo; and he would duly report it to the Public Accounts Committee, and say that that man should not have a pension.  It is not his function to judge that.  His function is to see that the funds expended are expended according to law.  The law says that a man's pension shall be based upon the period set down in the certificate issued by this Board.  If we have in any way departed from that he has all the material available to allow him to call attention to that fact. But here are the circumstances. Anybody who was intimately associated with the conditions beforehand knows perfectly well that it is not desirable, not merely from the internal but also from the external point of view, that all the details of that period should be brought out. In this case evidence had to be put forward, a man had to make it clear that he gave pre-truce military service within the meaning of the Act. How was he to do that?  By setting out some definite warlike act.  Remember that those acts were not what in normal warfare would be called warlike acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What I meant was that he had to prove that he gave military service within the meaning of the Act.  The Board are the only <Col N="959" /> people to judge what was military service.  Any Senator can conceive himself or any other individual going before that Board and saying: &ldquo;I gave military service from such a date to such a date.&rdquo;  They say: &ldquo;Prove it.&rdquo;  He says: &ldquo;I give you the names of Colonel So-and-So, Brigadier General So-and-So and Private So-and-So,&rdquo; who participated in the same operation, and somebody writes in and says: &ldquo;Yes, I was in command of his company and I am in a position to say that his was the hand that brought death to a certain individual who was an enemy of ours.&rdquo;  That has happened in hundreds of cases.  It is clearly not in the public interest that this information should be broadcasted, and it is not in the interests of many individuals of my own personal knowledge that the exact acts that they have performed should be made public. Remember also that the original Act did not lay down that the members of the Board should keep notes of the evidence.  Senator Comyn is wrong when he says that shorthand writers, paid by the State.  actually made these notes.</P>

They were not ordered by the original Act to make any such notes, but for their own convenience they made their own arrangements.  Their own arrangements certainly did to the best of my knowledge include the making of certain notes.  It is now proposed that these notes made by the Board should be made available for the Comptroller and Auditor-General, that the man who controls disbursements, and who audits, should obtain them.</P>

      <P>The Senator says that this evidence could be made available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and still we can be assured that this undesirable publicity will not take place.  I say that we can be assured of nothing of the sort.  I have given instances under another Act of ordinary perfectly straight cases where men got pensions that they should get which were duly made public.  In this case if we hand this evidence over to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, he in his own judgment will say: &ldquo;I am dubious about this, and I will report it to the Public Accounts Committee. If that is to be done I must insist that I have this material available to me and to my staff.&rdquo;  He reports that to the Committee, and as far as I remember the arrangements, a Deputy gets up in the Dáil and moves to have their report published; the thing is duly published and is immediately published in the newspapers.  I have no guarantee that if this material is made available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General it will not also be made available to the general public here and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am saying now what I have said over and over again, because people have persisted on misunderstanding the whole position.  Everything that is available to me is available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General. In so far as he is controlling my disbursements he has everything available to him that is available to me. The thing that is withheld is the evidence. The Act provided that the Board should contain a man specially trained for the consideration of <Col N="961" /> evidence.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General is not specially trained for the consideration of evidence. My reading of his function is that he should not say: &ldquo;Personally I do not think that the work that that man did in 1916 or 1920 really warranted such a pension&rdquo;: his business is to see that the disbursement of these funds coincided, and only coincided, with such disbursements as were provided for by law.  In this case he is perfectly able to do that because the disbursements provided by law are pensions, based upon periods of time, and set out in the certificate of the Board, which is available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  We are not limiting his powers; we are only defining his powers to be what we are advised they are by our own legal adviser and what I think ordinary common sense indicates are really his powers.</P>
    <P>I think any honest-minded person who is acquainted with the circumstances of the earlier period knows that it is against national interest, against the personal interests of many of the men involved in this matter, that this information should be made public.  We have no security for assuming that if these things are made available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General they will not also be made available to his staff, and necessarily also be made available to my staff, almost certainly in many cases made available to the Public Accounts Committee and to the public generally.  We have no security for assuming that that will not happen.  It is not in the public interest and not in good faith to the applicants that that should be done.  As far as getting after anybody who may be drawing a pension that he has not earned is concerned I have yet to hear how the arrangement that is urged&mdash;that the evidence should be made available&mdash; would assist the Comptroller and Auditor-General in any way whatsoever. The certificates issued by the Board are available to him, and through him are available to the Public Accounts Committee.  They <Col N="962" /> can, if they like, raise any individual case and question whether a man is drawing a pension that he could not possibly have earned.  But as far as the Comptroller and Auditor-General seeing the evidence is concerned it would not, to my mind, assist in diminishing one pension by one sixpence; it would certainly lead necessarily to national injury and to personal injury, and therefore we have introduced this Bill to make the position perfectly clear, although, as I said before, I am satisfied it does not alter the law in any way at all in that respect.  It would not be fair to people who come forward to give evidence in the interests of such applicants, not necessarily the applicants themselves, but people who come forward to give evidence.  I know of many cases, and there may even be members of the Seanad who themselves came forward to give evidence for certain applicants, and in that evidence necessarily gave certain information about themselves, although they might not in any way be beneficiaries under the original Act.  This Bill is largely unnecessary; it is merely to reassure people's minds.  If such a Bill were necessary it certainly would be everybody's duty to support it, to my mind, and certainly anybody who knows anything about the circumstances could form an idea as to the details contained in the evidence.</P>

The Minister has told us that the pension list is available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, as well as the names and the amounts, but that on no account will the evidence be submitted to him, as it would not be judicious in the public interest to do so, that a committee has already sifted the evidence and awarded the pensions, and after having done that, the only <Col N="963" /> duty for the Comptroller and Auditor-General was to pass the list. That being the case, I have no hesitation <Col N="964" /> whatever in voting for the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Standing Orders be suspended for the purpose of enabling the remaining stages of the Shops Hours (Drapery Trades, Dublin and Districts) Bill, 1930, to be taken to-day.&rdquo;  If there is any opposition to this motion I do not want to press it.  My reasons for moving the motion is that there is a certain amount of urgency about this Bill.  It was treated, so far, as a non-controversial Bill.  The existing Act expires in July, and as things move rather slowly in the Dáil, there is a chance that if we do not get the Bill to the Dáil as quickly as possible it may not be passed in time.  I only ask the House to accept the motion if there is general agreement.</P>
