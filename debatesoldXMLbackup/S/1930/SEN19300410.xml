      <P>The Committee of Selection has nominated the following Senators to represent the Seanad at the conference between members of the Seanad and Dáil upon amendment No. 6 made by the Seanad to the Game Preservation Bill, 1929:&mdash; Senators S.L. Brown, K.C.; M. Comyn, K.C.; James G. Douglas; P. J. Hooper, and Thomas Johnson.</P>
      <P>Under the Standing Orders, it is for the Cathaoirleach to fix the time and place of the conference.  I propose to do this after ascertaining the wishes of the Minister for Justice, who is the Minister in charge of the Bill.  All the members of the conference will then be notified accordingly.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, in view of the fact that the Ports and Harbours Tribunal has not yet reported, the Second Stage of the Cork Harbour Bill, 1927, be further postponed until the 22nd October, 1930, or, if the Seanad be not sitting on that day, until the next day thereafter on which the Seanad shall sit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am in order I would ask that that motion be not discharged to-day but that it be allowed to remain on the Order Paper until we meet again.  Some members of the Cork Harbour Board have been speaking to me, and while they are willing to comply as far as possible and to wait for the report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal, <Col N="966" /> that has been delayed a very long time.  There are rather rapid developments going on in Cork, and I know that there is at the moment some congestion on the upper quays, so that if I am in order I would ask that that motion be allowed to remain on the Order Paper until our next meeting.</P>

      <P>At yesterday's meeting Senator Mrs. Clarke said that she had an amendment which she wished to propose.  I had some conversation with her afterwards, and I am not now quite clear whether she has decided to propose an amendment or not.  I told her that if she still wished to do so I would ask the Seanad to postpone this Stage, as I would like to give her every reasonable opportunity.  I do not think she will propose an amendment, but at the same time if she wishes to do so I am anxious to give her the opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that possibly the Minister would have generally introduced this motion; but it is well to say, I think, so far as one can speak from outside, that these Conventions have been adopted by representatives of Governments, ship-owners and employees in the shipping industry.  I do not think that as far as we are concerned a great deal of new legislation will be required, but some new legislation will be required.  The Merchant Shipping Act, under which we are working, <Col N="968" /> would cover, I think, certainly the greater part of the Conventions that are referred to in this motion, but inasmuch as it was found necessary to enact new legislation in Great Britain amending the Merchant Shipping Act so as to comply with these Conventions, I take it that it will be necessary for the Oireachtas to amend the Merchant Shipping Act in these respects also, and I would like to have some information from the Minister as to how soon he is likely to be in a position to bring forward the necessary legislation.</P>
      <P>One other particular aspect of this motion on which I would like information is in regard to paragraph (d), concerning the simplification of the inspection of emigrants on board ship, as to what the position is to-day, whether any new legislation is required to bring the law into conformity with this Convention, and whether the Minister has in mind the necessity for any new legislation, even beyond this Convention, in respect to the inspection of emigrant ships.  As we know, there are no Irish ships taking emigrants; there are British and German ships; and the provision is that the emigrant inspector will be appointed by the shipowner and presumably will be of the nationality of the owner.  Of course, it is provided in this Convention that some other person may assist in a subordinate position to the inspector of emigrants of any other country that is concerned, and I would like to have from the Minister some indication of the position to-day regarding the inspection of ships which carry Irish emigrants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are presented with a long list&mdash;a couple of pages &mdash;of motions by Senator Milroy, who proposes that we should straight away sanction all these on the same day.  Some time ago we discussed at great length the appointment of a committee to investigate these matters, and there was a good deal of difference of opinion on it, but I think nothing shows more than this Order Paper how necessary such a committee is, although the proposal was opposed by Senator Milroy. <Col N="969" /> Now he proposes to bring forward two pages of a series&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator mixed up two different things.  He referred to the proposal that was made to appoint a committee to examine orders made by Departments of the State under legislation, but we are not now considering orders made by any Department of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="970" />
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are considering much more important things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>This is so important that I am afraid the Senator does not understand it.  Every member of the House was supplied some weeks ago with a printed document in which information was given with regard to the matters down for consideration by us to-day.  What is proposed is that this country is to give legislative effect to agreements that were arrived at by representatives of the Governments, the employers and the workers of the civilised States of the world with a view to coming to a common understanding and a common agreement on these questions. If there is one thing about which there ought to be unanimity in this or in any other Parliament it is that it should support the efforts that are being made by this international tribunal to secure unanimity among nations with regard to social legislation. That is the principle that is embodied in every one of these items on the Order Paper, and it is all humbug for the Senator to say that all these things have been suddenly put before us and that we are to have the guillotine and an execution with regard to things we know nothing about, when if he took the trouble to read the document that was provided he would know everything about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>You said that all you knew about it was what you saw on the Paper to-day, and that is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Please do not misunderstand me.  I did not say anything of the sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should discuss the important principle that is involved, and there is an important principle in every one of these items.  It is open to the members of this House to ratify these Conventions that were made by the representatives of the Governments, the employers and the workers of the <Col N="971" /> civilised States of the world.  We are asked to fall into line with other countries in ratifying these Conventions with a view to securing an amelioration in the conditions of working-class people.  That is the angle from which we ought to approach them, and for that reason I think it is nonsense to compare these things with orders that are made by Departments of State.  The principle is here, and we ought to consider it.  I support the adoption of this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I cannot agree with Senator Farren that our duty is to ratify without discussion or consideration the motions that have been put before us.  I am also deeply grieved that Senator Farren has not understood Senator Moore&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;because it argues, not a want of intelligence in Senator Moore, but a want of appreciation on the part of Senator Farren.  I was very much attracted by these motions, and I hope to receive from the Minister a full explanation of them.  As you know, they are the first instalment of the harvest at Geneva.</P>

      <P>I do not need information on this at all from Senator Johnson.  When I do need information from him I will ask him for it.  He occasionally supplies information, <Col N="972" /> sometimes accurately, and sometimes perhaps not so accurately. These motions deal with two subjects of very great importance to this country, curiously enough.  The first is the subject of seamen, and the second the question of emigrants.  It is a curious fact that although we have no navy and no mercantile marine&mdash;we used to have the &ldquo;Eblana,&rdquo; about which Senator O'Neill knows something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Senators are so hilarious over what is really a tragic subject.  We have no mercantile marine; we have the &ldquo;Muracoo&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Muirchu,&rdquo; or whatever it is.  That is the only ship we have, although there is one small company operating in Limerick or in Ballina.  There was a company here&mdash;the City of Dublin Co.&mdash;which was wound up although it had a £1,000,000 to its credit, a most disgraceful thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>So much for capitalistic ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Although we have no shipping we have a great number of seamen.  You do not need to travel very far on the seas of the world until you become acquainted with the fact that there are stewards and stewardesses of the Irish race on almost every ship belonging to every line on the ocean&mdash;men, women and boys&mdash;and, therefore, I say that it is a matter of vital importance for us that these Conventions, arrived at at Geneva with the aid of the Minister, should be implemented as quickly and as fully as possible, because that would be all to our advantage.  At the same time perhaps the Minister would give us some explanation of the fact that we have no ships, and perhaps, after his experience in Geneva and in London, he would tell us the reason why.  The shipping lines that we had before the Treaty <Col N="973" /> have ceased to be Irish lines.  Perhaps the Minister would give us some information of Article 9 of the Treaty&mdash;&ldquo;The Ports of Great Britain and the Irish Free State shall be freely open to the ships of the other country on payment of the customary port and other dues.&rdquo;  I am sometimes given credit for being able to construe in a general way certain propositions of law, certain sections and certain articles.  For the last nine years I have tried to construe the full meaning of that Article 9, and it has failed me to construe it.  This I do know, that after the Treaty was signed the head of the British Government said: &ldquo;Whatever we have lost, in any case we have preserved the coastal trade of Ireland.&rdquo;  So they have, but although we have no ships we have seamen all over the world, and, for that reason I am in favour of any Convention which will ameliorate the conditions of seamen.  I understand that many of these Conventions have received Parliamentary sanction in various countries in Europe, and I understand also that they have received Parliamentary sanction in England, that the Merchant Shipping Act has been amended there so as to comply with these conditions.  It makes very little difference whether we comply or not, because in my judgment&mdash;and on this I would be glad to have some information from the Minister&mdash;we are still under the Merchant Shipping Act of England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the motion to which I would like to call attention, that is, the question of emigrants dealt with in paragraph (d)&mdash;&ldquo;concerning the simplification of the inspection of emigrants on board ship.&rdquo;  I think that that is a very desirable Convention and that it ought to be implemented as soon as possible.  Unfortunately we have many emigrants.  I hope that the number will diminish year by year. I do not expect that it will diminish as the result of any activities of government, but I hope that the general trend of events will result in the number of emigrants from this country being reduced year by year. But so long as that number remains <Col N="974" /> as large as it is, I am entirely in favour of simplifying every arrangement possible to assist our poor people who have to emigrate to other lands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not see the importance of referring simple matters like this to a committee until Senator Comyn spoke, but then I began to see the necessity for it. Senator Moore cannot understand twenty-one pages of printed matter, generally compressed into sentences no longer than six lines each.  No committee will ever assist him in that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not explain this any better than by simply reading that document, and I presume that the Senator can do that himself.  The Senator thought that these Conventions should be sent to a committee to dissect them and to pass judgment on them.  The Senator does not want them explained. On the point that Senator Johnson raised, legislation will be introduced round about the autumn.  The actual legislation that is in force at the moment meets a considerable proportion of the regulations under the Conventions, but there are certain things definitely outside our legislation, and there is a new code of shipping laws in draft.  It will probably have to be held up until, in accordance with the report on Dominion Legislation, which has just been presented to the Dáil, an attempt to secure uniformity on such matters on load line arrangements and technical matters like that is made.  But either in the event of uniformity being secured, or if uniformity cannot be secured, legislation will be brought forward.  The aim of this Convention is the simplification of the inspection of emigrants on board ship, and it arises by a very simple method set out in Article 2: &ldquo;Each Member which ratifies this Convention undertakes to accept the principle that, save as hereinafter provided, <Col N="975" /> the official inspection carried out on board an emigrant vessel for the protection of emigrants shall be undertaken by not more than one Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At the moment there is often an inspection, say, at Hamburg, an inspection at Cobh, and there might be an inspection on the French coast, and there is, of course, the ordinary inspection, not of the purely emigrant type, when a boat has reached America.  There will be a certain simplification in future.  Of course, the details of what will be attended to at that inspection will be established by the law of the country to which the particular emigrant belongs. I do not know if there is any point of difficulty in the mind of the Seanad as to the present inspection. All that I am told about it is that it is a trifle severe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather interested to hear that a Bill dealing with merchant shipping was under the consideration of the Minister's Department. What Senator Comyn said in regard to our mercantile marine is unfortunately true; it is practically non-existent; but I have some reason to hope that it will not be so very much longer, because steps are afoot to do something constructive, and I hope when the Minister has his Bill ready he will be good enough to give those of us interested in the matter an opportunity to confer with him as to details.  He might fall foul of some of the details, and perhaps a conference would help us to avoid any impasse of that sort.</P>

    <P>The official inspector shall ensure the observance of the rights which emigrants possess under the laws of the country whose flag the vessel flies, or such other law as is <Col N="976" /> applicable, or under international agreements, or the terms of their contracts of transportation.</P>
    <P>We can see either, under our own legislation or under an international agreement, that we have inspection.

      <P>I would like to hear from the Minister what his proposals are regarding the period that must elapse between the ratifying of this Convention and the legislation which I presume will be necessary to amend the Factory Acts and the Workmen's Compensation Acts to implement these Conventions.  It seems to me that in respect of (b) perhaps a considerable amount of new legislation will be required, particularly in regard to internal navigation and perhaps docks as distinct from ships.  I may be wrong in that, but I rather think that some of the present conditions affecting workshops and boats do not comply very thoroughly with the Articles of this Convention, and I would like to have an assurance that the Minister proposes that there will be legislation in accord with the recommendations at an early stage, and that we shall not have to delay very long after ratification.</P>

As regards the marking and weighing of heavy packages, I do not think we have much to say to that, but we have a good deal to say concerning the protection against accidents of workers employed in loading and unloading ships.  I happen to know from my professional practice that the conditions of workers in various countries vary considerably.  I know from a case in which I appeared before the Privy Council, long before the Treaty, that in New Zealand workers are treated rather badly, and that the maximum amount of compensation to which a person was entitled in those days was £250.  The point I wish to make is this: a ship comes here and a workman who is employed on it may be injured.  That workman gets compensation, amounting to 10/-, 15/- or 20/- a week.  If the ship goes out of port, I want to suggest to the Minister the possibility that that workman may lose his compensation after two, three or four months.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that this matter, which is of the utmost importance to working-class people, should be treated in such a way by the Seanad.  I have more experience of the accidents which dockers meet with than Senator Comyn has in his profession, because I meet these men in my every-day life.  As far as some of the ports in Ireland are concerned the danger to the docker is proportionately greater than in some of the ports I have seen on the Continent.  Anything that goes to lessen the chances of these men meeting with accidents should have the full support of the Seanad.  I can claim some association with this Convention. I attended meetings and <Col N="979" /> conferences of the International Transport Federation regarding this Convention, and what is contained in it meets the claims of the Transport Workers' Federation to a very large extent.  Consequently, as one who has had practical experience of dockers, I believe this ought to be adopted by this House, and endorsed by the Executive Council.  Not only that, but they should see that the inspectors under the ports and docks regulations do their duty by seeing that the regulations are rigidly enforced, which, unfortunately, is not done at present.  To adopt the Convention is not enough; supervision should be enforced and the ordinary docker safeguarded.  I think there is no need to impress on an Assembly like this the necessity of this country putting itself in line with other countries.  At least we should do that.  I want to put it to the Minister that so far as his Department is concerned he should see that these regulations are carried out.  I know that many men are maimed and their lives put in jeopardy every other day in the ordinary routine of their employment, whereas if there was proper inspection these things would not occur.  Only recently a man was killed in Dublin through a rope being defective.  Men are discharging steamers with gear that is dangerous to their lives.  I want to impress on the Minister the importance of seeing that these regulations are properly carried out by his Department.</P>

I sincerely trust that the precautions indicated in this Convention will be effective.  This is a matter on which I have had some experience. I do not know of any class of employment that is so hideously dangerous as the loading and unloading of ships.  I trust that not only will the regulations be carried out but that the workmen will be compelled to take reasonable precautions for their own safety and for <Col N="980" /> the safety of their fellow-workers.  A great many accidents in which employers are mulcted would then be avoided.  It is quite right to stress that before accidents occur.  There are two parties concerned, and in many cases the workers themselves are criminally negligent of their own safety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two Conventions in this motion.  One concerns the marking of heavy packages transported by vessels.  The object of that is very simple&mdash;to put upon a consignor in an exporting country the duty of saying that packages above a certain gross weight are durably and plainly marked.  We are going to accept that.  There is no legislation at present in force to implement it, but we are going to have that legislation brought in.  As far as the latest chart issued by the International Labour Office shows, we are the first country to accept this Convention. We are doing it as a measure of protection for our workers, because if other countries follow the lead&mdash;and it is quite evident they are going to follow it&mdash;then those countries that consign packages will be under the same obligations, and consequently there will be a better safeguard for the men.  There is an immense amount of detail in the second Convention, but all the detailed information given deals with what Senator <Col N="981" /> Foran spoke of&mdash;the protection of workers on board ships.  We have legislation in the Factories and Workshops Acts to cover this, and regulations issued under these Acts, but it is rather difficult to say whether our powers are complete, whether under these Acts we can, by changing our regulations, ensure the remainder of what is stated here. We are going to do it by regulation first, and if we find anything outside the reach of these the Acts will have to be amended.  As far as the compensation matter goes, that is a different question altogether.  As Senator Foran knows.  Article 17 states:</P>
      <P>In order to ensure the due enforcement of any Regulations prescribed for the protection of the workers against accidents,</P>
      <P>(1)  the regulations shall clearly define the persons or bodies who are to be responsible for compliance with the respective regulations;</P>
      <P>(2)  provision shall be made for an efficient system of inspection and for penalties for breaches of the regulations.</P>
      <P>We accept that in the full sense. We are going to have supervision and penalties, and to see, as far as we can, that the regulations will follow out the Convention.</P>

In practice there is twenty-four hours' rest in every period of seven days, and there is no great likelihood of any breach with regard to that.  If there was any danger we would provide for non-compliance.</P>

Several accidents have happened that could be reasonably traced back to the fact that the energies of these men were used up, no doubt by long periods of employment without rest.

      <P>I hope the Seanad will ratify this Convention, and I hope also that it will not be taken as wrong on my part to suggest that the Minister should take the lead in legislation necessary to implement this Convention.  There are a number of foreign employers, such as contractors, in this country whose workmen meet with accidents.  I happen to know of three cases in which workmen met with accidents and got compensation, but were unable to recover it for more than two or three months.  The reason was this, that these contractors left the country&mdash;some of them were Scotchmen and some of them were Englishmen&mdash;and the awards of the Circuit Court Judge were not enforceable in either England or Scotland.  I know three cases of that kind.  They were rather small cases, but in all these cases the workmen sustained considerable hardship.  My suggestion to the Minister is that in implementing this Convention he should secure that any foreign contractors employing workmen here should insure them in some Irish office, and he should give the workmen the right to enforce their claims against insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that must be a very serious matter.  It must have occurred in a <Col N="984" /> great number of cases.  I know three cases in my own experience where it did occur.  They were cases of great hardship, and I am only suggesting to the Minister that in implementing this Convention he should see these people insure and that the insurance companies be made liable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Convention only declares that there shall be equality of treatment for national and foreign workers regarding workmen's compensation.  As far as the principle of equality of treatment is concerned the Workmen's Compensation Acts at present in force in the country secures that.  In so far as actual equality of payment of a compensation share to a person who changes his domicile is concerned, that is a different matter. That question will be eased by this Convention if it is passed by a considerable number of nations.  In so far as we are concerned, that point will be attended to in the workmen's compensation legislation which is at present in draft.  It ought to be brought before the Oireachtas in June, and certainly, I think, not later than the autumn.  What Senator Comyn spoke about is a different matter altogether&mdash;the reciprocal enforcement of judgments.  On that matter this Convention is silent. The points on which the Senator touched were not dealt with by the Convention at all, except incidentally, that Article 4 did say that the members ratifying this Convention undertook to afford each other mutual assistance to facilitate the application of the Convention, while Article 2 says that special agreement may be made between members to provide compensation under certain Conventions.</P>

      <P>Before we pass from these matters, I would like to ask the Minister if he could give us any information as to the intentions of the Ministry in regard to the other Conventions which are of considerable importance to us here and which have been before his Department for some time.  The Washington Hours Convention was one of the first of those international conventions. Then there was the Convention regarding the prohibition of night baking, and another one which, though of lesser importance, is nevertheless of considerable interest to us here: that is the Convention prohibiting the use of white lead in indoor <Col N="986" /> painting.  The Hours Convention is one that, I think, is very much like some other conventions that we have adopted here.  It is one that will not make any difference in practice, but yet I think it should be ratified.  The Convention regarding the prohibition of night baking is one that seems to me to be urgently necessary, because while all important bakers in the country, in conjunction with the men employed here, are in agreement that night baking should be prohibited, and, in fact, is not in operation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It would save a great deal of time if the Minister would deal with the matter now and give us the information.  The matter I am dealing with arises on the subjects that we have been just discussing, and this seemed to me to be an opportune time to raise it.  As I was saying, the Convention prohibiting night baking is important because there is a distinct tendency on the part of some of the smaller bakers to break the compacts that have been entered into and therefore to introduce an innovation which is undesirable. If the Convention were ratified here it would prohibit that for all time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has referred to three outstanding conventions already adopted.  Taking the conventions which appear on the Order Paper to-day and adding to them those that have previously been ratified, there will be, of the conventions passed by different meetings of the International Labour Organisation, eight left.  Of these the Senator has picked out three. We look very favourably on the convention prohibiting night baking. At the moment there is very little night baking carried on here.  What there is of it is mainly carried on by what one may describe as one family business.  At the moment, in view of the fact that night baking is only carried on mainly by one family we do not consider that it <Col N="987" /> would be right to prohibit those who occupy themselves in that particular way from doing so even though it means baking at night.  Another point that has to be considered is that if night baking were prohibited here it might have an adverse effect on some of our bakeries situate near the Border.  The bakers in that area have to enter into competition with North of Ireland firms.  As Senators know night baking is allowed in Northern Ireland.  The situation would be eased, from our point of view, if the British Government ratified this Convention because their doing so would take away that competitive element along the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same remarks, to some degree, apply to the eight-hour Convention. We feel that it would be a bad thing for this country to take a lead in this, seeing that some of the countries which surround us, and which have not adopted it, are more highly industrialised than ours.  These countries are very definitely competitors of ours.  By adopting the Convention we feel that we would be placing a particular handicap upon our people.  Again, the situation would be tremendously eased if the British Government decided to ratify that Convention, because their doing so would mean that the competitive element would disappear.  If we could imagine ourselves free from competition we would be quite clearly in favour of the ratification of that Convention.  With regard to the other Convention, the one prohibiting the use of white lead in the internal painting of buildings, we have had that under consideration for a very long time.  We could go as far as adopting the legislation which was passed in England in 1926.  The Lead Paint Act of 1926, which was passed there, has been found not to be up to the requirements of the Convention.  Therefore it would not be a satisfactory thing to introduce here and to proceed to ratify the Convention on foot of it. An investigation has been made here as to whether Irish barytes can be substituted for white lead.  At the <Col N="988" /> moment that investigation has not been completed.  At the moment we are giving that Convention favourable consideration, but just now we are not prepared to bring it before the Oireachtas for ratification.</P>

      <P>I move the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That it is expedient that a Joint Committee of the Seanad and the Dáil be set up to investigate the hardships inflicted on Irish workers consequent on the fact that they do not receive insurance benefits in the Saorstát in respect of contributions paid by them and <Col N="989" /> on their behalf while employed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and to report on the most suitable means to remove or alleviate these hardships:</P>
    <P>That seven Senators represent the Seanad on the said Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to rehearse all that I said on the last day on this subject. I appeal to the Seanad to be unanimous in asking that a Joint Committee be set up to investigate the hardships under which Irish migratory labourers suffer.  In connection with agricultural labourers there is one point I would like to refer to.  I understand that they do not stamp unemployment insurance cards outside of this country, but that they do stamp national health cards.  I believe they received benefits under the health insurance scheme up to the year 1928, but that at the moment the position is that only in isolated cases is benefit paid.  I did not intend to labour the case I made on the last day on this.  I hope the House will come to the unanimous conclusion that the question is one that merits investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is necessary to deal with the subject a little more fully than the Senator has done in moving his motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion that is now before the House varies from the one that was discussed last week inasmuch as it deals with Irish workers who go across the water and do not receive insurance benefit when they return. Therefore this motion is much wider than the one we discussed last week which used the phrase &ldquo;Irish migratory labourers&rdquo; and dealt only with unemployment insurance.  It was said, in respect of the motion last week, that all the information was available, and that there was no need for a committee of inquiry.  It may be true that remark would apply to the motion that is now before us so far as the Ministries are concerned.  I think it is true to say that Deputies and Senators are almost unanimously ignorant of what <Col N="990" /> the position is in respect of two or three classes of insurance which affect Irish workers going to England, Scotland or to Northern Ireland.  There is a good deal of complexity about the problem. Therefore, I think it would be quite useful, and probably a valuable procedure, if the Dáil were to agree with the Seanad to have a committee to investigate&mdash;I will not prejudice the case by saying the hardships&mdash; but the problem, and to see if the committee could find a means of removing such hardships as may be found to exist.</P>
    <P>Migratory labourers who go across the water from Mayo and Donegal were mainly under consideration last week&mdash;that is in respect of their unemployment insurance.  As has been pointed out, when they are working at agriculture across the water there is no deduction from their wages at all for unemployment insurance. But I think we are mostly aware of the fact that a good number of these labourers do not remain in agricultural employment.  They more or less change from agricultural to industrial or semi-industrial employment. We have seen that a number of them go into beet sugar factories across the water, following upon their employment in beet sugar cultivation.  In so far as they are engaged in industrial operations, their unemployment insurance contribution is deducted, but as has been pointed out, when they return to this country there is no benefit to come to them.  In respect of health insurance, whether they are employed in agriculture or in industry health insurance deductions are made from them, but as Irish migratory labourers they do not receive any benefit when they return, and that I think is partly their own fault.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure what the legal position at the moment is, but up to very recently it was within the competence of any Irish migratory labourer to get a card of exemption which would exempt him from having any deduction made from his wages by his employer while engaged at agricultural work, but the employer had to make a contribution. <Col N="991" /> The accumulated funds resulting from these contributions were, by agreement between the Insurance Commissioners made applicable to the insured persons in the counties concerned, mainly, as I say, the counties of Mayo and Donegal.  It happens, for some reason that I have no explanation of, that following the first two or three years of the passing of the Health Insurance Acts there was a steady decline in the number of persons who applied for these exemption certificates, until in recent years there have been only five or six applications from the thousands who go across the water and who apply for such certificates.  Consequently, it has been obligatory on their employers to make a deduction for health insurance for which the men receive no benefit.  If they had been exempt, and if the migratory labourers' fund which was established under the Health Insurance Acts had continued to be in credit, such moneys would have been spent in the localities concerned, first on nursing activities, and second on sanatorium benefit.  That was the arrangement made during the early years of the Health Insurance Acts, but it has fallen away simply because agricultural migratory labourers did not apply for these exemption cards. Therefore, they forfeited by their own act any benefit that would have accrued to them.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the term &ldquo;Irish migratory labourer&rdquo; is defined in the Health Insurance Acts.  It means persons who have no insurable occupation in this country and who go across the water for a period to work at agricultural operations.  In so far as these men work at other occupations than agriculture, of course, they come within the same category as all other workmen going from the Free State to Great Britain or Northern Ireland.  They are then just in the same position as a joiner, a carpenter, a dock labourer or any other workman and they come under the British law in respect to insurance.</P>
    <P>I think there is need for some compact <Col N="992" /> understanding or agreement between the various authorities.  I think it is unwise and unjust to base our claims upon allegations of hostility and on suggestions of ill-will and enmity.  I do not think that is the way to approach the matter, because if one liked one could say that it is a privilege the migratory labourer is seeking when he goes across the water in search of employment. That might be said. Consequently it might also be said that when seeking a privilege he could not look upon it as a hardship if a toll is charged for that right or opportunity.  For those of us who think that there is some value in having an association of States, friendly though separate, I certainly think there is a good case to be made from the standpoint of equity and justice that those who pay contributions to insurance funds either on the health side or on the unemployment side should derive some benefit out of these insurance funds.  If we take these funds and treat them as insurance funds it is clear that, in respect of those workers who go over for a period and return, they may receive benefit while they are there, but if there is no liability during the period after they have returned home, the fund itself is in profit, not only in respect of the amount that is contributed by the workman himself but in respect of the amount contributed by the employer in respect of the workman.</P>
    <P>I certainly think no undue request is being made when we ask that some recompense should be made to the Irish insurance funds owing to the fact that in respect of Irish workers working across the water moneys are being paid into British insurance funds.  I think that these funds at least ought to recoup the Irish funds to the amount that is to credit in respect of these workmen so that the Irish funds can pay out such sums as may be due in respect of the contributions that have been paid.  That strikes me as being a reasonable claim that ought to be put forward both by the Department of Industry and Commerce, in respect to unemployment <Col N="993" /> insurance, and by the Department of Local Government and Public Health which is responsible for all health insurance.  That would seem to me to be a very desirable thing.  There is a complication first in respect to migratory labourers, in the narrow sense of going to England or Scotland and working at agriculture, and of the same persons working occasionally at industrial occupations, and also in respect to seamen who are frequently at a loss by the fact that, though domiciled in Ireland, they work on a British ship. The problem of town workmen who go over to England occasionally and work at their own occupation, get unemployed and in coming home find they are not entitled to unemployment benefit, as well as the problem of workers of various kinds going into and coming out of the Six Counties have other complications which probably require somewhat different treatment.  They certainly require separate examination.</P>
    <P>All these problems seem to me to be worthy of examination.  There has been a more recent complication of particular interest to us due to the passing in Great Britain and Northern Ireland of the Contributory Insurance Act which leads to earlier pensions as well as to widows' and orphans' pensions.  All these problems are complicated.  Though all the information and the facts may be available to Ministries they are certainly not available to Deputies and Senators.  I support the motion mainly on the general principle that it is a valuable procedure that members of the Oireachtas should become intimate with some of these problems, so that their knowledge of affairs would enable them to bring light to bear upon a possible solution of them, and that in that way they would be able to assist governmental authority without relieving them of responsibility.</P>
    <P>The condition of things in Great Britain makes it opportune for the Oireachtas to inquire into this matter.  I think there is a receptiveness on such subjects at present that might be taken advantage of by reason of the fact that there is a <Col N="994" /> Labour Government in power, and they are largely dependent on the support of Irish workers in Great Britain.  I think that fact ought to be kept in mind in our consideration of the desirability of taking time by the forelock and looking at this matter in the widest sense embodied in the motion.  I therefore hope the Minister will look favourably on the proposition, and, if the Seanad approves of it, that he will use his influence with the Dáil to have the committee suggested set up.  I do not think that the committee can devise the means of alleviating this hardship and removing the difficulties as a committee.  I think it would inevitably require the assistance of at least two departments of State, and I think it is much more likely to be done if it is done with the good will of the parties of the two Houses. Some means may be found for bridging what difficulties there are, and seeking the assistance that is necessary to provide some benefits which are due to persons in respect of their contributions.  A case was made last week that it is not reasonable or proper to ask this State, out of its State funds, to make up any insurance benefits which might be payable to a person who becomes sick in this country, or unemployed, in respect of contributions made for insurance in another country.  I think that is reasonable, but I think it is possible to so present that case in respect of the two classes of insurance that there could be no refusal to transfer from the English funds such sums as had been contributed by Irish workers.  I hope the Minister will agree to the appointment of this committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought from what Senator Johnson said that there was considerable hope that anomalies would be rectified, seeing that there is a Labour Government in power in England.  I mentioned last week that the contribution paid by the <Col N="995" /> Irish labourer who goes across to England was 1/1d. per week, and that he had to keep and stamp two cards.  For that statement I relied on information supplied to me, and to a certain extent on my own personal knowledge.  They may be labouring men in Ireland, but in the majority of cases the employment they get in Wigan, Bolton and elsewhere, is temporary employment in connection with mines, and, therefore, they do pay 1/1d. per week. I was surprised to hear Senator Johnson suggest there ought to be a reasonable tone with regard to leave to work in England.  I do not agree that there should be any tone by an Irish worker getting employment in England.  I am very sorry it is necessary for so many of our labourers from the west of Ireland to have to go to England to seek employment, and I hope that will not continue very long.  Senator Johnson, of course, knows more about this question than we do, though we are greatly interested in it, but I understand that up to the Act of 1911 there was an arrangement by which the migratory labourer paid into the Post Office and thereby was enabled to get some recompense for the payments he made on these cards.  I am informed by a soldier of very distinuished rank, who does not happen to be here to-day, that in England sailors and soldiers have their cards stamped for them and when they come over here they receive no recompense in respect of these cards.  This is perhaps a matter with which Labour Senators are more conversant than I am.  At any rate, it is a matter for discussion and consideration, for I understand it affects a great many people.  I hope the Seanad will accept the motion, and I must congratulate Senator McEllin in bringing forward so very useful a motion.  He has brought forward other motions which have met with acceptance, and I hope this motion will be accepted also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Seanad will not pass this motion, and if it does I will ask the Dáil not to agree <Col N="996" /> with it, and for the reason that the Seanad is asked to set up a joint committee of the Dáil and Seanad to investigate the hardships inflicted on Irish workers owing to the fact that they do not receive insurance benefits in respect of contributions paid by them while employed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Two or three years ago I made a very full statement with regard to the position on this subject.  That statement is in the Official Reports.  In answer to Senator Byrne, who was then a member of the Dáil, I gave the history of the matter and set out the position.  The hardships, so far as they are hardships, in connection with this matter can be stated briefly so far as unemployment insurance is concerned.  The agricultural labourer who goes to England is not insurable. He has no hardship, for he pays nothing and gets nothing in return. In the case of a man who goes to England and gets into occupation of an insurable type, he pays in England and so does the State and employer. I think he pays 7d., the employer 8d., and the State 7½d.  If he stays in England, when unemployed he receives a minimum employment benefit of 2/6 a week and a maximum of 4/4.  The hardship that is inflicted is inflicted on him by himself by his leaving England.  As long as he stays in England he can get his contributions back.  If necessity drives him home the hardship is that when he gets work in another country he is paying one penny per day, including Sunday, for all the period he is in occupation, and he gets no benefit when he comes here.  Seamen are in a different position. No money is collected from seamen's wages.  The money is collected from the employer on behalf of the seamen, and that goes to a special fund. Seamen register in Great Britain.  If a seaman is an Irish national, and if he comes to reside in this country he draws no benefit, but he has paid for no benefit.  That is with regard to unemployment insurance benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to health insurance, people permanently resident in this country, under the British interpretation of the Health Insurance Act, <Col N="997" /> when they fall ill on the other side, as they are resident permanently, on the English interpretation, outside the United Kingdom, they cannot draw benefit, and that is accepted here as a proper interpretation of the wording of the Act.  That is the hardship.  The agricultural labourer is like the seaman.  No deduction is made from his wages, and he cannot draw benefit in consequence.  Soldiers are not insurable.  As far as people in industrial occupations are concerned, a man pays and also contributions are levied on the employer and the State.  He can draw benefit as long as he stays in England, but not when he comes here.  I do not know whether suggestions were made to alleviate this hardship.  I have a long statement of the proposals we made to the British Government and to the Northern Government with regard to these things.  This can only be done by agreement, and in no case did we get agreement.  The best proposition that could be made was that the British people should credit our unemployment and health insurance fund with the amount of moneys taken from our people on the other side and we would do the same in the case of Englishmen who came over here.</P>
    <P>The facts are against us.  Very few people from England or Scotland come over here to get occupation and who would be likely to benefit under the Health Insurance Acts.  That was the best suggestion, but it was completely and definitely turned down.  As to the receptiveness of the present British Government, they are not much more yielding than previous Governments when it comes to the question of paying out of their own Exchequer.  It is only a rough calculation, but no better calculation could be made by a committee sitting and watching the number of migratory labourers and others for a few years, that the cost to the English Exchequer would be about £33,000 a year if they transferred to us contributions received on behalf of Irish workers over there, so far as the Unemployment Insurance Fund is concerned. <Col N="998" /> I have not the figures, but they are available as regards health insurance.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion made was that we should do with regard to the man who goes across to an insurable occupation what is done with regard to the seamen.  There is no contribution made as regards seamen.  That would mean that local authorities looking for a man to employ, say, on roads, would naturally take the migratory labourer, for in a sense they would be charged less for him. Another suggestion is that we should simply foot the bill.  To give effect to a suggestion of that kind it should be brought forward as a special motion to have the money given as a dole and not as part of the insurance scheme.  We have kept the insurance scheme, with one period of extension, purely as an insurance scheme.  The suggestion made to me last year was that I should foot the bill for £56,000 out of the Insurance Fund.  That cannot be done.</P>
    <P>I ask the Seanad, instead of passing the resolution, to get the full statement made two or three years ago by me on this question.  The situation has not changed since then except that the contributions have been changed in England.  Read what is in that statement, and having considered it, bring forward a motion indicating a method of alleviating what are considered hardships, and indicating in a brief and concise way what are the hardships inflicted on the Irish workers referred to here.  If people have suggestions to make, let them be made, and let us have arguments on them, but there is no necessity for a joint committee of the Seanad and Dáil to consider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Northern Ireland people are concerned we put up about several alternatives to them as to the methods of dealing with this.  One we would <Col N="999" /> like to have accepted is that we would pay the benefits due to Northern workers here, and the Northern Ireland people would pay benefits to the Free State workers on each other's stamps.  The numbers who cross the Border from both sides are about equal, so that the unemployment and health insurance funds would lose and gain to about the same extent.  That suggestion has been refused.  I do not think any Labour representative is at all in the dark as to the efforts that have been made with the Northern Government. I am still hoping that they will look at the matter in a different light, but they have the right to deal with it as they wish, just as we have a very definite authority with our own fund here.  As a matter of fact, I am in communication in regard to both areas on this matter of unemployment insurance.</P>

The workers on both sides are satisfied that our Ministers have done everything reasonable to meet the situation as between the north and south.</P>

There is no reason why this committee, if set up, would not be <Col N="1000" /> able to show some return for its deliberations. For instance, the establishment of factories for the production of iodine from kelp was suggested. We have kelp in the raw state in abundance along the western seaboard.  At present French ships are taking it away and small remuneration is given to the people for collecting it and burning it. That is one of the things that could be discussed by the committee if set up to examine this question.</P>

I have read and re-read that statement dozens of times.  I have been unable, and others I have asked have been unable, to find any remedy.  The Minister has assured us he has the matter in hands, and that he frequently makes recommendations on the matter to the Northern Government.  Efforts that have been made by the Minister's Department to meet the requirements of Northern Ireland have been completely turned <Col N="1001" /> down.

      <P>What Senator Douglas asked me to say was that if Senator Mrs. Clarke did not attend to-day he would not like to press the Report Stage, because she had expressed the intention of putting down an amendment. What he suggested&mdash;and I make the suggestion on his behalf&mdash; was that the Report Stage should remain over until the first day on which we sit after Easter, on the distinct understanding that both that Stage and the Final Stage should be taken on that day, for it is important that that should be done.  I will put down a motion to suspend the Standing Orders for that purpose.</P>

      <P>I think that there is a real objection to the Senator's suggestion. We are likely to adjourn over Easter; as far as I can see there is no business likely to call us together for some days after the Dáil has resumed its work.  There is a real need for this Bill to be in the hands of the Dáil at the earliest possible date, because their position is that they have a crowded Order Paper, and if we delay in sending it to them it may be too late for enactment before the expiry of the present Act.  Therefore it is distinctly desirable that the Seanad should finish the Bill and have it in the hands of the <Col N="1003" /> Dáil at the resumption of their activities after Easter.  We may not meet for some time after the Dáil has resumed, because this would be practically the only business on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>Senator Brown's suggestion meets that point, because both stages will be taken on the next day.  We can only take one stage to-day.</P>

      <P>There is no motion on the Order Paper to-day to take all stages, and we cannot take them, so that if Senator Brown's suggestion is accepted it is the most we can do. We can pass the Bill next day, but we could not pass it to-day.</P>
      <P>Report Stage of the Bill adjourned until the next meeting of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.55 p.m. sine die.</P>
