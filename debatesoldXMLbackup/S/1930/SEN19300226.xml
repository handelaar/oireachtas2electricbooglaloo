      <P>The following message has been received from the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Eireann has agreed to amendments Nos. 1 to 5 inclusive, and to amendment No. 7 made by Seanad Eireann to the Game Preservation Bill, 1929; it has agreed to amendment No. 6 as amended by the deletion of sub-section (5) of the proposed new section.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Before any motion is moved arising out of the amendment by the Dáil to amendment No. 6 made in this House, I think the Seanad would welcome your opinion, sir, upon the following point. Amendment No. 6 empowers the Minister to set up a consultative council for the purpose of advising him in connection with the provisions of the Act, and sub-section (5) provides for the payment of travelling expenses to the members of such council.  The Dáil has accepted the amendment minus sub-section (5), and one might infer from the debate in the other House that the reason for the non-acceptance of sub-section (5) is that this is a money clause inserted by the Seanad in a non-Money Bill.  I should like to know whether, in your opinion, it is within the competence of this House to insert such an amendment in the Bill.</P>

      <P>No reason is given in the message received from the Dáil for the refusal of that House to agree to sub-section (5), but if the facts are as stated by Senator Miss Browne it is my opinion (in which I am fortified by that of my predecessor) that there is nothing in the <Col N="566" /> Constitution or otherwise to prevent the Seanad inserting such an amendment.</P>

      <P>Would it be possible to have the Minister present?  He might tell us the reason why he did not recommend the Dáil to accept this portion of the amendment. Possibly there may be power to pay expenses without any such addition. That has been suggested to me. If such a reason were given I would be in favour of agreeing with the Dáil, but, on the other hand, if he gave as a reason that we had exceeded our powers, I would be strongly in favour of refusing to agree with that decision.</P>

It is still within the competence of the House to consider whether, on its merits, it should accept the amendment made by the Dáil or reject it.  It would be well, possibly, to have the reason given for its rejection in the other House. With the permission of the House, we will let the matter stand over for the attendance of the Minister.</P>

      <P>On this Bill I am not proposing to make any movement to obstruct its passage, but I want to put in a formal objection to taking it without having had any explanation of its purpose.  I did not intervene on the Second Reading, but this is a Bill which ought to have been explained to the House, and I think we ought to establish the usage that, at least, at any early stage in the presentation or consideration of any Bill, someone should explain what it means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am a member of the Governing Body of University College, Cork, perhaps I may be permitted to say that when the scheme <Col N="568" /> was first mooted in Cork in connection with the Faculty of Dairy Science a certain amount was agreed on with the Minister for Finance for a certain building.  Then we were lucky enough to secure on one occasion the attendance of the President and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is member for the University.  We showed them over the buildings of University College, and induced them to give us a stone building, which added a certain amount to the cost in excess of what had been budgeted for in the first instance.  That necessitated cutting out the lecture theatre.  This Bill introduces the lecture theatre again. Under the circumstances the Bill should go through, as the work is actually going on.  I think this Bill is only meant to regularise it.</P>

      <P>There is a good deal in the point Senator Johnson mentioned, that this House is not properly fitted to pass measures of legislation that it knows nothing about.  It seems to me that the position bears out my contention of years ago, that the Government should have some representative in the Seanad to explain the particulars of special Bills.  It is not in accordance with the dignity of the House and not in accordance with the dignity of the Government, that we should be asked to pass measures of legislation which may be important. without having any explanation of these measures.  I want to reiterate my conviction&mdash;and this perhaps might be an opportunity for the Government to consider whether they should not have some representative in the Seanad who would know what measures of legislation are likely to arise, and inform the Seanad of their contents.  I made that claim when the Seanad was first set up, and I think our experience has proved that it would be a very necessary and useful change to make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Fitzgerald) Desmond FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could explain this matter.  At the moment the Minister for Agriculture is engaged in the Dáil, and it is not possible for <Col N="569" /> him to attend.  Neither is it possible to know exactly when a particular item on the Agenda will come on. As far as this Bill is concerned the Minister explained the circumstances in the Dáil some time ago.  There was an original estimate for buildings on a given site.  Some objection was raised to that site being used for that purpose, and consequently another site had to be chosen.  The other site chosen was contiguous to or part of University College property, and it was necessary that the new building should conform architecturally to the surrounding buildings of the University.  A different estimate had to be prepared.  That really is, I think, an outline of the circumstances, and the point which this Bill is intended to meet.  I do not think there is any other point in the matter.  I do not know if the Minister were here that he could elaborate very much on what I have said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Thomas Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>On the assurance of the Minister I have no objection whatever to the Bill being taken now.  As we did not know anything about it I think the objection was only natural.  We are fortunate in the Minister's presence as he let us know exactly what the Bill intended to do.  There is no reason whatever after the Minister's explanation why the House should not pass this Bill forthwith.</P>

    <P>As the House will notice this is a Money Bill, and I understand it is necessary it should be returned within twenty-one days.  A fortnight has elapsed since it was sent up from the other House, so that I think it would be advisable to pass this motion and take the remaining stages to-day.

      <P>We are not in the habit of making speeches for the sake of making speeches in this House, but it seems a pity that we should pass the final stage of a Bill which carries an amendment to the Constitution, which this House has been agitating for about six years, without some reference to the fact that it leaves us in a very much better position than before, from our point of view.  We hope it will never be exercised, and that there will never be a dispute as to what is or what is not a Money Bill.  One thing is certain that, with the passing of this Bill and the consequential alteration of the Constitution, it is possible&mdash;whereas it was practically impossible before&mdash;for this House to challenge such a decision if the occasion arises, and if the majority of the members of the Seanad wish to challenge it.  It is probably not perfect but I think it is a great improvement from our point of view.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell the House if it is not the case that in the Fishery Bill there is a clause similar to this one, which puts a certain amount of expense on the Exchequer.

If there is not, I do not propose to move that we should insist on our amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I am not going to dispute this matter, I do not agree with the suggestion that the Seanad cannot insert an amendment <Col N="572" /> in a Bill dealing with money. The question has arisen several times in this House, and the other position has always been taken up.  The only occasion when such a plea could be put forward is when there is a Money Bill and when the Ceann Comhairle certifies that it is a Money Bill.  That was not put forward in this case, so that there is really no reason why we should not insist on the amendment.  But on the merits I have no wish to force it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You will remember, Senator, I gave my ruling on the matter as far as my opinion went, and it is purely on the merits we are discussing the question now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement made by the Minister definitely raises an issue which I had hoped would not necessarily have been raised in this case.  When I suggested that we might debate this matter in the presence of the Minister, I thought he would have found some other reason which in itself would have been adequate, and which would mean that we need not deal with a comparatively small matter.  We know now that one of the underlying reasons is because this amendment of ours, in a Bill which was not a Money Bill, had to do with money&mdash;I think these were the words used.  I think it is extremely important that the House should consider that before it allows a usage and a practice to grow up which will take away powers definitely conferred on it by the Constitution. There is in the Constitution definite provision by which Bills can be regarded as Money Bills on the certificate of the Ceann Comhairle. Once a Bill is a Money Bill the powers of this House are definitely defined and limited, and we do not for one moment challenge that limitation.  But in a Bill which has not been so certified, there should not be&mdash;and I respectfully suggest that your ruling, sir, is right&mdash;and there is not any limit as to the amendments which we can make, except the limit which is imposed by the Money Resolution in the Dáil, which controls the expenditure. <Col N="573" /> When a Bill involves an expenditure of money a message is received from the Governor-General&mdash;in effect from the Government of the day&mdash;and that limits the amount of expenditure. As long as amendments to a Bill are within that limit there is no doubt, in my opinion, that this House can make amendments which deal with money matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The control obviously is with the Dáil, but the details are with us as much as with the Dáil, and if we were to admit, or even to imply that we agreed, or even consented, that when amendments of this kind are made they will be, for the underlying reason stated by the Minister &mdash;that they deal with money&mdash;that they will be rejected and sent back to us, and that we will then submit, we will find that without any amendment of the Constitution whatever, a usage will have grown up by which this House will have given away part of its powers.  I am not in favour of this House claiming powers which it has not got, but I think it should hesitate before giving away powers which clearly and definitely it has under the Constitution.  This matter came up some time ago; it was not simply a matter for ruling by the Chairman, but, if my memory is right, a Committee representative of the different groups was appointed to deal with it.  The Committee met, and I think sent in an unanimous report on the lines I have stated. That has not been challenged in any way by the Dáil.  I think it should be made quite clear that there is no message from the Dáil; that no statement was made in the Dáil challenging that decision.  I do not think it can be challenged that the underlying reason why this amendment was sent back was because it dealt with money.  If a different reason were given by the Minister, or if it was stated that the amendment was unnecessary, I would not quarrel and would agree to the motion proposed by Senator the Earl of Granard.  But in this case no other reason was given, and the suggestion was made that the Dáil would return amendments which dealt with money, even <Col N="574" /> though the Bill is not a Money Bill. I think it would be right for us in this case to insist on our amendment. If it comes back again let us have a conference and clear the matter up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Into the constitutional question which Senator Douglas has raised, I do not propose to enter.  It is certainly within the function of the Dáil to reject or accept, or partly reject or partly accept any amendment which has been put forward by the Seanad. Here the Dáil has partly accepted and partly rejected an amendment that was put forward by the Seanad. This is not a vital matter, because I believe that in fact Section 32 is sufficient if this Advisory Council were set up.  If expenses were to be paid to the members of the Advisory Council, then I believe they could be paid under Section 32.  That is my view.  But, on the main point, if the Seanad refuses this amendment as it has come up from the Dáil, and insists on keeping in this sub-section, then I am afraid the Bill will be held up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is really of too little importance to raise a big constitutional issue about regarding the rights of the two Houses.  I think it was quite unnecessary, in the first instance, to suggest asking the Dáil for reasons for rejecting the amendment.  The Minister has given what he considers to be one reason, but the majority in the Dáil might give another reason. On the whole, I think the amendment was rejected simply and solely on its merits, and I think it is on its merits we should deal with it here. Therefore, I would support the motion that the Seanad do not insist on that part of its amendment to which the Dáil does not agree, whilst, of course, reserving all rights under the Constitution and without prejudice at all to the merits or demerits of the amendment.  I agree <Col N="575" /> with the statement made by Senator Douglas, and I do not think that can be very seriously questioned in any way, but I would prefer that we would deal with this amendment to-day, simply and solely on the merits, without regard to its constitutional importance or otherwise, and thereby preserve all our rights in that respect, or, at least, not prejudice them, because I do not think it can be said that the question of usage can be raised here, as we are not admitting the contention the Minister seemed to put forward.  If on an important measure such a contention were put forward, remedies are available for testing its legality or otherwise.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately the Minister was not here when this matter came on for consideration and when a question was asked me by Senator Miss Browne as regards this amendment in the Dáil.  She asked me if, under certain conditions, it was within our competence to insert a money clause in a non-money Bill. I gave what I considered was a reasoned answer: I said I was not aware, nor am I now aware, of the reasons given by the Dáil for rejecting the amendment, but if it was that we had no power to insert the amendment I considered that we had the power.  My predecessor gave a similar ruling on the same point. Senator the Earl of Granard has now proposed that we accept the amendment made by the Dáil on its merits, and I hope that on these grounds the Seanad will consider the non-acceptance of the amendment.</P>

      <P>Whatever the merits of this amendment may be, the statement of the Minister is on record that, in his view, the underlying reason for the rejection of the Seanad's amendment by the Dáil was due to the fact that it involved a question of the expenditure of money. In any dispute on a more important matter of this kind that may arise between the two Houses that would be bound to be regarded as a precedent, and under the circumstances <Col N="576" /> I am very strongly in favour of insisting on our amendment, and I shall vote in favour of insisting on it.</P>

      <P>I did not take it from the Minister that he gave it as a definite opinion that that was the underlying reason.  His words were &mdash;I am subject to correction&mdash;&ldquo;Possibly it was one of the underlying reasons,&rdquo; so that it may or may not be.  I think the position ought to be cleared up as between the Dáil and the Seanad before we pass any motion in regard to the matter.  It would be very well if the matter was referred back to the Dáil and if they were asked on what grounds, for the enlightenment of the Seanad, this deletion was made.  We would then be in a better position to discuss the whole question.  The whole thing is vague and indefinite; we do not know on what grounds they have made this deletion.  I think it is absolutely essential that we should know what the grounds were before we would be in a position to come to a decision on the matter.  The financial aspect of it may have had nothing at all to do with their decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if we consider the minds of the people in the Dáil, and if we consider the financial position of the country we will agree that the Dáil did not reject it because the Seanad inserted this amendment in the Bill, but that it was really on the question of expense that they did so.  We agree that the Seanad has power to insert such an amendment, but the members of the Dáil, not wishing to spend money and wishing to curtail expenses, refused to accept the amendment&mdash;not on the point that we had not power to put it in.  For that reason I think, on the merits of the case, we ought to agree with the Dáil.</P>

      <P>There really can be no doubt whatever as to what was the motive of the Dáil in rejecting the amendment when one reads the report of the discussion on it.  The Minister, in moving that the Dáil disagree with the amendment, quoted the amendment, and then <Col N="577" /> went on to say: &ldquo;That is a money clause, and that has been inserted in the amendment.  I would suggest to the Dáil that sub-section (5) should not be accepted by this House, but that the House would accept this new Section 31 with the exception of sub-section (5).&rdquo;  There was no further discussion whatever on the matter, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who was in the Chair, then said: &ldquo;The Minister is moving to amend the amendment by the deletion of sub-section (5),&rdquo; and the Minister said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and the deletion of sub-section (5) was agreed to.  That was the only point mentioned in the whole discussion, and we must accept that as the reason why the Dáil disagreed with the amendment.</P>

      <P>I was quite of the opinion that this is not a matter that would necessarily lead to a conference between the two Houses, and I was going to point out that there was no means of obtaining the reason why the Dáil disagreed except by a conference of members appointed by the two Houses.  Nobody can speak for the Dáil in such a matter as this except the Ceann Comhairle, because there may be 152 reasons as to why the Dáil disagreed with the amendment. But inasmuch as from what Senator Hooper has quoted, only one reason was given by the Minister in charge, I think that that makes a distinct change in the position, and I am now inclined to the view that we ought to have the position defined and seek a conference as provided for in 92B of the Standing Orders, which says: &ldquo;In the case of disagreement between the Seanad and the Dáil in regard to any Money Bill, the Seanad may propose a conference between members representing both Houses for the purpose of discussing the points of disagreement.&rdquo;  I think the very fact that we have called for that conference, if we do so, will be sufficient to maintain our rights in the matter, and I do not think that the Dáil would insist, particularly as it is a view very widely held in the Seanad, that on <Col N="578" /> its merits the amendment we have inserted is not very important, and need not be insisted upon, but that we are establishing the right of the Seanad in this matter (in view of the discussion which Senator Hooper quoted) through the medium of a conference between members appointed by the two Houses, and that we should send a message to the Dáil in accordance with the procedure contained in 92B of the Standing Orders.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that there is a tremendous amount of <Col N="580" /> needless alarm about the rights of this House.  I do not think that the words quoted from the Dáil Report are a definite challenge to the ruling which you have given and which seems to be the understanding upon which this House has acted.  The words quoted by Senator Hooper were: &ldquo;That is a money clause and that has been inserted in the amendment.&rdquo; Following that, the Minister said: &ldquo;I would suggest to the Dáil that sub-section (5) should not be accepted.&rdquo; It is not made clear and it is not even implied, in my opinion, that that is the reason why the Minister suggested disagreement in the other House, and I think we are making a mountain of a molehill if we try to create a kind of constitutional precedent at the present time. If there is anything in the position that is not clear it is bound to arise at some future time, and if we think that this right which, according to your ruling, we exercise, is being challenged, it will be quite within the competence of this House on the occasion of some future Bill to act in such a way as will get a definite response from the Dáil as to what its exact attitude is.  Personally, I think it would be a mistake to precipitate a situation which, according to your ruling, is not either existent or imminent.</P>

The Minister comes along and says: &ldquo;Yes, this was a money clause.&rdquo;  But we felt we had full power in the case of a non-money Bill.  I stated that; it was reiterated by various Senators; I think anything we do will not make that opinion of ours stronger, and that by taking the step proposed we will have got all that is needful, and will have preserved the rights and privileges of this House.</P>

      <P>As I raised this matter at some length might I express my view that, having regard to the whole discussion, it might be just as well, and perhaps more dignified to pass Senator the Earl of Granard's motion without any explanation?  I think that explanation would be undignified and would not really help the matter.  What I personally wanted to achieve was that amendments would not come back to this House just for the reason that they happened to be money amendments. I believe that no matter what we have said now, this may happen again.  If it does happen I believe that Senator Johnson's suggestion&mdash; to ask for a conference&mdash;would be the right course.  Apparently the House does not wish to do that now, and I think the best thing is to pass the motion; but I certainly think that if such an amendment came up again in similar circumstances a conference should be held before and not after.</P>

      <P>I think that the Cathaoirleach speaks with authority for the Seanad on points of order, and when he has made the statement that he has made, it ought to be <Col N="582" /> accepted as the view of the whole Seanad.  He is not the first who made it; his predecessor made exactly the same statement, and on one or two occasions we insisted on that and carried our way.  After all, it does not seem necessary to pass a new resolution; we have only to rely on the decision of the Cathaoirleach that the matter would be in order if we did choose to insist on it as far as the money was concerned.</P>

      <P>If this House is to act with a degree of reasonable consistency it will throw out Senator the Earl of Granard's motion.  I think it was Senator the McGillycuddy who introduced this amendment. The matter was debated and a reasoned case was put forward for the insertion of the amendment.  It was inserted in the Bill by a majority vote.  I voted against it.  I think in the absence of any reasons put forward by the Minister or by the other House for the deletion of the amendment, that the Seanad, if it is <Col N="583" /> to be in any way consistent at all, should absolutely stand for the continuance of that amendment in the Bill.  That is the only way in which to bring the matter to an issue.  I do not see why we should run away from the question.  No reasoned case has been made by anybody as to why those Senators who voted for the insertion of that amendment before should run away from the opinion they then voted for. I see none whatever.  I will vote for Senator the Earl of Granard's proposal, but the one thing for those who voted for the insertion of the amendment to do is to vote against that proposal.</P>

That is not the position we ought to take up.  I want to make it clear that, subject to that, I propose to vote against Senator the Earl of Granard's motion.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Hanlon tried to create the impression that when an amendment is carried here on a vote, come weal, come woe, no matter what happened in the Dáil, that that amendment should be insisted upon&mdash;at least, that was the inference I gathered from what he said.  Last week we had a message from the Dáil dealing with the National Monuments Bill, stating that some of our amendments were agreed to and that some were dissented from.  No reasons were given, so far as I could make out, why the Dáil dissented from certain amendments, but certainly a majority in favour of these amendments was registered in this House.  If we were to act according to Senator O'Hanlon we should last week have insisted upon our amendments for precisely the same reasons as he adduced in regard to this.  We did not do so, and I think the same procedure holds just as good to-day as it did last week in regard to the other amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest possible respect, I think that my attitude is slightly different from what has been stated by Senator Milroy. If Senator Milroy's attitude is that the will of the Dáil must always prevail, even in respect of the deliberations and decisions of this House, then I must disagree with him.  I do not follow the line that when we have inserted an amendment we should take it out because the Dáil tells us we must do so.  We have certain rights and prerogatives and, following what Senator Douglas has said, we should strive to maintain them.  No case has been made, either in this House or outside this House, <Col N="585" /> against the decision arrived at by the House in respect of this amendment. If the House is to be consistent, in the absence of any case, surely the House will insist upon the retention of its amendment in the Bill?</P>
      <P>That is merely consistency, and I think it is an honourable and a fair practice.  I do not want to refer to what Senator Hooper said.  He said that no reason had been given in the Dáil.  There was a reason given in the Dáil.  There is the suggestion that if we give way on this, it means in an inferential way that we were partly whittling down our powers in this House.  I object to any such suggestion as that.</P>

The purpose of this Bill, as I understand it, is to simplify the administration in connection with this property.

It seeks, in effect, to leave the letting and the disposal of disused workhouses to the local authorities, At present, whether it was intended or not at the beginning, the Minister has the disposal of disused workhouses. It seems to me to be rather unwise and unsatisfactory that disused workhouses, disused barracks, and buildings of that description, which are capable of accommodating with a reasonable amount of comfort a considerable number of people should be disposed of in piece-meal fashion without regard to any general purpose.  I am convinced that before very long there will evolve a general national policy to deal with questions of employment and unemployment.  I think it will be found that buildings such as disused barracks and workhouses will <Col N="588" /> be needed in different centres throughout the country as a temporary home for numbers of men congregated for the purpose of doing public work of a useful character.</P>
      <P>I would like to put the question to the Minister for Local Government that it would be good policy, if he has any views for the future and is not thinking of day to day requirements, that he should retain within his control buildings such as disused workhouses and disused barracks so that it will not be necessary to find accommodation, in the way of huts, for men organised for the purpose of earning a livelihood on public works.  It seems to me it would be worth the Minister's while to consider that aspect of the matter which touches his own Department so closely.  He should also, I think, bear in mind that he himself did outline a policy which practically suggested that there would need to be considerable groupings of men, living together and going out in numbers from different centres to do public work of a useful character.  I throw that suggestion out in the hope that the Minister may take note of it, and so that he may realise that his promise, or his suggestion, of some years ago has not been entirely forgotten.</P>

      <P>With regard to what Senator Johnson has said, I would like to call attention to the fact that there are a number of these old workhouses and institutions of that kind more or less lying derelict in different parts of the country. If they are allowed to remain in their present condition there is a great likelihood that they will become perfectly useless either for the purpose that Senator Johnson suggests or for any other purpose.  A number of them that I know myself seem to be getting daily into a state of complete disrepair.  They are becoming almost ruins.  If the suggestion made by Senator Johnson is not put into effect, then I think a small amount of money might be advantageously spent in keeping them in a state of repair during the period that they are unoccupied.  I have not very <Col N="589" /> much enthusiasm myself as regards the use of them as tenements or as locations for men who may be gathered together to engage on some class of public works.  A good many of these buildings are crumbling away at the present time.  A little money could be well spent in keeping them in a state of repair, so that they may be utilised later on for such purposes as secondary or technical schools or workshops.  I think it is about time that some attention was paid to their condition.</P>

      <P>I think it is time that something should be done to define who is to take charge of these old workhouse buildings.  At the present time if a county council wants to get control of one of them for the purpose of starting an industry, it has first to consult the Minister.  To my mind the county councils would be the proper bodies to have control over these workhouses.  As far as I know, the moneys used to put up these buildings were raised locally. Some of those buildings might be utilised as centres for the starting of industries of one kind or another. In the County Monaghan one of the workhouses is at present being used as a technical school.  There are some other workhouses in the county that are rapidly becoming dilapidated. I think if the county councils had control of them they would be able to utilise them for the purpose of starting some useful work in them.  Some of these buildings could also be converted into artisans' dwellings.  I think the body having control over these old buildings should be clearly defined in some way.  At present there is a good deal of confusion with regard to who is in control of them, and I hope that matter will receive the Minister's attention.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point made that a number of these old workhouse buildings are falling into a state of disrepair, I think it is pertinent to call attention to what the Minister for Local Government said when moving the Second Reading of this Bill in the Dáil.  He said <Col N="590" /> it was proposed to impose on local authorities the duty of keeping and maintaining in good tenantable order and repair the buildings dealt with in the Bill.  Therefore, I think that the point made by Senator Connolly with regard to keeping these buildings in a state of repair is being met as far as this Bill is concerned. It is clear, also, from the terms of the Bill and from the speech of the Minister in the Dáil, that any looseness that hitherto existed as to the control of these buildings is to be attended to under the Bill.</P>

      <P>I ask the House not to accept this amendment.  This series of amendments has been put down&mdash;I am not divulging any secret in saying this&mdash;at the suggestion of a bill-posting company. The suggestion in this amendment is that the words &ldquo;the district or&rdquo; be deleted.  One of the reasons for the amendment&mdash;the reason has not been stated to the House, but it has been stated privately&mdash;is that the deletion of these words will bring the Bill into conformity with the British Rules.  That is not quite correct.  The Bill, as submitted by the Committee, is, I think, quite sufficient but is the least that is necessary to protect the amenities of any area.  The section reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The responsible authority may, and when required by the Minister shall, serve a notice upon any person, requiring him within reasonable time to remove any advertisement, advertising station or hoarding or sign, whether attached or not attached to the buildings where the amenity of the district or any public or private open space in the area is, in the opinion of the responsible authority or the Minister, injured by the display of such advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> The proposal in this amendment is to delete the words &ldquo;the district or.&rdquo;  The proposal in a later amendment is to leave out the district and only deal with public parks.  If we are going to propose to give the Minister power to remove offensive advertisements only in the case of public parks, there is no use in putting in such a section as this at all, because it is already provided that a local authority can protect public parks without any new Act.  This whole series of amendments would, if adopted, go far to destroy a section intended to protect the public against offensive and unsightly advertisements. I ask the House not to agree to the amendment.</P>

      <P>This series of amendments was only presented to members as they came here to-day. In view of their importance&mdash;so far as we know they are at the instance of a commercial concern engaged in advertising posters&mdash;we should, I think, either turn them down altogether at once or adjourn the Report Stage of this Bill until such time as we have an opportunity of giving them adequate consideration. In view of the fact that I only received my copy of the amendments a short time ago, I do not like to express any opinion on them now. I think, however, that we ought either to defeat all of them to-day or adjourn the consideration of the Report Stage of the Bill until we see what are the implications in these amendments.</P>

These amendments have been prepared by merely one advertising firm outside, and the Senator who has moved them has given no argument or reason in support of them good, bad or indifferent.  It is obvious without a prolonged examination that the result of adopting amendments such as the one now under discussion would be that anyone in any of the finest residential districts could set his front garden to an advertising agency and have garish or lurid <Col N="593" /> posters displayed in that garden, and the Town Planning Bill would not be able to remedy that.  In other words, you could only preserve the amenities of a public park or open space, but, as Senator Johnson has pointed out, a public authority has power to preserve the amenities of such a place.  What we want is to preserve the amenities of a district, particularly residential districts in rural areas.  That is what this Bill proposes to do.  I do not think the House need have any hesitation in rejecting the amendment unless we are to scrap one of the principal objects of the Bill.</P>

That is not work such a court should be called upon to perform.  It is not a question of interpreting law or sentencing people to imprisonment.  This is a case where a specialised department ought to be the judge.  I think the proposal in the amendment is quite unreasonable and would diminish the value of the Bill considerably.</P>

    <Title>Formation of Volunteer Reserve.</Title>
    <P>The Debate was resumed on the following motion by Senator Johnson:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad disapproves of the procedure adopted by the Minister for Defence in the formation of a Volunteer Reserve as being an abuse of the power of the Minister and an encroachment upon the authority of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion simply and solely because of the irregular and illegal manner in which the new Volunteer Reserve has been called into being.  I do not wish to be taken as being in favour of the suggestion that we should have no defence forces at all, because I believe the time has not yet arrived when we, any more than any other State, can abolish our Army, but it is difficult to understand why the Minister felt it necessary to resort to an administrative subterfuge in order to add this Volunteer Reserve to the defence forces of the country.  Judging by numerous expressions of opinion, both inside and outside the Oireachtas, it seems pretty clear that <Col N="597" /> almost all shades of opinion were in favour of a Volunteer Army rather than a large standing Army.  There was, therefore, no reason to assume that there would be any serious opposition to a Bill authorising the Minister to set up a Reserve such as that he has set up without the authority of the Oireachtas.  Even granting that there might be a couple of months delay in the passing of a Bill through the Oireachtas, there was no reason for anxiety, for there was no urgency whatever about the matter.  However, instead of bringing forward a Bill to give him the necessary powers, he proceeds in a most irregular and unseemly manner to bring the Oireachtas into contempt, so that by an extraordinary manipulation of an Act of Parliament he gives himself powers which he must have known the Act did not give him or intend to give him, however it might have been worded.  By a process of legal surgery which completely sets aside the spirit of the Defence Forces Act of 1923, he has erected an inverted pyramid with its base high up in the air, the base being the new volunteer Reserve. He has shown by what he has done the extent to which a Minister, by the aid of clever lawyers, can make Parliament look ridiculous by extorting from a certain Act of Parliament powers which Parliament never intended to confer on the Minister or anybody else.</P>
      <P>Section 210 of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, provides for the formation of a Reserve, and it clearly defines the manner in which that Reserve should be composed.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be lawful for the Executive Council to raise and maintain a reserve force (hereinafter referred to as the Reserve) for the Forces consisting of such number of officers, non-commissioned officers and men as may from time to time be provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oireachtas made no provision, financial or otherwise, for this reserve, as it is now set up.  Section 212 says: &ldquo;The Reserve shall consist <Col N="598" /> of&mdash;1.  The Reserve of Officers; 2.  The Reserve of Men.&rdquo;  Section 213 deals with the reserve of officers and it lays it down that the Reserve of Officers &ldquo;shall consist of officers of the Forces who have retired therefrom; (2) Officers belonging to the Reserve of Officers shall be liable to be recalled to service in the Forces under such conditions as may be prescribed,&rdquo; and so on.  Section 214 says: &ldquo;The Reserve of Men shall consist of non-commissioned officers and men who having served in the Forces have been transferred to the Reserve in pursuance of Part II., Chapter V., of this Act.&rdquo;  The whole spirit of the Act of 1923 goes to show that the reserve which that Act contemplated was to be a reserve of men who had actually served in the National Army either as officers. non-commissioned officers or men. It is true that under one section&mdash; 146, I think, of that Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, from time to time by general or special regulations, vary the conditions of service, so as to permit a soldier of the Forces in any service, with the assent of the Minister, either&mdash;(a) To enter the Reserve at once for the residue unexpired of the term of his original enlistment; or (b) To extend his army service for all or any part of the residue unexpired of such term.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It provides for the shortening of the period during which a man may spend in the army before he may be permitted to go into the Reserve, but it clearly contemplates that he shall have served in the army.  The Minister complies with this, what might be termed empty formula, by getting a man to sign the ordinary attestation form swearing him in as a member of the National Army to serve for a period of three years, and he then fills in another form applying to be transferred at once to the Volunteer Reserve.  The application is granted and he can, thereby, say with perfect truth, at least from a theoretical point of view, that he has served in the National Army and is now in the Volunteer Reserve, while of course, in strict and actual <Col N="599" /> commonsense fact he has never been a soldier.  Paragraph 1 of the Defence Forces Regulations dated the 18th October, 1929, says: &ldquo;There shall be established within the Reserve a class which shall be known as the Volunteer Reserve.&rdquo;  The wording clearly shows that the Minister looks on this as a sort of parenthetical reserve within the reserve contemplated by legislation. In paragraph 8 of Section 2 it is stated that &ldquo;(i) Men desirous of entering the Volunteer Reserve will be enlisted for a period of three years in the Forces.&rdquo;  A subsequent paragraph&mdash;paragraph 1, in page 15 of the regulations says: &ldquo;You will engage to serve the Executive Council of Saorstát Eireann for such term as is agreed on attestation,&rdquo; thereby, implying that a man may enter for a lesser period than three years or a greater period.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of uncertainty about the actual period during which a man may belong to this reserve. Paragraph 8 (iii) says:&mdash;&ldquo;A soldier of the Forces who in completing his attestation form declares that he desires immediate transfer to the Volunteer Reserve may, at any time after the commencement of his service, be removed from the Forces and transferred to the Volunteer Reserve.&rdquo;  This is a considerable straining of the term of service in the Forces.  A man cannot claim to have served in the Forces who has merely signed an attestation form and in three minutes' time is transferred to the Volunteer Reserve.  The attestation form is a rather elaborate document.  Paragraph 17 says:&mdash;&ldquo;Are you willing to serve as follows: (a) In Oglaigh na h-Eireann until removed therefrom and transferred to the Volunteer Reserve, and in the Volunteer Reserve for the residue unexpired of a period of three years?&rdquo;  It goes through the farce of asking a man if he is prepared to serve in the National Army until such time as he is transferred to the Volunteer Reserve Force.  He signs that.  Then he swears an oath.</P>
    <P>I ..................... do solemnly <Col N="600" /> swear (or declare) that I have this day freely and voluntarily enlisted as a soldier in Oglaigh na hEireann.</P>
    <P>The concluding portion of the oath makes him swear:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I will not while I am a soldier in Oglaigh na hEireann join or be a member of or subscribe to any political society or organisation whatsoever or any secret society whatsoever.</P>
    <P>After being a member of the National Army for about two or three minutes, during which he is not to be a member of any political society or any secret society, the note at the foot of the page says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The provisions of the above Oath cease to apply to a soldier when he has been transferred to the Reserve.  A member of the Volunteer Reserve will therefore be entitled to engage in any lawful political activities except when in case of imminent national danger or great emergency the Reserve has been called out on permanent service.</P>
    <P>This is the subterfuge resorted to in order to set up the Volunteer Reserve. At page 22 there is a form in which the soldier applies for a transfer:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I ...................... having this day duly enlisted as a soldier in Oglaigh na hEireann for a period of three years do hereby make application for immediate transfer to the Volunteer Reserve for the residue unexpired of such enlistment....</P>
    <P>There is another form to be signed by the Attesting Officer as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I hereby certify that No. ............ Rank .......... Name .............. being a soldier of the Forces has been transferred to the Volunteer Reserve with effect from the ....... day of............</P>
    <P>This is an example of the preciseness and respect for Acts of the Oireachtas that is set to the young recruit who is to be a citizen soldier, and who would naturally be expected <Col N="601" /> to have some respect for the Parliamentary institutions of the State which he may have to defend with his life.  But if he has any intelligence at all, as it is assumed he will have if he is accepted, he must see the elaborate resorts that have to be adopted in order to get round, or outside, an Act of the Parliament of that State.  I think it is a really lamentable example to set a young recruit.  It is the enactment of a melancholy farce to resort to devices of this sort, seeing that the obvious, the easy, and the honest course was to come to the Oireachtas and get the necessary powers.  I do not know where the Minister proposes to get money to pay for this Volunteer Reserve.</P>

      <P>The Estimates for 1929-30 did not make any provision for this Reserve.  There is provision for Army Reserves, Class A and Class B, and for a Reserve of Officers, but there is no provision for financing a Reserve such as that now set up, except by the most extraordinary stretching of the wording of the Act of Parliament.  As I said, I do not know why the Minister should have thought it necessary to resort to this peculiar proceeding, because I cannot contemplate any serious opposition, in view of the manner in which Deputies and Senators have committed themselves to the principle of a volunteer reserve. It is a very serious matter from the point of view of the safety of the State, and from the point of view of the supremacy of Parliament, that any Government should seek to set up an armed force for which it has not the most clear and explicit Parliamentary authority. That is really the key-note of the whole matter.  It is amazing to me to find how recklessly law is sought to be exploited, and the little attention that is paid to legality, on certain occasions, by people who should know better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A leading member of the Opposition dealing with this matter in the other House, began by saying: &ldquo;I <Col N="602" /> do not intend to say anything concerning the legality of these methods, because I am not concerned with their legality.&rdquo;  That is an amazing statement for a Parliamentarian to make; one who is responsible for making the laws, to say to all the world that he is really not concerned with the observance of the laws, and, above all, with the observance of these laws in a matter such as the armed forces of the country.

      <P>I am not criticising any particular Deputy, but I am criticising a type of mentality that seems to be prevalent at present&mdash;if the end is good then hang the means. Take any means you like, but, above all, do not show any regard, do not be meticulous about such little things as legalities.  We live under a reckless rule of thumb party, and consequently why should we apply legal tests, even in such an important matter as the setting up of the defence forces of the country!  There seems to be a fairly general tendency in that respect to brand anyone who asks for the strict observance of the law as being pernickety or eccentric.  It reminds me of a postcard I saw in a shop window some time ago depicting an incident on the famous West Clare railway.  A train is shown drawn up outside a station, with the driver on the foot-plate waiting for the signal.  A porter comes up with a brush under his arm and asks the driver: &ldquo;Why don't you pull into the station?&rdquo; The driver replies: &ldquo;Can't you see <Col N="603" /> the signal is against me?&rdquo;  The porter replies: &ldquo;Ah, begorra, 'tis particular you are getting.&rdquo;  It is in something of the same spirit that Acts of Parliament are being treated.  We must not show ourselves the least meticulous as to how they are going to be observed, provided we can by any distortion or manipulation do something which the spirit of the Act never intended we should do.  I can understand the courts being at times in difficulties because of the peculiar wording of Acts of Parliament, and trying to make sense out of a particular section in which there is very little real sense because of defective drafting. But a Minister faced with a position of that kind has a remedy, an easy remedy, because it does not take long to get an Act through, as even the most fiercely contested goes through the Oireachtas in a few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard it advanced unofficially on behalf of the Minister that he did not seek to introduce legislation in order to save the dignity of the Oireachtas because of the piffle that would be talked about the Army in getting a Bill which would give the necessary powers through.  The Minister did not say that himself, but a member of this House said it on his behalf.  I do not say he asked that member to say it.  That may be the reason, but I do not think it is a justifiable one, and I think the Minister must, from previous statements made by himself, admit that he did not believe the Act gave him power to set up a Volunteer Reserve. He looked about to see whether there were any means by which he could convince himself that it did.  It was only by a considerable straining of the meaning of the Act, aided by able lawyers whose business it was to strain it sufficiently for the purpose, that he introduced this method.  While I question the legality of the manner in which the Reserve was set up I do not propose to criticise it, because if we are to have an Army, I suppose unpaid forces are probably as good as any others in a sense, <Col N="604" /> although I cannot see that we are going to gain a tremendous amount from hosts of trained warriors, because at times they are just as likely to turn their arms against each other as against a common enemy, particularly a Volunteer Reserve that can belong to political organisations, secret societies and so forth, and that may find their allegiance to the Forces sometimes in conflict with their allegiance to political organisations. But I say the Minister is deserving of the disapproval and the censure of the Oireachtas for the irregular manner in which he has proceeded to set up armed forces for which he had no authority from the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact the Senator was quite right in what he said, because the Minister in what he did took care to keep himself within the wording of the law.  In all constitutional countries that I know of, in England, France, and other places, the Army Bill, or a Bill dealing with armed forces is brought in, in which the number of men that are to be employed is very carefully laid down.  I have constantly read of great disputes in the French Parliament as to the number of men that should be enlisted.  In the House of Commons it was a long fight against the Crown by the Commons to prevent the enlistment of more men than should be enlisted for fear they might interfere with the liberties of Parliament.  In the Free State Constitution that provision is omitted.  It states that forces <Col N="605" /> may be enlisted, but it does not set out the exact number.  Probably that was not thought of at the time. The Minister takes advantage of that and produces a Bill under which any number of men can be recruited. There is no law against it, and therefore it is technically legal, but it is constitutionally wrong. There is a great deal of difference between a constitutional act and a legal act, just as there is a great deal of difference between right and wrong.  The Minister seizes on the point in our Constitution where a word or two should have been inserted. It would be better in that respect if the Constitution were changed.</P>
      <P>I am not criticising the number of men enlisted, but when it is proposed to set up an armed force of a body of Volunteers you have to consider what sort of success you are likely to have.  The Minister does not seem to have considered that at all, because after several months of endeavour, having sent out recruiters all over Dublin, and into Trinity College, and the other University, at the end of a few months of constant labour I am told about 300 volunteers are the result.  I am told that 80 of these were enlisted in Trinity College.  When we ask why they were enlisted, and why Trinity College is able to produce a very considerable number of the total, we find, according to a paper published in Trinity College, that it was to enable the Irish people and the Volunteers to support the British in case of war.  When that statement is put forward you cannot expect that the Volunteers will be extremely popular.  It may have been totally different long ago, but in these times you cannot expect such Volunteers to be popular.  As a matter of fact, the force has not been popular; it has been a dead failure.  Why?  Because there is not a popular feeling in favour of it. I was connected at one time with an illegal organisation and had a good deal to say to its formation.</P>

      <P>I had no difficulty at any time in raising men.  I often enlisted more men in half-an-hour than the Minister has succeeded in raising in three months, because popular feeling was behind me.  It is not behind the Minister.  I think it is a great mistake to put forward things that are not wanted in this country; to put forward a body of Volunteers a great number of whom are declared to be in favour of helping the British, perhaps to come over and conquer this country again.  That might arise.  However, the Minister does not trouble himself about that. He has long passed away from the period when I first knew him, and when I proposed him as a Deputy and started him.  He has passed away from these matters, and has changed his opinion.  Apparently he is now enlisting Volunteers to fight for the British in case they come over here again.  In any case, he leaves that open and the Trinity College people can say what they like and get their own people to join under any proposition they wish. When one wishes to do things like that I have a strong opposition to their being done by secret and sinister means, hiding all these things and screwing around the corner of some words in the Constitution, which apparently makes them technically right.</P>
      <P>Why did the Minister not come forward to the Dáil with the proposition and like an honest man say: &ldquo;I want Volunteers.  Volunteers have been always popular in this country and I wish to start them&rdquo;? That would be the straightforward way.  He would not do that.  Ministers are always trying to be secret, to do everything by sidelines in finance and other things, but always behind curtains, with tricks, and dodges, and deceits.  That is the way we are governed&mdash;nothing but secrecy about everything, and tricks and dodges&mdash;and it is for that reason that I oppose this Bill.  If it was brought forward before the Dáil in a straightforward manner I would have voted for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to mention one or two points that occurred to me in connection with the Volunteer Force.  As far as we are concerned I would like it to be understood that in the main we are entirely in favour of a Volunteer Force in this country, provided always that the Volunteers are created as an Army, or as a Reserve army for the defence of Ireland specifically.  We do not want to fear&mdash;and we think there is grave reason to fear&mdash;that this Volunteer Force may be used in various ways, either operating on behalf of the British in any international crisis, or used in civil disturbances, for strikebreaking or such other purposes. The method by which this Volunteer Force has been created, as Senator Johnson and Senator O'Farrell have argued, has been, in my opinion, quite illegal.  Undoubtedly it is straining the section of the Act dealing with the Reserves to the limit. It is going beyond the limit to say that under this system, where men are sworn in for a period of three years, they can be automatically transferred after a period of three minutes, and become Volunteers. There is a rumour or suggestion&mdash;in fact a very definite statement was made to me&mdash;that a certain attitude was taken up with regard to recruitment in Trinity College.  I hope the Minister will be able to deny it.  I do not believe in making Party capital out of these things, but I would like it to be definitely recorded as a denial from the Minister that such statement is untrue.  The statement was that a guarantee was given to the Trinity College section that they would not be asked to fight against Ulster.  I do not know whether that is true or not or <Col N="608" /> whether there was any qualification or any special privilege given the Trinity force, as distinct from the other Volunteers.  I would like a statement on that from the Minister.</P>
      <P>There is one thing that I think is likely to defeat the purpose of the recruitment of Volunteers, and that, in my judgment, has already contributed to that, and that is the tendency on the part of the Executive Council or of the Government Party to induce members of the existing Army to come into the political arena, to resign their commissions or retire on very substantial pensions and take part in political activities as party politicians.  Personally, I feel, and I think most Senators will agree with me, that that is not desirable in the present phase of things, that it is not likely to encourage recruitment for the Volunteers if ex-officers of the standing Army, who may become officers in the Volunteer Reserve, are taken out of the Army, or are induced to leave it with substantial pensions, and are thrown in to fight the very constituencies where the fight is going to be keen.  I think under those circumstances that a political reaction will take place in the case of possible recruits for the Volunteers that will be highly undesirable, and I think if the Volunteers are going to be recruited, and successfully recruited, as far as possible all political elements should be eliminated. That will certainly not be done if we are going to have in politics very prominent officers of the Army who will be potential officers in the Volunteer Reserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the tendency towards a Volunteer Reserve Army is a very desirable one.  I feel that a standing army is always an undesirable thing. I feel that every citizen of a country should be ready to take his stand in the defence of the country, that a mercenary force such as a standing army should not be necessary in this country, and that a skeleton officer reserve force is the ideal, or the nearest thing that one can get for the purpose required.  The main issue that is operating in the minds of the <Col N="609" /> people who are potential recruits for the Volunteers is how they are going to be used.  Are they going to be used in any sense in a political way? Are they going to be used in defence of British rights as a members of the Commonwealth of the Dominions?  I think that these things have been the main stumbling blocks in the way of the success of recruitment for the Volunteers.  I do not think that the public have been satisfied that this force has been organised in such a way as to satisfy the national aspirations of the people, and I think that therein lies its failure.  It may be that the main recruitment for the force was carried out whilst the Minister was not here at all.  I think that the Minister, during the inauguration of this force and in its early stages, was absent from the country, but I would ask him these few questions with regard to the whole position.  I agree with the proposer of the motion that the normal and the reasonable thing would have been for a Bill to have been introduced to legalise and put in proper form the whole organisation of this Reserve, and I have sympathy with the motion in its attempt to legalise the method which was employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like the impression to go abroad that the Minister is speaking alone in this matter here when he rises to reply. I have not risen with the intention of anticipating his reply, but with the intention of making it clear that the opinions already expressed do not represent the unanimous views of this assembly.  When Senator Johnson initiated the discussion on his motion last December the circumstances attending the initation of that discussion were somewhat unfavourable, and it was difficult for those present either to follow the trend of his observations or to weigh the value of his arguments.  However, since then we have had ample time to read, mark and inwardly digest what the Senator said on that occasion, and as one who read the Senator's observations in the Official Report with the closest scrutiny, the most meticulous care, I must say <Col N="610" /> that the whole thing seems to me to be an elaborate example of much ado about nothing.  If it gives any impression at all it is an impression of how fallible the judgment of Senator Johnson can be on certain occasions.</P>
      <P>I think that very few additional points have been raised to-day. Senator O'Farrell seemed to think that an absence of argument could be compensated for by copious quotations from official documents.  He used such devastating terms as &ldquo;distortion and manipulation&rdquo; of the powers of a certain Act.  Senator Moore introduced no new point.  He told us what an excellent recruiter he had been on a certain occasion. I have no doubt he was, and I am not going to take away from him any little credit that he can claim to have for recruiting for any army that he may have been attached to. Senator Connolly had merely a few timid questionings that he wished to put to the Minister, but he advanced no real challenge to the Act itself.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnson's speech, I think, contains all the considered criticism that we need deal with, and he certainly surprised me.  He used language which, if the circumstances warranted the use of that language, would certainly be severe almost to the point of exaggeration.  He accused the Minister of stretching and twisting the provisions of a particular section.  He said: &ldquo;The Minister has illegitimately and unreasonably used the powers given to him under Section 146.&rdquo; That was very strong language for Senator Johnson to use.  The whole point as to whether that language is warranted or not, and as a matter of fact, I think, the whole point of Senator Johnson's contention, ranges round this question of whether Section 146 does really give the Minister power to do what he has done or not.  If it gives him that power it is simply childish, I think, to talk about twisting and stretching the provisions of this section and illegitimately and unreasonably using its powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Either the section gives the <Col N="611" /> Minister these powers or it does not give him these powers.  If it gives him these powers, then why quarrel with the Minister for exercising the powers that the Oireachtas has conferred upon him?  I presume that the Minister will be able to state very explicitly what his position in that regard is.  I do know that at one time Senator Johnson was not very clear or very definite in his mind that such powers were not embodied in the Act.  Dealing with this in the Dáil on the 6th May, 1926, he said: &ldquo;I do not know whether it will be necessary to have legislation to meet it&rdquo; (the question of the Reserve).  So that at that time clearly Senator Johnson was not convinced in his mind that the powers which the Minister has been exercising were precluded from his sphere by the provisions of the enactment. But even as a layman, as one not competent to speak with any great degree of knowledge of the intricacies of the law, the wording in portion of this section quoted by Senator Johnson, is to me clear, definite, and unquestionable.</P>
    <P>The section says: &ldquo;The Minister may from time to time, by general or special regulation, vary the conditions of service, so as to permit a soldier of the Forces in any service, with the assent of the Minister, either (a) to enter the Reserve at once for the residue unexpired of the term of his original enlistment ...&rdquo;  That seems to me the whole turning point of this matter; that is, if the section confers the power upon the Minister to do these things, then I say that it is simply idle and childish, and an unwarranted waste of the time of the House to contest it.  Then there was the extent to which Senator Johnson could challenge the legality of the procedure, and he has done so, in my opinion, in an argument exceedingly faulty and unconvincing, and in language altogether unsuited to the calm consideration of the matter. He and other speakers seemed to convey the impression that this action has been taken without the knowledge of the Oireachtas, that <Col N="612" /> the whole thing has been sprung upon the Oireachtas, without any previous intimation that such a step was in contemplation, and that such a step was likely to be taken. Senator Moore used the words &ldquo;secret and sinister&rdquo; as describing the procedure in relation to this matter, and similar imputations have been made in the course of this discussion. I do not know whether it was unconscious or not, but it seemed to me calculated to convey the impression that the real judgment and the real wishes of the Oireachtas had been overridden, and that a military autocracy was doing these things.</P>
    <P>Now, as a matter of fact, not once but on several occasions this matter has been dealt with in the Dáil, specifically and definitely by Ministers. The Minister for Finance referred to it on the 21st April, 1927, in his Budget statement; the Minister for Defence referred to it on the 16th December, 1927, on the Defence Forces Bill, and on the 25th November, 1928, on the Army Vote; Deputy Kerlin referred to it on the last-mentioned date, and seemed impatient for the formation&mdash;I presume he spoke for his Party&mdash;of some such body as has been set up; and last, but by no means least, in the matter of the pertinence of the quotations on the Army Vote on the 31st November, 1928, the Minister for Defence said: &ldquo;When I am satisfied that I have the legal power, I propose to start the Volunteer Reserve.&rdquo;  That was in 1928.  I presume that he has satisfied himself; I presume that he indicated by that that he was consulting those who were the proper people to advise him upon the legal aspect of the matter. Senator Johnson may take umbrage from the fact that he was not the person selected to advise the Minister for Defence on this matter.  I do not think that Senator Johnson would be the proper person to give such advice.  Senator Johnson appears, so to speak, to assign to himself the position of indispensable mentor of this whole State, and he assumes that if he withdraws his <Col N="613" /> watchful eye or his guiding hand from any of its movements the State is bound to fall into ways of mischief. Of course, that is an illusion. The ejection of that illusion from the Senator's mind would add to his capacity for helping this State, and to the assistance which he has given to this State since its inauguration.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Senators recollect who seconded Senator Johnson's motion.  I hardly believe that Senator Johnson is happy when he thinks of the seconder of his motion. Senator Comyn, who seconded it, seems to have assigned to himself the role of persistent seconder of Senator Johnson's motions, with the result that, if there is no other reason for their rejection, Senator Comyn's seconding of them is generally bound to secure their rejection.  I do not think that Senator Johnson will rejoice in the prospect of this senatorial old man of the sea clinging to the necks of his motions, and he will probably make arrangements that in future his motions, if they are to be seconded at all, will certainly not be seconded by Senator Comyn.</P>

      <P>Senator Comyn, or at least the Party with which he is now associated, endeavoured to establish a standing army that was not controlled by Parliament, and it nearly led to the downfall of liberty <Col N="614" /> in this country.  Of course, Senator Comyn ought to be a great authority on this matter.  I understand&mdash;he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that he was a member of the O.T.C. in Trinity College before the outbreak of the Great War.  Had it not been for the fact that his martial ardour evaporated when the war drums beat to battle possibly he might have gone down to history as the unknown general who broke the Hindenburg Line.  There was no point in Senator Comyn's intervention. It was a speech that seemed to be delivered without his having considered what was the wording of Senator Johnson's motion; it was a speech that threw no light upon the subject, and I am afraid that none of the other speeches we have heard to-day have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great solicitude and great regret have been expressed by some gentlemen here to-day over what they allege to have been the failure of recruiting for the Volunteer Reserve. How much help have they given to make it a success?  How much help have the organs of publicity with which they are identified given to make it a success?  The fact is known to anyone who has been watching events for the last few months that not only have they given no help but they have done everything in their power to prevent it from being a success.  I think it is a pity, in the case of a force which has been established in the interests of the State, with the desire to safeguard and defend the rights of the citizens and the status of the State, that certain sections of the community should first have tried to defeat the creation of that force, and that afterwards the spokesman of that section should appear in the National Assembly and pretend they regretted that it had not been a greater success than it is.  Whether a measure of success has attended it or not I do not know, but I know this, that if it is unsuccessful it will not be as a consequence of the futile efforts of these gentlemen and their associates; it will be a non-success <Col N="615" /> if there is in this country an absence of real citizenship which recognises its rights and is prepared to assert and defend them.  That, I take it, is the purpose of this force, and it is because that is its purpose that, despite all that has been said in criticism of it, I believe it is not going to fail, that I stand here in defence of the action the Minister has taken.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson's motion may have served one useful purpose. Certain propagandists have been at work trying to broadcast the idea that something illegal has been done, something not warranted by a statute of the Oireachtas.  If this discussion clears up that mistake and gives the Minister a chance to make it clear and definite that all that has been done is quite within his competence as Minister for Defence, quite within the meaning, the letter, and the spirit of the Act, then I think that possibly, and perhaps unintentionally, Senator Johnson will have rendered a service to the State.</P>

      <P>One would expect that there would be some volunteer reserve unless the standing army was for ever to be kept at an excessive strength.  Senator Johnson's motion concerns the procedure adopted, not the question of the advantage to the country of a reserve, and inasmuch as the Minister gave two years' notice that he was seeking advice as to the legality of establishing such a force, he is highly to be congratulated in having got through the work without allowing it to become the object of hairsplitting and of questions of legality.  There is a type of mentality which resists the civilising agencies that are represented in other nations at present, but it does not resist them by saying that they may potentially be turned into policemen, but by making little points on questions of procedure. And while rather misleading and lulling aspirations of peace are in the air this country is to be congratulated on definitely forming a military organisation, because without a <Col N="616" /> military organisation, no matter what its strength, the rights which a country has got would gradually be whittled away.</P>
      <P>No one for a moment pretends that some of the many armies of the Indian princes could have put up a resistance to England for five minutes, but immediately the Indian princes got rid of their armies in order to lesson the strain on their exchequers, certain arbitrary rules were strained, legality entered into it, and they lost privileges, and in some cases they lost millions of money through confiscation.  When they applied to the Minister who was concerned with the finances of India, and when they objected to acts of barefaced confiscation, they were told tersely that it was a matter of ethics and that they had better apply to the Political Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the very sentiments which certain imperial nations express can be turned into defences for them by the smaller and lesser principalities and nations which have standing armies, however small, or military organisations, because before you ultimately and completely exterminate rights you must go against your own expressed aspirations, otherwise your preaching controls your practice.  It is highly important for this country to have an army, and more important to have an avenue by which that army can be if necessary diminished.  As regards the fear of it being turned into an engine to fight for Great Britain in future years under various circumstances that will arise, it will fight for its own interests, and those interests may be largely bound up with the interests of Great Britain.  We are selling our cattle to England, and the heart will go with the treasure. After all, it might not be a very bad thing to fight for Great Britain if the circumstances demanded it, rather than to stand alone and be invaded, or be paraded to the world as one of those conscientious objectors to fighting, conscientious objectors to the creation of a volunteer reserve or, what is much worse, by <Col N="617" /> possible peaceful penetration of people who will screw the ways and means out of our pockets by high interest. One director of the Bank of England could conquer this country by a stroke of the pen, because politics are now changing into economics, and it is only in a small cul-de-sac like this that you will hear difficulties and points made when there should be none, particularly small legal difficulties being made when a thing is as clear as daylight. It is necessary for the physique of the country to have some reserve and some sort of training, and I think that the Minister was quite correct in putting this completed scheme before us.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Farrell spoke about certain types of mentality. One type I would like rather mildly to deprecate is the type that throws out epithets with that blandness and lightheartedness that I noticed here this afternoon, but that when it comes to substantiate these remarks fails utterly to do so.  That may be because in this country it seems to me that, whereas ordinary ethics would seem to attribute illegalities to a Minister which would require more proof than in the case of the ordinary person, here it seems that a moment of petulance justifies anything against a Minister.  That, no doubt, is due to the fact that so many of our people suffer from this, that for many generations we have not had any sense of responsibility towards a National Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson said that I acted illegitimately and unreasonably.  To act illegitimately means to act against the law.  Previous to that he was making the statement, when interrupted by Senator O'Farrell, that &ldquo;it is probably quite true that the Minister has power.&rdquo;  He did not quite finish the sentence.  What I take it the Senator meant to say, was that I had the power.  He said that I acted illegitimately.  His resolution asks the Seanad &ldquo;to disapprove of the procedure adopted by the Minister for Defence in the <Col N="618" /> formation of a Volunteer Reserve as being an abuse of the power of the Minister and an encroachment upon the authority of the Oireachtas.&rdquo; What would be an abuse of the Minister's power?  Surely it would be if he exercised an authority that he did not possess, or used the power he possesses for a wrong purpose&mdash; that is to say, for a purpose against the general well-being.  No Senator has suggested that any power the Minister possesses has been abused, or used for a wrong purpose.  The suggestion merely is that I used that power unreasonably.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell said that I acted in an irregular and illegal manner, that I set up the Volunteers without the authority of the Oireachtas, that I did it in an irregular and unseemly manner to injure and to bring the Oireachtas into contempt, and that in doing so I gave myself powers that the Act did not give me.  Towards the end of his remarks&mdash;I could not take a note of everything the Senator said &mdash;he admitted that I had those powers.  Senator Johnson, when he came to substantiate the remarks he made, that I had acted illegally, quoted certain things which seem to me to bear quite a contrary connotation. A number of people seem to think that because I expressed a doubt as to my legal powers that it meant I was pretty well satisfied that I did not possess those powers. Quite the contrary is the case.  I always try to exercise the caution that a certain popular phrase attributes to angels.  Therefore, until I am satisfied and know that I have power, I necessarily assume that I have not got it.  In this matter, as in other matters, unless it is perfectly clear and obvious to me that I possess a power, I consult the proper adviser.  I take his advice and not Senator Johnson's.</P>
    <P>The Senator said that it was provided that a person may be enlisted to serve as a soldier for twelve years or less as fixed by the Minister. It will be noticed that the Oireachtas limited the length of time but it did not limit the shortness of the time.  It left that to the <Col N="619" /> discretion of the Minister.  Senator Johnson went on to say that in the code &ldquo;the original enlistment shall be for the whole of the term of his original enlistment in army service; or for such portion of the term of his original enlistment as may be, from time to time, fixed by the Minister and specified in the attestation papers in Army Service, and for the residue of the said service in the Reserve.&rdquo;  What does that prove, if it proves anything?  It proves that the Oireachtas, with its eyes open, gave power to the Minister to limit the time of actual service in the Army, no matter how short the period.  It gave a discretion to the Minister to limit the time.  How anyone could suggest that the quotation Senator Johnson gave purported to say that the Oireachtas ordered the Minister that he should not allow a man to serve too short a period in the Army I cannot see.  What is the fact?  I consulted the proper authority as to whether these powers existed or not.  I was advised that they did, and nobody who has spoken has attempted to say otherwise than that the powers did exist.  The argument was that I distorted and twisted the Act, that I acted irregularly and in an unseemly manner, that I resorted to an administrative subterfuge.  The position is that either I had the power or I had not.  If I had the power the question comes to this, was it in the national interest that it should be used or that it should not?</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson seems to me to undertake to tell what was in the minds of various Senators and Deputies when passing the original Defence Forces Act.  I cannot pretend to do that.  The reasons that prompted their action may have been as many and as various as there were Senators and Deputies.  Neither I nor anybody else, including Senator Johnson, could say what was in their minds.  As to the legal side of this, I do not think any Senator has attempted to say that I had not legal powers.  If I had legal power, what <Col N="620" /> then constitutes an abuse of it?  I should say the use of it for some purpose against the national interest, but no one has attempted to say that any attempt was made to use that power against the national interest, or that I attempted to usurp the power of the Oireachtas.  First of all the Oireachtas gives power to a Minister.  The power resides in the Minister to be used for the national well-being.  It might be said that this Act, having been passed some years ago and circumstances having changed, that it was perfectly evident to anyone that the Oireachtas had changed its mind, and that therefore I should have given the Oireachtas an opportunity of indicaing that.</P>
    <P>Senator Milroy referred to various statements.  On 21st April, 1927, the Minister for Finance stated definitely in relation to his Budget proposals, that it was our intention to establish a territorial force.  Deputy Johnson, as he was then, did not object.  He forehold that it would be impossible for us to run an army on the sum estimated by the Minister for Finance, but he did not object in any way to the proposal to establish a territorial force.  In November, 1927, I myself indicated clearly that we had in view the formation of a Reserve.  I made that statement in the Dáil.  Deputy O'Connell, who is a member of the Party to which Senator Johnson belongs, did not in any way indicate that he objected to the formation of a Volunteer Reserve. The Fianna Fáil Party in the Dáil always spoke in favour of a volunteer reserve, although with that consistency that one may always expect from them, when it came to the point, they voted against it.  Every indication given in the Dáil by us, and every responsible statement that we made in the Dáil and in the Seanad, indicated that our desire was for the formation of a Volunteer Reserve, or that the formation of such a Reserve was a likely possibility?</P>

      <P>On the Second <Col N="621" /> Stage of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1929, I indicated quite clearly, when speaking in the Seanad on 13th March, 1929, that it was our intention to start a Volunteer Reserve.  I stated: &ldquo;Most Senators know that during last year we reduced considerably the standing Army, making it the framework which was to be filled in by other organisations, such as the A and B Reserves and the Volunteer Reserve.&rdquo; Here the suggestion is that I have taken an entirely new departure in the Army without consulting the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas gave me power to do a certain thing, provided it is for the national good. In the early stages we had not the A Reserve.  That came into being without legislation.  A couple of years ago we started the B Reserve. I did not come to the Oireachtas for legislation.  In due time, when I felt that the Army was ready to undertake an additional branch, I started the Volunteer Reserve.  Senator O'Farrell was wrong in nearly every definite statement that he made.  He said that no financial provision had been made, quite overlooking the fact, if my memory serves me right, that in the original Estimates last year provision was made for the O.T.C.  The Senator referred to the O.T.C. as part of a body for which no financial provision had been made.</P>

      <P>I think that when the Senator reads his remarks he will find that the statement I have just made is correct&mdash;that his remarks apply equally to the O.T.C. The Senator, apparently, was unaware of the fact that a Supplementary Estimate has been introduced in the Dáil and passed.  It was a perfectly legal act I did.  No <Col N="622" /> one, I think, can say that in bringing the Volunteer Reserve Force into existence I was acting against the national well-being.  Neither do I think anybody could assert that my action was an abuse of the power I possess.  Senator Johnson, as I understand it, having admitted that I had the power, went on to say that I acted illegitimately.  That is loose phrasing.  Possibly he got somewhat petulant at being interrupted, and unfortunately petulance in this country very often expresses itself in abuse of Ministers.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Farrell admitted that it was pretty clear that all shades of opinion were in favour of a Volunteer Reserve.  He also said that the Oireachtas had made no provision for it, financial or otherwise. Senator O'Farrell also said that men joining the Volunteer Reserve signed the ordinary attestation form.  They do not.  They sign a special one. The Senator implied that a man may attest for less than three years. That is not so.  The Senator seemed to be unaware that the regulations are laid on the Table of both Houses. He also said that he did not believe that the Act gives me the powers that I say it does.  He based his case on the use of the word &ldquo;serve&rdquo; and admitted, I think that the word &ldquo;serve&rdquo; can be interpreted as he said I was interpreting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then Senator Moore comes along. He said that I was technically and legally right but constitutionally wrong.  It was somewhat difficult to follow the Senator's remarks, but as far as I could understand them what he said was something like this: that as far as the Consitution of this State is concerned it was made by us, but that when you want to know something that is really constitutional you go to England or France. Although a thing may be perfectly legal here because our Constitution and our mode of law permit it, from the Senator's point of view it is constitutionally wrong because his English and French friends would not have it so, and therefore it is, in essence, constitutionally wrong.  The Senator also said that the Volunteer <Col N="623" /> Reserve&mdash;he included the O.T.C. in his references and spoke of Trinity College&mdash;has not been a success. Well it depends on what you mean by success.  It has been successful beyond my expectation to the extent of three times.</P>

      <P>The Senator referred to the O.T.C. in Trinity College. He said that an extraordinarily big percentage of the new organisation are members of Trinity College.  The number of members in the organisation is about 700, and of these 85 are members of Trinity College, which I think is a very fair and appropriate proportion. I am very glad to see these 85 young men in the Volunteer Reserve. The Senator also suggested &mdash;from this one gathered that he reads certain obscure organs that do not come my way very often and quoted them as if they were authoritative&mdash;that the object of the Volunteer Reserve was to support the British in case of war, and that consequently you cannot expect it to be very popular.  Why?  Because some organ which I believe to have a very limited circulation suggests on its own authority and not on any authoritative authority that the sole purpose of the Volunteers is to be used in support of the British in case of war.  Having consistently preached that as a fact, he then complains that that is the story that is going around, and that you cannot expect the Volunteers to be popular. The Volunteers are more popular, even during the short period of their existence, than I ever expected them to be.  The only body that has attempted to throw any doubt in that is the Party to which the Senator belongs, and he says they are a dead failure.  That remark has no relation <Col N="624" /> to the realities of the case.</P>
      <P>The Senator also dealt with a period of past history, and on that he was also a bit wrong.  He said that he was once connected with an illegal organisation but that popular feeling was behind him in it.  He referred to his knowing myself at that time.  We did know each other.  We were both associated with an organisation which I thought at that time was not illegal. At a given moment it looked as if it was unpopular.  When it became perfectly clear that it was about to be made illegal Senator Colonel Moore left it and associated himself with an organisation which looked popular for the moment and which had every guarantee of not being made illegal. That organisation existed solely for the purpose of serving the British authorities here.</P>

      <P>In my simplicity I remained in the original organisation. These are things I did not care usually to refer to.  In 1913-14 Senator Colonel Moore and I were both members of the Irish Volunteers.  Then when the Great War came, and it was apparent that the British Government were going to be severe on us another rival organisation&mdash;the National Volunteers&mdash;was formed, and the Senator joined that second organisation, which existed, as far as anyone could see, for the purpose of recruiting for the British Army. That organisation was never declared illegal, and to join it the Senator left the organisation to which he and I belonged, and of which I remained a member.</P>

      <P>This is not a matter I came here to discuss, but in my desire for accuracy I had to deal with it when the Senator got up and said that he had popular feeling behind him, and that I had passed away from the party of which I was a member when he knew me first.  I want to say the passing away from that party was done by the Senator and not by me.  The Senator then went on to say that we were apparently enlisting Volunteers to fight for the British.  A childish remark of that sort is beneath taking notice of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connolly asked are these volunteers for the defence of Ireland. These volunteers, as every document connected with them states clearly, are enlisted in the service of the State and for the well-being of the people who live in this State, and for nothing else.  The Senator said they might be used in several ways on behalf of the British or in the case of civil disturbance. They will only be used when the Government existing in this country by virtue of the will of the Irish people shall decide the purpose for which they shall be used.  If the Government of this country, speaking in the name of the people, wished the Volunteers to be used on behalf of the British, then they should be used on behalf of the British if that is the will of the people here.  In the <Col N="626" /> case of civil disturbance on a large scale amounting to a position of civil war the standing army will be called on first, then the A Reserve, next the B Reserve, and the Volunteer Reserve last.</P>

      <P>It is the order that exists at the moment, and I expect that is the ordinary intelligent way to anticipate events.  Volunteers may understand that they can only be called upon in the event of the standing army and A Reserve plus B Reserve being found inadequate to deal with the existing situation. Senator Connolly suggested a certain attitude was taken with regard to recruiting in Trinity College, and that assurances were given they would not be asked to fight against Ulster.  Nobody with any intelligence would put forward such a proposition.  People who lived in the North and who ran out of it are always talking about fighting Ulster, but not so the ordinary intelligent young men who join the O.T.C.  If people wanted to make that a condition of joining the Volunteer Reserve I would say their mental capacity unfitted them for membership.</P>

      <P>I did not name anyone.  He also went on to talk about members of the army taking part in politics.  That brings us to the declaration made by Volunteers and referred to by Senator Johnson. What is the position?  You have a Volunteer Reserve.  The members of the Volunteer Reserve are ordinary citizens pursuing their ordinary avocations and merely attending drill.  I do not think any intelligent person would suggest that during that period men should be excluded from participation in ordinary politics in the country.  When a man joins the Volunteer Reserve he does undertake at a given time and in given circumstances, which I submit are of their nature extremely exceptional, to be subject to discipline, <Col N="627" /> and it is in the interests of that discipline that he be precluded from participating actively in politics. When a man joins he makes a declaration, and on that declaration he is exempted from it during his ordinary membership of the Reserve and it will be only applied when a time of emergency has arisen.  If anyone can suggest a better way to meet that I would like to know it.  It must apply during a moment of emergency.  You do not want in a moment of emergency to present a man with conditions that were not presented when he joined.  He makes a declaration and he is exempted from the declaration but it will apply when he is called upon for active service.</P>
      <P>That is the position with regard to the declaration, and consequently any member of the Reserve is free to participate in politics on any side he likes.  I do not think I would be justified in proposing anything to the contrary.  If I were to say that every member of the Reserve was to hold himself aloof from politics I would hardly be treating him fairly. I think there are members not merely of the Government Party but members of other parties in the Reserve. At least, there is one man I know in the Reserve whose politics are not those of the Government, and his occupation is largely associated with politics.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has taken a long time to deal with small and unimportant points.  The greater part of his speech has dealt with points of terminology and grammar.  The essence of my complaint in the motion is &ldquo;That the Senand disapproves of the procedure adopted by the Minister for Defence in the formation of a Volunteer Reserve as being an abuse of the power of the Minister and an encroachment upon the authority of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  Nothing that he has said removes the conviction in my mind that that statement is true. Anyone who has read the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act with an unbiased mind would come to the conclusion that what is inherent in the Act is that the Reserve that is to be formed under the authority of the Act is a Reserve of men who have served and trained in the Army.  I am not going to deal with all the smaller points that have been raised.  I am not attacking the establishment of the Reserve.  I have raised no question as to the political views of the members of the Reserve. I am not going to say a word as to the wisdom or unwisdom of that Reserve.  If there is to be a trained army in the country I think it is the best form in which an army should be enlisted.  The important thing is to keep, and notwithstanding the admonition of Senator Milroy I hope I shall continue to keep, an eye on the encroachments on the authority of the Oireachtas.  If we are going to maintain the position of the Seanad in the first instance, and the Dáil and Seanad together in the second instance, in relation to the executive authority, we must, above everything else, have control over arming the citizens.  Anybody who has made a study of constitutional development in any country knows that the essence of executive power, and the possibility of tyranny being used by executive power, resides in authority over the armed forces, and if the Parliament of the country has any meaning at all above every other meaning, it is that it shall retain control of authority <Col N="629" /> in respect of the arming of the citizens.</P>
      <P>It is hardly necessary to remind the House again that this Act of 250 odd clauses and numerous schedules was passed in both Houses in 1923 without any discussion whatsoever in either House.  The Minister says that he has been legally advised on the matter.  As a layman I am not going to say that the lawyers are wrong when they told him he has power to do this thing, but I believe he has twisted the terms of the sections of that Act in the formation of the Volunteer Reserve.  The Bill speaks of having served in the Forces.  Men who have served in the Forces may be transferred to the Volunteer Reserve.  Does any Senator believe for one moment that that phrase implies that a man may join the Forces, become a soldier and at the same moment be transferred? The thing is preposterous.  No such intention was in the Bill, notwithstanding what the lawyers might say about the powers which are said to be in the Bill, and which the lawyers have told him he may use for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The precedent that is created here may be followed.  Another Ministry may come along and say &ldquo;We want to train boys over fourteen in the schools and we will call them a Boy Scouts Reserve.&rdquo;  They can do that by this precedent without coming to Parliament at all.  Is that a desirable thing?  Whether it is desirable or not that should be done, it is not right or proper that it should be done without the specific sanction of the Oireachtas.  Let us assume for a moment that Senator Mrs. Clarke is Minister for Defence in the next Ministry, and she says in deference to equality of sex she will arm a corps of Amazons without coming to Parliament for authority to do so!</P>

    <P>I say that method of procedure is surely stretching the meaning of the Act, and it is an abuse of the powers of the Minister and an encroachment <Col N="630" /> on the powers and authority of the Oireachtas.  The Minister has quoted a number of statements in the Dáil and in the Seanad that such a Reserve would in due time be established, and that that was part of the policy of the Minister.  It was never stated that it was going to be established simply by an extension of the existing Reserve in the manner that is now being accomplished.  But supposing it was said, there was no doubt whatever that the idea of a Volunteer Reserve has been made public time and again, and as Senator O'Farrell has said, it has been approved, that is all the more reason why there should be specific authority given by the Oireachtas. I hope the House will agree with me that it is not enough to say the Minister told the Dáil, and Opposition members of the Dáil approved, and that was sufficient.  When the authority of the Oireachtas is talked about this House also has to give its consent, and it is not sufficient to say authority was given and sanction approved by the fact that nobody objected when the Minister said such a thing was in contemplation.  There is nothing to be said from my point of view on the question of whether the Reserve has been a success or failure.  If it had been a most outstanding success or a most inglorious failure my objection would have been the same, and I plead with the Seanad, if the Dáil does not take a stand in this and on every other occasion, to safeguard the liberties of the people from the possibilities of abuse by an executive, because it is in that function that I think the Seanad will justify itself to the people and to the Constitution.  I think it is desirable that on this occasion the matter should be ventilated, and I think it is desirable that the Seanad should approve of the motion I have moved.</P>

      <P>May I draw the attention of the House to the possibility of the Dáil agreeing with the message sent down with regard to the Game Preservation Bill?  As it is desirable that the work of the proposed Committee should be gone through as quickly as possible, would it be in order to forestall the decision of the Dáil and appoint such a Committee at once?</P>
