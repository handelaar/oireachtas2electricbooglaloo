      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;mother&rdquo; in line 30 to insert the words &ldquo;or next friend.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 2, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;child&rdquo; in line 32 to insert the words &ldquo;or in case the mother is dead by any person who has actual knowledge of the facts stated therein, including a dying declaration of the mother.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of these amendments is to provide for a case of the greatest possible hardship which seems to have been overlooked in the drafting of the Bill.  As the House is aware the object of this measure is to provide for illegitimate children, and to secure that the father of an illegitimate child shall pay for the upkeep of that child.  In the drafting of the section, by inadvertence I am sure, it was overlooked that a case might arise where the mother died in childbirth. That case is not provided for in the section at all and it is the hardest case that can possibly be imagined because, when the mother dies, an infant is left without lawful father or mother, brother or sister, nobody's child, nobody's brother, absolutely friendless in the world. Kindly nature sometimes makes such children strong so that they will be able to combat the adverse fortune in which they came into the world. That is the child I propose to protect by this amendment.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  Upon the application, within the time hereinafter limited, of the mother of an illegitimate child or on the application, within the time hereinafter limited, of a local body administering the relief of the poor then giving relief to the mother of an illegitimate child or to an illegitimate child and in either case upon an information in writing upon oath being made by the mother of such child identifying the father of such child the Justice of the District Court....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Justice shall make the necessary order.  You will observe that <Col N="1071" /> the mother must make the information. Take a case where the mother dies, as frequently happens unfortunately in childbirth, there is no provision whatever for the child that survives.  These two amendments which I ask leave to put to. gether provide for that particular case.  In the first amendment I propose to insert &ldquo;or next friend&rdquo; of the illegitimate child.  In my opinion that is sufficient although it has been suggested to me by Senator Brown that probably some definition of the words is required.  The mother must swear the information.  As to the second amendment, by Section 2 it is a condition precedent to the right to make an application for relief that there should be a sworn information by the mother: &ldquo;Upon an information in writing upon oath being made by the mother of such child.&rdquo;  I do not know the object of that provision.  Perhaps the object was to get the oath of the mother identifying one man, so that thereafter she would not be able to make an oath identifying another man and so as to prevent the danger of blackmail.  Perhaps that is the reason the section was framed in that way.  Whatever the reason was my amendment is designed to provide for the case where the mother dies in childbirth.  I would substitute for the oath of the mother the oath of some person who can swear positively to the fact including the fact of a dying declaration by a mother.</P>
    <P>Here is the case I intend to provide for: a mother is on the point of death and a doctor or a priest is there and just as she is gasping out her last breath she tells the doctor or the priest the name of the father of the child.  What I propose to do in such a case is to enable the doctor or the priest, or some credible person, to give evidence of that dying declaration.  Of course a dying declaration is a highly credible thing.  Men have been executed on the strength of dying declarations. They are regarded by the courts and by lawyers as of the greatest sanctity and in cases of murder and manslaughter <Col N="1072" /> dying declarations are allowed.  These are the most serious cases that come before the courts.</P>
    <P>Dying declarations are not,&mdash;and I think I am practically right in saying this&mdash;allowed in any cases except murder or manslaughter.  I propose that a dying declaration should be allowed in this case to meet the particular hardship of cases where a child survives and the mother dies.  That is the way I propose to carry it out.  It was as good as I could provide for in the circumstances.  I do not wish to urge the amendment further than it appeals to the minds of Senators. It was mentioned in the course of the debates that here was a case of the greatest hardship that ought to be provided for in some way.  I have endeavoured to do so and I leave it to the judgment of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I think a very large number of the members sympathise with the Senator in the effort he is making to provide a remedy in the case he has mentioned where the mother is dead and the child lives. The difficulty is to see how it can be possibly carried out.  He will not carry it out simply by inserting the words &ldquo;or next friend&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;mother&rdquo; in line 30.  An application is never made by a next friend.  The person who makes the application is the person who happens to be the infant himself or herself by a next friend, and in order to carry out what the Senator wants he would have to move the insertion of these words in line 30.  &ldquo;The mother, or in case the mother be dead, the infant by a next friend.&rdquo; Supposing he was able to get over that difficulty there is then the almost insuperable difficulty of providing the case when the mother is dead.  He proposes to do that by allowing the initial declaration which has to be made by the mother (if the mother is alive) on oath, to be made by some one who has knowledge of the facts and to include in the facts that a dying declaration was made <Col N="1073" /> by the mother identifying the father of the child.  As the Senator pointed out there are only two cases in which a dying declaration is admissible.  It is hearsay evidence, merely telling what some person heard a dying person say, and it is admissible only as a necessary exception to the rule as against hearsay evidence.  It is only admissible under common law in cases of murder and manslaughter and under very strict conditions. That is to say that the person who makes it must be someone who has an unqualified belief at the time that he or she is without any hope of recovery and almost immediately before death.</P>
      <P>The dying declaration that the Senator wants to make admissible in this case would have to be made under the same circumstances in order to have it admissible.  There is no common law with reference to cases of this kind, and if he wants dying declarations to be made evidence, I am afraid he would have to prescribe in this Bill the necessary conditions which make dying declarations relevant.  These are the difficulties that I see.  I would be very glad personally if they could be got over by the House and I think it is a great pity we had not an opportunity of discussing this at an earlier stage when the Bill was in Committee.  These are the difficulties that I see, and if they can be got over I would be very glad to vote for the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Brown has very concisely and very clearly stated the difficulties that there are in the way of the amendments.  I have not defined what a dying declaration is.  I leave it to the Courts to decide what it is, because, as the Senator pointed out, this question of a dying declaration, and of evidence, is not statutory.  It is common law depending on decisions. The decisions are there, and rather than involve this House in a long discussion as to the meaning of a dying declaration, in order to get this amendment through, I am willing that the construction should be left to the courts.  In view of what Senator Brown has stated, and of <Col N="1074" /> the great importance of the amendment&mdash;I make bold to say that it is of considerable importance&mdash;I will be quite satisfied if this section is recommitted, when Senator Brown and myself would probably hammer out something that would meet the case. This amendment was not originally my suggestion.  It transpired in the course of the first debate that here was a case of the greatest hardship that should be met some way or other.  I leave the amendments to the House.  My responsibility for them ceases now that I have explained them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney) James Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the force of what Senator Comyn says.  I perfectly recognise that as the Bill stands there may be a case in which a child would be left unprovided for, and I appreciate the motive which inspired Senator Comyn in this matter.  At the same time I would ask the Seanad to reject the amendment.  The Senator was not quite accurate when he said that it was by inadvertence that this was left out of the Bill.  As a matter of fact, amendments almost similar in words to these two amendments were put up in the Dáil and rejected by the Dáil, so that there is no question of inadvertence in the matter.  It has been already before the other House and been fully debated. My position is that I have to look to the position not only of the child but also of the man who is charged.  I do not think that you could with safety find any man to be the parent of an illegitimate child except upon the oath of the mother of that child.  You may get persons who actually compromise themselves, but even that would not show that the particular person was the father of the child, for the woman may have been a loose woman.  I need not develop that further. Nobody except the mother herself knows.  That. I think, is a principle which is embodied in this Bill and which we ought to keep there&mdash;that nobody shall be found to be the parent of an illegitimate child except upon the oath of the mother.  I <Col N="1075" /> would like to go further on the question of a dying declaration.</P>
      <P>I completely agree with Senator Brown as to the principle of the criminal law which makes a dying declaration admissible, but that could not be transferred except expressly by this statute to civil proceedings. But I think it would be a terrible innovation in our law to bring into this Bill a dying declaration, a thing that has never been heard of in civil proceedings in this country before, and never been heard of in criminal proceedings except in the limited cases of homicide.  I think it would be a dangerous principle to bring in.  It may be true that courts think, and rightly think, that a person who has given up hope of this world will not lie.  That may be, of course, correct, but you must bear in mind that that person is not making the statement to the court. It would be given by somebody else and not by the dying person.  It may be given by the father, mother, sister or other relative of the dying person.  It may not be true.  Somebody may get up and say this woman made a dying declaration, and swear to the terms of the dying declaration, when she may never have made a dying declaration at all.  The easiest thing on earth would be to invent a dying declaration. I think it would be extremely dangerous to allow that principle to be brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to give one concrete example of a case in this country in the last couple of years.  A girl aged under sixteen was the mother of an illegitimate child.  She stated to the doctor and nurses who were attending her in childbirth that so and so was the father of that child. We will call him A.  She subsequently some time afterwards declared that not A but B was the father of her child, and that her first reason for bringing a charge against A was that B had told her to do so, and that she was acting under B's influence.  B was tried and found guilty by a jury in spite of his previous statement about A. The case went to the Court of <Col N="1076" /> Criminal Appeal and the conviction was affirmed.  The girl's father subsequently brought an action for seduction against B, and again obtained from the judge and jury a verdict against B.  Therefore one may take it for certain that B was the father of the child, yet the girl had stated to the doctor at the time of childbirth that A was the father of the child.  That is a concrete case, which shows the dangers you may run into in this kind of case. It is hardly twelve months since that case went to the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    <P>I submit to the House they would put a man very much in the power of unscrupulous relatives of a woman, and also very much in the power of a woman who would act as the particular woman I mentioned in this case did act.  In the first instance, I submit that this would be a very dangerous principle indeed to bring into the law, and I ask the Seanad to reject it.  I am perfectly aware of the fact that it may work out as a hardship if the mother dies and the child is left unprovided for, but I think you must choose the lesser of two evils and the lesser is the course I propose.  That is, that the oath of the mother shall be necessary before any tribunal decides the parenthood of the child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to vote for the amendment.  A judge and jury would not be inclined to accept a statement of some person on oath except there was corroborative evidence, and after consideration of the fact whether it was likely to be true or faked.  The mere statement of any one person will not finish the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister <Col N="1077" /> has said simply shows the imperfection of evidence and the uncertainty of it.  The Minister has stated that a girl when in the extremity of pain mentioned one man, and afterwards when in good health mentioned another and succeeded in making that other man responsible, but as to whether he was responsible is a matter which is still open to doubt, although the Minister thinks it is not.  Moreover, the oath of the mother does not finish the question. This Bill gives other safeguards to the man who is charged, because it provides that the oath of the mother shall not be taken as conclusive in any case, and that it must be corroborated in all cases.  A section has been introduced expressly for that. It states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) No Justice of the District Court shall be satisfied that a person is the putative father of an illegitimate child without hearing the evidence of the mother of such child and also evidence corroborative in some material particular or particulars of the evidence of such mother.</P>
      <P>As Senator Colonel Moore has pointed out, if a dying declaration is brought before the court the judge will examine and cross-examine and satisfy himself that there is no manner of doubt whatever that the tongue which purports to give the terms of the dying declaration is a truthful tongue.  I urge the Seanad to accept the amendment.  I think the fears of the Minister regarding it are not well grounded.  I would again suggest that the Report Stage might be adjourned for a week so that we may have the opportunity of devising some further safeguards which would satisfy the Minister or any reasonable person that the position of the man accused would be safeguarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>

      <P>Section 2, sub-section (2).  After paragraph (c) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) where the mother of such child was within the period prescribed <Col N="1079" /> by this Act for making such application of unsound mind within three months after such person becomes of sound mind, or&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) provides for the time within which an application for the issue of a summons or other process under Section 2 may be made: (a) before the birth of the illegitimate child in respect of whom the application is made, or (b) within six months after the birth of the child, (c) where the alleged father of such child contributed to the maintenance of such child within twelve months after its birth, at any time after such contribution, or, and so on.</P>
    <P>I think the amendment explains itself.  It sometimes happens that the girl gets mentally deranged for some time after the birth of the child.  The object of the amendment is not to keep her out of a remedy because of that infirmity of mind.  It is intended to provide that she shall be at liberty to bring her case within three months after she gets well.  I submit the amendment to the House without any comment, except to state that it ought to be accepted.</P>

      <P>As I said in the Dáil, puerperal fever does not last for such a long period as six months.  It lasts for only a very short period.  The practical working of this would, I am afraid, give very considerable difficulty.  Suppose that the six months had elapsed and that a woman came along with a charge and said: &ldquo;Part of the time I was insane&rdquo;&mdash;it is very difficult to say when a person is insane&mdash;it would be very difficult to carry that out. Secondly, suppose that a woman had become insane and remained insane for five or six years, it would be very difficult and very unfair to ask a man to deal with what had happened five or six years before.  If the Seanad inserted an amendment of this nature we certainly would need to have a final time limit.</P>

      <P>Section 2, sub-section (2). After paragraph (c) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) where the mother of such child was not resident in Saorstát Eireann at the date of the birth of such child and the alleged father was domiciled in Saorstát Eireann within three months after the return of the mother to Saorstát Eireann and not later than six months after the birth of such child, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment also deals with the statutory period of limitation within which claims of this kind are to be made.  It deals with a class of case which I am sorry to say is very frequent, the case of the mother of a child flying to another country to hide her misfortune.  In the sub-section there is a final limitation of six months.  The object of the amendment is to give her three months after she comes back to Ireland, or six months from the date of the birth of the child, within which to make her application.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I could never see the meaning of that sub-section because really where there is an agreement between the parties as to the maintenance of a child I think it is in the interests of justice that it should be possible to register it in court.  I think that <Col N="1082" /> sub-section (5), as it stands, is a great impediment to the registration of these agreements.  I do not think it was a desirable provision to put into the Bill, and the object of my amendment is to remedy some of its defects.</P>

      <P>Very well.  The amendment is intended to cover a case like this.  An illegitimate child is born in the house of the grandmother or the grandfather as the case may be.  The putative father is paying 5/- or 7/- a week for the maintenance of the child, and there is an agreement to that effect.  I think it is desirable that these agreements should be registered in court so that there may be no mistake about them, and so that there may be a record of the transaction.  You must remember that you are dealing with an infant, and in case the grandmother, the parent or whoever the person may be who has the custody of the child dies, the evidence of that agreement may be lost.</P>
      <P>I think it is desirable that evidence of that agreement should be preserved, and for that reason I think sub-section (5) ought to be deleted.</P>

      <P>I have already moved amendment 8.  All that I intend to say on it I said earlier.  If the House is of opinion that these agreements ought not to be registered, then, of course, it will not accept this proviso. The amendment to me appears to be reasonable, and I hope the House will accept it.  What I am seeking in the amendment is to have it made clear in the Bill that where a certain agreement has been made, and where &ldquo;the mother is dead or under any legal disability, that the application may be made by the person <Col N="1083" /> having the custody of the child and that the information shall not be required.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As Senator Wilson has already pointed out, it is the mother herself who would create all the difficulty.  There is nothing to prevent her, if she wants to have an order made, going before the District Justice and giving the information necessary to comply with the Act.  If she does not do that, and if after her death it cannot be done because of her neglect during life, then there is no one to be blamed for that but the mother herself.  The Bill seems to make all necessary provision to help the mother to get an affiliation order.  If, by her own act, she does not take the necessary steps to get that order, then I do not see why we should alter legislation to meet difficulties put in the way by claimants themselves.</P>

      <P>Senator Jameson, with all his great experience, and his great wisdom, does not seem to know as much about cases of this description as those of us practising in the courts.  The object of the amendment is not to provide for the mother but for the child.  The case I wish to provide for is that in which the mother is dead and the child alive.  As I have said, agreements are sometimes made between the putative father and the mother.</P>
      <P>These agreements are sometimes made in private and they are not registered.  Either the putative father or the mother may have an objection to their registration.  In the course of years, and after the agreement has been made, the mother may die.  The object of the amendment is to provide for the protection of the child, that if the mother dies it shall be competent for the child, or some person acting on its behalf, to get the agreement come to registered.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand what application this proviso has to sub-section (5).  It seems to me that <Col N="1084" /> the sub-section only deals with the question of information upon oath. If the object which the Senator has explained to the House is to be given effect to, then I think that the proviso ought to be to one of the earlier sections.  If one reads the sub-section and looks at the proviso, I think he will find there is not very much sense in it.</P>

      <P>The amendment reads: &ldquo;Provided that where the mother is dead or under any legal disability the application may be made by the person having the custody of the child and the information shall not be required.&rdquo;  There is no necessity for an information where the mother is dead, and therefore it would be quite impossible for them to make an information against another person.</P>

      <P>The whole principle that underlies this Bill is that the mother should make a statement on oath that so-and-so is the father of her child.  That oath is looked upon, and ought to be, a safeguard to some extent that false charges will not be made.  I do not see that the case that Senator Comyn has put forward could ever in fact possibly arise.  If, under an agreement in writing, a man has been paying for many years he is certainly not going to stop paying. If the mother has trusted him for all these years, and he has kept paying during all that period, it is extremely unlikely that suddenly he will turn around and stop paying. Who is to know if it is a secret matter between the mother and the father?  The reason for non-registration is because it is kept secret. If the mother dies who is to verify the whole business and the whole arrangement which is only known to the two?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir E. Coey Bigger</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a second time.  The voluntary hospitals in Dublin as in most cities have found it very difficult to carry on their work owing to the shortage of funds, and the suggestion has been made that they should be taken over by the State.  I have given much time and thought to this question and have discussed it with the leading authorities in England and Scotland, in Canada, and throughout Australias&mdash;Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia.  I found that the anxiety was the same everywhere, how to maintain the voluntary system and secure the necessary financial support.  This is becoming increasingly difficult, more especially since the great war, as the cost per bed is at least 50 per cent. more than before the war.  Subscriptions have not increased; in most cases they have fallen away.  The Governors of these hospitals are exercising all the economy they can and at the same time are insisting on making the patients pay as far as possible.  I was told recently by a leading surgeon that it was very difficult for patients who cannot pay to obtain admission to some of the large hospitals in Dublin.  There is a greater demand for hospital treatment now than ever before owing to the advances in medicine and surgery, and the more scientific investigation in many of the cases.  This all tends to <Col N="1086" /> make the hospitals more strict in refusing to admit patients who cannot pay.</P>
      <P>My reason for supporting this Bill is to help the hospitals to carry out their original function to afford the best treatment to those patients most urgently in need of it, irrespective of any payment the patients or their friends can make to the hospital. This Bill, if passed, will assist those hospitals which will profit by the scheme to carry out the provision that 25 per cent. of the patients will either be free or not pay more than 10/- per week.</P>
      <P>I admit there are two sides to the question of proceeding as proposed in the Bill, and I would rather the situation could have been met in some other way but not by State control.  I know that the hospitals have tried by every means in their power to obtain further financial assistance and have failed.  The Governors have accepted full responsibility for putting this scheme forward as their only hope of saving the hospitals from closing, or closing portion of the hospitals.  The Governors of the various hospitals are high and broadminded philanthropists with as high moral and religious principles as any of us, and they take the whole responsibility for putting this scheme in force.  This House is not asked to share any responsibility for the arrangements.  I hope the Seanad will approve of the motion to give the Bill a second reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger, I support this Bill, and second the motion for its Second Reading.  I am not enamoured of the Bill.  I agree with Senator Sir Edward Coey Bigger in all he said about the need of the hospitals and the need of the people for the service of the hospitals and the difficulty they experience in getting into them.  A great many people who live a long way from these hospitals in the country and who may have to go into hospital have first to pay their expenses up to town and cannot afford to pay much to the hospital. I do not know whether the scheme they have in England of <Col N="1087" /> having a Hospital Sunday was ever started here.  I think the churches assist and generally get a very good sum.  I believe Hospital Sunday was very successful in England, and I suppose it is still carried on there. I do not know whether it would be very good here.  As to the rights or the wrongs of this particular method of obtaining money by lottery, I suppose if a push were made to get up charitable organisations, fêtes and bazaars and the rest of them a good sum of money could be raised by selling lottery tickets, but I think the system under this Bill would be far preferable, because it will be controlled and dealt with by adults for adults, and people will not be pestered by children coming round selling tickets which people generally do not want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody should support this Bill.  I think it is very important that they should do so, and I think they will.  I do not know whether there are any Puritans here who will object to the fact of lotteries.  I think those Senators who accepted the very scandalous system of betting and the opening of betting houses with their great demoralisation, will hardly stumble over such a mild thing as a lottery, which will not do one-twentieth of the harm that the betting system is doing.  There are some points in the Bill that I do not understand, or rather, I hope I do not understand.  When I turn to the matter of expenses in this Bill they seem to me to be very extraordinary. Section 5 sets out how this money is to be distributed, and as far as I can see thirty per cent. is to be spent on getting up the lottery.  Another 7 per cent. may be spent on one or more people for also getting up the lottery, and finally there will be only 43 per cent. of the money that will be available for the tickets.  Thirty per cent. is to go in expenses, and the ticket-holders will only have a chance of getting 43 per cent. of the money, which, I think, is a very unreasonable arrangement.  This money ought to be given to the hospitals and not to the people who get up the <Col N="1088" /> sweep.  But as far as I can see, only 20 per cent. is to go to the hospitals; 43 per cent. is to go in prizes, whereas 30 per cent. is to go to expenses and another 7 per cent. to more than one person who is to help. It all seems to me to be most extraordinary. Perhaps I misunderstand the meaning of the section, but on the face of it, it seems to me that my assumption is correct.  Adding up 30 per cent., 20 per cent., and 7 per cent., we find that makes 57 per cent., which means that only 43 per cent. goes to the ticket-holders who invest their money, so that these people will have a very bad show in this matter.  The hospital people will have a bad show, whereas the people who get the thing up will have a very good show, for they will get thirty per cent. of the whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of those Puritans who oppose this Bill and the principle involved in it.  I am that peculiar class of Puritan that I confess that I have to-day taken ten tickets in a sweepstake, but I think what a person may do in a private capacity for a private enterprise is rather in a different field than to support this Bill.  This system of sweepstakes is not new in Dublin.  I took some tickets for such sweepstakes and I took notice of what happened.  I object to the principle of raising money by sweepstakes, because if it is accepted it will dry up, or cause to dry up, all sources of private and public charity which previously had gone to support those hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I really think this Bill will very largely defeat itself.  I oppose the Bill with some misgiving, because I quite recognise what Senator Sir E. Coey Bigger said, that it is a choice of two evils.  But I am further strengthened in my opposition to <Col N="1089" /> the Bill inasmuch as I believe if the element of sweepstakes comes in then inevitably you will have corruption. Money raised in sweepstakes some years ago very largely did not go to the hospitals, and many people like myself who took tickets would not have taken them if we knew the proportion that went to sources other than those set forth on the face of the tickets.  I regret to have to do it, but I intend to oppose this Bill, and I hope other Senators will vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to move the rejection of the Bill and in this I suppose I am going to be in a minority amongst those with whom I usually act, as I was seven years ago in the Dáil.  Senator Milroy will probably remember the circumstances on that occasion, and I hope the eventuality in this House will be the same as that of the Bill in the Dáil in 1923.  I think the proposer of this motion gave away the case, inadvertently, when he said that during his travels in many parts of the world he met people associated with hospitals and that they were faced with the same difficulty as we are.  That is to say, private hospitals could not obtain the funds from private charitable sources that they require to carry on this work.  I would like the Senator to consider the effect of that statement upon his argument.  We are going to meet the difficulty by a system of sweepstakes&mdash;sweepstakes which confessedly are not directed to the people of this country but are open to people all over the world. Following our example the hospital authorities in Australia seeing that they are in difficulties will adopt the sweepstakes plan and will appeal to the people, not of Australia, but all over the world and so will the people of South America and so will the people of England and the people of North America.  In all those countries where the Senator found the same difficulties existing that we have they will follow the same plan and then what is going to be the result?  Sweepstake tickets everywhere for charities everywhere, for purpose not of charity at all but <Col N="1090" /> purely of speculation in the hope that some day a profit may come to the holder of the lucky ticket.</P>
      <P>I should like to read an extract from a speech delivered by the late Minister for Justice on the First Reading of the Bill of 1923 which was in effect, identical with this Bill. Mr. Kevin O'Higgins, who was then Minister for Home Affairs and afterwards Minister for Justice, speaking in the Dáil on 21st February, 1923, column 1577-8, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to make it clear, from the outset, that there is very little likelihood now that this Bill can receive anything but opposition from me in the position which I hold.  I have given enough examination and investigation to the question of sweepstakes to realise that it would be almost impossible to close all the loopholes of corruption and fraud, and if this Bill comes along and says that the sweep shall be run under conditions and regulations to be approved of by the Minister for Home Affairs, the Minister for Home Affairs will have much satisfaction in opposing the Bill, and saying that he does not propose to put on his Department the work of trying to devise conditions and regulations which would do, or attempt to do, a thing which he regards as well nigh impossible.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that although the Minister at that time had not very long experience of his Department, the Minister for Justice to-day, having Departmental experience of three years, is opposed to the Bill, as was the Minister for Justice in 1923.  I now draw attention to the Report of the Committee of the Dáil of that year which was set up to consider the matter.  It consisted of Deputies O'Maille, Milroy, Dr. White, Sears, Hughes, Nagle, Corish, Thrift, Magennis and Duggan.  That Committee recommended that the Bill, which had been referred to them, should be amended so as to include this section: &ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any Committee conducting a sweepstake or drawing of prizes to farm out or hand over for <Col N="1091" /> a money consideration the conducting of such sweepstake or drawing to a private individual or private individuals.&rdquo;  Now, though ostensibly this Bill will be run by a Committee, there is provision made in it for the expenses which the promoter may draw.  It is clearly indicated by the plan of the Bill that the Hospital Committee should be merely for show purposes, although the Committee, of course, would father or accept responsibility for the scheme which is to be submitted to the Minister for approval, but the running of the sweepstakes is to be within certain conditions handed over to a promoter.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the very definite recommendation of that Committee to the Dáil in 1923 that, in their opinion, such a proposal should not be lawful, and that if there was to be any legitimisation of the sweepstakes system for the purpose of financing hospitals it should be done by the hospitals as a voluntary or semi-voluntary scheme, and a more of less amateur scheme.  As to this professional sweepstakes business and the arrangement of it, anybody who has read the discussion before the Committee can have a clear exposition of the plan.  The proposal is to raise £100,000; that is to say, to sell tickets to the value of £100,000, or £200,000, or £250,000.  But £100,000 was commonly only mentioned. Ninety per cent. of these tickets are to be sold outside this country.  Five to ten per cent. is the estimated figure that will be sold to the charitable public in Ireland. Eighty per cent.&mdash;that was the figure quoted in the Bill of 1923&mdash;of such tickets were to be sold in Great Britain, and the remaining ten or fifteen per cent. in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Since that date certain experience has been gained probably, and it may be that a larger field than Great Britain will be sought for the sale of these tickets, because the police opposition in England may be more strict now than it was in 1922 and 1923, although it was recorded then <Col N="1092" /> that very large quantities of the tickets which were sent through the post in England were confiscated by the British Postal Authorities. Senator Colonel Moore has referred to the percentages that are set out in the Bill under Section 5, sub-section (2).  The Senator has not quite correctly stated what is set out there.  The proposal is that for the use of the name of the hospital and the legitimisation of the sweep the hospital should get 20 per cent. of the takings.  That is, the commission to the hospital to be paid by the promoter of the sweepstake for the use of the name of the hospital will be not less than 20 per cent. of the takings.  The commission shall not exceed 30 per cent. which 30 per cent. will include a sum not exceeding 7 per cent. for the promotion charges.  That is to say, 50 per cent. will be left as provision for the prizes, the cost of printing the tickets, and certain other minor charges.  Though it appears from this sub-section that these are the minima and the maxima, the plan, as enumerated by the promoters of the Bill in the Dáil Committee, is clearly that the 50 per cent. of the expected amount, or a sum that is equivalent to 50 per cent., will be available as prize money.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill to limit the number of free tickets that the promoter of the Bill may allot to himself or to his friends.  Presuming that we have a sale of £100,000 worth of tickets, what does this Bill provide for?  It provides for £7,000 going to the promoter as his profit, and, if you like, payment for his risk and his insurance.  That is, having his organisation, he can count on selling £100,000 worth of tickets by an expenditure of £15,000 or £20,000 in postage and printing, and he will make a profit of £7,000 for himself. As I have already said, it is a professional undertaking, and we are legitimising the profession of sweepstake promoters in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The earlier Bill was limited to the period of one year, but this Bill is limited to a period of four years. In those four years very many <Col N="1093" /> sweepstakes can be promoted, all kinds of hospitals can seek the approval of the Minister for their sweepstakes.  By that time the industry of sweepstakes promotion will have become established.  There will, no doubt, be a considerable number of people employed as clerks, and, as I said on a previous debate on sweepstakes, vested interests, if one may so speak, will have grown up.  It was put forward as one reason why these sweeps might be legitimatised that there were 600 clerks employed, and if you refuse permission to carry on the sweeps you will throw on the unemployment market 600 clerks. That was the argument then used.  But the establishment and legitimisation of these sweepstakes for four years will mean that there will be a considerable plea at the end of the four years for their continuation, on the grounds that otherwise you are going to disemploy a certain number of clerks.  I ask Senators, particularly those who are interested in local government, if we proceed to finance private hospitals by this method is there any reason on earth why the public hospitals&mdash;those under the control of the boards of health&mdash;should not be financed by the same method?  There is no reason whatever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This comes from the Sinn Féiners, those who talk and preach about self-reliance.

      <P>This is not a Bill for the legalisation of lotteries.  I am not opposing this Bill on the grounds that it is a lottery or that it is a sweepstake.  Sweepstakes have been run, and run up to date, notwithstanding the fact that they are illegal. I would much prefer the general legalisation of sweepstakes than this kind of Bill, which legalises for specific purposes for in the main the private profit of a few promoters who will exploit the needs of the hospitals for their profit.  Is it accepted that we are to use the needs of the hospitals for private profit? One of the members of the Dáil Committee who has a considerable <Col N="1095" /> knowledge of the circumstances and conditions under which these sweeps will be run informed that Committee that the probability was that a great deal of the work will be done in Switzerland, because it seems that there is an organisation available there which it was not quite convenient to transfer to this country. It is, of course, set out that the printing will be done in this country, and that is part of the bribe for the legalisation, for a specific purpose, of sweepstakes.  I do not think there has ever been a Bill introduced covering four or five pages and with ten or eleven sections which contained more objectionable features than this.</P>
      <P>There are many loopholes for fraud; there is very little in the Bill to prevent fraud.  Those of us who are in the way of being pestered by children and others in trying to sell to us those minor sweepstake tickets will know quite well how easy it is for fraud to be committed in this matter.  You are proposing to send out, under the scheme embodied in the Bill, millions of sweepstake tickets.  In the case of two sweeps it was reported that not less than three million tickets had been issued and somewhere else it was reported that nine out of every ten that are issued are never returned.  Is there any safeguard under this Bill which will insure that the people who buy tickets receive the chance for which they are paying?  Is there anything to insure that the person who sells the tickets will forward the counterfoil to the head office to insure that the ticket number will be drawn? There is nothing whatever to insure these things and I am as certain as I am here standing that there are many thousands of tickets sold all over the world to people who are attracted by the name of an hospital but whose tickets never come within the scheme and whose chances of drawing a prize are nil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people pay for a ticket and that counterfoil never reaches the hospital.  That and the money the person paid are retained by the seller of the ticket.  If one bears in <Col N="1096" /> mind the very small proportion of these tickets that are within the jurisdiction of the authorities of this country, then one will see how impossible it is to ensure that fraud is not going to be perpetrated under this scheme.  Because of the palpable risks of gross fraud and corruption, the Minister opposed the predecessor of this Bill.  Nothing has been done to correct the possibilities of such frauds occurring now or to stop up these loopholes.  We are calmly told in the Bill that notwithstanding that the Minister has to approve the scheme, it must not on any account appear in any printed matter or in any advertisement of the Bill that this has the sanction of the Government of the Free State.  We are legislating for the sanction of these things.  We are to give a certificate of legitimisation to this scheme, but we are to keep it dark from the world that the Government is authorising it.  Do not let it be known that this is an authorised scheme for fear of the danger of the bad name and the loss of credit that will accrue to the Government.</P>
    <P>It has been said that there is no alternative.  I cannot understand the position of the friends of the hospitals in this matter.  It seems to me that for some unaccountable reason they are very loth indeed to seek or even accept any money from any public authority in the State for fear that the Government may require supervision over their affairs.  Why should there be any objection to the possibility of State supervision?  As a matter of fact there are very many institutions that receive State grants at present and are not supervised in any direct way.  I cannot understand the antipathy on the part of the hospital committees to this supervision by the State.  If these hospitals are of social value to the country, why should they not come forward and demand a grant-in-aid? In 1923, I took upon myself the responsibility of saying that £100,000 could be raised in one year by the addition of one penny to the Health Insurance contribution, or that £50,000 could be raised by the <Col N="1097" /> addition of one halfpenny to the Health Insurance contribution.  Apparently even the hint was not acceptable. I had no authority then to make that statement and I have no authority now to repeat it, but such a suggestion has never been repudiated, and I am sure the insured persons would be glad to pay that halfpenny or that penny provided that they and their families were ensured the right of hospital treatment.</P>
    <P>There are ways in which the hospitals can be saved financially, and the best way, I believe, in which to do that is by a definite grant from the State funds which might be raised through the organisation of Health Insurance.  I would much prefer, if you are going to legitimise sweepstakes for a specific purpose&mdash; for a social and benevolent need&mdash; that it should be definitely done under the auspices of the Ministry of Finance or somebody appointed and approved by the Minister to run the sweepstakes.  Notwithstanding the suggestion that this Bill would only be opposed by Puritans&mdash;and I rather pride in the appellation, if I can be called a Puritan&mdash;I am not adverse to the system of premium bonds for this and other purposes run under official auspices, where every item of the expense can be scrutinised and where no private interest can be served in the matter. But the proposal on the part of the promoters of this Bill is: &ldquo;We believe you ought to continue to make sweepstakes illegal in general; but for the specific purpose during the short period for which application is made by a certain class of persons we want you to legalise these sweepstakes.&rdquo;  Then a group of financiers, probably three or four individuals, who are going to use the hospitals as their means of exploiting the public, are to benefit by the exploitation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the speech of Senator Johnson.  He has, I am sure, covered very completely some of the points that show our objections to this Bill. Whatever may be said about the <Col N="1098" /> position of the hospitals, I think we must admit that the system under which these sweepstakes are contemplated mainly makes for profiteering at the expense of the charitable public by an individual, or a group of individuals, who will be at the back of the promoters of each scheme.  There are several other aspects of the Bill that will have to be radically changed before I would vote for it.  There is the question of the supervision of the administration and control and the method of managing of the various hospitals. If we refer to Section 3 of the Bill we see it stated in sub-section (1) and in sub-section (2):</P>
      <P>(1)  When a scheme is submitted to the Minister under this Act, the Minister may, if he so thinks proper, and he is satisfied that the hospital or hospitals named in such scheme is or are a hospital or hospitals to which this Act applies, sanction such scheme either without modification or with such modifications as he may think fit to make therein.</P>
      <P>(2)  When a scheme is submitted to the Minister under this Act, the Minister may, for the purpose of satisfying himself that a hospital named in such scheme is a hospital to which this Act applies, require such evidence by statutory declaration or otherwise as he thinks fit.</P>
      <P>I venture to suggest that the clause does not go nearly far enough to ensure that the hospital or hospitals applying for permission to run sweepstakes are entitled to run them.  In my opinion, the Minister would require to satisfy himself on many other aspects.  He would have to satisfy himself as regards the administration of the hospital, as regards the efficiency with which it does its work.  The balance sheet will not necessarily convey that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the balance sheet of the preceding year has to be submitted to the Minister, but a balance sheet will not convey adequately the proportion of service considering the resources at the disposal of the hospital. <Col N="1099" /> A hospital might be very much in debt and yet run a much greater service, say, to the sick poor than an hospital with a fairly heavy balance sheet.  Then there is the question of the beds allotted, I presume, but it does not make it very clear in the Bill, that this means beds allotted and used.  A hospital might allot 50 or 60 or 100 beds, but the per week or per annum use of those beds is, I think, the thing upon which the Minister would require to satisfy himself before he would grant a permit or say that a hospital was legitimately entitled to the benefit of the Act.</P>
    <P>There is one other question and I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that it is a question that causes a good deal of discussion in certain circles in the city.  That is the system of making appointments to the staffs.  I may state quite frankly that so far as I know, and I am reasonably well informed, I believe that the staff appointments are very far from satisfactory to the main body of medical opinion and that considerations other than professional efficiency or competence, operate.  All of us know, I think, that canvassing is rampant for every position vacant in the hospitals.  We do know that various considerations other than those of competence are taken into account.  I do not want to go into an historical survey with regard to the governorship of the various hospitals, but there are certain barriers in some of them due to old charters and to the maintenance of a certain type of board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order may I ask if we are not discussing the question simply that hospitals are not in funds and whether or not this is the proper way to assist them? It is not in order I suggest to discuss the internal affairs of hospitals on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator is quite in order.  We are discussing the Public Charitable Hospitals and the method of alleviating the condition of these hospitals, and the Senator is, I think, quite in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1100" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to Senator Milroy that I am discussing the Bill from the point of view of the information and the particulars to be submitted to the Minister under Section 3.  As I say, I do not wish at this stage to go into a historical survey of the various hospitals in our midst, but I do know, and it is generally accepted, that certain barriers do exist in certain hospitals.  I am not referring to any particular sectarian hospital more than another.  What I do complain about is that the system is, in my judgment, wrong, and I would suggest that if the Minister is going to pass any scheme for the running of a sweepstake under the Act, he should take such steps as will ensure that the administration, management and the equity of the staff appointments should come under his control before he gives his permission for such a scheme.  I suggest to him and to the House that a medical advisory board could be called into being which would operate with him and could guide him in his decision as to whether all the things that he would expect a hospital to do were being adequately done before he gives such permission.</P>
      <P>One other thing that occurs to me on this Bill is that, as legislation stands at present, any individual, or group of individuals, can take premises, occupy them&mdash;it may be only a tenement house&mdash;and proceed to create a hospital, apply to the public for funds, institute flag days and such things.  I do not think that is as it should be.  I understand that such things have been done, and done up to a comparatively recent time, in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I suggest, arising out of this Bill, owing to the possibility of hospitals being created for the exploitation of the public, that a licence should be necessary before any hospital, which may apply for public funds, should be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the main, I am in agreement with Senator Johnson that the care of the sick poor should be a charge on the State, and that it is going to place us in a very dangerous position if we are going to leave ourselves <Col N="1101" /> at the mercy of promoters of sweepstakes who are really&mdash;let us be quite honest about it&mdash;betting men who want to exploit the charitable public and who want, for a certain fee, to use the name of the hospitals to appeal to the public.  I think that is the history of previous sweepstakes, and that it will be the history of future sweepstakes if they are to be administered under this Bill.  I understand that the promotion of the Calcutta Sweep and of the big Stock Exchange Sweep in England cost 10 per cent.  That 10 per cent. covers all expenses, secretarial duties, printing of the tickets, etc.  I see no reason why a sweep could not be carried on if it has a charitable object at the same rate for expenses here.  If it cannot be done, I think, as the Bill stands at present, particularly with the expenses clause, it will only be used and exploited by the promoters of sweepstakes, with the hospitals as an excuse for profiteering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I am not enamoured or in love with the proposed scheme for providing the funds that are required to carry on our charitable hospitals, but I have not yet met the person who can provide an alternative.  I do know something about the position of some of the hospitals, and I am perfectly satisfied that if we do not do something like this to provide them with sufficient funds to carry on they will have to close their doors.  There is no alternative at the moment.  If any person could show me where £40,000 or £50,000 can be found, to pay off what is due on one of the best hospitals in Dublin, then I will not vote for the Bill; but unless I can be shown where they can get the money I will be compelled to vote for it.  I must say that there were certain matters raised in connection with this Bill at which I was surprised. I commence with the criticism of Senator Connolly, who referred to the question of the management of the Dublin hospitals. I always believed that if there was one thing of which we could be proud and of which we could <Col N="1102" /> boast in Dublin it was the management of our hospitals.  I have heard it stated by people who travelled the world that the management of our hospitals was superior to any they experienced in any part of the world, be they State-controlled or otherwise. I was certainly astonished to hear Senator Connolly complaining of the management of the hospitals. I would not attempt to go into the question which Senator Connolly raised in regard to the staffing of the hospitals, but from the little knowledge I possess of the Dublin hospitals&mdash;and I have some knowledge of them&mdash;I am perfectly satisfied that there is not good ground for the complaint. From the information at my disposal in regard to the hospitals, I think I can say that the complaint which the Senator has made in regard to their staffs is not well founded.  I will not say any more than that.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnson, in objecting to the Bill, told us that he took up the identically same position now which he did with regard to some similar effort that was made in 1923.  The proof that the position he took up at that stage was wrong is that from 1923 the load of debt has been increasing on the Dublin hospitals and no satisfactory effort has been made to reduce it.  In fact, they are all in a worse position than they were in 1923, and until an alternative has been put up to this method of raising funds&mdash;none of us are in love with it&mdash;we must accept it.  That is the position.  I remember, in order to help one of the best hospitals in Dublin&mdash;and they are all good hospitals; I do not want to single out one any more than another; they are all doing splendid work&mdash;a few months ago we had to have a dog race meeting to try to pay off the week's wages, to promote dog races to try to pay the weekly wages!  It is a disgrace to people who call themselves Christians that we should allow the hospitals to fall into that terrible position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hospitals which are doing most for the poor that are heaviest in debt.  That is the unfortunate <Col N="1103" /> position.  Unless we can come to their assistance in some way the poor will be deprived of necessary medical attention and treatment. The Saviour of Mankind, when carrying on His healing activities, did not seek out the wealthy man to heal him.  He healed the rich and the poor.  It should not matter to us whether a person is rich or poor if he needs medical attention.  Unless some effort is made to provide funds for these hospitals the poor cannot be properly attended to.  These are the brutal facts of the situation; we have got to provide the money somehow. If the State is prepared to provide the money I will not vote for this Bill.  On the question of State control of the hospitals, I may say that I am perfectly satisfied that they are better managed under the present system than they would be under State control.  I may be alone in that opinion, but after a considerable experience I am not prepared to support State control against the present control, which is better than any the State could devise.</P>
    <P>The statement has been made that we are going to go around the world begging for the hospitals of this country.  Any person who takes serious notice of passing events, who takes up a morning or evening paper approaching the end of March, a day or two prior to the running of some race, which is, I think, called the Grand National, we find column after column announcing the results of sweeps on the Grand National for various purposes &mdash;some bona fide for charitable and religious organisations, and a number of them for other purposes.  In another few weeks' time if the people who talk about this Bill take up their morning or evening newspaper they will see whole columns of the paper filled with the results of sweeps on another race, which is, I think, called the Derby.  If the people are prepared to take tickets for various purposes in sweeps on these races surely they will be prepared to take them for sweeps in aid of the hospitals.  I believe there is sufficient money for the various <Col N="1104" /> sweeps for which tickets are sold in this country to keep our hospitals in a proper financial position, and we should not allow that money to go elsewhere.  Might I go further and say that there is nothing in the world to prevent, to-night or tomorrow night, my buying a Stock Exchange ticket on the Derby Sweep if I want to?  I can also get tickets on the Calcutta Sweep if I want to.  Most people can get them if they know their way about.  We buy Calcutta Sweep tickets, and Stock Exchange Sweep tickets, and we do not know to what purpose the money is being devoted.  I believe that the proceeds of the London Stock Exchange Sweep are given to widows and orphans.  What the proceeds of the Calcutta Sweep are devoted to I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are willing to buy tickets for the promotion of racing, I think it is as well to buy them to assist our hospitals.  There is undoubtedly a gambling spirit amongst our people, and we had better face it.  Our people will invest in the half-crown or shilling ticket, and if they cannot buy it outside they will run a sweep in their own workshops.  I was often in them myself. In fact, I have seen sweeps run in this House.  If we are willing to contribute to those things, surely it is no harm to do it openly and above board when the proceeds will go to the aid of a hospital?  Senator Colonel Moore referred to the question of expenses in connection with running sweeps, but the Senator forgot to say that 30 per cent. is the maximum that would be allowed for expenses under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not laid down that 30 per cent. must be spent on expenses or that that is the maximum that can be allowed for expenses. From what I heard about sweeps, it is necessary to expend money on them in order to make money.  If a large number of tickets are not printed and got into circulation, if the sweep is not well advertised, and good prizes offered, the money will not <Col N="1105" /> be raised.  As to the question of safeguards, those who are opposing the Bill can, on the Committee Stage, move amendments safeguarding the position, and I will be prepared to support them.  As a matter of fact, there are safeguards in the Bill already.  In the first place, any hospital which proposes to run a sweepstake must, first of all, get the Minister's sanction.  The Minister must be aware of the financial position of each hospital, the kind of work it is doing, the names of the Committee appointed by that hospital to run the sweep, and other particulars. There are safeguards in the Bill, but if they are not strong enough we can, by the insertion of amendments on the Committee Stage, ensure further safeguards.  I am not supporting this Bill for the purpose of enriching sweep promoters. I have no interest in them, but I have an interest in our hospitals, because I know the work they are doing.  It is because I know the position in which the hospitals find themselves, and because I know the work that they could do if they had more money, that I am supporting this Bill.  I hope the Seanad will take the view that I take and pass the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonMahon" hpid="Sir Bryan Mahon Sir Bryan Mahon">
      <NameTxt>Sir Bryan Mahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill and I agree with what Senator Farren said.  I do not support it in order to run sweepstakes, but because I think it will help the hospitals.  There has been a great deal of talk about sweepstakes.  In every civilised country that I know they are run for charitable purposes. Why should they not be run here for charitable purposes?  You cannot get a better charity than our hospitals. I know something about the Calcutta Sweep.  It is run not for charitable purposes but for the purpose of helping racing.  An enormous sum is raised every year and the profits are given to racing.  The promoters of that sweep had an excess of £100,000 three years ago and the money was given by the Calcutta Turf Club as a donation to hospitals. I would not be in favour of sweepstakes if any other means could be <Col N="1106" /> got to help the hospitals.  If such a sweep could be run under the control of the State for charitable purposes it would be all the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. Hooper Mr. Hooper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be more impressed by the opposition to the Bill if some practical alternative had been put forward.  It is true that Senator Johnson suggested that money might be raised by extra contributions from workers under the National Health Insurance Act.  Let us examine that suggestion and its practicability.  The Senator told us that that suggestion was put forward seven years ago and he stated that he had no authority to put it forward then than now.  Apparently he got no support even from his own Party.  It was not taken up by the Oireachtas, and as Senator Farren pointed out, during these seven years nothing has been done to meet the emergency that has arisen.  Even if we could get some assurance now that there was some prospect of Senator Johnson's suggestion being put into practice, one could better understand the opposition to the Bill.  But we have no such assurance and, so far as anyone can tell, we may be in exactly the same position seven years hence that we are in to-day, or that we were in seven years ago.  In the meantime the hospitals are struggling and something has to be done to help them.  What are we going to do? Are we going to reject this Bill and to let them struggle on as they have been struggling or to give them the helping hand that this Bill holds out to them?  What is their position? I was struck by reading a report of an hospital meeting held the other day&mdash;I think it was the Coombe Hospital&mdash;at which a statement was made by Sir William Taylor who, as we all know, is one of the leading surgeons in Dublin.  This is what he said with respect to the position of the Dublin hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking a conservative estimate he could say that the Dublin hospitals are in debt to the extent of £130,000.  It would take almost as much more to bring them up to <Col N="1107" /> modern requirements&mdash;a quarter of a million was wanted.  They could not go to the Government for the money which would mean increased taxation.</P>
    <P>Sir William continued:</P>
    <P>I am sick and tired of trying for years past to raise money for hospitals with which I am associated. We have explored every avenue of income, but the fact is that the people have not got the money to give.  We have got to face the fact that the only means left to the hospitals to enable them to carry on is the sweepstake.</P>
    <P>Later he said:</P>
    <P>Only by means of sweepstakes can the hospitals of Dublin be cleared of debt and brought into a condition fit for the successful practice of modern surgery and medicine.</P>
    <P>Only last week I read the statement of another gentleman prominently identified with our Dublin hospitals&mdash;Lord Powerscourt.  He said at a meeting of the Children's Hospital in Harcourt Street, that unless something of that kind was done the hospitals would have to stop and others like him were at their wits' end in the matter.  Some help of this kind is essential if they are to continue.  That being the case the question for us to put to ourselves is, whether we will oppose this Bill, or wait until some scheme, such as Senator Johnson put forward, is made available.  Senator Dowdall told us that his main objection to the Bill was that it would dry up the springs of charity.  Surely the reason this Bill is before us is that the springs have dried up.  Another objection to the Bill was that it would lead to corruption.  I cannot say that it is corruption proof but I should think that if we passed the Second Reading, on the Committee Stage we might be able, with the help of some of those who have taken exception on these grounds, to devise some means of preventing corruption.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> Suggestions were made that swindling could be effected by people retaining the money for tickets which they had sold.  One would think that this was really the first time that this kind of enterprise was carried on.  Sweepstakes of this kind have been carried on for a very long time.  So far as Dublin is concerned something of the kind has been in existence for at least 150 years.  The most famous of our hospitals was built largely on the proceeds of a lottery.  I refer to the Rotunda Hospital.  Other public works in Dublin were carried on under similar circumstances.  In recent times other sweepstakes were also carried out, and so far as I know no grave abuses were ever proved. Loose suggestions have been made, but I think when arguments are advanced in that way we ought to have some proof.  Another suggestion put forward was that this Bill was introduced mainly in the interests of certain promoters.  I think that is another statement that we should have some proof of.  As far as I am concerned, I am not supporting the Bill in the interests of any promoters. I think enough has been said to show that this Bill is wanted in the interests of the hospitals.  It is true that the hospitals and the committees that will have charge of the sweepstakes will have to get expert advice in the promotion of sweepstakes.  It cannot be expected that the governors of hospitals could have the experience or the knowledge in order to efficiently conduct enterprises of the kind.  It is only right that they should have authority to employ people who are experienced.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned that the amount of money promoters would be entitled to draw was too large.  It may be.  If it is too large let us try when we come to the Committee Stage to restrict it in some way, but do not make that a reason for rejecting the Bill now.  On the question of expenses I was reading some of the proceedings before the Special Committee appointed by the Dáil to deal with the Bill and some very interesting <Col N="1109" /> figures were quoted.  Deputy Sir James Craig, who had charge of the Bill, mentioned the Toome Sweep in 1923 and stated that the figures relating to that sweep were before the Dáil.  He said that 37 per cent. went in expenses.</P>
    <P>This evidence was given before the Committee that the Chairman referred to, dealing with the Toome sweeps.  Only £5,000 was given in prizes, while postage cost £31,000; printing and stationery, £6,000; wages, £3,600; advertisements, £205.  The total expenses came to £31,171.  That included the £5,000 spent on prizes.  The tickets sold realised £84,863, so that the expenses came to 37 per cent. of the tickets sold, the profits being £52,999, or 63 per cent.</P>
    <P>When this Bill puts a limit on the expenses allowable, 30 per cent., it cannot be regarded as an excessive amount in view of the 37 per cent. in the case of the sweep in the North of Ireland.  These are all the points I wish to make, but I earnestly appeal to the House to pass the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the opposition to this measure has been voiced from various quarters in the House.  Speaking of the Bill, I must say that it has been very skilfully promoted.  Whoever had an interest in framing this Bill and legalising a lottery of this description has done his work well.  He has first cast about for a truly charitable object, the hospitals of Dublin, and then he secured as sponsors for his Bill in the Dáil and the Seanad men of the highest character, men with a long record of unpaid service to the poor, men who have to admit that they are not in favour of this measure, except that they know of no other possible alternative.  I submit to the Seanad that it is a perfect disgrace that the sick poor of this city should be left in such a position.  They are the first charge on the resources of the State, and my answer to those who ask me what is the alternative to this is: &ldquo;Tighten your belt, economise, and <Col N="1110" /> pay for the upkeep and for the medical attendance of your sick poor.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What does this Bill propose to do? It proposes to alter the general law against lotteries.  In the Dáil, the Bill encountered the opposition of the President&mdash;the head of the Government&mdash;it encountered the opposition of the Minister for Justice, and yet it moved on.  If all the bookmakers had been united on this Bill it would have been carried through the Dáil.  It appears they are not.</P>
      <P>I see in this Bill a very peculiar clause, Section 7 (2)&mdash;</P>
      <P>No advertisement, memorandum, circular, ticket or other document issued by a committee in relation to a sweepstake held under this Act shall contain any words indicating or which could reasonably be construed as indicating that such sweepstake is being held under the auspices or patronage of the Government of Saorstát Eireann or any Minister head of a Department of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is not that sub-section a confession on the part of the Minister that there is something discreditable in this measure for raising money? What I submit is this: if you have to raise money by means of a lottery, face the situation squarely and have a State lottery properly conducted. It was stated in the course of the debate that at least 30 per cent. of the money which would be collected from the public would go in expenses. That, I submit confidently, is a very expensive way of raising money.  The cost of collecting the ordinary taxes require only 4 per cent. or 5 per cent. of the total amount collected.  Therefore, I say as a tax on the people and as a method of raising money, it is a most expensive method, and the Ministry which allowed it, or the Oireachtas which passes this Bill would be much wiser if they faced their responsibilities and provided the money directly out of State funds, providing it either by economy of expenditure or by additional taxation if necessary.  Is this <Col N="1111" /> sweepstake to be confined to Ireland? Even if it is, I would say that it is open to the greatest possible abuse and that there are in this measure loopholes for fraud in every section.</P>
    <P>Apparently it is not going to be confined to this country.  Apparently the central clearing house is to be Switzerland.  It is to be an international affair.  What are you going to do?  Are you going to facilitate the sale of tickets for the poor of Dublin in friendly countries where the sale of such tickets is contrary to law?  Will you allow bootleggers to bootleg tickets into countries where their sale is forbidden?</P>

      <P>Through Holland.  I am not going to give any information which may be used by highly respectable gentlemen, like my friend here, for the purpose of gambling.  With regard to the pushing of the sale of these tickets, take the United States.  It is to the interest of the man who gets tickets to push their sale by every means at his disposal and by every argument he can use.  What is the first argument? &ldquo;Why not buy these tickets? They are for the poor Dublin hospitals, the sick poor of Dublin.  The Free State cannot afford to pay for its sick poor, and why not give a shilling to Róisín Dubh?&rdquo;  Dark Rosaleen, I can assure you, will be cited again and again for the purpose of pushing the sale of these tickets, and the names of the highly honoured and decent men who have been induced to become protagonists of this measure will be freely made use of.  I have heard a lot within the last few days about disparaging the credit of the country, but nothing could disparage it more than hawking about the world tickets for sweepstakes to support the sick poor, who, by your own admission, you cannot support.  It is, in my opinion, very disgraceful.  Let us see the frauds that can be perpetrated under this Bill.  I am not surprised that the Minister has as, I think, weakly guarded himself against any responsibility by saying that his name was not to be used in connection with these sweepstakes.  Let us say that 10,000 tickets are sent to Kansas City, St. Louis, or any other city where Irish people reside, and they are sold.  There is no provision in the Bill to secure that 1,000 of the tickets, or counterfoils of the tickets, will come back.  £1,000,000 worth, or £500,000 worth, of tickets <Col N="1114" /> might be sold under this scheme, and probably will be, for there is a vast organisation and a great cause&mdash;the Dublin hospitals.  They have great names behind this Bill, and then they have poor old Ireland.  I thought we had sufficient self-respect, although we are poor, to prevent us from sending the hat around the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand Senator Comyn's sympathy with the United States, seeing that certain people connected with his views and politics are over there exploiting them on behalf of a newspaper project. The Senator would think it a crime if we were to go there and ask them to assist the sick poor of this country.  The Senator has referred to England as a friendly country, and naturally he is very anxious we should not exploit the Englishman in favour of the sick poor of this country. Coming to the realities of the position, we who live in the city cannot shut our eyes to the position of the hospitals.  The three maternity hospitals are on the verge of bankruptcy. They have to curtail their help to the poor of the city.  Every week-end we see people going around making guys of themselves trying to extract a few shillings from the sympathetic public of the city, and even the money got by that means falls short of meeting the requirements of the hospitals.  Senator Johnson suggested that another penny could be put on the National Health Insurance, <Col N="1115" /> and he told us of the amount of revenue that would bring in.  I want to tell Senator Johnson, in case he does not know, that the trade unions have a levy towards the support of hospitals in the city, and that they, as far as individuals are concerned, tax themselves to the very limit of their capacity. Owing to the lack of funds a Dublin citizen can hardly get admission into the city hospitals.  Why?  Because the county councils and the public health bodies down the country when they send a patient to an hospital in Dublin make a contribution towards the funds of the hospital, and naturally the hospitals in their present financial position embrace the people having money rather than the ordinary workingman who cannot pay directly for his keep in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be done by making the levy universal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if we had the ideal State the Senator is thinking of that would provide all the accommodation required.  The Senator has been agitating for that for seven years, and in the meantime we see the hospitals deteriorating, and getting heavier and heavier into debt. Now when somebody comes along with a scheme which might go some way to get the hospitals out of their present financial position, and certainly it will not go all the way to make the hospitals what they ought to be somebody expresses the opinion that there are too many loopholes for fraud, and that kind of thing in the Bill.  We know that sweepstakes are going on all the time in the city, and has anybody any knowledge of the amount of fraud that comes from them?  Here we have a properly set up constituted regularised national or semi-national sweepstake, and which will be on the lines of the London Stock Exchange. Safeguards are provided in the case of the London Stock Exchange tickets.  You are assured you will get a receipt from headquarters for your contribution, so that you will <Col N="1116" /> know whether your money has been sent on or not.  In the case of other kinds of sweepstakes we know that is not so.  I believe that under properly regulated national sweepstakes, such as are contemplated in this Bill, the public will have a safeguard for the money they give. There will be a check on the funds&mdash; an audit, and so on.  If we can exploit outsiders in England, America or elsewhere for the purpose of improving our hospitals I think we are perfectly entitled to do so.  It is no indignity.  Certainly it is less belittling to the country to go abroad to appeal for funds for the suffering poor, than it is to go abroad to ask for subscriptions for a newspaper or political associations.  I think the Second Reading of this Bill ought to be passed, and if there is anything wrong with the Bill it can be amended in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. Barrington Mr. Barrington">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrington</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of Senator Comyn's denunciation, I am a convinced and unrepentant supporter of this Bill, and for the reasons that Senator Farren has put forward. I have been associated with a certain hospital for a great many years, and it has been one perpetual struggle to try and clear off the debt that has accumulated on it.  Until the trade and Labour societies of the district took it up and made a levy in its favour it was a fearful struggle to exist, and even now it is hard to get on.  During the last three weeks it has been forcibly brought home what an immense amount of good the hospitals in Dublin are doing.  A poor woman from the country, though she was a woman without any resources, freely received the kindest treatment at the hands of the medical authority in the hospital in which she was treated.  Senator Comyn has suggested that we should tighten our belt, but that advice has been tendered to us so frequently and with so little effect that I am beginning to lose faith in it.  Senator Mrs. Costello has suggested that the Churches should make appeals on behalf of hospitals.  They do so every year.  There is what is known as a Hospital Sunday, when funds <Col N="1117" /> are collected for the hospitals.  I have not the smallest fear that the funds collected in that way will fall off because the funds of the hospitals are being supplemented from another source.  We would be glad if they could be supplemented in another way.  I have no faith in the method Senator Johnson suggests.  I know an hospital in the neighbourhood of Dublin which is supported entirely by voluntary contributions. That hospital finds it hard to struggle along, and its facilities are being used by the public authorities for autopsies, inquests, and cases of the kind which cause expense to the hospital.  Though the hospital has appealed to local authorities and to the Minister for Local Government they have been unable to get any assistance.  It is all very well to say trust to something, but we have been trusting to something else all our lives, and the hospitals are accumulating debt after debt, and some of them will have to close down if something is not done.  Unless someone comes along with a better proposal than what is before us, and one that can be put into operation at once, I fear that many of the hospitals will be closed.  Until that is done I will support this Bill, or any other Bill brought in to assist the hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to support this Bill.  Senator Johnson drew attention to a Bill with which I was associated in the Dáil several years ago.  That Bill ceased because the general election eventuated.  But I venture to say if that Bill was carried through seven years ago there would be no necessity for this Bill to-day.  It seems that there are appalling sums of money to be acquired by means of sweepstakes, according to some critics of this Bill. Senator Comyn's only objection was that it might be successful, that too much money might be got.  Many points have been made, but there is one in particular that I want to refer to lest a mistaken idea might get abroad from the discussion here.  A suggestion was made with great emphasis that if we enacted a Bill of <Col N="1118" /> this nature we would be giving a tremendous impetus to sweepstake promoters.  I think that is about the most unlikely thing in the world.  I think if the Bill is enacted and the hospital authorities wish to have a sweep run, it may not be at all certain that they will be able to secure the services of a promoter because of the enormous risk he would have to undertake.  It might be possible to insert in this Bill provision that such sweepstakes should be managed by a committee and not by any promoter. If the Seanad wants to put into the Bill something that would render its purpose futile, then they should insert such a provision, but if you want to give effect to the proposals you will have of necessity to allow the hospitals to engage the services of someone who knows his business and has had experience of that kind of enterprise.  That particular person, before embarking upon a sweepstake, will have to put down £50,000 or £60,000 in a bank to guarantee the prizes, and that fact seems to be entirely overlooked.  My own impression is that the number of that classs of people is not very great in the City of Dublin.  And it does not follow that even if the committee gets the sanction of the Minister for Justice for running a sweepstake that it is going to carry it into effect, especially after what has been stated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I was in the position of one of those who have had experience of that kind, and it had been put to me to undertake such a sweepstake, I would be very chary indeed before undertaking it.  It is too much to expect that a man who planks down that amount of money is going to do that for sheer philanthropy.  In the present circumstances of the various countries of the world it is not at all certain that such a huge amount will accrue from the sweepstakes as may be anticipated.  However, I have no interest in promoters, and no interest in the Bill except as a member of this Assembly to consider its provisions. It was only when dealing with the previous Bill of 1923 that I realised, by contact with very distinguished heads of hospitals, what <Col N="1119" /> the dire necessities of these institutions were.  In all the discussion to-day there has not been one practical alternative put forward to meet the situation that exists.  Certain theories have been advanced, but theories are not going to take these hospitals out of their difficulties.  If this operates, and you can get anyone to run sweepstakes, they will bring in sufficient money to clear off their debts.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that I see no objection whatever to enlarging the scope of the contribution to the hospitals of this city beyond the area of this city.  I see nothing in the world wrong with that.  I have heard no denunciation here to-day of the London Stock Exchange Sweep or the Calcutta Sweep, and I have heard no criticism of those who buy tickets for those sweeps.  The only objection is that the consciences, the scruples and the theoretical ideas of certain people would require slight readjustment. They will have the consolation, if they succeed, of knowing that their particular theories stand high and dry and are quite unassailable, but they will also have to consider the fact that the vindication of their theories may cost this city some of its most desirable institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGriffith" hpid="Sir John Griffith Sir John Griffith">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Griffith</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say why I cannot support this Bill.  I am so convinced that the combination of charity and gambling is a bad one that I cannot believe that the effect hoped for in this combination will succeed in clearing the hospitals of debt.  My own conviction is that if the case is carefully looked into you will find that there has been very considerable improvement in the management of our hospitals in the last few years.  For instance, the wholesale free admission of patients has ceased where it was possible to obtain payment.  That is the first step, and my own conviction is, and it is pretty well supported by Senator Johnson and several others, that for the very poor we must be prepared to pay.  My own conviction, also, is that if this <Col N="1120" /> Bill passes a very large amount of what is called charitable contributions to our hospitals will cease if these hospitals accept this nostrum for their losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Sir John Griffith, I oppose this Bill.  I oppose it on many grounds, but I shall only give two.  One is that I feel if the Bill is passed and sweepstakes come into vogue the hospitals will inevitably suffer in the future. If a sweepstake takes place on behalf of one hospital, the money from private sources will dry up in relation probably to all the other hospitals. A sweepstake may again come along for a second or a third hospital and inevitably in a comparatively short time not alone will the sweepstakes have to cease but the supply of money from a benevolent public will also cease.</P>
      <P>The other reason why I dislike the Bill is that some hospitals in Dublin&mdash;one, at least, and there may be more&mdash;have expressed the opinion and have written to the Press that they are opposed to this measure and will not become members of the society of the other hospitals that will adopt this scheme.  That, I think, is a very strong argument against the Bill.  As to the ethical situation, that is another question. Personally, I believe lotteries or gambling for the sake of charity are wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LaurenceONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall support this Bill, and I shall give one reason. Owing to the position which I once held, I had many opportunities of knowing the dire distress of the hospitals in Dublin.  The reason I give for supporting this Bill is that no alternative has been offered, and until such alternative is offered as would enable the hospitals to go on in the good work they are doing I shall support this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection I have to this Bill is that it drags our Ministry into it.  If it was a question of the committee of the hospitals coming forward and asking us to pass a scheme they laid before us there <Col N="1121" /> might be no objection.  But when a scheme is to be passed and may be approved or altered if necessary by the Minister for Justice, then I do not consider that our Minister for Justice should be asked to perform that task.  It is dragging the name of the Executive Council, and the members of it, into a situation which I do not think any citizen ought to ask them to fill.  But if the Minister for Justice is to do what it is said in his Bill he is to do&mdash;here are the words: &ldquo;sanction such scheme either without modification or with such modification as he may think fit to make therein&rdquo;&mdash;it is making him responsible for everything in the Bill.  I cannot think of our Minister for Justice having either the experience or the knowledge or any of the qualifications that would enable him to sanction a scheme and say that he <Col N="1122" /> was perfectly certain that it was water-tight.  I am perfectly sure he could not do it.  If the committee of the hospitals ask us to approve of committees and of schemes put up for this purpose well and good, but to drag the Government into that position creates quite a different situation.  When you come to think of it, the promoters saw this themselves. They put in a clause that the Minister's name shall not be mentioned, but everybody in the Free State will know if the Minister sanctions the scheme, that whether he made modifications or no modifications, he practically must accept the whole responsibility for it.  I say we should not ask any member of our Executive to accept responsibility for such a scheme for any such purpose.</P>

      <P>I move the following motion which stands in my name:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the marketing of butter produced in Saorstát Eireann during the five years ended 31st December, 1929, with special reference to the effect of combined marketing on the demand for and price of butter produced in co-operative creameries, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  the method of marketing butter in future which would <Col N="1123" /> conduce most effectively to increase the demand for butter produced in Saorstát Eireann and the price obtainable for such butter relative to the prices obtainable for other butters, without adding unduly to the cost of marketing.</P>
    <P>A motion in identical terms was proposed in the Dáil practically two weeks ago and was carried without a dissentient.  It is essential for the complete functioning of this tribunal that a motion in similar terms be also passed in the Seanad.  The matter is one of urgency, and certainly one of public importance.  I ask the Seanad to pass it, if possible, unanimously. Inasmuch as the Minister for Agriculture is present and may like to give details of the case, I do not intend to say very much in moving this motion except this: that following an investigation some few years back into the efficient marketing of butter, a selling Federation, called the I.A.C., was brought into being.  This Federation had for its object the more efficient marketing of Irish butter with a view to securing, of course, a better return to the farmer.  That was to be done through such methods as effecting economies in handling and freightage charges and above all things in the elimination of the competition, sometimes cut-throat competition, between the creameries themselves. This Federation, as I say, was brought into being.  Whilst the idea underlying it was right and the principle was eminently sound, it cannot be said that the results have been too satisfactory.  The main reason for that is that quite a number of the creameries, both proprietary and co-operative, remained outside of this selling Federation, fully 20 per cent. of them refusing to join.</P>
    <P>At various times this 20 per cent. of Saorstát creameries have been invited by the Federation to join, but they have constantly refused.  They give as their reason that they can do better for their farmer suppliers in the creameries outside the Federation than those inside it can do for <Col N="1124" /> theirs.  Occasionally they have produced figures dealing with various aspects of the case.  Sometimes they produce figures to show that some of the creameries outside the Federation had actually secured for their suppliers a better return, in terms of 3/- per hundred more for the butter which they marketed, than was obtained on behalf of creameries inside the Federation.  That was their reply to the invitation to join the Federation.  On the other hand, the representatives of the Irish Associated Creameries say that whilst there might be some truth in those figures they were not of any general application.  Moreover, they pointed out that the happy result that was effected by creameries outside the Federation was brought about mainly through the existence of the Federation: that those outside creameries are reaping the reward due to the existence of the Federation without in any way attempting to shoulder any of the obligations incurred by the federated creameries &mdash;financial or otherwise.  The matter has been argued pro and con for the last one and a half years.  We have the rather unhappy position that the trade certainly is not in any way being helped by this position.  It is not for me to go into the case on both sides.  I take it that will be more of a matter for the tribunal, if the Seanad decides that a tribunal be set up.</P>
    <P>May I say that, arising out of all these discussions, that at the annual congress of the Irish Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Association held in the early part of this Spring&mdash;a congress composed of representatives of the various associations engaged in that most praiseworthy task of cow-testing&mdash;a resolution was unanimously passed asking the Minister for Agriculture to set up a tribunal to inquire into this matter.  At the Congress of the Irish Farmers' Union held subsequently&mdash;a Congress to a small degree representative of both parties, the federated creameries and the outside creameries&mdash;a resolution was also passed unanimously asking the Minister for Agriculture to set up this <Col N="1125" /> tribunal.  As a matter of fact, both parties to this dispute have asked that the Minister for Agriculture should set up a tribunal to inquire into the matters set forth in the motion before the House.  Where you have unanimity to that extent, I trust that the Seanad will give its assent to the setting up of this tribunal. Very rightly, of course, the scope of this inquiry will embrace matters other than those to which I have referred, such as the questions in dispute between the associated creameries and those outside of the Federation.  If, as the result of the investigations carried out by this tribunal, a solution is found for that dispute, and of any survey it carries out, the situation is explained why Danish butter practically all the time is able to secure a higher price than Irish butter on the British market&mdash;the difference in price being sometimes as much as 25/- per cwt. in favour of the Danish&mdash;if the tribunal succeeds in solving or helping in any way to solve that problem, in what is a portion of our national production, then it will deserve very great credit indeed.</P>
    <P>From what I know of the personnel of the proposed tribunal, the Minister for Agriculture has been very fortunate in getting together a group of men who combine capacity with certain very definite experience and, if I may say so, that judicial-mindedness which will be the greatest possible asset to them in the carrying out of their investigations and making their report.  These men, so far as I know them, have had experience of practical farming; they have had experience in co-operative development, and some of them, at least, are men who have been engaged in trade development. They are men who have had very considerable experience in many fields.  I think, therefore, that the Minister has been very fortunate in being able to get together a tribunal with such a personnel.  I understand that all these gentlemen have consented to act upon it.</P>

I think they can be relied upon to approach the matter in a proper spirit.  I hope that the Seanad will be unanimous in giving its approval to the proposal.</P>

      <P>I move as an amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete in line 4 the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Obviously the object of the amendment is merely to extend the scope of the inquiry.  Possibly, the Minister for Agriculture can give us very convincing reasons why the scope of it should not be extended beyond five years, but on the face of it the period seems to me to be too short.  The period of five years mentioned in the motion includes about two and a half years' trading under the I.A.C., and two and a half years of non-combine selling.  The history of butter selling goes back a good deal further than five or fifteen years. The period of fifteen years suggested in the amendment would include a greater portion of the time of the non-combine selling.  I think that a great deal more is to be learned from non-combine selling of butter than might prove to be the case if the terms of the motion were restricted to five years.  The fifteen-year period suggested by the amendment also would include a period similar in some respects to the past few years under the I.A.C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the war years, and portion of the post-war period, certain things occurred that aroused a great deal of suspicion in the minds of <Col N="1127" /> creameries and other people who are suppliers of butter.  These suspicions still hold good.  At all events they are still there and are the cause, I think, of a good deal of suspicion of the I.A.C. and of combined selling generally.  The suspicions are like this, that during that period of almost butter famine legal prices were fixed, but some of these people have told me that butter was actually sold at a greater price than the price that was returned to the producers. They suspect that something was radically wrong.  I do not know whether these statements can be proved or not, but I do say this, that if the period is extended there will be evidence to show that something was radically wrong then.  These people will feel that, unless that suspicion is eradicated, the tribunal will not have done its work properly. Because of that, they are afraid of the possibility that something similar might occur again.</P>
    <P>With regard to the facts mentioned by Senator O'Hanlon, that under the combined selling scheme of the I.A.C. eighty per cent. of the creameries are getting from 3/- to 4/- per cwt. less for their butter than the creameries which are fighting their own individual battles outside the Federation, perhaps the Minister for Agriculture would confirm those figures or give us some indication as to what the position actually is.  It seems extraordinary that the individual creameries working on their own, each one having to bear its own overhead charges, are able to do so much better than the 80 per cent. in the combine, with, so to speak, only the one overhead expense.  It seems rather extraordinary that the 20 per cent. creameries working on their own are able to do so much better than the 80 per cent. in the combine, and that in this matter of price there should be this big margin between the two.  That is a matter that requires to be cleared up.  Unless there is a very good reason why the inquiry should not extend over the fifteen-year period, then I think my amendment should be accepted.  We are <Col N="1128" /> all very anxious to see this tribunal become a success, but most of the tribunals that have been set up have been looked upon with suspicion, and so will this one, I think.  It certainly is by a number of people vitally concerned such as creamery managers.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Hanlon told us that the setting up of this tribunal was mooted by people inside and outside the Creamery Federation.  I have it as fairly definite from people who seem to know a great deal about this business that not one of the creamery committees was anxious for this tribunal at all because they feel it will merely whitewash the system in operation at the moment.  They feel that that system is wrong, although the idea of combined selling is obviously a good one.  At all events, I think if my amendment is accepted, extending the period to fifteen years, that a good deal of evidence which might prove useful to the tribunal would be brought forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. Senator Robinson, in my opinion, was quite right in saying that it is highly desirable that there should be a tribunal to examine into the question of the marketing of butter.  If an exhaustive inquiry is desirable, I do not see why it should be limited to five years.  If the tribunal is to do good work, as no doubt it will, why should the scope of the inquiry be confined to five years as from the 31st of December last?  We had some very interesting periods in the butter trade which occurred more than five years ago&mdash;some of them up to ten years ago.  I think the Senator's amendment is a reasonable one.  I do not know who the members of the tribunal are.  The proposer of the motion has given us the names of them, but so far as I am individually concerned they might as well be numbers.  I hope they are men of experience and that they are not all officials, that they are thoroughly well acquainted with the sale of butter, not merely Irish butter, but of butter of various countries of origin.  As I understand it butter is blended in England now no matter <Col N="1129" /> where it is sold.  The speech of Senator O'Hanlon rather indicated that it was a desirable thing that all creameries should be tied.  I use the word &ldquo;tied&rdquo; in no offensive sense&mdash; that they should be all under the one board.  My idea at present is that I would like to see a few free creameries and a few free farmers, if it were nothing else than to encourage competition in the quality of butter.</P>
      <P>It is said that the free creameries get 3/- per cwt. for their butter more than the combine.  I do not think that is conclusive in favour of the free creameries, but certainly it is a matter to be considered.  I saw the other day a most amazing fact that a grand old farmer and his wife in Cheshire made the best cheese in England in their farm and I am quite certain that the farmers of the County Clare that I know so well and who have a great objection to creameries, make as good butter as any of these creameries.  If they have an objection to creameries it is because they are interested in the raising of livestock.  They make very good butter.  I should be very sorry to see all the creameries that are now free and in free competition as regards the quality of their butter, tied up in a combine.  I would not like that it should go forth from the Oireachtas as a sort of instruction to this tribunal that they were to make a report in favour of the tied creameries.</P>

I would like to see this matter thrashed out.  I am thoroughly in favour of the plans which have continually been thought out for the improvement of agriculture in Ireland, for the improvement of the butter trade, and for the improvement of every aspect of Irish agriculture. Anything I say is not to be taken as a criticism of the energy that has been displayed.  Sometimes the policy probably is not right. This is not a party question.  It is a national question.  We are dealing with our own industry, the only industry in this country.  Everything else is subsidiary to the agricultural industry in this country, and not being a party but a national question this should be approached as a national question.  I am sure the tribunal to be selected by the Minister and the men he will appoint on that tribunal will approach it in a judicial spirit.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be advisable to adopt the amendment down in the name of Senator Robinson.  It would add enormously to the time necessary to make the report; it would delay the findings of the tribunal, and it would deal with a period during which control was exercised in London.  Nobody in this country could really give any information there that would be of any use, and even if they had got all the information it would be really of no use.  It will be found that five years is a very reasonable period.  If I had the picking of it myself I would say six.  Five, I think, includes the number of years' experience that will give all the information necessary for the tribunal to get rationalisation, if I may call it so, the formation of a great number of selling agencies in England, and buying with co-operation and co-ordination of shops.  There has been a distinct change in trade in the matter of shops.  All these things have taken place within the last five years.  The combined marketing <Col N="1131" /> is only in existence two or three years.  For that reason, I really think that five years in the Bill is a reasonable time to allow the tribunal to get through its work and get the information which will be necessary for the Department of Agriculture to have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this motion.  This whole question of creameries is developing into a very serious situation.  Some people are inclined to blame one thing&mdash;to blame the I.A.C. and other people are inclined to blame the independent creameries.  I believe a good deal of trouble about prices comes through the creameries that are independent. The I.A.C. lends itself to better prices and efficiency in marketing. I believe myself that the reason why the independent creameries get better prices is because of the fact that they are independent. Buyers on the other side are up against the Central Marketing Board here and they were rather reluctant to buy from the Central Marketing Board even at a lower price than the independent creameries are offering.  Then the combined creameries when there is an oversupply of butter in some other places in the market, hold up their supplies for a time and the independent creameries take advantage of that. The result is that sometimes they can show a very small amount over the price paid to the I.A.C. I think that the worst thing that we are suffering from in the way of competition at the moment is the subsidy menace from Australia and New Zealand.  That subsidy amounts to 1½d. a gallon in those countries. Some people may say that we are in close proximity to the British market here but nevertheless it is hard on farmers here to stand up against a subsidy of 1½d. a gallon given to the farmers of Australia and New Zealand.  I believe myself that the only solution of this difficulty is to subsidise the Irish creamery suppliers. That, I think, will be a matter for the tribunal to look into <Col N="1132" /> and to inquire into.  I wish to support the motion.</P>

      <P>As I understand it the motion is in two parts.  One is that the tribunal would inquire into the marketing of butter produced in Saorstát Eireann for the past five years.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be convenient for me to ask the Minister for information on one point.  I am anxious to get his opinion on this &mdash;the motion refers to the marketing of butter.  I would like to know whether that includes, in addition to creamery butter, factory butter, farmers' butter.  At the Congress of the Farmers' Union the resolution asking the Minister for an inquiry was confined to creamery butter, that is, to ascertaining what really is the dispute between the free creameries and the combined creameries. It was felt at that Congress that it would be inadvisable to do anything to interfere with the home manufacture of butter by the farmers, especially so in districts where no creameries have been established, and where it is not likely that there would be any creameries established.  I take it that this tribunal will report on these matters and that before any steps are taken to hamper or prevent the export of farmers' butter legislation will have to be brought in here.  I see by a report or statement in a paper issued by the I.A.C., called the &ldquo;I.A.C. Bulletin,&rdquo; that the cessation of the <Col N="1133" /> export of farmers' butter in a very short time is anticipated.  This is an extract from that paper: &ldquo;It is true that until the end of last year nearly 25 per cent.  of the butter exported was factory and farmers' butter.  But in view of the new export regulations which we understand are to be put in force next year, and owing to the progress made by the new creameries which have been established in districts that were the principal feeders of the Cork butter merchants, it is reasonable to expect that in a few years the only butter exported from the Free State will be creamery butter.&rdquo;  That makes it a very serious matter for the farmers who have to rely on home-made butter.  I would like to hear from the Minister if it is his policy to shut out farmers' butter from all chances of export&mdash; on its merits, of course.  If it is sold as home-made butter and not as creamery butter, this butter should not be prevented from being sold on its merits as farmers' butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan) Patrick J. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator O'Hanlon and Senator Guinness pointed out, this tribunal is to inquire into the marketing of butter produced in Saorstát Eireann within the five years ending 31st December last and report how it should be marketed. With regard to the amendment this tribunal will inquire into the marketing of creamery butter only; it will inquire into the marketing of any other butter only in so far as that reacts on creamery butter.  The amendment before us suggests that a term of fifteen years, instead of five years, should be inserted in the motion as the period to which the inquiry of the tribunal would apply. If we intended to control butter again there would be some point in that amendment.  But there is no intention to go back to war regulations and to control butter here. There would be no point in inquiring now into how the butter was marketed during the war unless we wanted to gain experience from that control.  But as there is no intention to control the butter, that matter <Col N="1134" /> does not arise.  Therefore, there is no point in making that.  The experience as to how butter was marketed during the war will give us no information whatsoever as to how butter should be normally marketed. Further, it would be quite out of the question to extend this period for seven, eight or nine years, not to speak of fifteen years.  As Senator Dowdall said, it might be better to have it extend over a period of six years instead of five, but there is not much in the difference.  The fact is that the motion must be passed in identical terms with a motion which was passed in the Dáil.  It would be most inadvisable to extend the period to eight years.  This tribunal will be under the necessity of getting information voluntarily from a number of creameries, voluntary bodies, societies and business men, who will not be paid for any information they give.  They will supply the facts that they get from their books.  The tribunal, for instance, will call possibly for a considerable amount of statistics and trade information from co-operative creameries which will entail on the secretariat looking up their books for five or six years and the making out of quite exhaustive returns.  There is no reason why the difficulties of all these bodies should be added to.  It will be a severe enough strain on the creameries and business men to make the examination for five or six years without our asking that they should go back over their books for seven or eight years.  We are satisfied that if we can get the information we require with regard to the last five years that the tribunal will have sufficient data to go upon in order to make their recommendations.  I do not think it is necessary to deal with a number of the points raised, except to say this&mdash;I understand from Senator Robinson that he really wants the inquiry to go back to the war period, because he suspects there was something wrong in the matter of prices, that full prices were not paid, and he suggests that something is wrong.</P>

We would be glad if the I.A.C. can give us the benefit of their experience and the information at their disposal. We would be glad if the outside creameries do the same thing.  But I want to make it quite clear that we are not in any way making any implication against either the I.A.C. or the outside creameries.  This is solely an inquiry into the marketing of butter.  I am not in a position to give the Senator information with regard to prices.  I do not know if the prices obtained by the outside creameries were, in fact, higher than the prices obtained by the I.A.C.  It is to find that out, definitely, that we are setting up this tribunal.

Since then I have had the advantage of an interview with the Minister in connection with this, and he very fairly put it to me that if one or two representatives of that kind were on, possibly it would make those who had useful information to give to trade competitors rather reluctant to give it.  Again if one sectional interest were represented another sectional interest would seek to come in, which is not what he desires to have, and I see his point of view.  The information that I think would be usefully disclosed to the tribunal by such a man or men as I have indicated can be given in evidence before the tribunal.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw attention to two points, rather of form.  The Minister pointed out that it is necessary to have the motion introduced in identical terms in both Houses, and the motion reads:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the facts are that it was passed in the Dáil a couple of weeks ago, and that it was on the Order Paper there for a week before being passed, there is nothing very urgent about it.  It is well to point out that that is a pretext, a form so that the Act under which the Order will be made will <Col N="1137" /> enable the tribunal to call for sworn evidence.  My point is that it would be desirable to get some amendment of that Act so that tribunals of this kind can be established without having to use this kind of phraseology which is not, on the face of it a fact or is not correct.</P>
    <P>The second point is that paragraph 1, and in fact paragraph 2, refer to the marketing of butter.  I take it once the tribunal is set up it is settled under the terms of the resolution that the Minister's authority over the tribunal will only exist so far as the scope of the inquiry is concerned.  If we say in the resolution that the inquiry shall be into the marketing of butter and the Minister here states that it shall only be into the marketing of creamery butter, it is rather a contradiction. I think if the Minister desires that it should only be an inquiry into the marketing of creamery butter, the resolution should have stated that. The Minister hopes and intends that the tribunal shall only inquire into the marketing of creamery butter, but it will be still within the province of the tribunal to inquire into the marketing of all butter provided they pay special attention to the marketing of creamery butter.

      <P>The resolution was deliberately framed in these terms. The point which Senator Johnson has in mind was thought of.  The intention was to inquire into the marketing of creamery butter, and a resolution for that purpose had to be drafted.  It is quite clear that when we have an inquiry of that sort, into the marketing of any product, especially into the marketing of butter, a product of which there are three or four classes, that possibly you may have at some stage of the inquiry to make some inquiries into the manufacture of factory butter to find out its reactions on the marketing <Col N="1138" /> of creamery butter.  It was deliberately drafted in that way.  It is quite possible that evidence will be given that factory butter or home-made butter had some effect on the price of creamery butter in special instances, at a special point, or on a special market.  That matter should be investigated, and it was to enable the tribunal to make inquiries like that which were relevant that the resolution was drafted in these terms. It would be absurd, in my opinion, to draft the resolution so rigidly that afterwards when the tribunal itself came to examine the complexities of the case, it tied up the tribunal in such a way that they could not make whatever inquiries they thought were essential.</P>

I say that although it might be said that I was trying to prejudice the judges.  That is not so. When you come to the conclusion that a certain individual would be quite a good man to act on such a committee, you discuss it with him. You tell him what the scope of the inquiry is to be and you consult him in regard to the terms of reference. To a great extent the terms of reference were drafted in consultation with the Committee, on their advice and on suggestions from them.  I would like to see, if Senator Johnson thinks there is anything in the point, a resolution which would be as rigid as he wants it and at the same time give the tribunal all the powers which they have.</P>

Who knows whether that resolution was not engineered by the Minister himself, that he was not merely looking for an excuse upon which to hang the idea of setting up a tribunal?  He could not set it up without some reason.  The reason for bringing forward this motion is that a resolution was passed by the Farmers' Union.  Probably he engineered the resolution, as there has to be a <Col N="1140" /> tribunal, and a report from that tribunal, on which to base legislation. That is the reason I say that the two parties should agree that it is an impartial tribunal, that they should agree beforehand on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in the opinion of the Seanad the report and accounts of the Electricity Supply Board should be expanded and clarified.</P>
      <P>The motion is for the purpose of calling attention to the report of the accounts of the Electricity Supply Board, to ask for certain further information and, within its terms, obtain from the Seanad their opinion on these accounts.  In their present form, the report and the accounts are not sufficiently elucidated.  As the House knows, it was the policy of the Government, which it endorsed by legislation, to free the Electricity Supply Board from any form of direct Parliamentary control.  The Board was not to be similar to the Post Office or other Government Departments on whose administration questions could be raised in the House from day to day.  The Minister did suggest, however, in the early debates, that it might be possible, although he was not an enthusiast on the subject, to have the reports debated once a year.  I think it is only reasonable when large sums of money are being expended that the House should have some formal occasion on which they can make a criticism of the accounts and ask for information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite frankly admit to the House that my motion is of a somewhat protective character and rather an anticipation of financial criticism, that it will be possible to prevent criticism later on, because in its present form the operations of the Board are only brought up to 31st March, 1929.  The operations of the Board have not been very extensive so far, and the amount of money spent has been comparatively small. <Col N="1142" /> The next report will, however, show wider activities and very much larger sums of money, running into millions of pounds, I imagine.  If the report and accounts for next year are in their present form, or if the present form is more or less the structure, the scaffolding, on which future reports are to be based, I would suggest they are inadequate. I ask the House to agree with me that they are inadequate and that they will not give the House the information that they have the right to expect.  In one respect I would suggest that the present report is inadequate, and I would like a ruling on this point.  I admit that the matter on which I am going to comment, to a certain extent, has occurred subsequent to the report.  That is in respect of permitted undertakings. These permitted undertakings have been within the cognisance of the Electricity Supply Board all along. Latterly developments have taken place of which the House should be made aware.  It is aware that considerable dissatisfaction has been felt by the permitted undertakings at the treatment they have received, and that at a certain stage&mdash;I cannot tell the date&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Senator is asking that the report should be expanded and clarified, I submit, sir, that he might move that in any account or any report to be rendered for the operations of the Board for the period ending on 31st March, 1930, certain things should appear profitably, but the Senator will have to <Col N="1143" /> avoid criticising matters that are more or less subject to decision by the Board and the Permitted Undertakers Association at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister does not want that matter discussed I will not do so.  I am perfectly free to raise that special point by motion at any time.  The Minister knows what I am referring to.  It is a matter of considerable importance.  Another point on which the report is unilluminating is on the matter of rates&mdash;the responsibility of the Board in the matter of rates.  Certain developments have taken place since the report.  They are not of the same delicate nature as the matter already mentioned, and they arise out of the auditor's certificate. Can the report definitely say that any provision has been made for the payment of rates applicable to property in the occupation of the Electricity Supply Board?  As the Minister knows, there have been certain questions in the Dáil on that matter. There was, I submit, a reply amounting to an admission that certain properties in the occupation of the Board were liable for rates, and early legislation was promised to settle the matter, but no legislation has been introduced, and certain public authorities think it very wrong that they did not receive the rates or something representing rates on the property that had been acquired by the Board.</P>
      <P>It is the same in regard to income tax.  That is again a point on which no reference has been made.  I do not want to pursue the matter although by implication the Minister for Finance suggested that the profits of the Electricity Supply Board would be liable to taxation. In the matter of statistics, I admit quite readily that possibly there would not be much use in statistics unless they were accompanied by a report of similar undertakings in other countries.  I have studied the report of the Electricity Commission in Victoria, in South Africa, and also in Ontario.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> I hope the Minister will agree that there should be from next year onwards a table giving the statistics that are usually given by large electrical undertakings.  I am not prepared to say what precise form these statistics should take, but they should give the number of units generated, the net output, the efficient transmission power and so on.  They would be of interest to the electrical profession and to the general public.</P>
    <P>Turning to the accounts, I have referred to the auditor's certificate, where he mentions that no provision has been made for rates.  I would also draw the attention of the House to this item, &ldquo;The amount shown due to sundry creditors for materials purchased, constructional work carried out, and expenses incurred, has not been fully vouched by us, due to the fact that statements in verification of some of the amounts shown due in the books to creditors were not available.&rdquo;  It is hard to say what lies behind the auditor's qualification. Of course when auditors qualify a statement they generally do not put in a note like that without having made every effort to get information. That is the ordinary practice.  Auditors only put in notes after failing to receive information which they consider they were entitled to.</P>
    <P>Turning to the accounts themselves I do not know if many members have copies of the report in their hands. I have nothing to say on the revenue account.  I hope in future that these items for generation costs and distribution costs will be sub-divided to show what proportion are salaries and what proportion are materials and overhead charges.  At the moment I need not be precise, but certainly it will not be satisfactory later on if there is merely one item for generation costs without sub-division.  The item interest on loans is a specially important one on which I suggest even now more information might be given.  Interest on loans is shown as the comparatively small item of £1,300 and yet during that period advances were made to the Board by the <Col N="1145" /> Minister for Finance to the extent of a quarter of a million.  I suppose the explanation is this sum of a quarter of a million may have been in the hands of the Supply Board only for a very short time, and that the interest might be a comparatively small sum.  Another explanation might be &mdash;and probably is&mdash;that the interest is charged to capital.  If so, I would suggest that it should appear definitely as such.  It could be charged to the capital account as a sum representing interest, or it might be brought into the revenue account on one side, and shown as a payment out on the other side.  One is not a purist in the form that these things take as long as they are clear.  There are many ways of giving information. It is reasonable to ask that the account should be full and explicit.</P>
    <P>With regard to the two items on the credit side of the capital account, I would suggest to the Minister that further information is due to the House.  A sum of £275,000 is shown as received from the Minister for Finance as advances under Section 12 of the Electricity Supply Act of 1927.  Under that section, advances are dealt with under two sub-sections.  On sub-section (2), £600,000 is to be advanced to the Supply Board to meet interest on maintenance during the period of construction.  I would suggest receipts in this respect should in future be shown separately and designated as sums advanced under Section 12 (2).  Sub-section (3) states that a sum of £2,500,000 will be, in course of time, paid to the Electricity Supply Board or be advanced for the purposes of distribution and construction.  I suggest that that item should also be shown separately.  In the same way I suggest that any expenditure against the £600,000 or on the £2,500,000 be shown separately in the capital account, and, if revenue, in the revenue account.  In the present case the matter is less important, as the sums are small; but next year, if we have not the information, it will be difficult to trace the financial operations of the Board.  I am not bringing this <Col N="1146" /> motion forward in any spirit of provocation. I am sure we all wish that this information should be clear to laymen, and not merely to expert accountants.</P>
    <P>I would like to call attention to one matter in the balance sheet.  A small sum is provided this year for the redemption of loans.  I have examined the manner in which such provision is treated in certain other electricity supply accounts, and in all cases the money set aside for redemption is invested in liquid securities. I have the accounts of the South African Electricity Supply Board here, and provision is made on the liability side for repayment of borrowed money, to the extent of £189,000, and on the other side is set out the exact security in which that sum is invested.  There is a danger, I suggest, that moneys like that may be set aside and put back into the business, and not kept liquid, which I suggest is not good finance.  It is money definitely due for repayment; it should be kept liquid, and the nature of the security should be shown.  I also suggest that the operation dealing with the sale of appliances ought to be kept separate, so that one could see what progress, if any, resulted from that activity. These are the points I wish to make, and I hope that, as far as they can, they will be embodied in the accounts now due and which I suggest might be issued rather sooner than January.  It should be possible to issue the account at least within six months.  The present accounts were not issued until January, nine months after the date of closing.</P>

      <P>I do not think so. It was laid on the Table, and it is <Col N="1147" /> possible to requisition and obtain a copy of it.  That is an illustration of the desirability that the Seanad should reconsider its decision not to appoint a committee to deal with these matters.  The suggestions that I have to make are quite in keeping with those made by Senator Sir John Keane, particularly with regard to the amplification of the accounts.  I cannot speak as a technical accountant, but I have in my hand a copy of the Dublin Electricity Supply accounts.  These seem to be in the same form, with slight modifications, as those of the Pembroke Urban Council and Rathmines Urban Council electricity accounts.  They may be in conformity with some Board of Trade regulations, or perhaps a statutory form, I am not sure.  The Dublin Electricity Supply accounts are very much fuller and should be, I think, a model for future reports rather than that this Report should be taken as a model.  For instance, we have under the heading of capital account in the Electricity Supply Board's Report the item, constructional work, £140,000.  Under what might be said to be a similar heading, there are numerous items in the Dublin account.  We have in the loans account of the Dublin undertaking ten separate items, for machinery, professional services, printing and stationery, legal expenses, etc.  That is given as an illustration of the difference between the single item in the accounts before us, and the information that is supplied to the citizens of Dublin. In the Dublin account one has an appendix, and an analysis of the electricity accounts for the year, and for the previous year, showing the financial state, and giving technical records showing the units sold under the various heads for light, heat and power, at domestic valuation rate, and full bulk supply rate; for supplies inside the city boundary; the cost of public lighting, the cost per unit for coal and other expenses of generation and distribution as well as interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> Averages are given, and these, I think, are given in the Municipal Journal in the reports on the Electricity Supply undertakings.  The average price obtained for current for private supply and public light, as well as the total, is given, and the price per meter, cooker rents, etc. The information that was supplied to the citizens of Dublin by the Corporation was very full, and one could get an insight into the financial position of the undertaking.  That is not the case in this Report.  As Senator Sir John Keane pointed out, the auditor's report contains certain reservations.  For instance, it says &ldquo;all head office expenses have been capitalised.  No portion of the sum being charged against revenue.&rdquo; That would strike one as not being satisfactory, because if there is any revenue, some of the head offices expenses should be charged against that as part of the necessary expenditure.  Special attention ought to be devoted to that.</P>
    <P>One might call attention to the commercial accounts of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  If it were objected that the Corporation was not a right example, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs commercial accounts are very much more detailed than anything contained in the accounts now before us.  Then we deal with the Report itself.  I do not know whether this is the kind of report which is to be given in future, but I hope that it will be the policy of the Board in view of their special position in relation to the State, that as full information as possible as to policy should be given, as well as to current events.  I draw attention to paragraph 34 on page 14:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In approaching the problem of tariffs the Board felt that it should keep in mind two fundamental principles, the first one being that the rates of charge should be such as to make it possible for the maximum number of consumers who utilised to the <Col N="1149" /> fullest degree the abundant supply of electricity for all purposes which the hydro-electric development of the River Shannon and the building of the national network placed at their disposal, and the second, that the rates of charge for electricity to be utilised for each particular purpose should be such as to correspond as closely as possible to the cost of supplying it for that purpose.</P>
    <P>They go on to explain how they have endeavoured to fit in the rates to be charged in respect of the different services in different districts, and the costs of supplying these districts.  That raises again a big question of policy in respect to the electricity supply of the country. The charges for local purposes are going to be allocated according to the cost of particular services.  There is very little in the Report about the cost of power, but I am calling attention to the phrase, that the tariffs should be such as to correspond as close as possible to the cost of supplying for the particular purpose. Recently contracts have been made according to public announcements with large consumers, and one might presume that the policy announced here will determine the general action of the Board, and that these consumers will be charged according to the cost of supply for the particular purpose.  I wonder whether this is the method of fixing costs to the consumer in the case of a large consumer, or whether any other principle obtains when a bargain is struck.  One cannot but take note of the possibility that under the powers of the Board they may by variation of costs completely change the economic activity of the country in general.  That is to say, certain contracts have been made for power, let us say, with the Dublin Tramway and Ford's of Cork.  One can visualise the possibility that some company will seek to make a bargain with the Electricity Supply Board to get power at a very cheap rate for manufacturing purposes.  I think <Col N="1150" /> that is quite feasible and not at all an unreasonable expectation.  The policy of the Board ought to be made known in that respect.</P>

      <P>You have quoted prices for power:&mdash;&ldquo;Determination of charges for electricity purposes should receive priority.&rdquo;  Nevertheless, in the appendix the prices are quoted in respect of power, minor power perhaps, but I am making the suggestion that there should be made known to the Oireachtas the principle of policy in regard to power for bulk and industrial purposes.  I will not enlarge upon that, because the opportunity may again arise for dealing with the subject, but I am pleading for the fullest possible information to be contained in these reports on account of the very peculiar circumstances under which the Board work, the tremendous power they have, and the very limited amount of criticism that is allowed of a public kind.  The Report is signed by J.J. Murphy, Chairman; T.A. McLaughlin, Managing Director; P.J. Egan, J.C. Foley, H. Kennedy, J. Fay, J. Leydon and P.J. Dempsey, Secretary.  Messrs. Fay and Leydon, although not members of the Board in the period covered by the Report, were members on the date of the signing of the Report.  I think that fact justifies me in asking for some statement of policy in regard to the appointment of civil servants, and in asking that the Oireachtas be made aware of the position in regard to the changes that have occurred in the composition of the Board.</P>

      <P>There is only one point to which I want to refer, and it has some reference to what Senator Johnson has said.  Some time ago I suggested to the Minister that the Electricity Supply Board should have a flat rate throughout the Free State.  In my opinion that could have been done.  The money that has been spent on this scheme is national money and it is a national question, and one part of Ireland should be supplied as well as any other part&mdash;the west as well as the east.  I pointed out that I was not referring to supplies to particular houses but to villages and towns, and the Minister agreed with me that that ought to be the case.  I do not know whether he tied himself down that that would be the case, but he agreed that it would be the better policy to pursue, though that policy is not being carried out.  The Electricity Supply Board are making bargains here and there according to the strength of the people they have to meet, and strong measures are taken to compel people to come to an agreement.  I do not think that that is the proper way to proceed.</P>

I would like the Minister to say if he has any knowledge of the fact that the Board have changed their schedule of terms as originally published for the wiring of premises.  For instance, on page 56 of the report there is a scale of charges laid down for a certain district&mdash;Booterstown, Blackrock, Monkstown, Dalkey, Terenure, Kimmage and Rathfarnham.  It is laid down that private houses shall be wired on a hire-purchase system, the special rates being charged where valuation of the house is less than £8, and that these shall be weekly payments of 6d. per week until a maximum of 60 payments per outlet has been made, and one shilling per week where the valuation of the house is £8 or over, but less than £18, this weekly payment <Col N="1152" /> to continue until a maximum of 30 payments per outlet has been made, and so on.  That is not being acted on.</P>

    <P>I will give an instance.  Recently the Blackrock Urban Council had a small housing scheme which dealt with 35 houses.  For some reason these houses were not wired for the purpose of electricity supply or arrangements made for the supply of gas by the contractor.  The majority of the tenants of these houses are poor people, and when they went into possession they asked the Electricity Supply Board for their terms. One of the tenants of these houses showed me the terms at which these houses would be wired.  The charge came to a total of £6 18s. 6d. for six outlets, the total amount to be paid within a period of six months.  The valuation of that house would be about £10, so that the most he would have to pay would be 1/- per week under the published scale of charges until such time as he had paid the cost of the wiring, but the Board would not do that for him, and said he would have to pay the £6 18s. 6d. within six months.  The Gas Company gave him six outlets for six shillings for gas lighting purposes, and in addition inserted a gas stove free of charge.  They also gave him a gas fire for which he could pay the Gas Company any way it suited him. The result is that a number of these people are using gas because of the superior enterprise of the Gas Company. I suggest that unless better terms are offered by the Electricity Supply Board that wherever an enterprising company like the Dublin Gas Company is available electricity is not going to be taken.  It is very necessary the scale of charges issued shall be adhered to, and that there shall not be this mysterious changing and chopping about as experienced in Blackrock.  There is no minimum fixed as to the number of outlets a person may ask to have installed. It is simply laid down that there shall be an instalment rate on a fixed schedule with regard to any number of outlets he may have <Col N="1153" /> inserted in his house provided his valuation is less than £28.  The same competition may not occur in districts outside of Dublin, but certainly in Dublin it is most important as far as the electricity consumption is concerned, or the Gas Company is going to drive out the Electricity Board in every instance, such as that quoted.</P>

      <P>I take it that we are discussing figures.  In the next report most of us would like to see a profit and loss account, as well as what Senator O'Farrell has talked about.  Rates are laid down at which the Electricity Supply Board are going to supply current and wire houses.  We have no figures or facts of any description as to whether the Board are making or losing money. The Board are competing with private contractors, and we ought to know whether they are making or losing money.  They could, I think, quite easily give us figures which would show the cost of wiring, to a certain extent, of any number of houses, or any particular house. That should be public knowledge, as otherwise there are two things of which the Board might be accused. One is that they are making too much money out of people, and the other, that they are selling the current at a cost which will eventually mean a charge on the taxpayers. That could be met by giving figures as to the cost of wiring, stating that the cost of wiring is so much and we charge so much.  It is a big public affair and we ought to know the figures connected with it.  They have taken over the Dublin area. Formerly we knew what rate the Dublin citizens were paying, and we knew what the debt of the city was. I believe at that period it was about half a million, and we know that the Electricity Department were contributing to the relief of the rates of the city.  We have no figures to show how the new arrangement of the Electricity Supply Board affect the citizens.  I believe there has been a reduction of rates, but we should have a profit and loss account showing <Col N="1154" /> how the citizens stand under the new arrangement as compared with the old, and whether under the rates now charged the citizens are in any better position.  The figures, as I have said, are a mystery.</P>
      <P>Looking through the report to find out how the citizens stand, there is nothing in it to show how the change has affected the citizens of Dublin. It may be that Dublin has not got as much advantage out of the transfer as it ought to, and it may be that Dublin was better off than under the old conditions.  Until we get the figures we cannot tell.  I think the Board should give the figures and enable everybody to see how the matter is carried out.  We also should have figures with regard to the wiring. In the case of ordinary contracts a contractor is in competition with other contractors.  I have been trying to find out if there is any rule under which the Board work, or any standard up to which the work must come if it is to be passed.  We used to have Board of Trade regulations, and also there was the Institute of Electrical Engineers, who set up a standard to which the work should be done before an insurance company would take it.  The Electricity Supply Board have a standard of their own.  In the documents that have been published there are rules relating to the men, but I cannot find any rules for safety as regards the wiring which would satisfy an insurance company so as to take an insurance. Hitherto we had an independent body in that respect.  I know the whole thing is in the initial stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eventually, if we are to have safe work done, we must not let the contracting supply body be the judges of their own work and give the certificates regarding it.  In every other country in the world there is a perfectly independent body for that, and I believe electricity experts should set the standard up to which the work must rise.  We have no such body here, but the Minister will have to appoint such a body and not leave it <Col N="1155" /> to the contracting party to give a certificate for the work which they themselves have carried out.  It is not a wise thing to allow the Electricity Supply Board to do that. Perhaps the Board in the next report may give an excellent system of rules which could be laid before an electrical expert and which will be amply efficient for the purpose of public safety.  Until that is done, there is no certainty that the work is up to any standard except what they think right.  We have had our office wired recently.  One of the clerks in the office got a shock, and we discovered that one of the metal wires was not properly earthed, so that you could get a shock from it.  These metal equipments are a brand new thing, and a set of rules had to be drawn up so that they could be safely used. We ought to have a deciding body who would draw up rules of safety and see that they are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Our accounts, to which I have already referred, are not like the accounts from England, Canada, the United States and other places abroad in regard to the thoroughness of the information given, the cost of the current, the price to the consumer and the profits of the concern.  The information of that kind given to the shareholders is perfectly marvellous.</P>
    <P>We could not, of course, expect that this Board of Control would give us such figures as to the standard that has been set in other countries, but it is a matter that ought to be kept in front of them. We would ask the Minister to look after the Board and to use his influence to see that these reports are brought into something of the shape indicated.  I hope that that will be one of the results of the discussions that we have had to-day.</P>

      <P>I think this is a very good resolution.  This Board is dealing with public money, but at the same time it is not a public department subject to public criticism. The operations of the Board are not <Col N="1156" /> subject to review just as if it were a public department.  We have no means of finding out what is done by the Board except from its report and accounts.  I think it is desirable that the reports and the accounts should be as full as possible.  There is a reason, I think, for that, which has not been stressed by any Senator who has spoken, and the reason is this: this is a big concern, and it is inevitable that as time goes on it will be interfered with more and more by the Minister.  I do not think that the Ministry, as time goes on, can really uphold and allow a board of this character to be completely and entirely independent and self-sufficient.  Perhaps it can.  I hope it can.  It is highly desirable that this Board should be self-sufficient and as free as possible.  I agree that it is necessary that once a year at least the House should have the fullest possible information as to the operations of the Board.</P>

      <P>I propose taking the rather unusual course of asking that the debate on this motion should be adjourned so that I may have an opportunity of considering all that has been said to-day. I am not sure what precisely is demanded, whether it is that the reports and the accounts should be clarified, next year, or whether Senators want the reports and accounts for this year, as well as next year, clarified and expanded.  There may be an advantage in getting some of the information segregated, as certain Senators asked, but it may cause difficulty to have this done.  I have kept very far away from the Board in most of its activities, following up the plan announced to the Seanad when the 1927 legislation was going through, and I would require time to find out how far what is now asked would hamper the Board.  I said here and in the Dáil that the price these people were going to pay for the complete independence that we were giving them was the fullest publicity, and that their accounts and reports should be open to examination <Col N="1157" /> and discussion.  I also covered my tracks by saying that while I was not going to be responsible for all their actions I did hold myself out as a channel of communication between the Board and this House and the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I propose, with the consent of the Seanad, that this debate should stand adjourned until I get an opportunity of considering the questions that have been asked and of discussing them departmentally with the auditors, and, if necessary, with the members of the Electricity Supply Board.  I am sure that no matter how much publicity is wanted &mdash;and the fullest publicity is promised&mdash;Senators would not insist on such publicity as would simply pile up expense on the Board and serve no useful purpose.  I would like to go to the Board with the suggestions made here and have an opportunity of discussing them departmentally and with the auditors, to announce here the result of these discussions, and to put certain proposals before the House embodying what I think it expedient to demand from the Board in the next year's report and accounts.  Possibly I may be able to supply information about this year's returns also.</P>
      <P>In that connection I would like to know if Senator Sir John Keane, when he questioned item 7 in the auditor's report, would like to have an explanation of that now or would he prefer to leave that over until I am dealing with the other matters.</P>

      <P>There is just one other point to which I wish to refer. Senator Jameson asked for a profit and loss account.  As he put the point at the beginning, it seemed to me that he desired this in relation to certain sections of work such as wiring, <Col N="1158" /> public lighting and domestic lighting.  But as he went on to develop his argument, it seemed to me that he wanted this type of account made up for each of these items and further segregated for areas such as Dublin, Cork and elsewhere.  I do not know what he has in mind.  It would be a very big task to have separate accounts for all the different areas&mdash;accounts which have been previously separated under different sub-heads.  No doubt the Board, in its gathering in of the material, will try to have items like these brought into separate compartments, but is it essential to have all the divisions to which I have referred? Perhaps the Senator would let me know exactly what he wants before this day week.  I was asked by Senator O'Farrell about the Board's policy of charges re wiring.  I do not know if the Senator wants me to take up the special case that he gave, to take that as a test case and get information from the Board on it, or does he simply want me to bear that in mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Decidedly.  It is within my power to prescribe the form of the accounts.

Then I can come before the House with a considered statement.</P>
