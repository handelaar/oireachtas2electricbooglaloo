      <P>I have given due consideration to the matter raised by Senator Comyn at the opening of yesterday's meeting of the House, when he alleged that a breach of privilege had been committed in respect of his person by his being stopped by the military guard for the purpose of identification when he was entering Leinster House on Tuesday.  Had there in fact been a breach of privilege I should have felt bound to request the House to take action in the matter, but I cannot subscribe to the view that a request to stop for purposes of identification is an arrest within the meaning of Section 18 of the Constitution.  I find on inquiry that it is usual for the military guard to request persons to stop whom they do not immediately recognise, but that upon recognition they are allowed to proceed, and that the guard invariably discharge their duties in a courteous manner.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>First Schedule: To delete the figure 6d. in line 5 and to substitute therefor the figure 8d., and to delete the figure 7d. in line 8 and to substitute therefor the figure 9d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect is to make the reduction one penny in these two cases instead of threepence.  The meaning of it, in effect, is that instead of reducing the contributions by the body of employers by £112,000 the figure would be reduced by £30,000 less than that. It is not possible, outside the Department, to give anything in the way of a precise figure, because we do not know the relative proportions of the various classes of contributors who pay to the fund.  I want to ask the Seanad to consider the case of unemployed persons and the desirability of improving their position as contrasted with the position to-day and to allow provision to be made by keeping the fund somewhere approaching its present level of income, so that an improvement can be made in the benefits paid.  This is not the time or place to go into detail regarding the class of improvement that we would desire, but my suggestion would be, if there is £80,000 or £90,000 available within the next year or two more than is necessary to meet the present demands upon the fund, that it would be a good service if, let us <Col N="279" /> say, the money were spent upon extending benefits beyond the period of twenty-six weeks to unemployed men who have dependents.</P>
    <P>I want the House to take into account the case of many hundreds, in fact thousands one might say, of men with families who have been dismissed from their employment for many causes.  In numerous cases they have been dismissed through the trade they have been following, perhaps for twenty years, having gone out of fashion and therefore their services were no longer in demand.  Take a man of forty or fifty years of age who is accustomed to a particular class of work, who has a family and who is thrown out of work.  For the twenty-six weeks he is waiting and expecting and hoping to get replaced in employment and the hope is not fulfilled. Then he goes off the unemployment fund.  If he has, let us say, a wife and four children and is entitled to receive twenty-six weeks' benefit, there is a sudden drop in his income from the 24/- which he has been receiving in unemployment benefit to nothing and he has immediately and of necessity to become an applicant for home help.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is not good for the State that that man and his family should be reduced to that condition as rapidly as is the case at present, and that we would be doing a good service, if we had the funds available, as it appears we have, to extend the benefits in that way so that that man and his children would, at least, have some improvement in the conditions allowed by the present scheme of benefit.  We still retain, by such a proposal, the insurance character of this scheme.</P>
    <P>I am not proposing to go outside the insurance character of the scheme, but I am proposing that, having a premium income, as we may call it, we can give the improved benefits which I suggest should be by extending the period for men with families depending on them.  We might reduce the sum paid in benefit after the six months, but it is surely a desirable thing that these benefits should not entirely cease.  I only make that suggestion as a desirable way in which the surplus <Col N="280" /> could be expended.  The difficulty that I see&mdash;and I shall state it quite frankly &mdash;is that if the amount of the contribution is reduced now, and if the demand upon the fund continues it would be very much more difficult for the present Minister or his successor to come forward and ask for an increase in contributions. As the demand will be insistent, the inevitable alternative would be to provide an increase out of taxation rather than out of contributions.</P>
    <P>The case the Minister makes which seems to have had the greatest appeal is that this reduction of contributions would provide a fillip for industry. I think that is worth examining.  I find that there is, roughly, about a quarter of a million persons eligible for paying insurance contributions. Not very much more than half of that number are engaged in what might be called industry.  How it can be said that industry receives a fillip by the retention of the distributive trades' share of the unemployment contribution, or the national local government service, insurance, banking, public utility organisations, professional services and so on, is more than I can understand. To relieve that type of contributor, to the extent of nearly half the total number of contributors. cannot conceivably benefit industrial output or prosperity.  We have, therefore, the position that we are going to remit these contributions in respect of half the number of those paying without any possible hope or expectation of a great fillip to industry.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this question of a fillip to industry.  I would put it to the Seanad that there is a greater likelihood of Irish industry being benefited from the expenditure of, let us say, £100 by 100 men going to shops for family requirements than from the expenditure of £100 by one man upon imported luxuries or semi-luxuries. The £100 that goes to the average workman and his wife is, to a much greater degree, a help to home industry than that same £100 en bloc spent as it is more than likely to be spent on luxuries or semi-luxuries, these being much more likely to be imported than domestic necessaries. <Col N="281" /> From the point of view of a fillip to industry there is a much greater chance of that fillip coming from the distribution to people who will spend that sum over the retail counter, than from the retention of that sum by the employer, expended as profits are expended, or as improved dividend returns would be spent.  On each of these grounds I think the case for maintaining the fund nearly up to its present level is a complete one. Whether from the point of view of the recipient of unemployment benefit or from the point of view of maintaining or assisting Irish industry the advantage lies in the wider distribution of the fund through the extension of the unemployment benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment, and in doing so I would like to put it to the Minister that he is going to exploit the National Health Insurance Act for the benefit of the Unemployment Insurance Act.  It is the experience of most people who are dealing with national health insurance that the curtailment of the unemployment benefit creates a very great strain on the national health fund.  Every other day we hear complaints being made by approved societies about the number of people who are drawing national health benefit.  The Minister appears to be anxious to give a fillip to industry, and I want to say to him that he is giving the fillip by putting a greater strain on the agricultural community, inasmuch as the agricultural community contribute to the National Health Insurance Fund.  That fund is being steadily depleted.  Amongst people who are dealing with national health insurance it is generally believed that it will be exhausted in a fairly short period.  The reduction in the contributions to the unemployment scheme will certainly mean greater economies in that scheme.  It will mean that the people will be thrown over in still greater numbers on the National Health Insurance Fund.  I would like to ask the Minister if he has had any consultation with the national health insurance societies in order to ascertain what will be the effect of the reduction or curtailment of unemployment benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very considerable experience of an approved society and I can say without fear of contradiction that a great number of people who are drawing national health insurance benefit should be by every right drawing unemployment insurance benefit. Owing to the meagre allowance made to those who are drawing benefit under the unemployment scheme, when their benefit is exhausted their physical condition is such that no doctor will hesitate to give them a certificate of ill-health. Consequently they come on the National Health Insurance Fund and draw benefit so long as their health remains impaired and while they can secure a doctor's certificate that they are ill.  I believe the proposed reduction is more imaginary than real.  There will be reactions on the other end.  I regard these two Acts-the Unemployment Insurance Act and the National Health Insurance Act&mdash;as being closely allied.  I think if the Minister would get some information as to how the Central Fund of the national health insurance scheme stands it would be as much a revelation to him as it would be to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The position taken up by Labour Senators last evening was that the entire surplus of £300,000 should go to labour.  On these benches we supported that proposition.  As I understand Senator Johnson's amendment, it comes to this, that he does not now require the entire £300,000, but that the people he represents are entitled to a portion of it.  I think in practice and in substance that is the meaning of his amendment.  It was stated last evening that the £300,000 surplus was provided partly by the State, partly by the employers, and partly by the workmen.  There was considerable substance in the contention put forward against the Labour members last evening.  This contribution, small though it may be in the individual case when stated in terms of pence, amounts to hundreds of pounds in the case of certain employers, some of whom are members of the Seanad, and voted last evening.  We <Col N="283" /> are fully aware of that.  At the same time I submit to the House that Senator Johnson's amendment means that the workmen, though they are not entitled to the £300,000, in justice and in honesty are entitled to some of it, and that the contribution ought not to be reduced to the figure stated in the Bill, but ought to be left at the figure suggested in Senator Johnson's amendment. If the Senator divides the House on the question, we will support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very hard to follow the reasoning of Senator Foran on this amendment.  He asked me if I had discussed the effect of what he called &ldquo;this reduction&rdquo; with the national health insurance people. The case he made was that if unemployment benefit were reduced the people were going to fall into worse and worse health, and were going to become a burden on the National Health Insurance Fund.  What Senator Foran has forgotten is that there is no reduction with regard to benefit either in amount paid or in the duration of the period over which it runs.  There is not the slightest change in the amount of money that is going out year by year to the insured contributor &mdash;not a penny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is admitted, but there is no reduction or no curtailment.  The sum of money that has been going out to the country to insured contributors year by year is not being reduced by a penny piece.  What is being reduced is the overpayments which, up to date, have flown in, to the reduction of the debt.  No insured contributor will find himself a penny piece worse off by reason of this Bill than he was up to date.</P>

      <P>Why not increased benefits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator would not achieve that by his amendment.  All he would achieve by his amendment would be that instead of our stopping the overpayments at a point that would just meet the outgoings, we would stop it at a point that would mean getting 4d. per contributor more than we need.  We will not do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get Senator Foran's point clear, at any rate.  There is no reduction in the amount of money that is going out to contributors in the country&mdash;no reduction whatever.  Again, this is like Senator O'Farrell's complaint of yesterday, that things are getting worse and worse because we have not everybody on the dole here, so that, according to a proleptic use of the phrase, Deputy Johnson will argue that the people are worse off because they are not getting the increased benefits that he would like them to get. If he likes that hypothetical argument, he is welcome to it.  There will be no reduction of benefits to the insured contributor.  We are keeping the benefits at exactly the same figure.  But we propose to stop those overpayments by the employer and employed which give us a surplus of £300,000 per annum.  We propose to stop those overpayments so that the fund will be kept at a sufficiently small amount to liquidate the present debt over a period of from seven to nine years. Senator Johnson referred to what would happen in the future to the men going off work.  The fact is that the sale of unemployment insurance stamps for the last five or seven years&mdash;which is the only real test of whether or not there are more people going into insurable occupations&mdash;has steadily gone up.  There are more people in insurable occupations at the moment than ever there were in the history of the <Col N="285" /> country.  There are all sorts of tests against which arguments could be advanced.  There are five or six other tests, all of which lead to the same conclusion as this one-that the sale of stamps, which are only got by people who are employed, has gone up year by year.</P>
    <P>As regards the fillip to industry, here is a concrete benefit to industry-to the employer and to the employee.  We hand to them for the future a certain amount of money which, otherwise, we would have taken from them.  Against that, Senator Johnson says: &ldquo;I do not believe that this money will be spent in any way that will give a fillip to industry.&rdquo; I was glad at last to see emerging in this House&mdash;though the considerations are somewhat different&mdash;the historic view that the Labour Party might be expected to take of business men-that whatever they get will be only extra profits and will be spent on luxuries or semi-luxuries.  I was glad to see that emerging because, for the last seven years, I have had it dinned into my head, on every question of tariffs, that no business man is in business because of business but because he is a strong nationalist and wants to give employment in this country.  It is well to see other view-points emerge once more&mdash;that business men are in business for the sake of making money. Senator Johnson says that this money will not be spent in a way that will benefit industry.  He makes the other point, that there are a number of insured people who are not in industry at all&mdash;people engaged in the insurance and banking worlds, and people of a local government type.  That may be so, but one must think of the justice of all this.  It has been many times pleaded that there are certain folk subscribing to the Unemployment Insurance Fund that never should have been in it&mdash;bank clerks and other people whose lives are good lives and who have no necessity for this insurance. It is rather hard now, at a time when the fund can be depleted a little, because the calls on it are not so great &mdash;it is rather hard to have these people now told that they should not get any return, even though they have been paying into a fund for years, from which they never hoped to draw anything. <Col N="286" /> They are the people who deserve some consideration at this point, although we must recognise that it is on the good life the bad life has to depend in order to get a rather equitable insurance system.  On the other hand, Senator Johnson says that this money should be spent by way of increased benefits, that in that way increased purchasing power would be given to certain people who would be likely to spend the money in a way which would be a fillip to industry.  There is this flaw in the argument: that if you do not pass this Bill there will be no fillip to industry at all.  You do not get any greater purchasing power&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no promise of increased benefits and I will resist very strongly any attempt to get increased benefits, because there has been no case made for them.  That question should be argued in a different way and it has not been argued.  You can stop, if you like, by passing this amendment certain people&mdash;good lives, the State, the employer and even the bad life&mdash;from getting a remission of what amounts to £300,000 a year.  But that is all you do.  You do not achieve, by passing this amendment, the granting of a penny piece extra in the way of benefit.  You get by this Bill a remission of £224,000 between employer and employed and from £49,000 to £64,000 to the State.  I think that that is a very good proposition and I think that this amendment is a very bad one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is perfectly right in saying that the carrying of the amendment will not provide improved benefits.  I am well aware that it is not possible within the scope of this Bill to provide improved benefits but we ought at least make a condition in which a future Minister&mdash;if the present Minister will not do it&mdash;can provide increased benefits without imposing any new burdens on the contributors or the State.  I think the Minister said that £300,000 would be still due to the fund at the beginning of January.  The Minister proposes to leave that burden upon <Col N="287" /> the fund, drawing interest from the fund for six, seven or eight years.  If this amendment were carried, the debt would be paid off in a much shorter time and the interest burden would be cancelled.  There would then remain for the Minister's successor a fund out of which without imposing any new burden on contributors or the State, he could improve the benefits in the direction I have mentioned or in other directions which, on examination, might be found to be more advantageous.  I do not know whether the Minister, when he makes reference to bank clerks and the like who are paying unemployment insurance contributions, and who do not expect to draw from that fund&mdash;I do not know if he wants us to take it that, in his view, the good lives&mdash;well established, employed persons, who are not likely to be disemployed&mdash;ought not to make contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not my view of insurance. The Minister has been insisting that this is an insurance fund and yet he suggests to the House that the good lives, as he spoke of them, persons in permanent employment, should have a further advantage beyond permanent employment in the remission of the obligation to make contribution, and I am surprised that he should take the view he does.  It indicates a state of mind towards this whole question which is not very healthy for the unemployed person in future, because, if only the irregularly employed, nonpermanent, <Col N="288" /> non-continuously employed persons are to pay into the unemployment insurance fund the contributions both of the employer and of the employed person will be very greatly increased and the fund would either become bankrupt very quickly or the benefits would be reduced seriously. Some other remarks of the Minister seem to indicate that he is against the whole scheme of unemployment insurance and that it is his opinion that it is something that ought to be scrapped as quickly as possible.  I hope that that is not in the minds of any other member of the Ministry and that it is not going to be the view of Governments in this country.  I would commend to the Minister's consideration a remark of the Chief Justice, as reported in yesterday's newspapers, regarding the state of mind of the unemployed, workless slum-dweller, and the like, and what would be the condition of the country if these people were goaded, as there is rather a tendency to goad them, into very much more vigorous action than has ever heretofore been taken.  I hope that the hint of the Minister that unemployment insurance is something that ought to be scrapped will not be heeded by the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The amendments deal with the fines which it is proposed to inflict for offences committed by people engaged in the egg trade, or egglers, as they are called.  Section 10 deals with the maximum fines to be inflicted on traders for abuses in connection <Col N="290" /> with the identification mark.  Each trader has an identification mark of his own.  It seems to me rather hard that, for what is to a certain extent an insignificant offence, traders will be liable, on conviction for a second offence, not alone to a fine of £20, but also to imprisonment or both to a fine and imprisonment, if the court so decides. I consider that that is a very humiliating portion of the Bill for egg traders and for people who have implemented the provisions of the original Act and who contributed towards the success it has been.  I think that is not meeting these people in the spirit in which they met those responsible for carrying out the provisions of the Act and in which they assisted in making the operations of the Act a success.</P>
      <P>This is a trade in which a large amount of employment is given, and it is not possible for the egg trader himself to be at all times present on the premises.  He may be taken away from his business to attend to various other things for a lengthy period, but still he is liable for the actions of his employees while he is away.  On his return he may find himself in the position of having to face a term of imprisonment for an offence committed by his employees of which he was entirely ignorant.  I think it is a great hardship that an eggler should be liable to such punishment.  For that reason I think that such a heavy fine should be deleted from the Bill. Furthermore, there are various other means by which it would be possible to penalise an egg trader even more severely.  To suspend his licence and put him out of the egg business would be a far greater penalty than a term of imprisonment, and I consider that the suspension of his licence would achieve the object of the Bill in a much better way than the term of imprisonment. As I say, imprisonment is very humiliating, and I do not think that this provision will fulfil the purpose which it is intended to fulfil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to accept the amendment for the reason stated by Senator MacEllin. Senator MacEllin told us last evening that in County Mayo they had developed <Col N="291" /> the egg trade to the extent of £600,000 per annum.  That is the result of the efforts of the large merchants and the smaller people, too, who co-operated and produced this magnificent result.  As the Senator stated, these are people who should not be penalised in respect of an offence which might not be an intentional offence at all, and who should not be placed in the same category as common &ldquo;drunks&rdquo; for breaches of the regulations. Here is what the section states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every person who uses or places on any eggs or packages of eggs in contravention of this section any mark prescribed or assigned under Section 15 of the Principal Act shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof, in the case of a first offence, to a fine not exceeding ten pounds, and in the case of a second or any subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is what Senator MacEllin wants struckout: &ldquo;Or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.&rdquo; Senator MacEllin said what I believe to be the law that it will be quite possible under that section for the proprietor of a large business in County Mayo to get imprisonment from the District Justice for an act that would be merely the negligence of one of the fifty or sixty employees in his business. If the section had run in this way: &ldquo;Every person who fraudulently uses or places on any eggs or packages such a mark,&rdquo; there would be something to be said for it.  If a person fraudulently does it, certainly give him imprisonment, but if it is done negligently by the servants of a great employer, I submit to this House that the employer ought not to be liable to imprisonment whatever he may be liable to in the shape of a fine.  There is too much altogether of what I might call the penal frame of mind in dealing with sea fisheries, agriculture, eggs and things like that.  There was a Bill the other day in which for the breach of a civil <Col N="292" /> contract a provision was made that a person should be sent to prison.  I am glad to see that it was deleted in the Dáil and that we are saved the trouble of endeavouring to delete it here.  The same thing is running through this section as it is framed.  I suggest that the Minister ought to do one of two things He ought either to accept the amendment of Senator MacEllin, and I think that would be the best thing to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I use it as an argument seeing that the section as framed deals with cases of what might be the mere act of negligence of a servant.  I think the Minister ought to accept the amendment of Senator MacEllin and delete the imprisonment.  I think Senator MacEllin has made his case, and very concisely.</P>

      <P>I would like to subscribe to what Senator MacEllin has argued for, but I do not think he has made a case sufficiently clear because, as I read this, it obviously must be a case of fraud.  It is placing upon the package or the eggs a mark for a definite purpose to deceive the buyer.  It is the second and subsequent offences that make imprisonment possible. Therefore it must be obviously done for the purpose of fraud or deceit.</P>

      <P>I do not agree at all with the Senator that this offence is less serious than what he calls common drunkenness.  I think common drunkenness is much less serious.  I think it is a shame to give a man who is drunk-quite a human sort of weakness, and often quite inadvertent&mdash;jail, and to allow a man who steals a large sum of money, in a respectable way, off with a fine.  I think our standards are all wrong in this regard.  If a man going down a street lifts a package of eggs he will get jail.  If a big trader with a turnover of from £30,000 to £40,000 makes £1,000 to £3,000, as he might make it by persistently breaking the regulations, he is not to be put to the indignity of going to jail.  I think he should be rammed into jail with the &ldquo;political prisoners&rdquo; and kept there. I think that the man who goes into a shop hungry and steals a pound of butter has a far better case in law and morals than this big trader who persistently breaks the regulations and puts anything from £100 to £1,000 into his pocket at the expense of the honest trader.  I think we have all the equities, whatever about the law, of this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, as Senator Johnson pointed out, it is only for a second offence, and it is at the discretion of the court.  I draw the attention of Senators to the fact that a similar amendment was put down to a number of other sections.  There are seven amendments of the same character put down by Senator MacEllin to different sections.  All these sections deal with offences against the Act, and if these amendments are carried what can happen?  Remember the egg trader, the eggler, to use an expression that is usual, is in no small way of business.  In towns in the West, like Tuam and Ballina, most of the business men do the biggest part of their trade in eggs.  The turnover of a big man would be something like £20,000 a year and of a small man something like £5,000 and £10,000 a year.  Senators will see that if a trader persistently breaks the regulations <Col N="294" /> he can make good money out of it at the expense of the traders who do not.  Suppose eggs are described as &ldquo;extra selected&rdquo; and half are good and half are bad and you get the &ldquo;extra selected&rdquo; price.  That is done persistently by traders who deal with houses on the other side.  Look at all the money a dishonest trader can make! Why should he not go to jail? Our standards in this are all wrong. A man who goes into a shop, steals one egg, and on coming out is caught by a policeman is rammed into jail, whereas a trader who persistently makes money by breaking this regulation is a respectable man and it is a disgrace to put him into jail.  I do not think it is.  I think he ought to go to jail quicker than the poor man who when passing a shop steals an egg.  I have not the slightest hesitation in asking the Seanad to insist on a man who persistently and flagrantly breaks these regulations going to jail.  He is a common thief, a respectable thief if you like, but a common thief, and should go to jail.  There is not the slightest danger that the law will be unjustly administered.</P>
    <P>Senator MacEllin suggests that such a man can be removed from the registration scheme, and says it is a more serious sentence.  It may be a more serious sentence.  The Minister can do that.  It is no disgrace.  But he cannot impose a fine.  That must be done by a District Justice, and the District Justice cannot impose anything except a fine for a first offence.  It is only for a second, a third or a fourth offence that he can impose imprisonment, and he has the option of imposing a fine.  He will hear the case in open court.  He will be the best judge as to whether or not it is an inadvertence, but in 999 cases out of 1,000 where the wrong mark is put on a box it is fraudulently done.  The District Justice is supposed to have common sense, and he can use his discretion. He will hear both sides; he will hear that it is done by an employee, if in fact it was done by an employee.  The owner of the premises can come forward and prove that it was done without his knowledge.  If he is in a position to do so, he can bring forward any other evidence to show it was inadvertently <Col N="295" /> done, and the District Justice can exercise his discretion in a merciful way.  The penalty will be imposed in open court by a Justice after hearing both sides, and not until then. I suggest that that gives absolute security to the exporter, and I would ask the Seanad to leave this provision in.  I see people getting jail for a number of offences for which possibly they deserved to get jail, but I would like to see an odd exporter who is making a lot of money out of defrauding the State, who has no civic sense, and is breaking these regulations persistently, getting jail.  I do not believe they will.  The real trouble is that no one will get jail in this way.  We had similar penalties under the original Act and nobody that I know of got jail.  I think the real danger is that the District Justices generally will take a lenient view of the man with a collar and tie, who is in a big way of business, and will not send him to jail. But I hope that somebody who deserves to get jail under this Bill will get it.  I think then we will have a more wholesome public spirit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the first portion of the amendment for the purpose of discussion and nothing else.  The handling of eggs in the towns is different from the handling of eggs in country districts.  Sometimes eggs collected in the country are mixed up with other goods and materials, and I believe that does not tend to efficiency. The handling of eggs with many people is a side issue and they do not give <Col N="297" /> the matter the attention it ought to get.  The mixing of eggs with other goods is liable to have a bad effect and ultimately will injure the export trade. The best prices for eggs are paid by people who are confined to the egg trade.  They have nothing to do with any other business and they are able to give more attention to the trade.  I believe that our ultimate object ought to be to confine this trade to egglers. They will know their business; they will comply with the regulations and ultimately will be able to give better prices to the producers.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of this matter is that there are what I consider to be severe regulations as regards the buildings that have to be put up in the towns in order to comply with the requirements of the Act.  It seems to me that those regulations for the buildings in the towns are superfluous.  I think the same principle is not applied to the handling of eggs in the countryside.</P>
      <P>Only a few weeks ago a case came under my notice where an egg dealer had to put up a new building in order to comply with the requirements of the Act.  He laid the foundations and intended that the new building should be in line with the old building.  As, in those circumstances, it would be one foot narrower than the space required by the regulations, an inspector who came down condemned the new building. The result was that the new building had to be erected in a manner which put it altogether out of line with the old building.  I think that is a rather peculiar interpretation of the Act.  If it was considered necessary to condemn the proposed new building because it happened to be one foot narrower than the space required under the Act, then, in my opinion, it ought to be just as important to take steps to control those who handle eggs through the countryside.  In some places, in my opinion, the Act is being interpreted in too severe a manner. If such a severe interpretation of the Act is necessary in the towns, it ought to be equally necessary in the countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should give attention to this matter concerning the erection of buildings in towns.  In the <Col N="298" /> case I have mentioned it was too bad, I think, that the person concerned should have been prohibited, for the slight reason given, from erecting the new building in line with the old one. As a result of the severe interpretation of the Act a number of people in the towns who have not been able to put up buildings to comply with the regulations have been put out of business altogether.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider these cases, and thereby give to many of these poor people an opportunity of getting into business again.  People, at the outset, were allowed to carry on business in buildings which are not now approved of.  I think that is a matter the Minister should look into.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks made by the mover of the amendment seem to have a good deal of commonsense in them.  There are many restrictions in the Act with regard to premises.  Of course, it is well known that eggs can be damaged just as much in the course of transport as they can be on the premises in which they are handled. The amendment, however, appears to me to be too drastic and far reaching because it proposes that eggs should only be transported in vehicles that are not used for any other purpose.  It might prove uneconomical for people engaged in the trade if they were restricted in the use of their vehicles for that purpose only.  If the Senator were to bring up a milder amendment, one proposing that reasonable care and cleanliness should be exercised in the case of vehicles employed in the transport of eggs, I would be inclined to support it, but I think that the principle in the amendment before the House goes too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister last evening provided the strongest argument that could be used in favour of the amendment because he told us&mdash;I was very much surprised to hear it&mdash;that, amongst other things, eggs can be contaminated by onions.  They can also be contaminated by petrol, by fertilisers and artificial manures, which are usually carried in carts.  Very stringent regulations have been imposed, and justly imposed, with regard to the segregation and care of eggs in <Col N="299" /> stores.  What the amendment proposes is that that these same regulations should be extended to the collecting vehicles which, as we know, are frequently used for the carriage of petrol and other things that will contaminate eggs.  I think I am rightly informed when I say that eggs are frequently in the motor cars for a much longer time than they are in the stores. If that is true, then it adds greater force to the arguments put forward in support of this amendment by Senator MacEllin.  The subject that we are discussing is a very important one.  It is becoming more important every day, and it is a great advantage to the Seanad that we have the opportunity of hearing a man take part in that discussion who really knows his business and has made a great success of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that Senator MacEllin knows his business from start to finish.  Before dealing with the amendment, I just want to refer to the point that was raised by Senator Bagwell and to inform him that we have in operation regulations dealing with it.  These regulations were issued under the original Act passed in 1924. One of them provides:</P>
      <P>The eggs shall be adequately protected from wet, damp, dirt or contamination during the course of transport or packing.</P>
      <P>Another regulation provides.</P>
      <P>Packages of eggs in course of transport shall at all times be adequately protected from adverse weather conditions and from contamination of any sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that we have already in existence regulations which enable us, if we have sufficient officials&mdash;we are now pressing into the service Civic Guards &mdash;to see that eggs in course of transport are properly handled.  With regard to Senator MacEllin's amendment, Senators will remember that there are four parties interested in this.  The first is the consumer.  It is in the interest of the consumer that all these Acts have been passed and regulations made.  Secondly, there is the exporter, beginning from the consumer's <Col N="300" /> end; thirdly, there is the collector, and lastly there is the farmer. The object of the Acts and regulations passed and made up to the present has been to regulate the eggs while they are passing to and from the exporter's premises.  Senator MacEllin says that we should go further and control the collectors.  If we could do that it would be excellent, but, of course, there are limits to what you can do and limits to the control that you can impose.  There is no point in pretending that you are controlling if the control is not effective.  If we were to control the collectors it has to be remembered that we would then have to control at least four times as many persons as we are at the moment controlling under our export sections.</P>
    <P>It would be quite simple to insert some provision here making regulations as to the sort of lorries&mdash;motor and horse drawn&mdash;that should be used in the collection of eggs, dealing with the size of the lorries, their state of cleanliness and so on, but the question would then arise: how are you going to enforce the regulations?  To start with, if you made such regulations it would mean doubling the number of inspectors that we have.  The Civic Guards could not do it effectively.  I think I have made an under-statement in saying that we would have to double the number of inspectors because you have twice as many collectors as you have exporters.  In my opinion you have far too many of them, but if such regulations were there then you would have to follow those collectors from place to place. Therefore, I think I am under-stating when I say that if the collectors were to be controlled effectively we would have to employ at least twice as many inspectors as we have at present.  The Senator has a rough and ready way and, if you like, an effective way of doing that.  He suggests that we should accept this amendment which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It shall not be lawful for any person trading in eggs to use a vehicle employed by him in the collection and transport of eggs for the collection or transport of other goods or materials.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> The amendment is, I think, too drastic. It has to be remembered that the collectors of eggs do, in addition, a general business.  They sell goods to the farmer and buy from him.  They buy eggs from the farmer as part of the price of the goods they sell to him.  If the Seanad is prepared to accept an amendment of this sort, they must be prepared not only to enter a new field and attempt something that the Seanad has not attempted previously, but they must also be prepared to dislocate trade very seriously indeed.  As Senator MacEllin pointed out, there are far too many collectors, but they are all making a living of one kind or another.  There must be some sort of need for them or they would not be there.  They are engaged in a legitimate trade.  This amendment, if accepted, would reduce them to less than one-fourth of their present number. I should say that not one in fifty of them could afford to keep a lorry on the road for the mere purpose of collecting eggs.  I doubt if it would be economical for them to do so.  What would happen if the amendment were accepted is that the exporters would collect the eggs.</P>

      <P>I doubt it.  If they were they would be doing so.  Those people do a trade in tea, sugar and bacon, and they collect eggs.  They have their part in commerce, and it pays them at present to do that, but if you accept the amendment you would put them all out of business.  Nobody can afford to collect eggs and take them in to an exporter.  I think the effect of the amendment would be to give the collection of eggs to the exporters.  I doubt if the eggs would be collected economically that way.  It would hardly pay an exporter to send out a lorry on a journey of from 15 to 40 miles merely for the purpose of collecting eggs in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it applies to the farmer.  Surely Senator MacEllin has <Col N="302" /> in mind the man who goes through the country collecting eggs.  He goes to the farmer and sells him goods and collects eggs from him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not apply to him. We are not dealing with him but with quite a useful and usual sort of trade where certain people collect eggs from the farmers' houses, and that particular system is developing more and more.  Then you have the travelling shops.  Supposing the amendment is passed, then undoubtedly the exporter will have to collect eggs from the farmer. The farmers may bring them in, but if they do they would lose somewhat by doing so.  They may be able to get cheap goods from the travelling shop.  There may be a lot to be said for and against the travelling shop, but we are not discussing that here.  The position is that the farmer will have to bring the eggs in to the exporter, or the exporter will have to send out to the farmer for them, and the exporter cannot afford to send out unless he will get the eggs at a price that would pay him to do so and that will have to come off the price of the eggs.  At present, the collector is doing a general trade with the farmer.  He calls with his lorry at the door of the farmer and he sells bacon, tea, and so on.  There are a number of people who are not exporting eggs doing that at the moment.  The Senator is suggesting that trade should be confined to the exporters of eggs, or, in other words, that people who now buy eggs and sell them to the exporters and who, in addition, do a general trade such as selling fertilisers, tea, sugar, bacon, and so on, should be put out of business, and all that is to be handed over to the exporter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am only suggesting that would be the effect.  At present <Col N="303" /> there are men not exporters who are selling tea and sugar and buying eggs, and the effect of this amendment would be to put them out of business.  They are in a small way.  If a regulation were made under which they would have to confine their business to collecting eggs alone they could not afford to trade and would be put out of business. The exporters would get that business.  That is inevitable, but I do not say that it is the intention.  Perhaps it would be better if they were and to have the business rationalised and a bigger business done, but what guarantee have we that the bigger business that will follow, that the concentration of business in the hands of bigger men would give better results? Possibly it would.  Are we seriously, in an Act like this regulating the marketing of eggs, to take a step which will drive out of business the very large number of small but legitimate traders that would be affected by this?</P>
      <P>I admit that if the business were handled by the big men it might be handled more efficiently, and it might be no loss if the smaller men were driven out of business.  I think there are too many middle-men living out of the farmer.  If we casually pass the amendment we would not be able to enforce it and would have to repeal it again.  You want to have eggs marketed cleaner and fresher on the other side, and it is suggested that the control should extend from the exporter to the collector.  Why not go further and extend it to the farmer? After all, the farmer often keeps eggs too long.  He brings them into a dairy and puts them alongside onions and bacon, American or Chinese, or whatever he buys.  There is as much case for controlling the farmer as the collector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit for the sake of argument that if you had an ideal Department of Agriculture&mdash;I was almost going to say Minister for Agriculture&mdash;ideal farmers and ideal conditions, then you might begin to control everybody. Personally, I think you have enough control.  I suggest we should confine our control to the exporters and see how that works.  I agree with Senator MacEllin that certain hardships take <Col N="304" /> place as a result of the stringent regulations we made as regards exporters' premises.  I would be quite willing to investigate the matter to see that exporters are not subject to regulations unless they are essential, and my view of what is essential is based on this.  Our regulations for exporters' premises are in force in order to see to it that in these premises eggs can be graded, packed and tested efficiently.  We do not want to go any further, but possibly we may have done so in certain cases. The only use of the regulations is to make certain that there are facilities and conveniences in the exporter's premises for efficiently testing, packing and grading eggs.  It is with that object, therefore, that the regulations were made.  I would be quite willing to see that we make no more regulations than are necessary to effect that particular purpose.</P>

      <P>I move to delete the section.  This section declares that it shall not be lawful for any person to carry on by way of trade or gain in premises which are not registered in the register of preservers the business of preserving eggs.  It is not clear whether this section applies to farmers. If all premises in which eggs are preserved are to be inspected, I think it would require a large number of new inspectors.  I do not think that farmers and others who preserve eggs and sell some of them should be required to have their premises registered. Perhaps the Minister would tell us whether the section applies in such cases?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have some information from the Minister with regard to Part 1 of the Schedule dealing with the Motor Car Act of 1903. Is the Minister in a position to lift the veil of mystery that surrounds the delay in regard to the introduction of the Traffic Regulation Bill?  Each year the necessity for such a Bill is discussed and universally admitted.  We got to the stage at one time that an Inter-Departmental Committee was appointed to inquire into the whole position. The Committee heard a considerable amount of evidence in public, and eventually presented its report some time in 1928.  A year ago the Minister asked permission to introduce the Traffic Bill, and permission was granted.  He expressed the hope that the Bill would be in the hands of Deputies before the Oireachtas met in the Spring.  When the Oireachtas met early this year the Minister asked permission to withdraw the Bill.  The Bill, in fact, had never appeared; he asked permission not to produce it, and he expressed the hope that the Bill would be introduced before the Summer Recess. The Summer Recess came, but there was no Bill.  Then, on the 27th of last month, a debate took place in the other House, and the Minister answered criticisms there by expressing the hope that the Bill would be introduced before the Winter Recess, the <Col N="306" /> Recess that took place last week.  That Recess came and there was no Bill.  We must now wait for at least two months before we see the Bill, unless Santa Claus brings it by way of the chimney.</P>
      <P>Whilst making every conceivable allowance for the multitude of complicated questions that must be considered before a Bill of this kind is put into official form, one finds it exceedingly difficult to know what is the real reason for the repeated adjournments and the non-fulfilment of promises.  I do not know if it is that the Government have no ideas on the matter, or that they have so many ideas they find it difficult to put them into a Bill.  They have had an example given them in Northern Ireland, and a still greater example in the Bill which recently became an Act in the British Parliament.  The Minister has at least the advantage of being able to look at these measures and get some ideas from them.</P>
      <P>In view of the revolution which has taken place in transport within recent years it is almost inconceivable to think that the legislation upon which our traffic laws are based was passed at a time when the motor car was almost a curiosity; it was certainly a novelty.  During 1929 buses plying for hire in the Free State covered 24,000,000 miles.  They carried 48,000,000 passengers and took £860,000 in receipts.  We have a vast number of lorries of various kinds operating on all sorts of roads.  In the Free State in 1925 there were 29,000 motor vehicles of various kinds registered; in 1930 that number had increased to 47,000, an increase in five years of about 60 per cent.  Notwithstanding that we go along placidly as if nothing was happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to point out that during nine months of the present year the mileage of buses has increased by 1,500,000 miles and the passengers carried by over 2,000,000.  It will be seen from these figures that it is a rapidly-growing traffic.  The absurdity of the present position will be realised when we all know that the legal speed limit at the moment is 20 miles per hour for ordinary motor vehicles and about 12 miles per hour for buses.  We <Col N="307" /> treat the law with contempt in that respect, and the whole position could be remedied by the introduction of the promised Traffic Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no control in regard to the issue of licences.  There are one hundred and one different authorities for issuing licences.  A boy of seventeen can drive a bus carrying anything up to 40 or 50 passengers.  A boy over fourteen years can take out a licence and drive a motor bicycle.  We know that a very large proportion of road accidents are due to motor cyclists, yet the position is that the boy a day over fourteen years can get a licence and tear along the road with a girl on the pillion behind him on one of these terrible engines of destruction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision at the moment for compulsory insurance. A motorist can knock down a man, the breadwinner of a family, and there is no method of getting any compensation if the motorist has no means or is not insured.  Then again we have buses which are daily racing and chasing each other; that has become pretty well a national pastime.  There is nothing to prevent any road in the Free State from being encumbered with unnecessary buses competing with each other.  There is nothing to prevent the driver, who has thirty or forty passengers on his bus, chatting with a passenger sitting beside him, driving carelessly and endangering the lives of all.  Under present conditions a person can steal a motor car, and if he says he is taking it merely for a joyride the Guards are not in a position to deal with him.  There are all sorts of absurd anachronisms and anomalies connected with the traffic law now in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that when the Minister does introduce the Bill he will deal with the question of the right of Civic Guards to travel free on buses.  I hope he will make it a right and not a privilege.  I am afraid that at the moment it saps the independence of the Guards to permit them to travel free.  That permission is given as a sort of privilege by the proprietors or drivers of the buses.  It is hard for a Guard to act <Col N="308" /> independently when he is placed in that position.  I think the Guards should have the right to travel free, and they should have that right when in mufti as well as in uniform, because otherwise it might be regarded as a privilege if they were allowed to travel free while in mufti.  They have a difficult task to discharge, and it is advisable that in no way should their independence be tampered with.  I invite the Minister to make another promise, one he may think he will be able to keep, as to when we may see this Bill introduced. While one recognises the difficulties there may be in connection with such a Bill, still we think sufficient time has been allowed for its consideration by the Executive Council, and I hope that the Minister will let us have it as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>That is absolutely definite.  I take it that really is all the explanation that the Seanad calls for at the moment. I can explain why a Bill was introduced in the Winter of 1929&mdash;at least permission was sought for its introduction. I can give an explanation as to why it did not appear, but I do not think it would help us or be a material assistance to the Seanad. Senator O'Farrell has again suggested to me a way in which I can give a promise.  The difficulty however in promises is that very often one's hopes are labelled by other people as promises, but we have a lot of hopes that we would not care to be pinned down to as promises.</P>

      <P>The most remarkable point in this Bill is that the Minister for Fisheries has adopted the method for management which was recommended to him by a Commission which sat ten years ago.  These recommendations made by that Commission the Minister steadily refused to put into operation.  He continually opposed them.  Now, however, after all that lapse of time he reverts to these recommendations. I would just like to read a few lines from the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the resources of Ireland.  That Commission was assembled about 1920.  It states various considerations and then it goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These considerations are the more important, as the present system has now failed at every stage and the faults of that system are clearly exposed.  The capture of fish has not been encouraged; the fisherman has not been given a decent livelihood, the consumer has not been provided with regular supplies, and, in Ireland, he has not been provided in many places with a supply at all. Nor is it possible to rectify any of these faults&mdash;that is, the failure to encourage the capture of fish to give the fishermen a decent livelihood or to provide the consumer with regular supplies or any supplies by any revision or extension of the present system.  Most of the faults of the present system are inherent in it and are too firmly fixed in practice.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go any further with this extract, but just to point out that the argument stated there is in favour of the Bill as it now stands.  That Bill is <Col N="310" /> totally opposite to the whole management of the fisheries during the last ten years.  For ten years the Minister has continued the same practice that was condemned in the report of the Commission of Inquiry.  At the end of ten years the Minister suddenly finds that he ought all that time have carried out the recommendations in the report, and that he should have done all the things based on the recommendations of that report.  There are several Senators here who were on that Commission. Most of the recommendations were due to Senator Johnson, but there are other Senators who were on the Commission and who will back up what I say.  The Minister, however, preferred to continue in the old system which was condemned, and he has notoriously failed in his work.  Even the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; newspaper, which generally backs his Party, has condemned him again and again every year for the way in which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, we had a meeting and the Minister made two promises.  He promised he would have a Commission to investigate the matter, and he promised definitely, when he was pressed on the matter, to reduce the charges on boats and gear that had been bought by fishermen from the Department at war prices.  The fishermen were then being charged a great deal too much.  He gave a definite promise to do that at the meeting.

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill to show how its finances would work out.  I believe there was a financial resolution in the Dáil and a motion was passed arranging that certain sums would be allotted for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see from the Bill and from the rules of the Association, the Association is to receive from the Department certain boats, lands, money and various other things.  It is not stated, however, supposing that the method is successful and that it works out well and profits are made, what is to become of the profits.  If there are losses, and losses are just as likely, however well managed it may be, what will become of the losses?  I agree that fishing is a very difficult business and that there are very likely to be losses.  But it is quite possible that there may be profits and what is to become of them?  As far as I can see, nothing is laid down.  The State is paying in certain sums, probably very large sums.  The Association will require large sums.  They are going to manage the marketing and large sums will be required for buying and selling to people across the water.  They must have large sums of money which will be provided for them by the State so far as I can see. It is provided, of course, that certain shares are to be taken.  Does the Minister think that the shares which will be taken by the fishermen and other people will anything like enable them to proceed and make money? They will get small sums as subscriptions <Col N="313" /> and nothing more I expect, unless I am wrong.  These sums of money, I presume, will be advanced to the Association.  The Commission of Inquiry in their report provided a scheme and also that these moneys should be paid back to the State; that all debts should be paid off as soon as possible, which was quite right.  I am only asking for an explanation because I confess I cannot see from the Bill or from the rules how that money is to be disposed of or the debts paid off if there are debts. Some of the members of this Committee are appointed by the Minister and some by the Association.  That may be quite right, but there is nothing said as to how the members of that Committee and the officials connected with it are to be paid.  I do not know whether they are to be paid at all or whether they are to do the work voluntarily.  It will be a pretty heavy job for them if they are doing it voluntarily.  I should like the Minister to explain how the financial part of this works out.  I do not see any explanation here, but he may be able to explain it.</P>

      <P>Strange as it may appear, I am not going to attack the Minister, although to a large extent I agree with Senator Moore that this is a Bill which is overdue, that a great deal might be done and ought to be done which we hope may be done under this Bill for the benefit of these sea fisheries.  I must confess that when I read the Bill first this establishment of the Fisheries Association seemed to me rather a large order.  I should like to give an instance in justification which occurred within my own experience. I quite agree with Senator Johnson that if we pass this Bill it might, with advantage to the country, be amended by retaining a certain control&mdash;the two Houses of Parliament&mdash; over the members of this Committee and this Association.  It was my privilege once to be very intimately connected with the late Father Davis of Baltimore who probably did more for the sea fishing industry in Ireland than anybody else.  He obtained the loan of money from the Baroness Burdett-Coutts and, single-handed, established <Col N="314" /> a fisheries school at Baltimore.  He got boys from all over the country and taught them the art of fishing and of boat-building and net-making.  He established a fleet of fishing boats and he managed these in such a way that a reproductive fund was formed during his lifetime and, before he died, a considerable sum of money had been accumulated which was available for the purpose of developing fisheries there. One of Father Davis's favourite sayings, which I remember him repeating on many occasions when we were cruising together, was that fishermen were born not made.  He used to distinguish between the fisherman-farmer and the <i>bona fide</i> fisherman, and he maintained that unless there was a strain of Norse blood in the district where the boy came from or in the boy himself it was impossible to make a genuine or <i>bona fide</i> fisherman of him. To my mind that saying of his applies equally to administrators.  I think administrators are usually born not made. I am quite sure that the Minister has done the best he could in selecting the gentlemen whose names appear at the end of this pamphlet.  I know some of them very well indeed, and I think nobody better could be chosen.  There is one of the Deputies for Galway; Mr. Roycroft, Limerick; Mr. Murphy, who administered the affairs of Dublin so well, and a number of others.  I do not think any better selection could be made of people to do this work voluntarily. But we must remember that these are all very busy men.  They are not like Father Davis, who was a born administrator in this matter and could give practically all his time to it. Without in the slightest disparaging them, I still think that it would be very desirable that some amendments of the nature indicated by Senator Johnson should be inserted in the Bill. With the principle of establishing a Board, having regard to the experience at Baltimore, I am altogether in accord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter.  I think that there is very little use in protecting and developing and endeavouring to create and foster this fishing industry if, at the same time, some steps are not taken to protect the fish from poachers.  I have seen a French fishing <Col N="315" /> boat tacking out of the rocky islands on the coast of Clare within a stone's throw of the shore.  I is common knowledge that the Fisheries Department are not equipped with vessels capable of dealing with poachers of this sort. Unless poaching is put a stop to, I think very little of such fish asl obster, etc., which are very profitable, will remain to the native fishermen.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think the Bill is well conceived.  I have much pleasure in supporting it, and if, under the Minister's administration, this Board acts as well as another Board which he established last year, and which to my knowledge has been doing most valuable work in connection with the kelp industry, and if this industry is as well managed as that industry has been, I am sure the scheme will be a great success, but everything depends on the management.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should be greatly indebted to some of the Senators who have spoken upon this Bill, because they have brought to the consideration of it a considerable amount of knowledge.  I shall not refer now especially to Senator Colonel Moore because he is sitting beside me and because it is unnecessary for me to commend what he said on this Bill. But I shall say that Senator Colonel Moore has tremendous experience upon this question of fishing and that he has spent time and money and thought upon the development of the fishing industry.  I wish to refer particularly to what was said by Senator Johnson last night.  I was impressed by what he told the House, perhaps because he expressed what was in my own mind. The Minister, in his opening statement, said that he did not pay any particular attention to the rules and regulations of this new society or association that is to be set up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator wishes I shall tell him exactly what I did say. What I said was this.  That the rules of the Association, as the Senator has them in his hand, are practically as sent up to me by the directors.  That does not mean that they were not examined in my Department and elsewhere. They were closely examined in my Department and in the Department of Finance, but I opposed strongly any interference with the rules as sent up to me because I felt that as the task was committed to the Directors I should stand over what they considered they required. But in fact they were closely examined by me and the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister considers that he should stand over what this Board requires.  The Minister has incurred a considerable amount of criticism in regard to the conduct of the fisheries in Ireland.  He has been congratulated upon bringing forward this measure.  I think it is a good measure.  I believe he is congratulating himself upon getting rid of responsibilities, but I think perhaps in his eagerness to get rid of responsibilities and to throw them over on others, he has not been sufficiently careful of the interests of the public, and of the State in this matter.  It is for that reason that I wished Senators to consider carefully what Senator Johnson said on the subject in the speech he delivered yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was one matter referred to by my friend Senator Barrington. He referred to the names appended to these rules and regulations.  I know two of them&mdash;the first and the last on the list.  I think they will bring enthusiasm and steady, persevering industry to the service of the association. But I think Senator Barrington is misinformed when he says that some of the other members of the Board will be working voluntarily and will not have a personal interest in it.  That is a matter which ought to be cleared up before this Bill is <Col N="317" /> finally passed because, in my opinion, it will be possible for some of the members of this Board to contract with the Board itself under the rules and the regulations, and if it is possible for them to contract with the Board itself under the rules and regulations, then, it is possible that you may have not a friendly society but a monopoly that will control one of the great resources of this State.  These rules and regulations were submitted here.  We scanned them, but we have not gone fully into them.  I think we have a provision there for voting by proxy and a provision that the voting shall be in proportion to the amount of shares that people hold in the society.  I took up this book of rules and regulations last evening in the ante-chamber of the Seanad, and so far as I have been able to look through them in the time at my disposal I think these are two matters which are incontrovertible.</P>
    <P>There is another question arising on this Bill.  The Minister, anxious to get rid of criticism&mdash;a good deal of it perhaps unmerited criticism&mdash;purposes to transfer to this society under Section 2 certain property.  Under Section 2 (1) &ldquo;The Minister may from time to time by order, made with the consent of the Minister for Finance, vest in the society upon such terms and conditions as may be mentioned in such order&mdash; (a) any sea-fishing boats ...&rdquo;&mdash;let them have them and welcome&mdash;&ldquo;any moneys for the time being due through the Minister in respect of loans ...&rdquo;&mdash;let them have them and welcome. But what else&mdash;&ldquo;any land situated in Saorstát Eireann which is for the time being vested in the Minister by statute, deed, contract or otherwise ...&rdquo; What land is vested in the Minister by &ldquo;statute, deed, contract or otherwise?&rdquo; Are the foreshores of Ireland vested in the Minister, and does he propose to transfer them to this society which may break up or become a monopoly? Does he propose to transfer to them the foreshores of Ireland?  Here is sub-section 2:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any property vested in the society by an order made under this section shall, under and by virtue of such order and without the necessity <Col N="318" /> for any other conveyance or assign ment whatsoever but subject in the case of registered sea-fishing boats to registration in the register of shipping, become and be vested in the society for all the estate, term and interest or respective estates, terms and interests for which the same were immediately before such order vested in or held by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What are the lands that were vested in the Minister?  Were they the foreshores of Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Were they the oyster fisheries?  No.  I have studied this question perhaps more carefully than Senator Brown and do not wish to be answered by a mere &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no.&rdquo; What are the lands vested in the Minister which he proposes to transfer to this society ruled by seven men?  I would like to know what the lands are. Are they oyster fisheries?  Are they oyster beds?  Does the Minister propose to transfer them without a deed? What does he know of the litigation he lets them in for?  Is he going to transfer, not oyster beds, but lawsuits, to these gentlemen?  I know some people&mdash;perhaps I am one myself&mdash;who will test any grant made by the Minister to this society in respect of some of the very valuable property on the shores of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I have spoken&mdash;because I was interrupted&mdash;a little too vehemently on this question.  I do not wish to speak at all vehemently on this Bill, because I agree with the principle of the Bill.  It is my desire to help the Minister and the Board in endeavouring to revive the fisheries. Sea-fishing in Ireland has gone down steadily for the past sixty years. The Congested Districts Board spent great sums of money every year in endeavouring to revive or maintain the fisheries in Donegal and on the west coast.  All the money they spent in all these years has not come to any permanent fruition.  The Congested Districts Board took up that work with great enthusiasm and, in many cases, with great ability.  They were successful in Donegal, where a practical man was engaged by them. <Col N="319" /> As long as he lived the fishing in Donegal was a success.  In Galway, Clare and in the southern parts the management of the work was in the hands of a theoretical man&mdash;not Father Davis&mdash; but another clergyman who knew everything about fish except the one practical thing, how to catch fish and how to cure fish.  The work of the Congested Districts Board was a failure in the south of Ireland.  Fishing in Ireland has been going down steadily for the past sixty years.  I remember that thirty or forty years ago a fine fleet of fishing trawlers went out from Galway.  In recent years I do not see a fishing trawler in Galway Bay. What do I see on the shores?  I see the glass bulbs used by French lobster fishers.  These bulbs are washed in by the tide, showing that the lobster fishing in the west of Ireland is in the hands of Frenchmen who come over and come inside our territorial waters.</P>
    <P>What oyster fisheries have we now? On the south side of Galway Bay there were tremendous oyster fisheries.  The best oysters in the world were produced there, and so flourishing was the trade that two of the principal hotels in this city were established by people from that area for the purpose of selling their oysters&mdash;Hynes' Restaurant and the Red Bank Restaurant.  There is not an oyster to be had in the whole district now.  There is tremendous property to be developed in this oyster sea-fishing.  I think it is right that it should be developed by practical men, and in this committee you have a combination of practical business knowledge, education and enthusiasm.  I wish this Board well.  I hope and believe it will succeed.  At the same time, in order to give them a fair chance to succeed you should have your Bill right.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Bill is right so far as it relates to the land.  Let me tell my friend, Senator Brown, my view in regard to the land.  You have under Article II of the Constitution vested in Saorstát Eireann all lands and waters, mines and minerals, hitherto vested in the State or any Department thereof, or held for the public use and benefit, and also all natural resources.  There are great <Col N="320" /> limitations to that.  The Act of 1924 dealing with State Lands does not authorise any Minister to alienate State Lands.  No man has that power, I am glad to say.  The only power given is the power to demise the lands, or any part thereof, with the buildings thereon, but without mines and minerals, to such person by way of lease for such term not exceeding 99 years as the Minister shall think proper.  That is all the Minister can do in regard to the alienation of State Lands in the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>Seeing what Senator Brown's views on other matters are, I am very glad to know that it is conceded at last in every part of this House, that the foreshores of Ireland belong to Saorstát Eireann.  I may tell Senator Brown that I know this subject as well as he does.  I have studied it more recently than he has done, and I have a little more interest in studying it perhaps than he has.  The Bill seems to me, in general outline, to be well thought out.  In my opinion, it is right to put the management of the sea fisheries into the hands of practical people.  There are, however, two or three omissions in the Bill.  Whether these omissions are due to inadvertence or are deliberate, I do not know. There is no provision in the Bill for the proper curing of fish.  Is that to be left in the hands of the Association?  Is there to be any regulation regarding the proper curing of fish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>We had in the Eggs Bill and the Fresh Meat Bill certain leading regulations provided.  I desire to tell the House one of the causes of the failure of the fisheries during the last 50 or 60 years.  It is well known that the herring is the king of fish, so far as the food of mankind is concerned.  The Norwegians are the best men in the world for curing herring and other fish. A Norwegian came over here and by a certain method he extracted at one operation every portion of the blood from the fish.  The Irish curers thought they knew their business better than he did.  They left one little shade or drop of blood in the fish which prevented it from being properly cured.  That is one of the secrets.  I hope the Minister <Col N="322" /> will not think that I am hostile to his measure when I give him that little piece of information with regard to the proper curing of fish.</P>
      <P>Greater consideration should have been given in the Bill to the Irish trade in fish and to the transport of fish to the inland markets here.  Somebody has said that the Irish people are not good fishermen&mdash;that it is necessary to have a drop of Viking blood to make a good fisherman.  I should be inclined to agree as regards that.  I am certain of this&mdash;that the Irish people are not fish eaters.  The market for fish in Ireland ought to be developed, and I will tell the Minister the fate of one attempt to develop the trade in cured fish in the inland towns.  The Congested Districts Board, in order to establish a local trade, sent 100 barrels of well-cured fish to 100 persons in the inland towns at 1d. a fish with a request that the person should, if possible, repeat the order.  They sent out 100 barrels at a cost of £500 to 100 different people, and they only got one order.  The problem before this Board is, therefore, a very serious one.  They will have to develop a local trade in fish.  They will also have to develop, if possible, a foreign trade in fish.  They will have this difficulty to face: Our western shores are suitable for small boats, but are not suitable, to the same extent, for big boats.  In my judgment, the greatest success will be found in developing the lobster and the oyster trade in Ireland as one enterprise.  I hope I shall not be regarded as hostile to the Bill when I say that it requires further consideration, especially in respect of the section dealing with property.  If what Senator Johnson said has been considered by the Minister, perhaps it will not be necessary for him to adjourn the further consideration of this measure.  I should like to go very carefully into the Bill, and I hope it will not be rushed through this House before we know exactly where we stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>My comment upon this Bill is in respect of its unusual character, in that there is circulated with the Bill model rules for an Association, while this House has no power whatever to amend these rules.  It <Col N="323" /> appears to me that the real criticism of the measure lies in the rules.  I presume that whoever drafted these rules obtained legal advice upon them. There is one section which appears to be unprecedented and, I would submit, very dangerous.  That is the section which binds, so far as I can see, for all time, members to market all their catches through the Association.  I presume that that is in accordance with the common law, but not being a lawyer, I am unable to say anything definite on that point.</P>
      <P>That provision appears to me to be a distinct hardship, and I think it would act as a deterrent to anybody who was thinking of joining the Association and who read the rules.  If you take the parallel case of the Irish Associated Creameries, I think it throws a certain light on an obligation of that kind.  There, the most that was done was to enter into contracts to market all produce through the association for a period of years.  Here&mdash;and we have no power in the matter at all&mdash;the contracts are to be for all time and are entered into irrespective of what may happen the Association, whether it may get into bad ways or be improperly conducted.  It would appear to me to be a form of legal servitude to bind a man for all time in this way, irrespective of what may happen to the Association. I do not know what this House can do except enter a protest against rules in that form.  I suggest that it is not a desirable method of legislation to ask us to examine a Bill in relation to a document over which we have no control.  I ask the Minister to deal specially with that matter in his reply.</P>

      <P>Coming from a mara-time county, where fishing is an important industry and provides a livelihood for a great many people, I welcome <Col N="324" /> this Bill.  I should like to stress what Senator Barrington and Senator Comyn have said with regard to the French pirates.  If some legislation is not introduced to punish these persons properly, there will be no use in our trying to improve the fishing industry. In my own county, around the great Saltee Island, one of the most valuable lobster fisheries in Ireland has been practically ruined.  Not many years ago a very valuable oyster bed in Wexford Harbour was taken clean away.  These people care nothing about fines.  £100 is nothing to them. Drastic measures will have to be taken to deal with them.</P>
      <P>Until these measures are taken, there will be no use in doing anything in certain parts of the country for the improvement of the fishing industry.  These French pirates are coming in in sight of the shore and they have been guilty of most outrageous acts.  Last year, they landed on the Great Saltee Island and added insult to injury by taking a number of the birds protected there and making a bait of them.  That was discovered when one of these pirates was taken to Waterford.  I saw the proof of it in the Gárda barracks at Kilmore Quay.  Something will have to be done to give these pirates a long term of imprisonment or to confiscate their boats.  Something drastic must be done because they will care about nothing else.  My experience during the last few years concerning Kilmore Quay convinces me that the fishing will be ruined, despite everything, if these people are not dealt with drastically.</P>

      <P>Before I come to what I might call the amusing speeches of Senator Comyn and Senator Colonel Moore I will deal with the earlier speakers.  Senator O'Doherty asked whether the provisions of this measure would apply to those who go round selling fish from carts.  They do not, nor do they apply to hawkers in towns or cities.  The Bill does not deal with these people.  We advisedly omitted them from the Bill because in their sales they touch the poorest class of people who get fish from the <Col N="325" /> carts rather cheaply.  We were afraid to do anything which might raise the cost of fish to the poorer classes. The Senator was also anxious to know how the sub-section in connection with offals was going to be worked.  The position is that the onus of proof will lie on the inspector.  I should say that there would be no difficulty in identifying fish offals of the day before.  Anyone going into a shop would easily recognise offals that were lying there for twenty-four hours.</P>

I think that that provision should be retained in the Bill.  If the inspector cannot prove that the offals are there from the day before, he will lose his case and make himself ridiculous.</P>

      <P>I want to know how the inspector could satisfy himself or a court of law that there has been a breach of the Act.  It seems to me that it is rather indefinable.  Supposing the offal is that of fish which was sold on the previous evening at seven o'clock, how can an inspector determine that when the shop opens next morning?  I may point out that if you can enforce the provision, I am in favour of it.</P>

Senator Johnson has raised a question concerning the transfer of land to the Association. For the information of the Seanad I should say that lands vested in me are lands which formerly vested in the Congested Districts Board.  Lands, under the Interpretation Act, include buildings. They are mainly various stores around the coast, on islands, and in out <Col N="326" /> of the way places, where we keep barrels, salt, nets, and so on, with perhaps a little land about them.  These are the only lands that vest in the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, and these are the only lands that can be transferred to the Association.  I understand from a legal authority that these lands are not governed by the State Lands Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in the Executive Council who is responsible for foreshores is, I think, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Senator Johnson was worried about the provision for the licensing of salesmen.  I still believe, despite what he said, that it is desirable, where you have persons consigning fish to a far market&mdash;I am contemplating a big market in a city&mdash; that the person who auctions the fish should be above suspicion and should not have the slightest interest in the price of the fish.  If the person who is auctioning the fish is interested, by way of being a curer or owning a retail or wholesale shop, there will be that suspicion.  This portion of the Bill will only apply in specified areas.  Yesterday, <Col N="327" /> on Second Reading, I mentioned that I will only specify areas when I am asked to do so by the Association. It will be to the interest of the Association to see that the fish will go to the highest price.  That is obvious to anybody, because the more the fishermen will get for their fish the sooner will the loans given to them be repaid to the Association.  It will, therefore, always be to the interest of the Association to see that the fishermen get good prices.  That provision, I admit, could not be strictly enforced in many out-of-the-way coves and harbours where fishing goes on, but it is desirable that it should prevail everywhere as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be an offence for anybody to sell who is not licensed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  The Senator was also wondering about the principle involved in regard to authority to prosecute and in regard to making offences of certain breaches of contract by members of the Association.  I think that in a case like this where the whole principle is based on placing the maximum faith in the honesty of the general body of fishermen and where the derelictions of even a very few might upset the whole Association, this provision should be retained in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there were a few persons in any particular area who were disposing of their fish in a way other than that in which they agreed to dispose of it, to the cognisance of other members of the Association, but not of the agent of the Association, the example, in my view, would be a very bad one and would put a great strain on the loyalty of other members, especially if they saw other people getting away with the disposal of their fish and not having deducted from the proceeds the money which should be deducted for the payment of the loans.  I think it is necessary that some provision such as this should remain in the Bill&mdash;something more than the remedies which the Association will have under the rules.  I still hold that the provisions in the Agricultural Credit Act are exactly similar to these. The cases are exactly similar.  In the Agricultural Credit Act it is an offence for a person who gets money for a <Col N="328" /> specific purpose to use it for another purpose.  If a man says that he is going to dispose of his fish through the Association, if the Association is the owner of that fish, and if he disposes of it elsewhere he is stealing the property of the Association, and it is only right that it should be an offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why, if he only gets a loan from the Association?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>He is getting a loan, and there is a contract made providing for a particular way of repaying that loan. The method of repayment is that he hands over the fish to the Association. The agent will handle the money that is paid to the salesman for that fish. The fisherman will not handle it until the end of the week, when he is given the proceeds less the deduction which will be made for the repayment of the loan and interest, and for other purposes as specified in the rules.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not in the least. A fisherman only joins the Association if it is going to be of benefit to him, of course.  Every person who wants a boat or gear for the purpose of fishing will inevitably become a member of the Association because of the system of repayments.  It will be of benefit to him as in fact he will not feel the repayment at all.  Instead of the present system of paying in half-yearly instalments he will never see the money and will, therefore, not feel the repayment.  I believe, therefore, in order to safeguard this provision, it is necessary that persons who try to evade their agreement should be punished.  Senator Johnson raised a point in connection with the <Col N="329" /> definition of salt fish.  I think he need not have any fear in that connection as the term salt fish has a very particular trade meaning.  If one went into a shop and asked for salt fish, one would not be given fish that has just been sprinkled over with salt to preserve it just as if a bit of muslin had been placed over it.  I do not think the Senator need have any fear that fish such as he suggested will be eliminated by this definition.</P>

      <P>The chief contribution of Senator Colonel Moore to the debate was first of all that I discovered this report after ten years and that I had now come in with this Bill containing the proposals suggested ten years ago. After that he stated that he did not understand the Bill.  I think, in the first place, that the proposals here are extremely different from the proposals of the Committee which sat at that time.  I think they are different in almost every way.  The Senator read a great deal from that report stating that the existing system was a failure, but he did not read out the recommendations.  In fact I hold that the present scheme is entirely different from that which was then recommended. The Senator referred to a meeting held some years ago which I barely remember.  It must be five years since it was held.  I think it was a meeting held in the Mansion House.</P>

The suggestion came from Senator Comyn that this Bill was a kind of washing of hands and an attempt to get away from my responsibility in this matter.  The fact is that the whole finances of the Association will be voted by grants-in-aid.  The money will have to be voted each year, and I will have to answer for the Association in the Dáil and here each year. There will be no shedding of responsibility at all.  Senator Colonel Moore and Senator Comyn can get up on any platform they wish and denounce the Minister for Fisheries in the old form which they have been used to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give this example of an existing company.  You have the man referred to by Senator Barrington&mdash;Mr. Roycroft of the Limerick <Col N="331" /> Steamship Company.  If you prevented that man from contracting with the Association&mdash;I am sure that besides the Limerick Steamship Company he is interested in other ocean carrying companies&mdash;you would hamper the Association very seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to defend that provision in the articles of association. Certainly it would militate against the Association if they were to be prevented from contracting in any way with a big transit man like the managing director of the Limerick Steamship Company.  I inferred from what Senator Comyn said that he had a grievance because he only took up the rules in the ante-room yesterday when they were circulated three weeks ago to each member of the Seanad.  I was highly amused with what the Senator has been observing off the Clare coast, namely, these glass bulbs which he said were used by the French lobster fishers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator spoke a good deal about the oyster fisheries.  In fact there is on the board a man whom I consider to be perhaps the best man on commercial oyster fisheries in the country, Mr. McKibbin, of Fenit.  He himself does a good deal in the way of oyster culture.  He has opened up a very big trade in connection with Tralee Bay oysters with London and Dublin, and on the Board naturally will give a certain amount of attention to that particular end of fishing.  This Bill is not going to deal with how the <Col N="332" /> particular persons down the country are going to cure fish.  It is not the function of this Bill to do so.  I was rather amused by the Senator talking of some Norwegian being here in connection with herring curing.  I remember reading about it, but I am certain that it was mackerel and not herring.  The Norwegians have given us the lead in mackerel and the Scotch have led as far as herrings are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope gains will be made.  As I pointed out, the Department, as long as the Association will require it, will have to provide money <Col N="333" /> each year by way of a grant-in-aid.  If the Association is affluent after a few years that grant-in-aid may cease. It will be the ideal thing to hope, that the Sea Fisheries Association will become self-supporting and that this Association eventually will be largely governed by the fishermen themselves.  I should say that in the case of the Association, like other co-operative societies, it will rebound to the benefit of the members if there is a profit.  I do not think it will go in for accumulating money as an Association.  If it can afford it, it will give the benefit back to the fishermen by way of paying a higher price for fish, providing facilities for repayment of loans, and so on.  According as the Association gets on, if the fish come I should say it would be able to expand, provide better boats, and so on.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Sea Fisheries Bill, 1930, be referred to a Special Committee consisting of the following eight Senators:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;S.L. Brown, K.C.;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;J.C. Dowdall;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Thomas Foran;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;John MacLoughlin;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Joseph O'Doherty;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;M.F. O'Hanlon;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;L. O'Neill, and</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Thomas Johnson.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Four to form a quorum.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say that I have spoken to several of the Senators named.  I have not spoken to two, so that I am not able to say if they are willing to act.  They are chosen because of my own idea of their suitability. I think it desirable that the Bill should be referred to a Committee. Perhaps, in the first instance, the Minister will agree to an informal Committee to discuss intimately with himself and his advisers and to clear up points of difficulty, and then to discuss the matter in a more formal <Col N="335" /> manner in view of any amendments that may come.  I think it is desirable that some examination of the provisions of the Bill and possibly even of the rules should be undertaken by a committee of this kind.  It would be of advantage to the Bill and the purpose which the Minister has in view.</P>

      <P>I have no rooted objection to the special committee.  What I felt was that the second thing to which Senator Johnson referred would be extremely desirable, that is that a conference between persons interested in any particular aspect of the Bill and myself should be held.  I do not know that there is anything so out of the way in the Bill that it cannot go to the ordinary Committee.  I am wondering whether a special committee would save us from having another committee stage when the Bill comes back here.  If conferences are arranged I will be available any time during the recess.  If Senators would discuss any points which they wish to discuss with me I think it would be preferable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered that, but I really thought committees were advantageous in other cases and that a committee would probably be advantageous in this case.  It would save a prolonged committee stage and report stage.</P>

      <P>Might I ask what is the position with regard to these rules?  Senator Johnson suggested that the rules would be considered and presumably amended.  Surely it is out of the power of this House in any way to alter those rules.  They have to be altered from within the society itself.  They have already been registered under the Friendly Society Acts and I do not see how they can be touched by any committee arranged by this House.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister to give us some indication as to whether or not anything will be done <Col N="336" /> to secure that any fish will be left in the sea to be dealt with by this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the Senator referred to a question of penalties on Frenchmen who come along lobster fishing off the coast.  The penalties at the moment, notwithstanding what the Senator says, when you take the difference of exchange between the franc and the pound, are pretty heavy.  Furthermore, there is power to confiscate gear.  There is no power to confiscate a boat.  I think the penalties are fairly heavy as they stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>They think nothing of these penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt that very much. From the many appeals we get in connection with the fines imposed, I do not at all agree that they are looked upon as negligible.  Many representations have been made to the Department by the French Commercial Attache and the French Minister.  I think the penalties are considered very severe.  In fact, there is under consideration at the moment a Bill to deal with our exclusive fishery rights which will deal with the general question of penalties.  It has nothing at all to do, perhaps, with some of the things that are in persons' minds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Wyse-Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say that it is not a question of penalties that Miss Browne altogether refers to.  It is a question of the opportunity to catch them.  I do not think the State gives the opportunity of catching these intruders which it ought to give.  I think that is really the question and not the penalty.</P>

      <P>I move on behalf of Deputy Milroy:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad approves of the Draft Convention concerning forced or compulsory labour adopted by the International Labour Conference at its Fourteenth Session, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Seanad on the 10th December, 1930, and recommends the Executive Council to take the necessary steps for its ratification.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="338" /> This Convention is not of practical importance in the Saorstát, as we have neither forced nor compulsory labour. But appeals have been made at Geneva that all countries shall ratify Geneva Conventions whether directly affecting them or not, so that the social conditions of the world may, in general, be raised.  This is why the Seanad is asked to ratify the Draft Convention.</P>
