      <P>The House will recollect that a formal order was made last week for the printing and circulating of the draft of the new Standing Orders.  I understand that these will be circulated to-morrow and the Motion will appear on the Order Paper for Wednesday, the 18th instant, that these Standing Orders be adopted as the Standing Orders of the Seanad.  I suggest to the House that we should go into Committee on these Orders and take them seriatim, and that any amendment which Senators may desire to move shall be delivered in writing to the Clerk not later than Saturday, the 14th instant, no others being considered.  Senators will realise that these Orders are the result of very careful work and that they have been closely examined by the Committee on Procedure, on which <Col N="1432" /> the different groups in the Seanad are represented.  Does the House agree with that?  Senators will have from to-morrow until the 14th instant to consider any amendments they desire to move to these Standing Orders.  I would ask the House to agree that any Standing Powers to which amendments will not be moved will be adopted without debate.</P>

    <P>(2) The manager shall attend any meeting of the Council or of any committee of the Council at which he is requested by the Council to attend, and shall at such meeting give to the Council or such Committee (as the case may be) such advice and assistance as shall reasonably be required of him by the Council or such committee, and for that purpose the Manager shall arrange for the attendance at such meeting of such of the officers of the Corporation as may be necessary, having regard to the business to be transacted at such meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In section 57, sub-section (2). To delete in line 22 the words &ldquo;may be&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;the Council may consider.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment I propose relates to the attendance of the Manager at meetings of the Council.  Sub-section (2) says that the Manager may attend any meeting of the Council and that the Manager shall arrange for the attendance at such meeting of such of the officers of the Corporation as may be necessary. We want to substitute for the words &ldquo;as may be necessary&rdquo; the words &ldquo;as the Council may consider necessary.&rdquo; The question which would be likely to arise at such meetings would be question in relation to contracts or in relation to any other works of the council and probably questions as to general policy.  The Manager is there of course.  The Manager is intended to be a great executive officer.  But there may be other officers of the Council who <Col N="1435" /> would be good men for advising, say, on the legal interpretation of contracts, statutes and matters of that kind.  There may be other officers of the Council such as engineers who may be quite competent to advise the Council on engineering questions in relation, say, to water works.  Then another man may be a very good man to advise them on the question of electricity and we wish to have it in the power of the Council to say, if they wish, who is the man who is to come before them and give them advice.  I think this is an amendment which the Minister ought to consider reasonable.  It is put forward as a distinct improvement on the Bill.  It preserves the executive authority of the Manager and at the same time it preserves the deliberative quality of the Council and it is an amendment that ought to be accepted.  Speaking on this amendment I would say that the Minister has been very vigilant and very jealous of the powers of the Manager and his executive authority.  We do not question that at all.  The Minister has carried his point through the Seanad in that matter.  This is not a question relating to the Manager's executive authority.  It is a question relating to what I might call the Council's views in the matters of policy.  I think that the Council should have the right to ask for the attendance of any officer that they consider necessary.  I leave the amendment to the judgment of the House.  I have explained the object of the amendment as well as I could in the space of time that I wish to take up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy) Richard (General) Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator says I have been vigilant on the question of the Manager's powers.  I have been vigilant for the purpose of eliminating out of the situation between the Council and the Manager those little things that may prevent the Manager completely dominating with his own responsibility, and, therefore, the things that would prevent him from completely serving the Council to the fullest possible extent.  The Senator <Col N="1436" /> states that his amendment is such that it would put it into the direct power of the Council to say who is the man who is to come before them to give advice.  We have arranged that such advice or such information as is in the hands of the Manager, or which is in his procurement, will be at the disposal of the Council.  In Section 54 we make it clear that the Lord Mayor or Chairman of the Council shall get the information that may be in the possession or procurement of the Manager.  In the next section we have arranged that it shall be the duty of the Manager to advise and assist the Council generally in regard to the exercise or performance by them of the reserved functions, and in Section 57 we make arrangements for the attendance of the Manager at any meeting of the Council or Committee of the Council, and that he shall at such meetings give the Council or the Committee such advice and assistance as shall reasonably be required of him by the Council or such Committee, and for that purpose the Manager shall arrange for the attendance at such meeting of such of the officers of the Corporation as may be necessary, having regard to the business to be transacted at such meeting.  We say that it shall be the duty of the Manager to give to the Council such advice and assistance as they require, and that, so far as the bringing forward of any official into the Council that the Manager may consider necessary, that that official will be brought forward by the Manager.  But it will be entirely within the discretion of the Manager to say whether the official will be brought forward or not&mdash;subject to this, that the Council is always in the position to say: &ldquo;We have not got the advice and assistance we require in connection with this matter, and we are not in a position to say that we have been fully served in this matter without hearing such and such a person.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want to bring about a situation either for the Council itself or for the Manager, that in a casual kind of way, for one reason or another, some member of the Council <Col N="1437" /> will get the Council to insist that such and such a person whether minor or major on the staff shall be brought forward there for the purpose of cross-examination and for the purpose of arguing out the point with the Manager.  I submit that the section as it stands at present amply provides for the situation.  &ldquo;The Manager shall arrange for the attendance at such meeting&rdquo; and so on. It was argued in the Dáil that that left a doubt as to who was the ultimate person responsible for saying whether it was necessary or not.  In so far as it brought any member of the staff before the Council the only way in which it could be made clear would be to say &ldquo;such officers of the Corporation as the Manager would consider necessary.&rdquo;  But that would be underlining the matter, and I do not think it is necessary to underline it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept the principle of this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the principle.  If the Council says &ldquo;We want to see the clerk who filled up these forms here&rdquo;; and if the Manager in the exercise of his responsibility and discretion says &ldquo;I am responsible for the management of the staff and the handling of the staff in the execution of the Council's work and I object to the Council interfering and cross-examining this man on these points,&rdquo; then a way is opened up for a dispute.  We must assume that the Council and the Manager are going to act reasonably and that the Manager is there to serve the Council's general demands and general purposes.  If we introduce little matters upon which little disputes can arise for one reason or another, these disputes will arise and will muddy the whole atmosphere of co-operation that should exist between the Manager and the Corporation about matters generally.  The section in its present form provides that in so far as is necessary in regard to giving advice or assistance from the Council, the Manager shall bring before the Council such officers as may be necessary. <Col N="1438" /> If the Manager is fit to be in the position at all he should be left to determine, whether having heard the Council on any particular matter, he shall bring a particular officer before them or not.</P>
      <P>I think on the general question Senators who have been members of public bodies will realise that there has been a very great amount of unnecessary attendance in the past at Council meetings of responsible officers who might very much more effectively and profitably be away attending to their duties in other places.  The Manager should be the person to give the Council advice, and the Council should not be placed in a position in which they can criticise the Manager and say: &ldquo;Oh, he is not the engineer,&rdquo; or &ldquo;He is not the medical officer of health; we will not hear him.  We want to hear so-and-so.  We want a clerk from this or that department.&rdquo;  The necessities of the situation are amply covered by the section as it stands, in my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the position stated by the Minister is wrong.  That is to say, if in any circumstances, if by any chance there is a clash between the Council and the Manager, the Manager's will shall prevail.  I put forward this as the kind of thing which may well happen.  There are certain reserved functions for the Council.  One of these is &ldquo;The powers conferred by Section 3 of the Borough Funds (Ireland) Act, 1888, in relation to the promotion or the opposing of legislation, the prosecution, and defence of any such legal proceedings as are mentioned in that section, etc.&rdquo; That is a reserved function of the Council, and it may be a serious matter for the Council.  The Council may require more detailed information, personally given, than the Manager can give.  Again, the Manager may have views which are opposed to those of the Council in respect to the prosecution or defence of any legal proceedings or in relation to the promotion or the opposing of legislation.  He may have definite views on these matters which <Col N="1439" /> are not the views of the Council. The Council may want to get full information, and the Minister's proposition is that the Manager shall decide ultimately who shall give the information.  The best of Managers in regard to technical affairs will be speaking from a brief prepared by his experts, and I think everybody will admit that, on many matters, it is better to have the information required given by the person responsible rather than given in a secondhand way.</P>
      <P>While I am not satisfied with the amendment in form, because I think it would not go far to achieve its purpose, I think the Council should have the right to call into consultation any officer that they desire to see in the fulfilment of their particular reserved functions.  Supposing we delete the words &ldquo;may be&rdquo; and insert the words of the amendment, &ldquo;the Council may consider,&rdquo; that would mean that there shall be a formal consideration before any officer can be brought forward.  That is to say, the Manager will not be able to bring forward an officer to assist the Council if the amendment is passed, unless the Council have previously considered it.  It would seem to me that the purpose of the mover would be better served if the Seanad insert such words as these after the word &ldquo;necessary,&rdquo;&ldquo;or as the Council may require.&rdquo;  That would leave an alternative so that if the Manager thought a particular officer would be necessary he could bring him forward and on the other hand if the Council thought it necessary he could be brought forward. I do not think it should be left to the ultimate decision or veto of the Manager if the Council desires the attendance of a particular official with regard to the carrying out of the reserved functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to be a very important matter.  The importance of it has been proved by an incident which occurred, I think, recently in Cork.  The Council there desired the attendance of some official at a meeting and the Manager <Col N="1440" /> refused to produce him.  How the matter turned out in the end I do not know.  I am speaking rather from memory in regard to it but I think everybody who has experience will know that if the Manager is really to be Manager he shall have to account to the Council if the Council are to be of any use.  They are there to criticise to a certain extent.  The Manager has very large powers indeed over the Council.  He will definitely have all these powers. It is only human nature for him to put forward the best side he can. Everybody does that and I would not blame him for doing it but the Council may want to have the required information directly.  They may want the information or details from some subordinate of the Manager and I think it is right that they should have the power to demand the attendance of the officer who could give that information, otherwise I do not see how they could carry out their duties.  They are simply bound to do what the Manager tells them and they have no power to learn the details independently for themselves.  I think such a provision as this is necessary and that it should be in the interests of everybody to have it in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are two points of view in regard to this amendment.  There are a number of other similar amendments in regard to the question of detail, but this is a question of what one's point of view is.  One point of view is whether the Manager is to be in a similar position to the managing director of a firm or of a Board.  If a Board were to allow any of its subordinate officials to come into its meetings and to discuss business with the members of the Board over the head of the Manager, or even before him, it would lead to chaos in the conduct of business by the Manager.  The idea of this section is that the Manager should be left in a similar position to that of managing director of a Company, responsible in the ultimate, no doubt, to the members of the Council, and responsible for the control of the staff and all details. I believe his position would become <Col N="1441" /> impossible if the Council were, against his wishes, to send for and discuss the affairs of the Council with either the office boy, on the one hand, or a very senior official on the other.  Many of the amendments deal with the principle rather than with the details.  If I thought it wise to do so I would support the amendment, but I oppose it because I want the Manager to be absolutely responsible to the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>With the statement of the Minister I am in general agreement, in so far as it is undesirable that, if the Council were unreasonable, they should be allowed to ask that junior officials should be brought before them, or that they should ask for their attendance.  I can, however, conceive a situation arising in which it would be necessary that the Council should have before them the executive officers of the Council&mdash;the law officer, the City Engineer, the City Architect, the Borough Surveyor&mdash;to advise them on questions of policy.  As I understand the proposal in the Bill, it is that the Manager is responsible for the details of the work of administration, and that the Council will be responsible for policy.  I think that is the idea underlying the Bill.  If the Council are to consider questions of policy they might think it desirable to call the Chief Executive Officer of the Department before them&mdash;a thing that has often occurred at these public bodies.  I think it is necessary and desirable that the Council should have the power to ask the Manager to produce these particular officials when required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not considering the possibility of a clash between the Council and the Manager.  It is not a question of a difference of opinion at all.  We must remember that the Manager will not be a professional man, and he cannot be expected to be an expert engineer, an expert in public health services, or in legal and other matters that come before the Council.  I can say from my experience that it would be necessary, if the Council desired that the responsible <Col N="1442" /> executive officer should be brought before them, that the Manager should not have the power to refuse to do so.  I am not arguing in anticipation of a clash between the Manager and the Council, because I think any Manager would be extremely foolish who would refuse, when questions of policy are being considered, to bring forward officers for examination.  I am speaking in the hope of making this Bill a good Bill, and not from the point of view of taking any power from the Manager. I am considering the working of the public services of the City.  I agree with what the Minister said, that it is undesirable that junior officers should be brought to the Council meetings.  Anyone who has had any experience of public bodies would oppose that, but I think there should be power to bring in executive officers when the Council is considering matters of policy, which may have a very important bearing on the affairs of the City.  Under these circumstances, the Council should be in a position to bring in these officers.</P>
    <P>No matter how efficient a Manager is, it must be remembered that there will be members in the new Corporation who will be experts in different branches of industry.  That was always so.  In the Corporation there were professional men and directors of various branches of industry, men who had a great knowledge of civic administration, whose opinions very often weighed against the opinions offered by some of the professional men in the employment of the Corporation, and very often members of the Council were better able to decide questions of policy than some of the experts the Corporation had in its employment.  I am not decrying the officials of the Corporation, because I have always stated that the Corporation had a splendid staff, comparable to any in any service that I know.  I am always prepared to pay a tribute to the higher officials of the Dublin Corporation, and to bear testimony to the fact that they have rendered good service to the City.  It is in order to try and bring <Col N="1443" /> about harmony in the future government of the City that I think it is desirable the Council should have power to have the chief executive officers before them.</P>

      <P>Beginning at line 20 the Section continues: &ldquo;and for that purpose the Manager shall arrange for the attendance at such meeting of such of the officers of the Corporation as may be necessary having regard to the business to be transacted at such meeting ...&rdquo; I think if you override that by other words you practically do away with the functions of the Manager altogether.  As I read the section it is quite sufficient to cover any expert that the Council may desire to hear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in hearing Senator Douglas draw an analogy between the managing director of a business firm and the City Manager.  I wonder what business firm he has in mind, because he must know, as we all know, that the general tendency of directors at the present time in most firms or undertakings is to reduce the manager to a mere cypher.  If Senator Bagwell or Senator Esmonde were here they could tell the House that there is no railway manager in Ireland at present in a position above that of a cypher.  The directors take out of his hands practically all the responsibility that formerly devolved upon the manager, and it is amazing to find some people here applauding the policy of making the Manager of the new Corporation supreme.  I agree in making him supreme in most things, because he cannot do his work otherwise.  I have seen the deplorable results of unskilled and inexperienced people trying to do work that can only be done by people <Col N="1444" /> with expert knowledge and experience. It is amusing to find universal applause by business men and directors of banks, and so on, to this principle, when, if you talk to their managers about the matter they will tell you that they interfere and cause confusion by poking their noses into matters about which they know nothing, and by giving instructions over the head of the managers.  All the directors here know that is a fact.  If they do not believe it, let them consult their own managers or their own staff.  It is a grand thing to applaud in someone else's case what they would not accept in the case of their own business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a business like railways, for instance, the general manager, as Senator Farren pointed out, is not a professional man.  The directors insist on having the chief permanent way engineer before them to talk about certain matters.  Sometimes the general manager is against a man coming in, because he may have certain ideas of his own which are not in accordance with these held by men placed over a great department in a professional capacity.  The directors like to have a talk with him, and possibly they are right; they do the same with the locomotive engineer and the stores superintendent. The same would be necessary in the case of the Corporation.  It does not follow always that the Manager is infallible, nor does it follow that there will of necessity be any friction between the two.  We must assume that the Council and the Manager are going to act in a commonsense way, or the Bill is not going to be a success.  I think it should be at the discretion of the Council, who we must assume will be composed of a body of responsible people, to send for any officer like the Borough Surveyor or the Law Agent, when dealing with a particular question, and to say that such an officer should be brought before them.  I do not think that is much to ask in the Bill, and I do not think it will lead to any friction.  It is only establishing the principle which the directors of every company that <Col N="1445" /> I know absolutely insist upon where their own officers are concerned.</P>

      <P>After this very closely-reasoned debate I think the Minister should now decide between the two positions.  Perhaps wisdom lies in a middle course.  I quite accept what the Minister stated, that it is wrong that the Council should have the right to call subordinate officials on every occasion.  That is not our intention.  But take the case, which I hope will not happen, of a breach in any of the embankments. There will be great excitement in the Council.  Under this section the Council would not have the right to call upon the engineer immediately. The Manager could bring forward whatever officials he liked.  The Council cannot say to the Manager: &ldquo;Why should not the engineer be here?&rdquo;  All they can say is that they are not satisfied with the explanation of the servants he has brought before them.  This amendment is not put forward in any partisan spirit, but with a view to establishing what I might call the homogeneity of this Bill.  It is brought forward so as to give the Council some authority in special cases.  Perhaps the Minister would accept this change in the amendment: &ldquo;And for that purpose the Manager shall arrange for the attendance at such meeting of such of the officers of the Corporation as the Council may consider necessary, or the Council may require, having regard to the business to be transacted at such meeting.&rdquo;  I think that would meet any objection that was made by Senator Douglas, and would provide for what was said from the Labour Benches.</P>

      <P>It was astounding; I think we ought to discuss, and I am prepared to discuss, the matter without any reference to Cork.  I am also prepared to discuss it with reference to Cork, although I do not think it will do Cork or Dublin any good to talk about Cork in connection with this Bill.  Senator Comyn thinks that some wisdom lies between what is in the Bill and what the amendment proposes.  If I might refer to Cork for a moment, there was a row in the Cork Council because the Manager was putting into operation the bye-laws of the Corporation. We are only gradually getting away from the position by which there was no such thing as a Manager and the Council did everything. We want to get very definitely away from that, we must do everything possible to safeguard the machine.  Section 58 makes provision whereby in a matter entirely and completely outside the Council's reserved functions, and in a matter that is entirely the Manager's responsibility, the Council may by operation of certain machinery pass a resolution, and make an order that the Manager shall do a certain thing.  If the Manager declined to bring in the engineer when discussing a big engineering matter, and the Council objected to that, they have the machinery by which they can require the Manager to produce the engineer.  Catastrophes and excitement bring their own machinery for doing things.  We provide legislation for the normal running of the Corporation.  The Manager is there to serve the Council, to give the Council the information at his disposal, and to produce such officials as are necessary for that.  I want to safeguard the Manager in his control over the staff.  I think any change in the section would not do that. The Manager is in the position that he knows that if he is so unreasonable as to be worthy of suspension the Council can suspend him.  If he is simply unreasonable, and they want an official produced before them, they can operate under Section 58.  I do not think that the Manager <Col N="1447" /> in carrying on the business of the Council is going to be unreasonable.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should explain that some of the amendments down in the name of Senator Milroy were prompted by me.  Under the Collection of Rates (Dublin) Act, 1849, and the Enforcement of Court Orders Act for the collection of rates, so far as the municipal rate went, that could be given to the rate collector. Under the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, orders coming into the District Court for the collection of rates were to be passed over to the under-sheriff, if over £5, and to the Civic Guards if under £5. I understand there is a difference in the courts about the matter, and that the Enforcement of Court Orders Act <Col N="1448" /> for the collection of rates was given to the collector of rates at times on the discretion of the Justice when the collector asked for it.  We have wiped out a large number of individual rates in the city and we have made a new municipal rate, but we have subjected it to all the conditions of the old poor rate and, therefore, we have done away with the provision by which the District Justice, on the application of the rate collector, could give the rate collector an order to enforce the collection of rates.  It has been represented by the corporation authorities that where the collection of rates is very satisfactory that it will interfere with and to some extent increase the cost of collection if the court order as a general matter is to be handed over to the under-sheriff for execution.  The intention of the amendment is to preserve the old discretion when on the application of the rate collector the Justice could hand over the enforcement order to the collector for collection.</P>

It was not exactly a rate, but in the main it applied a charge for water supply entered into by special contract between individuals and the Corporation.  We have put all the general rates of the City, with the exception of the police rate, into the municipal rate.  The Act of 1861 arranges a scheme under which it could be recovered.  The scheme was generally dealt with in the Act of 1849.  By putting in this amendment here it will enable the water contract money to be collected as part of the municipal rate.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Dublin Corporation Act, 1890, arrangements were made by which the City Council in respect of houses of £8 valuation, and suitable for being occupied by artisans or labourers, could compound with the owner of that property provided they satisfied certain conditions and paid the rates before the March of the particular year. They could assess their rates at not less than two-thirds and not more than four-fifths of the valuation.  One <Col N="1450" /> great advantage of that to the Corporation was that they could require certain conditions to be fulfilled with regard to repairs and sanitation, and all that in connection with these houses.  The Rates on Small Dwellings Act, 1925, provided that in the case of houses of £6 valuation&mdash;with power to extend that up to £12 valuation&mdash;a reduction could be given to the owner in respect of one-tenth of the rate on small dwellings.</P>
      <P>The Act of 1925 secures that the old Act remained in operation.  It is pointed out by the Council authorities that they wanted to retain the power of giving a greater reduction for the purpose of getting greater control over a certain class of these houses.  As the Bill stands it would be possible for the Council, if a certain house or a number of houses came within the scope of their desire in this matter, to give the advantage of eight-tenths as against nine-tenths of the rates under the Small Dwellings Act.  It is simply for the purpose of reserving the powers of the Council to accept to the extent of one-tenth as in the old arrangements, subject to whatever general conditions they may wish to impose. There are no general conditions as to sanitation imposed under the Small Dwellings Act.  This section, as it stands, completely removes the idea of valuation, and I think that is not to be desired.  By the Report Stage consideration will be given as to whether a limit might not be placed on it.  I think there should be some restriction.  There was a restriction in the 1890 Act of £8.  The Small Dwellings Act actually fixed the valuation at £6, but it gave power to raise it to £12.</P>

      <P>It simply means this: The Senator will remember <Col N="1451" /> that a Bill was introduced last year which extended to the City and County of Dublin the power to give outdoor relief to able-bodied persons, which power had been extended to the country as a whole under the 1923 Act.  That raised this year's poor rate by probably 1s. 6d. in respect of Rathmines and Pembroke. We are stabilising, in so far as the rates are comparable, the rates in Rathmines and Pembroke for five years with the rates of last year.</P>
      <P>The police rate is a separate rate, and we take that out of the rates for the purpose of standardising. The increased poor rate for the purpose of giving assistance to the able-bodied is also a separate item, and will fall in its proper proportions on Rathmines and Pembroke.  We also take that out of the rate for standardising. What is standardised is the basic thing that is left.</P>

The class of houses to which I am going to refer will not have the benefit of the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act.  The maximum rent in respect of houses held under that Act can be ascertained, but in the case of other hereditaments or tenements which do not come under that Act, I think <Col N="1452" /> the phrase &ldquo;at a reasonable rent&rdquo; will immediately open the way to the Courts in cases in which there is a dispute.

      <P>I think it is an impossible question to ask any court to settle.  No one has yet found a way of settling the question of what a reasonable rent is.  I remember when this matter was first raised in connection with the land, special judges and courts were set up to deal with it.  The question involved then was, what is a fair rent, and not the question which we have today, what is a reasonable rent. After very long consideration the courts finally decided that a fair rent was what an ordinary man would be able to live on in comfort and bring up his family on in comfort. Then the question arose, what is comfort?  Was a man with a large family to have a smaller rent than a man with no family?  It is a question which no one has been able to settle, nor do I think it will ever be settled.</P>

      <P>I think this is a matter which the Minister should reconsider before we take the Report Stage of the Bill.  Senator Moore has related some of his reminiscences. I may give an example of the difficulties that are likely to arise in deciding this question.  A valuer was <Col N="1453" /> giving evidence on behalf of a landlord as to the reasonable rent of a house.  He gave the figure of £20. He was asked by a solicitor if he were acting as valuer for the tenant, whether he would value the house at £20.  His answer was &ldquo;upon my oath I would go very near it.&rdquo;  This is really a matter which depends on private judgment.  It depends on inclination, on self-interest and on a variety of things, and a matter which if not settled on the Report Stage of this Bill will cause tremendous difficulties in the carrying out of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What the section provides for is that where a tenement is unoccupied at the time of rating the person liable on paying the full rate shall be entitled to a refund of one-twenty-fourth in respect of every completed month during which the tenement is unoccupied for certain purposes.  One purpose of unoccupation would be that he could not get a person to take it at a reasonable rent.  The person owning the tenement will claim a refund, and say &ldquo;I was unable to get a person to occupy the house at a reasonable rent.  I was offered such and such a rent by one man, and such a rent by somebody else but I am not prepared to accept that figure.&rdquo;  I take it that it would then become a question for the Corporation to say whether the rent offered was a reasonable one, and whether the reasons given for want of occupancy were reasonable.  It may be that a refund will be made and the thing will end there.  But where a difference occurs it will be a matter for the courts.  You must have some machinery to force the Corporation to pay out a certain amount of money.  If they are not willing to pay it out, then I take it the case will have to go to the courts.  In connection with the rating arrangements for vacant premises made under the 1928 Act, I had not had any case brought to my notice of a dispute between ratepayers and the Council.</P>

      <P>This is a question on which I have some experience, and <Col N="1454" /> I would make a suggestion to the Minister on the problem of what a reasonable rent is.  You may have a case like this: Premises may be vacant, and the Council will demand the rates on them.  The owner of the premises will say: &ldquo;I could not get a reasonable rent.&rdquo;  The Council will answer: &ldquo;You could have got a reasonable rent of £50.&rdquo;  The man's reply to that will be, &ldquo;my house is well worth £75.&rdquo;  That dispute must be settled by some court.  The settlement of the dispute will involve the employment of valuers, and although I am against bureaucracy I think it would not be a bad thing to have the determination of this absolutely in the hands of some one person.</P>

I think that is the nett effect of the proposal in the Bill, and I think we should have some attempt to justify increasing the rate of discount provided for in the 1928 Act.  That Act applies to the country generally.  This Act applies to Dublin only.  I do not think we should allow this to pass, because, in effect, it is an amendment of the 1928 Act.  I think we should have some explanation as to why it is proposed to increase the rate of discount from 10 per cent. to 20 per cent.</P>

      <P>Section 10 of the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928, provides for the payment of discount. There is a remission of rates to the extent of 1/10th for a certain amount of prompt payment of rates. Sub-section (2) of that Act sets out that&mdash;</P>
      <P>The provisions of this section shall be in addition to and not in substitution for the provisions of any other enactment (whether public, general, local or personal, public or private) enabling a rate to be discharged by payment of a fraction thereof within a limited time, but not so as to entitle any person to relief under this section and under such other enactment in respect of the same rate.</P>
      <P>One of the enactments that was borne in mind framing that sub-section was Section 75 of the Dublin Corporation Act of 1890.  That section provides&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases in which the annual value of any premises does not exceed eight pounds and the premises are in the judgment of the <Col N="1456" /> Corporation suitable as dwellings for and are occupied by artisans or labourers it shall be lawful for the Corporation to compound with the owner of such premises for the payment of all or any of the rates leviable on such reduced estimate of the net annual value not being less than two-thirds nor more than four-fifths of the net value at which the premises are assessed as the Corporation may deem reasonable. Provided that the year's rates on such reduced estimates are paid on or before the first day of March in each year.</P>
    <P>This section seeks to retain that to the extent of four-fifths to the Corporation. It was pointed out by the City Corporation that the Bill as it stands at present would prejudice them in the holding of these powers. These powers are being followed for this reason: that the Small Dwellings Act gives them no discretion but to give these deductions in respect of prompt payment of rates. This section lays down the conditions which they will give the increased reduction.  The object was to get greater control over sanitation and other matters in regard to artisans dwellings in the city, and over the general state of repairs of these dwellings.  The City authorities have pressed us to secure a continuance of that discretion to them. I think the Seanad ought to meet the City authorities in allowing them to retain this discretion.</P>

      <P>The Rates on Small Dwellings Acts itself prevents houses that are getting privileges under previous Acts getting increased privileges under it.  That Act at present applies to Dublin. <Col N="1457" /> It extends the privilege of one-tenth remission of rates to houses with a valuation up to £6 whether it submits to the additional sanitary control or not.  As a matter of fact, this Act does increase the level up to £8 in respect of all small dwellings.  Under the Rates on Small Dwellings Act it would be possible for the Minister to issue an order increasing the valuation in respect of remissions up to £12.  The Corporation do not desire that, but while not extending the concessions under the Rates on Small Dwellings Act above £8, they do desire a discretion to extend the additional discount such as they had under the 1890 Act.  They desire to be able to act in a selective way in respect of the houses to which they would apply the discount for the purpose of having control over the general condition and sanitation of the houses.</P>

      <P>I am sure it is due to my obtuseness, but I do not read sub-section (1) of Section 10 of the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928, in that way. That sub-section provides that wherever the owner of a small dwelling who is not also the occupier pays to the rating authority nine-tenths of the amount of the rate and so on&mdash; that is practically a 10 per cent. discount. Sub-section (2) goes on to say that the provisions of this section shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the provisions of any other enactment enabling a rate to be discharged by payment of a fraction thereof, but not so as to entitle any person to relief under this section in respect of the same rate.  It cannot be doubled.  Then we have the sub-section in the Bill which says that the Act shall apply, but subject to the modification that in relation to such hereditament or tenement it shall be &ldquo;eight-tenths&rdquo; and not &ldquo;nine-tenths.&rdquo;  Therefore I take it that the discount provided for in the 1928 Act is doubled.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 30:</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 76 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>76.&mdash;(1)  The Council, by resolution passed under this section and for the passing of which not less than two-thirds of the members of the Council shall have voted, may authorise the expenditure by the Corporation of moneys on the decoration of the City for occasions of public rejoicing or for other appropriate occasions.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every resolution passed under this section shall specify the occasion for which the decoration of the City wholly or partly at the expense of the Corporation is to be authorised by such resolution and the amount which is to be expended by the Corporation on such decoration.</P>
      <P>(3)  Subject to the provisions of the next following sub-section the Corporation may expend moneys out of the Municipal Fund in accordance with and in so far as authorised by a resolution passed under this section but not otherwise.</P>
      <P>(4)  The aggregate amount of the expenditure of the Corporation for the purposes of this section in any local financial year shall not exceed a sum equivalent to a rate of one penny in the pound of the rateable valuation of the City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment speaks for itself. Its object is that the Corporation may, on very special occasions, decide <Col N="1459" /> to expend a certain amount of money on the decoration of the city. They can only do so by passing a resolution at a meeting at which not less than two-thirds of the members would be present and at which it should be decided what was the occasion such money should be expended. This amendment has been framed deliberately so that nobody could abuse its powers in this respect. I think every Senator in the House will agree with me when I say that there are very special and rare occasions on which it is necessary, in the interests of our city, when large numbers of visitors may be coming into it, that we should be entitled to decorate it in cases where we think it is advisable and necessary to do so.  I do not know that there is any necessity to elaborate in detail what the amendment does.  It is quite simple and means this: On occasions of rejoicing in our city there may be great numbers of persons coming in here and I think it is undesirable that commercial travellers should be sent round with tall hats to collect from citizens money for the purpose of decorating the city on such occasions.  Some good citizens will contribute and some particular ones always are contributing, and the necessity of this being thrown upon the shoulders of a few people&mdash;bankers and other people like that&mdash;has been simply blackmailing these people, getting subscriptions to meet a charge that should fall upon the citizens as a whole.  Senators will agree with me in having framed the amendment so as to prevent the council being wild or extravagant about this matter, and I hope I have done it in a reasonable way, and I hope the amendment will be accepted.  As far as I understand it, the Minister is not opposed to the amendment.</P>

      <P>Under this section provision is made for the appointment of the Deputy Manager, but I do not see any provision made in the event of the possibility of the Manager and the Lord Mayor being incapacitated at the same time.  There would be no possibility under the machinery in the Bill for the appointment of a Deputy Lord Mayor. And as the Lord Mayor seems to have certain powers which are essential, it seems to be desirable that any possible gap should be filled.  I only query this point in order to know whether under the existing law there is provision for the appointment of a Deputy Mayor.  If that is so, perhaps there is no need to say anything further about it.  But as the section stands it does not make possible the appointment of a Deputy Lord Mayor in case the present Lord Mayor happened to be incapacitated.</P>

      <P>This section makes provision for the appointment of persons to manage the Dublin Union for a period, but it is contemplated that the Council shall not elect persons from their own members, but that they may go outside.

      <P>Perhaps it would be as well that the Seanad should understand the position.  At the present moment there are three areas in which there are Boards of Guardians&mdash;Balrothery, Rathdown, and the Commissioners of the Dublin area.  The County Council are given powers here to set up a body to act practically as Commissioners for the County Council in Balrothery and Rathdown areas, and to nominate certain people to act for such people in respect of the Dublin area.  We shall be passing through a transition period in this financial year, to the 1st April next.  It may be that the County Council would wish to nominate the present guardians either in Rathdown or Balrothery to carry on the work for the remainder of the year, and these guardians need not be members of the County Council. This arrangement is only for a small part of the financial year, and we think that the County Council should have a discretion in the matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 34:</P>
      <P>Section 101, sub-section (5)&mdash; To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) No order made under the foregoing sub-sections of this section shall come into operation unless and until it has been laid <Col N="1464" /> before each House of the Oireachtas and approved by a resolution of each such House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The question raised in this amendment is an important one.  It will be found in sub-section (3), and gives the Minister power to do certain things by order:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) Where it appears to the Minister that any local, personal, or private Act or any order relating to the existing city or to either of the added urban districts and in force at the passing of this Act contains provisions which are inconsistent with or rendered unnecessary by or adequately replaced by provisions made by or under this Act, the Minister may by order declare that such provisions of such Act or order shall not apply in or in relation to the City, and upon such order being made the provisions specified therein of such Act or order shall not apply in or in relation to the City.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say the Minister may in his discretion decide that any local, personal, or private Act shall no longer be law if, in his opinion, it is adequately replaced by the provisions of this Act.  No doubt it is necessary that certain powers shall be given to the Minister to make the adaptations, and particularly is that so in respect to the general Acts provided for by sub-section (5).  But when one is giving the Minister power to amend by administrative order sections, say, of the Port and Docks Act or, say, an Act of the Gas Company, or any other local, private or personal Act, it is a very big order indeed that is given to the Minister without the sanction of the Oireachtas.  It is provided in sub-section (6) that any order made under the section shall be laid before both Houses and if a resolution is passed within a certain time annulling such order it shall not have effect.  But we know as a matter of practice that the laying of an order on the Table is a mere perfunctory procedure.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House and I think nobody in the other House has taken <Col N="1465" /> upon himself or herself the onerous responsibility of examining those orders and their effect upon the law of the country.  I think that that provision of laying on the Table and waiting for a motion in the House might be justified in respect of Section 5 which deals with general Acts. But it seems to me that this amending of local, personal or private Acts by an order of the Minister should not be operative without the sanction of the Oireachtas.  Personally I would be quite satisfied if I felt that there was machinery within this House to ensure that the House itself would be made cognisant of the effect of any order of the kind by deliberating in a definite way and that certain public attention would necessarily be drawn to the effect of such an order.  But in view of the practice I think it is too great a power to give to the Minister.  We should require that before any order of the kind becomes effective it should have the positive sanction rather than the negative acquiescence of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a most glaring example of the exercise by the Ministry of suspensing and dispensing powers.  The power to suspend by Acts of Parliament and the power to dispense with Acts of Parliament is a most glaring example of the exercise of arbitrary power by the Minister.  The Minister, I am sure, knows thoroughly well that the exercise of these powers in former times has caused untold trouble.  Ministries now in democratic governments are taking these same arbitrary powers that did so much harm in former times. On several occasions Bills have come before this House where the officials of the Department took to themselves the right to legislate.  Here the Minister takes to himself the right to repeal legislation, the right to suspend legislation and the right to dispense with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There might be every excuse for a Department which is pressed for time in the formulation of a measure but this Bill is a Bill to which a <Col N="1466" /> great amount of care and attention has been devoted.  I am sure that every Act of Parliament relating to local government in Ireland and elsewhere has been scanned by those who were preparing this Bill.  It was quite competent for the Minister, if he intended to alter or repeal any existing law in whole or in part, to put it into the Bill&mdash;it was within his power to put it into the Bill. It was within his knowledge, because I know in the course of the discussion that has gone on in relation to the various sections of the Bill that the Minister is thoroughly cognisant of every Act of Parliament dealing directly or indirectly with the Corporation of Dublin.  He and his officials are cognisant of all these Acts of Parliament. It would be quite competent for the Minister to put into his Bill the various sections of Acts of Parliament which he contemplates are to be dispensed with or suspended. It is a very bad principle to introduce this power of allowing the Minister, by laying orders on the Table, to override the legislature or the law courts.  I saw the other day where a Minister stated that the power of life and death was in the hands of the Ministry and not in the power of the law; that it was in the hands of the Government for the time being.  There must be respect for the written law; there must be a respect for the authority of our legal institutions, for the authority of the Parliament of this country.  The authority of the Oireachtas must be preserved supreme in all respects and on all occasions.  There was no justification whatever for the Minister here taking to himself the power by order to suspend or dispense with the law.  He and his officials know thoroughly well what they want to do.  They should have put it into this Bill.  They should have it passed by the Dáil and Seanad.  I think the resolution proposed by Senator Johnson is really too mild, in view of what has happened, not merely in this country but in other countries. Ministers and Departments have taken on themselves arbitrary powers and this is a thing which the <Col N="1467" /> people will have to resist sooner or later.</P>

      <P>Unusual as is the company in which I find myself, I wish to support the spirit of this amendment.  This matter of giving power to Departments to make orders has been the subject of very serious comment by eminent people in other countries.  A short time ago the Lord Chief Justice of England wrote a book on this very subject, and one can imagine when the Lord Chief Justice, with the responsibility of his office, thinks it necessary to write a book and thinks the matter worthy of consideration, how important the question is.  This is really giving very wide and dangerous powers to the Executive.  It enables them to amend in any way they wish a number of Acts of Parliament within the wide scope of this Bill.  That is what the section really means.  The courts of law have no power to interfere with such administrative orders.  I agree that in 99 out of 100 cases there may be no abuse or injustice.  But the fact that it is possible in one case out of the 100 to inflict injustice by machinery of this kind, to turn a Department into a law-making body, is extremely serious, and it strikes at the root of the basic principles on which Parliamentary control rests.  I do not see why it should not be possible to divide this into two groups.  There are ordinary administrative orders which do not involve the adaptation of any Act.  There are other orders which involve the adaptation of some statutes.  These orders would constitute new law&mdash;law made by administrative order.  If the House wishes to have law by administrative order they are given an opportunity now of saying so.  I suggest some scheme in which amendments to Acts of Parliament should be confirmed by positive resolutions of both Houses and not merely passed by allowing the order to lie on the Table.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a word to enforce the statements <Col N="1468" /> made by the Senators who have already spoken.  The peace of this country and the freedom of every citizen depend upon the law courts. The law courts try to carry out as best they can the laws passed by the Oireachtas.  On these two things, on the Oireachtas and on the courts of justice, the rights of the citizens rest.  As has been pointed out by the last speaker, Lord Chief Justice Hewit, in his recent book, has shown that there is a gradual encroachment in England on the rights of Parliament and on the rights of the law courts.  Ministers, to save themselves trouble and to save bother, put in some section in a Bill. This is a growing abuse.  It enables them, in spite of certain laws, to do what they choose to abolish these laws and to alter them or to do anything else they like with them.  That is an abuse that has been growing up in this country.  There is much less excuse for that in this country than in other countries.  In England, where these things are done, Ministers have an immense amount of work before their Parliament.  That Parliament has to deal with the affairs of many parts of the world and they find it difficult there to find time for many things.  But in this country it is different.  The country is small and there is ample time to provide for all the legislation that is needed.  The Seanad and Dáil should resist encroachments of this kind on their authority.</P>

      <P>I think with the general principle underlying most of the speeches, all sides of this House are in general agreement. The only difficulty has arisen over a certain type of order which is purely administrative.  In the amendment we have the necessity for a formal resolution.  I think there is a growing feeling here that there should be a positive Resolution by the House instead of simply laying the order on the Table of the House.  I think it is no harm to point out that on this Bill there is no question of giving unlimited power to the Minister.  The point was raised by Senator Johnson that <Col N="1469" /> if the order were laid on the Table it might be overlooked, but that a Resolution coming before the House would not be overlooked.  Personally I must say that I prefer a positive Resolution, and for that reason I will support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Comyn has a greater conception than his remarks would indicate of the large amount of legislation which is involved.  There are about 48 local, personal and private Acts dealing with Dublin City alone. There are other Acts dealing with Rathmines, some others with Pembroke, and some Acts dealing with the urban districts now making up the coastal borough.  I have not a copy of even some of these Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will understand that it is very difficult to get a copy of some of these private Acts.  There are bodies that have not got copies of their own private Acts.  In Dublin alone there are 48 private Acts.  I am asking here for power to issue such orders on these lines as will in the first place give effect to the provisions of the Act generally, and, in so far as we are putting Rathmines and Pembroke into the new Dublin City area, and amalgamating four urban councils into a new borough, that I should be given power to extend to the whole new City the provisions of an Act dealing with the present Dublin City or the provisions of a particular Act dealing with Rathmines or Pembroke, according as it may appear best, after full consultation with the local authority.  For instance a great amount of private legislation has been carried through dealing with public health matters generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we extended the area of the present City of Limerick we would extend to the new area all the provisions of Acts, dealing with buildings, streets and public health matters, which are included in private Acts of the City of Limerick and the Oireachtas would pass that provision <Col N="1470" /> without examining in the least any of the private Acts.  All the power we are asking, as far as private Acts are concerned, is that we shall be allowed to take the legislation that already exists in regard to Dublin, Rathmines or Pembroke and, after full examination of the provisions and the different matters contained in these Acts by the local authority, that we shall have power to issue an order which will make uniform the law in respect to the whole City according to the best provisions of this legislation, and that we shall have power to deal with the general adaptation of these Acts.  For instance, under the Rathmines Urban Council Act of 1902 the Clerk may do some things; the surveyor may do other things, and the Council may do certain other things.  All these things are to be made clear by the necessary orders.</P>
    <P>If all these matters have to come before the Seanad by way of a formal Resolution and that these matters are to be discussed here, I do not know where the discussion will lead to.  What we propose is that we shall be allowed to issue an order to be laid on the Tables of both Houses and that if, within the next twenty-one days on which either House sat, it is found that there is any objectionable provision in the Order, the matter can be raised and the order annulled.  The same provisions are incorporated in the 1923 and 1925 Acts.  I do not see any reason for departing from that procedure here simply because, instead of dealing with the whole country and changing from boards of guardians to boards of health and from rural councils to county councils, we are changing from urban councils to borough councils or to municipal councils.  The analogy is quite the same as in the 1923 and 1925 Acts.</P>
    <P>To suggest that the Seanad or the Dáil simply deals with its responsibilities in the matter of statutory powers in a perfunctory way, and that because of that the operation of the City Council or a department should be slowed down, I think an unworthy suggestion to come from <Col N="1471" /> any section of the Oireachtas.  Civil Service departments are charged with being dilatory in the way of dealing with certain matters.  They deal with very detailed matters and deal with them very scrupulously and in many ways they are tied up with statutory provisions of one kind or another.  In the matter of dealing with the mass of legislation that gradually must be dealt with either by order of this kind or in some other way, in order to have a uniform position in regard to the law in the City and the Borough, if we are to be unnecessarily held up by having to discuss the various orders that will be issued, in both Houses of the Oireachtas, the work is going to be much longer delayed than I would like to see it.</P>

I do not remember, but I accept the Minister's word in the matter, that identically wide powers were given then to the Minister.  It was provided by order, he states, that he might annul or amend any local, private or personal Acts.  It may have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not. What I did suggest was that some of the general legislation as applied to district councils and boards of guardians in regard to county councils and boards of health bear the same relation that the private Acts bear to the Acts that are going to govern the Borough and the municipal council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not of the view that this system of legislation by order should be entirely banned.  I think it is necessary under the modern scheme of Parliamentary Government with the complexities that confront Parliament, that some such provision should be in operation provided that there is clear and adequate provision made for Parliamentary sanction of the acts of the Minister.  I do not think that in <Col N="1472" /> practice the provision that is made in the 1923 Act or in this Bill is satisfactory.  We are opposed to this provision because of the faults of the 1923 Act and the subsequent Acts.  We should bear in mind that we had not very long experience of Parliamentary affairs in 1923, and that we have long since learned that a provision such as is sought to be put into the Bill by sub-section (6) is inadequate to ensure that there shall be proper Parliamentary control over the making of laws.  I hope the House will bear in mind that in making these orders the Ministry is being given power to alter the law and even to make new laws.  If there is one thing we should insist on it is that the law-making authority should be the Parliament and not the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister has spoken of the possibility of holding up the work of administration and I recognise that possibility.  It has been recognised as a defect in England and I find that in the Local Government Act passed in England about 1929, the same question was under discussion. After a good deal of consultation and debate a provision was inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every order made under this section shall come into operation upon the date specified therein in that behalf, but shall be laid before Parliament as soon as may be after it is made and shall cease to have effect upon the expiration of a period of three months from the date upon which it came into operation unless at the same time before the expiration of that period it has been approved by a resolution passed by each House of Parliament.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided that in reckoning any such period of three months as aforesaid no account shall be taken of any time during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued or during which both Houses are adjourned for more than four days.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If such provision as that were inserted in this Bill it would remove the Minister's objection regarding <Col N="1473" /> the dilatory effect of getting Parliamentary consent to the Orders.  But I am convinced that we ought to ensure that the Parliament should have an active and positive supervision over the law-making of the country.  I shall put it to the Minister in a concrete way.  Let me mention the Gas Company.  The Gas Company is acting under Parliamentary sanction, under statutory provisions made for its operation. I have an idea that some of those provisions should be altered, but this section would read in effect as affecting the Gas Company as follows: &ldquo;Where it appears to the Minister that the Act relating to the Gas Company (giving them powers under which they are acting) contains provisions which are inconsistent with or are rendered unnecessary by or adequately replaced by provisions made by or under this Act, the Minister may by order declare that such provisions shall not apply.&rdquo;  That is possibly a nonsensical comparison, because the Gas Company may not have any of the powers or provisions that are affected by this Bill.  I do not know what the powers of the Gas Company are.  I do not know what the powers of the Port and Docks Board are or of any other institution which is working under statute, but we have taken over as part of the law of the State these statutes, and if they are to be altered they should be altered by Parliament and not by the Minister.</P>
    <P>That is the whole case.  In so far as the Minister seeks to change private, local or personal Acts he should certainly get the positive approval of the Oireachtas.  I have made this resolution apply to the local, personal or private Acts rather than to general Acts.  I am not sure that I am wise in doing so.  I can see reason for being more moderate than Senator Comyn would be but I would ask the House to approve of the principle of the amendment and, if it is thought desirable, to amend the provisions of the amendment in such a way as I have indicated, in the direction of the clause of the <Col N="1474" /> English Local Government Act of 1929.  That can be done on the Report Stage and it would meet the only objection which the Minister has submitted to the House.</P>

      <P>The feeling of the House is that these matters should be dealt with by Resolution of the Houses and not by being laid on the Table.  It must be quite evident to <Col N="1475" /> the Minister that that is the feeling. Having come to this stage of the Bill, we do not want to carry a resolution against the wishes of the Minister. Knowing the feeling, I think the Minister should look into the matter and see whether these orders which have to be made cannot be made in such a way that they will be submitted by resolution to the House. We passed this Bill through Committee in two days.  That is a fair sample of how we can do our business, and if the orders are of the nature that the Minister referred to, the matter can be arranged by agreement practically.  There may be only one order about which there may be discussion, but if everybody knew that all orders would be brought before the House, it would give a greater feeling of security. That is not the case under the Bill in its present form.  Before the Report Stage I would suggest to the Minister that he should look into the matter to see if he could not meet the wishes of the House by making a proposal which the House will accept.  Arrangements could be made for meetings of the House so that they could be passed in a reasonable time.  It is only a matter of arrangement. It may cause a little delay, but I do not think it will be very great if the wishes of the House are met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly consider this matter between this and the Report Stage if the Seanad will hold over the amendment in the meantime.  This is a matter that must be dealt with piecemeal.  The number of things that have to be dealt with range, say, from penalties for chimneys going on fire, to regulations that have to be attended to regarding drains and overhead wires, as well as powers of interference with dividing walls where dangerous structures exist.  While that work is work for the head of the Department affecting the borough council on the one side, and the city council on the other side, I feel that if I have, after this Dublin Bill, to come before the Oireachtas with a <Col N="1476" /> whole new code on say public health, sanitary and other matters, I shrink from what it means to me, and to the Department, because what it involves is taking in all the improvements in general public health matters made by means of Private Bills on behalf of the City Council of Dublin and the six other urban district councils.  If an order has to be argued and a resolution passed, say after 3 months, that seems an unnecessary and a laborious way of doing business.  With the system offered the order will be issued in a way that seems reasonable after the necessary examination and will then be put into operation.  The situation is left perfectly clear, so that the Dáil after 21 sitting days, and the Seanad after 21 sitting days, will see if there is anything objectionable in the order.  It seems to me that a very great amount of labour is going to be put unnecessarily on the Minister, because it will mean that he will have to watch every detail of the adaptation, which is really a Departmental business, particularly when dealing with an elected public body, and such as the Council or the Borough might reasonably be left to examine in detail.  The matter might be left between the Department and the Council involved.  This proposal is going to involve the Minister. Senator Johnson's conception is going to involve a great amount of work on the Seanad, and to involve going over the whole gamut of the public health services, road control, and various matters in connection with local government, in respect of the City of Dublin and of the County Borough.</P>

      <P>I submit that as you allow for the fixing of certain shop hours for local authorities you should allow for the framing of regulations inside particular limits. Inside those limits you will allow experts of the Local Government Department and the City Council to deal with details affecting an area where conditions are fully known. <Col N="1477" /> This is not a question of the Minister making an order, but of the Minister making an order after full examination of the general and local Acts affecting the area in which there is an elected local government body.  I think it is very different to say that the Minister is taking an Act of Parliament, whether public or private, and changing it.  We have to operate within the limits of this particular Bill, and to operate with the two Councils involved.  While I will have the matter more fully considered between this and the Report Stage, I rather shrink from the amount of detailed work asked for by the amendment.</P>

These are Acts which, I think, the House is not anxious should be interfered with without Parliamentary sanction.  Surely it would be quite easy to differentiate between the two, allowing the Minister full power with regard to administration and executive Acts, but in things that impinge on existing Acts of Parliament they should be brought up and determined by Resolution of the House.</P>

      <P>Let us take a case like this: Rathmines and Rathgar Urban District Council got an Act passed in 1902.  Section 32 reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Council may require <Col N="1478" /> the owner of any house within the district having a supply of water for domestic purposes to abolish private cess pits or privies combined with ashpits or pail closets, and to provide instead water closets or such other latrine accommodation and refuse receptacles as the Council may approve of.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any person who after the expiry of three months from the date of his having been served with written notice to make such alterations, neglects or refuses to carry it into effect shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding £5 and to a daily penalty not exceeding 40/.</P>
    <P>Rathmines got that passed for itself. It is an Act of Parliament, and there may be a similar Act of Parliament as regards Dublin.  It says the penalty shall not exceed £10.  It has to be decided whether the fine has to be £5 or £10 for the whole City.</P>

We all know that the Minister has to take a lead on these matters from his officials.  He has to be briefed and advised by them. The responsibility of the Minister is there equally whether the order is made by the Department or by Resolution. I can see no extra work involved except that in piloting the Resolutions through both Houses. After all they will mainly be formal, non-controversial matters that will be dealt with, and there will be no more work and no more debate about them than we had about a number of resolutions we had from Geneva and that we debated recently. What was proposed by the amendment is a precaution lest there should be the danger of legislation by order.</P>

      <P>Before passing from the Second Schedule, I would like if the Minister would give some explanation as to the principle underlying the drafting of the boundary lines. Looking at the map, I find that in the Cabra district the new boundary runs through farm lands and between fields of a single holding, while within a very few yards there is a townland division.  On the outside of the city there are considerable buildings, convent buildings, and so on.  I do not know whether there is any connection between those buildings and the decision to leave them outside the City or not. In two or three places on the map there seems to be an entirely artificial new boundary drawn, and it requires an explanation which I hope the Minister will give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The boundary was very carefully examined by our engineering officer in conjunction with the City authorities.  With regard to the position in Cabra where a townland is divided, we desired to avoid a division of the townland, because of the difficulty created by persons in respect of leases and titles.  Where we divided the townland in Cabra, I think it will be found that part of the townland is left outside because of its general configuration.  It would not be built on for a considerable time, and if built on would involve considerable difficulties in the matter of drainage.  It cannot be drained into the ordinary drainage system of the city, as the slope is in the opposite direction. Our engineering people came to the conclusion that where the townland is divided and part left out, it is left out because it was considered after the fullest possible consideration that it could not be built on.</P>

I had an interview with a deputation from the county council concerning certain matters, and it was arising out of that interview I discussed with them the inclusion of the corridor between the City and Howth, so that the county council had every opportunity of making representation to us in regard to the matter of the boundary.  I have had representations from the county council in respect of the rating on certain of the added rural areas that have been acceded to.  Outside of that I got no representations with regard to the boundary.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That, in view of the present excessive rate of interest charged by the Irish Banking Companies on loans and overdrafts, the Seanad requests the Executive Council to take such steps as may be necessary to control such rate of interest.&rdquo;  (Senator Connolly).</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>As the oldest member of the banking community, I think, in this House, it seems incumbent upon me to make a few remarks on Senator Connolly's resolution. In doing so I shall try to take as my text the Senator's speech and deal with it, bit by bit, as he made his statement.  I think I had better deal with the resolution itself which speaks of &ldquo;the present excessive rate of interest&rdquo; and so on because I think the Senator in his speech did not pay a great deal of attention to his text.  He dealt with a very large range of subjects, completely outside his resolution, and, so I think, <Col N="1483" /> perhaps, it would be better if I followed him on the lines of his speech. There were some things in it I must say that I do not understand.  I tried to understand them.  He says in his speech that &ldquo;there is a very considerable discrepancy between the rate of interest charged by the banks, at the moment, and the present value of money not only in this country but all over the world.&rdquo;  I have been trying to know what that means and I cannot.</P>
      <P>The present value of money all over the world?  The man who can describe that to me is a wonderfully intelligent person.  I cannot understand it myself.  Perhaps the Senator will be able to explain.  Then he went on to ask, &ldquo;What is the accepted bankers' theory, as regards the value of money in this country, compared with the ordinary standard is completely ignored in the present situation.&rdquo;  I cannot attempt to deal with a sentence like that.  &ldquo;The value of money in this country compared with the ordinary standard&rdquo;&mdash;what does that mean?  What is the standard?  Is it the rate at which the Free State borrows money?  Is it the standard at which the Free State can do its bills or the British Government can do its bills, or is the standard rate the rate that we can get on deposit?  Is it the rate charged by bankers to Governments? I admit that this matter would require such an amount of explanation that I cannot attempt to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come down, then, to more practical matters, and what I want to point out is that at the moment there is a difference of 4 per cent. on the average as between the deposit rate and the overdraft rate.  The same thing goes on in Great Britain as here.  There is one thing that I think the Senator ought surely to have looked at in dealing with this matter.  He talks of the English bank rate.  He means, I suppose, by that the London rate.  They are two totally different things.  When you come to discuss the rate charged upon loans, and you want to compare the Irish bank rate and the <Col N="1484" /> English bank rate, it is not the Bank of England rate you talk about, but the London bank rate on loans and deposits, so that when the Senator talks of the English bank rate as showing a difference of 4 per cent. with our rate he means the London bank rate.  That is so.  The London bank rate, at the present moment, is 1 per cent. on deposits, and their minimum lending rate is 5 per cent. The Irish bank deposit rate is 1½ per cent., and the ordinary lending rate, as compared with 5 per cent., which is the London rate, is 5½ per cent. The difference between the two rates, that is, as regards the ordinary English banks and the Irish banks, is the same when the Senator talks in these kind of general terms.</P>
    <P>At the present moment the Irish bank rate is 5½ per cent.  That is the ordinary rate we charge on overdrafts, as I said.  But the Irish bank rate that the Senator talks about, as compared with these other rates is 4 per cent.  If the Senator looks this up on any of the cards he will find that out.  Again he says, &ldquo;we find to-day that the Irish bank rate is 2½ per cent. above the English bank rate.&rdquo;  It is not 2½ per cent. above the rate of the London banks.  There the Senator is comparing two totally different things.  When we come to talk of the Bank of England rate anyone who studies banking in this country must know that the business to which that rate applies does not exist in this country at all.  The class of people who deal with the Bank of England and make use of that rate are people who have securities in the nature of bills and other things that can be cashed at any moment. These bills, which have to be met to the hour, are for huge sums, and people only come to the Bank of England, which is a central bank, when there is a strain of money and the other London banks are not lending money enough to meet that.  They come to the Bank of England and they produce a class of security which is of such a nature that it has always to be met to the hour and the minute, and the amounts dealt with are enormous.  Such business does <Col N="1485" /> not at all exist in this country.  When we talk of the Bank of England rate and compare it with our rate we are only confusing the issue altogether.</P>
    <P>There is another point the Senator seemed not to recognise.  He did not seem to realise that loans, overdrafts and those kind of advances must be dealt with in a totally different way to bills which are certain to be met or loans of a certain definite type to be paid on a certain date.  Take, for instance, our own Government.  They have been very fortunate, and the Senator himself referred in his speech to our Finance Minister having done an excellent piece of business.  We agree with him.  But to-day the Free State is paying nearly 5 per cent. on this loan while the British Government to-day cannot get any money on long loan for less than 5 per cent.  But the British Government can get money on Treasury bills for three months at 2? per cent. or 2¼ per cent., because there is a business necessity for these kind of things in Great Britain. To say that we are robbing the public here because we charge 5½ per cent., when our own Government can only get a loan for any length of time at about the same rate or about 1/2 per cent. less, is begging the question.</P>
    <P>Again the Senator uses words that I do not know whether he really meant or not.  He talks of the stranglehold of the banks on industry and production.  What sort of stranglehold have the banks got? The bankers have in their hands, from the public in this country, a great many millions of money which they are liable to repay at a given instant.  During the first month of the deposit there is an understanding that the money put in is to be left for that month.  That is the only condition.  After that there is supposed to be given a week's notice of withdrawal.  But as a matter of fact the client of an Irish bank knows perfectly well that if he needs money he has on deposit he has only to walk into the bank and say so; so that the banks of Ireland have to keep a vast amount of money through <Col N="1486" /> which they do their business, and which comes from people who have money to spare; it is the management of this money which is entrusted to the banks and that is what they work on.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the capital and the reserves of the Irish banks.  The whole of the capital, and the whole of the reserves, of all the banks in Ireland, compared with the millions deposited by the public, is infinitesimal.  If we were to carry on entirely upon our own capital and resources, and that that was all we had to manage, we would be out of business very soon.  The Senator says we have eight and three-quarter millions of capital in the bank and that we have got something like 125 per cent. of a reserve.  I think that is why our depositors, and those who leave their money with us, feel so safe about it.  Would it be at all likely that we would be entrusted with the amount of money we have if we had not put by these huge reserves?</P>
    <P>I have been very long in banking and I can remember a time quite well when the Irish bankers distributed their reserves.  I was young in those days and I did not see a terrible lot of harm in doing it, but, sundry matters connected with the policy of the bank, and other things, drew the attention of the banking world, generally, to the necessity for those very large reserves and the banks, for many years now, have altered that old policy. They do not divide up now.  They doubled their reserves and the banks can stand shocks now which in my young days they could not stand. People who think that we could do our business on the capital of the banks can be assured that we could not do so.  What we depend upon to do business with is the cash deposits of our customers.  There is no stranglehold in that.  The public give us the money and we distribute it to those who need money.  We pay a certain percentage to the public who give us that money, but we have nothing to do with what the public do with their own money.  If <Col N="1487" /> they choose to take their money from us to-morrow there is nothing to prevent them doing so, but they do trust us not to put their money into a lot of mad-cap proposals as regards industry, etc.  They trust the bankers to manage their money, by giving reasonable banking accommodation to the business community with which they deal.</P>
    <P>It is not the business of bankers to supply the capital of a business. That is the business of the public and the people who put their money into enterprise to supply the capital. What the banks' business should be is to supply the extra money needed by business from time to time, as it wants overdrafts to manage its business; but it is not the business of the banks to supply the real capital of the business.  But there are some cases in Ireland which are different and which deal with the farming community largely.  It is an extraordinary thing, and I am sure the Senator will probably say it is very lucky for the banks, that the Irish agricultural customer, as soon as he gets a bit of money, locks it up in the bank because he knows he can get it back whenever he wants it.  He is extremely slow in putting his money into industrial investments. The Senator is right there.  At the present moment there are a series of industrial investments into which everybody would like to see the farmer put his money, such as creameries and co-operative business of that kind.  But it came out very largely before us at the Banking Commission that it is extremely hard to get the farmer to invest in these enterprises; that the most they would do would be take up half-crown shares, and that it takes years to get them to invest more money.</P>
    <P>After a lot of arrangements made by the Department of Agriculture with regard to the new creameries to which the farmers were sending their milk, the trouble has been that capital cannot be got out of the farmers themselves.  Arrangements are made by which they pay annual instalments, and the banks supply <Col N="1488" /> capital in this.  But this is a national matter.  The banks consider that this is the farmers' money, and that it is a safe and sound proceeding to invest it so.  That is an exception to the general rule of banking where it is considered not safe for banks to lend to business concerns the capital upon which they work.  It may be sometimes done, but such things are not done generally, and it is not ordinary banking.  Why should the Senator talk of the stranglehold of the banks, and how could such a thing possibly exist?  We have nothing to say to the holding of that money; we have no rights over it.  If people in the country themselves want to put money into any of these industries, they have nothing to do but to go to the bank and take their money out and put it into the capital of a business if they want to promote it.  It is quite a praiseworthy matter that businesses that require promotion should get people to put their money into them.  We are the guardians and the trustees of the money the people give us.  There are safe methods of banking and unsafe methods of banking, but, so far as I know, the Irish banks have had regard to the necessities of their depositors to such an extent that they will not indulge in unsafe banking.</P>
    <P>The Senator quoted from a statement signed by Mr. McElligott, the present secretary to the Department of Finance, in the Minority Report which he made at the time of the Banking Commission.  I am sure Mr. McElligott will feel himself very highly honoured at having some statements he made at the time selected from his report by Senator Connolly. I am certain when Mr. McElligott wrote that report he had no idea it was going to be made use of for a statement which subsequently came into the Senator's speech, that it is time that the system under which our banks are administered was ended.  The main gist of Senator Connolly's remarks was based on Mr. McElligott's statement, and I doubt when writing his report Mr. McElligott had any idea that such use could be made of it, as, I am sure, it would be a matter of considerable <Col N="1489" /> astonishment to him to hear that such use was made of it.  I see that Mr. McElligott has dropped into much the same mistake as the Senator himself did in his own quotation. He has quoted the deposit rate here and gave 5 per cent. as the Bank of England rate.  There, I think, he referred to the English bank rate, which was at that time 6 per cent., and the margin was 3 per cent.  I think if the Senator will look into that he will find it is so.</P>
    <P>There is one thing we must remember. It is not easy to take a monthly state of affairs, as regards rates, and to base on that an argument for the establishment of laws regarding banks.  That is what the Senator has sought to do.  In long periods bankers may make more money because of the rates than at others.  Sometimes the deposit rate is high and the lending rate low. The margin of profit varies.  You will see from the speeches of the chairmen of the banks that it has been bad, or good, for the banks according to the rate prevailing.  I could not deal here with what makes these rates.  It is one of the most interesting studies in the world, and it has become infinitely more interesting in the last few years since the war.</P>
    <P>The Senator seems to think that the bankers of the world are a curse to the world.  I would like him to turn to some of the things that have been done by modern banks in restoring the credit of the smaller and the newer States in Europe.  There is a combination on the part of the bankers of the world now to help the impoverished States.  It is largely being engineered by Mr. Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England, and he has secured the assistance of banks in all countries, and they have lent money to help impoverished and new States in a way that has completely resuscitated and put these new States into good business.  It is completely to the methods of banking that that is due, and I do not think it could be classed as a stranglehold upon the people. That kind of thing would not be possible at all in a small country <Col N="1490" /> such as this.  Banking in this country is totally different to what it is in America.  I wonder did the Senator, in his attacks upon the banks, notice at all what the Banking Commission said about the banking system in the Free State?  At the Banking Commission we had as chairman Mr. Parker Willis&mdash;an American and a great believer in the federal reserve system of the United States of America.  When he first sat down with us he thoroughly believed he could turn the banking system of this country into something such as the federal reserve system of the United States of America.  He soon found out it was impossible, and I think his final words were: &ldquo;You should try now and get State bills going which you can rediscount by the establishment of a federal reserve system.&rdquo;  I wonder what our farmers would think if they saw their bills rediscounted and someone was to come down upon them for the whole amount.  The whole system of federal reserve banking is wholly different.  I think I had better not say whether it is straight or safe.  It is under that system that we have seen the terrible catastrophes which we have witnessed in America.</P>
    <P>Although the Senator referred to the Hatry collapse, surely he does not mean to say that the Irish banks did anything that would induce their customers to go into that.  Whether any money was lost by private people or not in that connection I do not know.  There must have been some Irish money lost in that transaction, but compared with the losses in Great Britain it was very small. It was outside ordinary banking business.</P>
    <P>It was robbery and swindling of a most accomplished description, and, that by it many people were taken in, I have no doubt, but what that has to do with the Irish state of affairs, as I said before, I do not know.</P>
    <P>Looking at what the Banking Commission thought about our banking system here, I would refer the Senator to a report which was signed by Mr. McElligott himself.  It is a <Col N="1491" /> queer thing that I did not sign it myself, but the reason that I did not sign it was that I presented another minority report dealing with the currency problem because I differed from the Commission on sundry points, but that is neither here nor there.  Mr. McElligott signed this report.  It is the report of the Currency Commission which sat in 1926, and it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Saorstát is provided with a sound, well-maintained system of commercial banking which has been free from the failures that have of late years been common in other countries.  There can be no doubt that the public at large possess a high degree of confidence in it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That report was signed by H. Parker-Willis, Chairman; J.J. McElligott, C.A.B. Campion, who was an Australian; Mr. Lionel Smith-Gordon, and three bankers&mdash; Mr. Lillis, Mr. Galloway, from Northern Ireland, and Mr. O'Connell. Then again if you take the second report you will see some other references as to what they thought about the thing.  I would direct the Senator's attention to this matter, because he apparently would rush into legislation in regard to our banking system without the consideration which those engaged in the business seem to think necessary.  Here is what they say (the Saorstát):&mdash;&ldquo;With a population of 3,000,000 persons or less and with an economic system predominantly agricultural while its local financial market has been but slightly developed, it is certainly not in a position to attempt anything of an experimental nature in money or banking, or to undertake the establishment of a monetary base which would set it quite apart from the two countries with which it is economically most closely allied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It says again: &ldquo;Nevertheless, in spite of these inevitable variations, the price level of the Saorstát is not far from that of the English market and parallels the latter with an unusual degree of closeness; in fact <Col N="1492" /> it could hardly do otherwise when it is remembered that the prices of many Irish staples are practically made in the English market, while the prices of English commodities sold in Ireland are, of course, based upon what must be paid for the goods when they are purchased from their English manufacturers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Senator was trying to show that we should be separate altogether. With our markets such as they are with Great Britain that would be perfectly impossible.  We are bound by our trade conditions.</P>
    <P>Here is another quotation&mdash;anyone can get the report&mdash;I am only now quoting what applies to the speech that we are discussing:&mdash;&ldquo;In these circumstances any change in currency or banking policies that would create a decided separation from or opposition to those of Great Britain should be carefully considered before being adopted, because of the indirect and incidental harm undoubtedly to be expected therefrom as regards immediate incomes of the farmer, the producer and the business man.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the words spoken by the Banking Commission, which had been sitting for months and months, examining all kinds of statements put forward by witnesses, industrial, farming, and every other kind, from all over Ireland.  There are other things that ought to be alluded to, but I think I have quoted sufficient to show what a very sensible Commission, with an American at its head, who was fully imbued at the outset with the idea that we were such old-fashioned fogies, finally adopted.</P>
    <P>The Senator talks about unclaimed bank balances.  I would like to ask him what really put that into his head?  What really does he mean?  Has the Senator any idea of what amount the unclaimed balances would total all over 10 years in the whole United Kingdom?  What do they amount to entirely on the other side of the water?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That's what I would like to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1493" />
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be about £3,000,000.  That is for the whole United Kingdom, and that would be for the full thing now.  Out of that £3,000,000 the Senator will understand that the amount belonging to the Free State is so small that I am quite justified in saying that it is absolutely negligible.  However, getting that money for the State would not be of any great benefit to the State.  But supposing the State got it, whatever sum it may be?  What would have happened if the State got it?  They would have put it into the Exchequer, just the same as the death duty, and it would have disappeared now.  As it is, the money is well invested, and it is of some advantage to the country.  The Senator says that we ought to know what money is credited to depositors. So we do.  The banks tell exactly what amount is due to depositors. The amount of moneys deposited in each bank by the public is given in the accounts of the banks annually.  The Senator can also see in these accounts annually published by the banks the different ways in which this money is applied.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Senator that he study bank balances more closely. Perhaps this is becoming too personal. The Senator makes a point about the segregation of accounts of the banks doing business here.  Mr. McElligott in his report made reference to that, but what Mr. McElligott wanted was to have these accounts segregated for statistical purposes.  At the present moment there is a discussion going on with the Currency Commission as to whether these things will be met.  I think it is quite wrong to try to get people to believe that there is a whole lot of secrecy about banks. The very thing Mr. McElligott is anxious about is to try and see whether he can get the figures of what he wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the other statement of what we do with our money, I think we can give that very freely.  I think the Governor of the Bank of Ireland at one meeting gave some figures as to what money we had employed in <Col N="1494" /> agricultural ways and what money we had employed for other purposes in the development of industry.  The Senator can get all this information out of any of the balance sheets.  All the banks publish their balances on about the same day, and if the Senator would only just study them he would get all the information he wants.  I think it is not right for the Senator to make the sort of statements he has made.  He is not right in his figures either.  I am very sorry that the Senator did not study these balances more fully.  Because if he did he would not have reached the conclusions he has formed.  He talks of customers' accounts being made up every six months.  Well, they are. Then he says we charge compound interest.  It is a commonly accepted principle that at the end of six months the amount of interest accruing to the bank should be paid.  Take the case of a customer who has an overdraft of £30,000.  At the end of six months 5 per cent. or 5½ per cent. is charged on that overdraft.  If he does not pay that interest he has to apply for further permission to have that money added to the amount of his overdraft.  There is nothing wrong with that.  That is the principle of banking acknowledged both by customers and banks.  To charge interest at the end of six months is the practice, and I would say really that it is a very good practice.  It is far easier to pay six months' interest at the end of six months, and a further six months' interest at the end of another six months, than to pay 12 months' interest at the end of the year.  As far as my experience goes it is much better for the banks and for the banks' customers that the interest should be paid every six months.  Then, if the interest is not paid it is added to the debt.</P>
    <P>Really the Senator in making such accusations as this is doing a very strange thing.  He says &ldquo;they (the bankers) have not wakened up to the fact that they are the keystone of the whole economic structure, and that according as they act for the good of the country or against the welfare of the country, the country <Col N="1495" /> will prosper or suffer.&rdquo;  Now to make that accusation against a set of men such as we know the bankers of Ireland to be is not right or proper.  These are a body of men who have merited the statements made about them by the Banking Commission.  It is better leave the matter there.  Then the Senator goes on to say &ldquo;I see no prospect of it being otherwise until our basis of banking and our basis of credit and our whole system of currency is radically changed.&rdquo;  Well, of course, that is the Senator's idea and in that I just want to point out that he is going radically against the quietly formed opinion of the Currency Commission which sat in Ireland only four years ago, and which had quite a strong representation of people not connected with the Free State at all.</P>
    <P>Here again I think the Senator is rather wrong, when he says that &ldquo;in this House it is sufficient for a member of the Fianna Fáil Party to raise an issue here to have it defeated.&rdquo; That is not a fair description of the way we carry on the debates in this House.  We had an excellent exposition of it this afternoon, and my opinion is that every issue which comes up here is debated on its merits and not on Party lines.  The Senator says &ldquo;that the real evil behind all our evils is an economic one and the cause of the economic one is a banking one, the system of banking that we are living under.&rdquo;  That looks a very excellent statement to make, but what facts has the Senator given to show that?  What proofs does he give us to prove that statement?  He tries to say that the rates are not the same as in the English banks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>Then on what grounds does he make the statement? If the statement is not based on that matter of the rates, then I do not know what it is based on.  In the Senator's speech he quoted nothing to show that the troubles in this country are due to the system of banking under which we are living.  There <Col N="1496" /> again the Senator particularly comes up against the opinions of the Currency Commission, a body of men who looked carefully into the matter and sat for weeks inquiring into it.  I would ask the House to regard a statement of that kind as really a thing that does much more harm than good.  I do not see what good can be done by abusing a set of men who do not talk probably very much about what they are doing.  But leaving the bank directors out of the question altogether, I suppose one of the greatest assets that the Free State has are the bank managers distributed throughout the different towns and villages of the whole country.  A more sensible, quite set of men, who have a wide knowledge of the affairs of nearly everybody in their districts, one could not find. They are a body of men who are doing their level best to help the farmers and business people around them.  Anyone who wants to examine the banking problem will find, if he goes round to the different towns in Ireland and sees the bank managers and discusses these problems with them, how much they know and how much they are interested in the affairs of their customers.  Any such person would find out how much is being done by the bank managers who are carrying on the banking system in the different areas around Ireland. Anyone who makes that examination will be satisfied that the statement made by Senator Connolly is one that cannot be proved.  At the end I come to a matter on which I am reluctant to touch.  I refer to a statement made by the Senator and it was the first time that such a statement was made in this House.  In announcing the Party policy Senator Connolly said: &ldquo;I want to say that in so far as this Party is concerned we aim at controlling the system of banking.&rdquo;  That is a pretty fixed statement to make on behalf of what I call the Opposition in the Irish Free State.  We have had it again and again stated that this Party mean to repudiate the payment of land annuities.  On the top of that they are going to destroy the present <Col N="1497" /> banking system in Ireland, and they are going, as a Government, to interfere with the rate of interest charged by the banks in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I wonder did the Senator consider the fact that the rate of interest we pay on deposit depends on the rate we earn on our loan?  If an outside body comes in and destroys the rate that we can get for our bank loan we shall not be able to pay the rate of interest on our deposits which we have been paying.  That is going to hit the whole of the money deposited by investors in banks in the Irish Free State.  I take it he is going to persuade his Party to that policy, or, rather, he must have persuaded his Party before he made that statement. Before making that statement he must have had the consent of his Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suppose any Senator has ever heard me refer to politics per se in this House, but this is pure polities and it is politics of the most dangerous nature that I have ever heard in this House.  If the Senator's Party is going to get into power in this country he is going to make interference with the banks one of the planks in their platform, and what his Party in that event are going to do is to bring about the destruction of our present banking system. In that event the country is going to be faced with a very serious problem.  I do not mind the Senator at all speaking about bank directors and about the banks.  I do not mind what he says about us or what observations he makes about us.  I think he was pleading a special case and I do not mind how hard he hits us. But it is another matter when he makes a proposition in the Seanad and tries to get the Seanad to agree to it, a proposition with which, if they did agree, would mean that we were endorsing the policy of a Party to destroy our banking system, and to get the Executive Council which they would appoint, possibly to fix the rate of interest which the banks would charge on advances and possibly compel them at the same time to pay a certain deposit rate.  There is no reason why, having done one thing, they should not do the other. <Col N="1498" /> They would soon knock all the banks in Ireland out of business if that is their policy.  A political party, through platform polities, is going to secure the economic salvation of this country!  That is the programme that is being offered on the discussion of the Resolution which the Senator brought before the House.</P>
    <P>The Senator says some desperately hard things about us.  He abuses the banks.  We are not the only terrible offenders in the matter. He abuses the banks all over the country.  He says that it all boils down to one point&mdash;&ldquo;that the economic position is due to one cause, the system under which our banks are administered.&rdquo;  He comes then to the most extraordinary statement that I have just read to you as to what is the policy of the Party and he says: &ldquo;It is not a Party matter.&rdquo;  How can he reconcile the two statements&mdash;first of all that &ldquo;in so far as this Party is concerned we aim at controlling the system of banking&rdquo; and then &ldquo;It is not a Party matter&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Again, I was struck at the end of the speech as I was at the beginning by a matter which I was unable to understand.  He concludes by calling the banking system of the country &ldquo;the machine that is diametrically opposed to the interests of this country.&rdquo;  I wonder what justification Senator Connolly has for that statement.  I am sorry that the Senator made that statement because really since he came into this House we have heard a great many sound statements from him.  I was beginning to form in my mind a judgment that he would study this kind of subject intimately and that when he made speeches about it they would show the effect of that study.  I have been getting on to five and forty years at banking and I have been learning, practically every year of my life, something new in regard to the matter.  There is a great deal about the subject that I do not know now.  Yet the Senator gets up in this House and, with the amount of reading which he has disclosed in his speech, he condemns our whole system of banking, and tells us that we <Col N="1499" /> are the cause of the whole financial trouble, and that when he and his Party come into power they will end that state of affairs, and that they will reform us.  I presume he meant what he said.  I was going to read to the Seanad something from an article which appeared in a paper as regards the glut of money and rates charged, but it is hardly worth while referring to it now.</P>
    <P>There is, however, the statement given the other day in the &ldquo;Daily Express&rdquo; in regard to English banking&mdash;that although it is possible for borrowers to get loans at four and a half per cent. the banks as a whole are charging a minimum charge of five and a half per cent.  That is an ordinary banking article appearing in the paper.  It is extraordinary, and I do not think the Senator will understand it as it is very difficult to understand it.  The money market is being choked with easy money, but easy money in London has not proved that industry is getting any direct benefit.  It does not, of course, because the kind of industrial transactions which are carried on in the country do not admit of the ups and downs of the money that is rolling about in the money market.  I remember quite well long ago&mdash; I think it was about the time when the rate for deposits in London was 5/- per cent. and when 10/- per cent. was our rate here in Ireland&mdash;that money was pouring into us at the 10/- per cent. rate because they could not get more than 5/- per cent. in London.  We had then to refuse to take deposits of more than £10,000 from any one who was not a customer of the bank.  Yet on that day all the ordinary banking business of the country was going on. One gentleman came into our bank and offered me a million and asked me what I would give him for it.  I asked him how long he would leave and he said he could not say.  I said: &ldquo;In that case we will take care of your million but we will not give you 5/- per cent. for it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the Senator is completely confusing the issue.  I would like him to study a little more what banking conditions are and what the conditions <Col N="1500" /> are which regulate banking and not to fill himself up with the idea that great prosperity arises from a very low bank rate that will enable people to get money cheaply.  It was a very wise man who once said when the English bank rate was at 6 per cent. &ldquo;never take money from the bank at 6 per cent. unless you can make ten per cent. out of the money.&rdquo;  That is perfectly sound. If you are not sure of being able to employ the bank's money at whatever rate you agree to pay them and make money out of it, then do not go near the bank.  Trade or prosperity is not built up on the one half per cent. or the one per cent. here or there that the people of the country who borrow money pay to their banker for money.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have anything further to add to these remarks.  I have tried to show what I think to be inaccuracies in statements about banking rates, etc., and in confusing the rates which exist between the Bank of England rate and the London Bank rate.  I am sorry that I had to deal with the matter of a big Party policy, but I thought it hardly fair that an announcement of such a policy, from what in this country is a very great Party, should not be taken notice of when such statements are made in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">

      <P>I oppose this motion for the reason that I do not believe in Government interference in any business where it is at all possible to avoid it.  Many comparisons have been made between the English banking system and the Irish banking system.  With all due deference to the statement made by Senator Jameson, I am still of opinion that the English banking client is much better treated than the Irish banking client, and that he has very much greater advantages than the Irish bankers give.  All those things are known to people who have any knowledge of English or Irish banking.  What I wanted to hear from Senator Connolly when he was proposing this very drastic motion was a quotation or an instance of where a Government of any country <Col N="1501" /> in the world outside Russia interferes to fix the rates of interest to be paid on deposits or to be charged for loans.  The British Government does not fix the rates of interest to be charged by the English banks, and I do not think any other Government does either.  Although I disagree with this motion I am not satisfied, and the majority of the people of this country are not satisfied, that the agricultural industry is getting a fair deal from the banks.</P>
      <P>During all the years of depression since the war banks have done nothing to ease the lot of the farmer. There might be some excuse for the banks in those years if they had not been prosperous themselves.  But in those times their rates of interest on loans were 5½ per cent., 6½ per cent. and 7½ per cent.  At the same time they were paying 18 per cent. and 20 per cent. in dividends and they were issuing very glowing reports of the prosperity of the banks.  Those reports were possibly very nice reading for the shareholders of the banks but they were very poor consolation to the distressed farmers who had to pay a very high rate of interest on money which was practically forced on them to buy land during the boom years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy adopted by practically all the banks recently has been a policy of retrenchment or a policy of calling in all the money advanced in the boom years of the war period. To my mind that is a very wrong policy and the manner in which it is being carried out by all the banks is, I believe, very bad for the prosperity of the country or at least very bad for the farming community.  That policy in many instances has had the effect of making rogues of honest men.  Regarding the big point of policy of banking I am not going to discuss it.  I am making a few remarks on this question as I think it affects the farming community.  We would like to see some stability in the rate of interest.  At the present time there is no reason why the Irish banks, having plenty of money of their own as Senator Jameson stated, should not strike out on a policy of their own and not follow the rise and <Col N="1502" /> fall of the English bank rate.  Having said so much I think the Seanad should not encourage a policy of Government interference in banking or in any other business.  That is a policy which the Seanad should reject.</P>

      <P>The Senator's motion was limited in its actual words but I think everybody will agree that as the discussion developed it proved to be far wider than these words indicated and that it was actually revolutionary in its intentions. I am not going to say that all revolutions are bad though generally the word has a sinister effect.  I might say that when not many years ago a certain Party decided to accept an empty formula it was a revolution but it was a good revolution.  The Senator's motion involved in effect the admission that one cannot regulate interest without regulating the whole banking policy.  This motion is quite impracticable.  In effect it suggests that the Government should control the entire banking system of the State.  We have heard the accusation the Senator has made against the whole banking system not only in this country but in Europe.  He comes as a saviour to suffering humanity.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The times are out of joint,</P>
      <P>Oh, cursed spite that ever I was born to set it right.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He by his miraculous touch is going to put all this right merely by sweeping away a structure built up slowly and patiently over many years.  Senator Jameson dealt with the fallacy involved in comparing certain features of the bank rate which are not comparable.  The Senator may take it as a general working principle that the rates on ordinary overdrafts in this country are in many cases less&mdash;certainly in the average not higher&mdash;than those charged on the same class of security in England.  He might further note that in England, however good the security, and however good the connection, an advance cannot be got at the present time at less than the minimum 4 per cent.  In this country to-day, under certain conditions, it <Col N="1503" /> is well known that loans can be got at 3 per cent.  The House has only got to throw back its recollection to the war time to see the total absurdity of regulation by the State in commercial transactions.</P>
    <P>In order not to do great injustice you had to fix the rate so as to enable the less efficient to continue in business.  Senators know the old story, that when the rabbits were regulated they disappeared, because the price fixed was such that it was not a profitable transaction for anyone to go and get rabbits.  Presumably the Senator does not want to regulate interest on collateral loans. He does not want to regulate a lower rate of interest on better class advances. He wants to regulate a higher rate of interest on more speculative advances.  What would be the effect?  Would the banks continue advances at rates which the Senator or the Government would wish to impose?  Obviously business in that direction would be curtailed, and the money would be diverted from local industry to a safer form of investment, to Treasury Bills, Government Stocks, or something safe.  The rate of interest which the Senator wishes to regulate is that on the more speculative advances. Those would not continue unless the interest was adequate to the risk involved.</P>
    <P>After all, this State has an amount of experience in dabbling in banking. I have a recollection that in the early and more hopeful days the National Land Bank was started.  I do not know why the Government did not continue that, but I imagine they found it was exceedingly embarrassing and disappointing to have to deal with the importunities of all kinds of friends who wished for facilities for credit for all kinds of concerns which had a political import, and which did not stand very close business examination, and wisely the Government got rid of that embarrassment.  With that experience I should imagine they would be very unwise to take it up again.  When you come to Government control of credit, look at the <Col N="1504" /> rates charged to-day by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I think I am right in saying that the Agricultural Credit Corporation is working on as close a margin as possible and is charging 6 per cent.  I admit that is on long term loans, but the class of business the Senator wishes to finance would also require long term loans and could not safely be financed as deposits withdrawable on demand.  If the Senator had to sit day after day dealing with the renewal of bills and advances on land he would find that in effect loans from the banks had become long term loans, owing to the indulgence of the banks and patience with agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>That is where I thought Senator Counihan's remarks hard in saying that the banks are not considerate towards agriculture, because he knows that these loans go on year after year with practically very little or no reduction.  In effect they are long term loans, almost the same as loans given by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and very often at a lower rate of interest.  As the Senator who spoke last knows too well, that security is often unmarketable. Day after day there are abortive sales due to political or local sympathies, and it has to be remembered when dealing with that class of security that caution must be exercised.  A generous flow of credit cannot be expected when there are obstacles to such free flow. I admit there is something to be said for regulation in the case of an enterprise which has a distinct monopoly. If you are building on land near a town, where land is very scarce&mdash;although I do not approve of the principle&mdash;you can at least make a case for compulsory acquisition at arbitration prices, for the good of the public.  In the case of an attempt to corner essential foodstuffs, or public utility concerns, there would probably be a case for State regulation on certain conditions.  But no such case at all can be made in the case of credit.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more widely held to-day than money.  Take the question of Savings Certificates.  I think <Col N="1505" /> there are four millions invested, all in small sums.  There is nothing whatever to prevent the general investing public coming together, if they are dissatisfied with the banking system, and deciding that they are going to put the thing right.  I am sure there are many of the Senator's friends, certainly amongst his supporters, more than ample funds to start a bank with as much paid-up capital as the whole of the banks in this country have, some 8½ millions, if they had the necessary confidence. When the Senator talks of the monopoly of the banks he talks about a thing that does not exist.  If he and his friends believe in the iniquities of banking they can be put right. The remedy is in their own hands. They can come along and start a bank and give high advances, they may fertilise industry, and they can give money to erect factories on the security of the factories alone.  Let them start national industries behind tariff barriers and everyone will wish them well.  I can only advise a certain caution in their operations.</P>
    <P>The Senator talked glibly about currency changes.  Senator Jameson has dealt with that.  Can the Senator say what he means by currency changes?  After all, this matter was carefully gone into by experts, and they adopted a system of exchange with England that is working well. If the Senator is going to depart from the gold standard and start some standard of his own, it can be done.  There is nothing to prevent him.  I take it that he does not mean that.  He intends in some way to adopt the gold standard.  He will have to hold gold reserves.  The amount he will have to hold I am not prepared to state, but probably it will be 4 or 5 million, and it will be an unearning asset.  The Senator can calculate what the interest will be on 4 or 5 millions.</P>
    <P>That is the difficulty Australia had.  Australia has developed very much on the lines that the Senator is asking for, and Australia is in this difficulty that high wages are chasing the high cost of living, and that country is unable to meet its balance of trade by exports.  Gold is withdrawn <Col N="1506" /> to meet an adverse exchange. That is the only sound alternative unless the Senator can out of his wisdom evolve something which he will tell us about.  When the Senator says glibly and emphatically that the banks are suspect, what does he mean?  By whom?  I admit that bankers are not popular with people who owe them money for years and when they press for payment.  He should show why the banks are suspect. Why would the country have confidence in them and give them money to take care of if they were suspect?  It would be just as reasonable for me, and perhaps with more justification, to suggest that the Fianna Fáil Party is suspect.  It is certainly suspect as far as credit is concerned, because almost the foremost plank in its policy is to repudiate a debt that was honourably accepted.</P>

      <P>It was an obligation undertaken by their predecessors in office, and undoubtedly in doing that, the Party has prejudiced the credit of this State.  When to this is added a rather wide item for the regulation of the whole banking policy, I think I could go before any impartial audience and submit that the Fianna Fáil Party was suspect. The Senator humorously stated when introducing the motion that he was anxious to hear what the prisoners had to say.  I suggest that the metaphor was unfortunate, because under any fair system of law a man is not condemned until he has been proved guilty.  I ask the House to believe that the Senator has not advanced any convincing proof whatever in support of the charge he made, or in support of the dangerous or revolutionary change he asks the House to endorse.</P>

      <P>As Senator Sir John Keane has said, if Senator Connolly finds something wrong all he has to do is to immediately apply his magic to put it right.  The Minister for Finance is engaged in the Dáil and unable to be here.  On his behalf and on behalf of the Executive Council I want to ask the <Col N="1507" /> Seanad not to apply this simple magic to the situation.  If the Senator or the Seanad think there is anything wrong with the banking situation then they ought to have the matter put right and not simply pass it on to some other people to do it. There are some points that, if the Senator is not simply playing with the Seanad, he ought to develop.  He implies in his motion that the reason for desiring to control banks is that at present they charge an excessive rate of interest.  I think he would find, as Senator Jameson suggested, some difficulty in explaining that to-day the Irish bank rate is 2½ per cent. above the English bank rate. The Senator did not tell us in what respect the Irish bank rates are excessive. The Bank of England rate is 3 per cent. and the Irish bank rates to be charged on certain matters are: Irish trade bills, 4 months or under; English and Scotch trade bills, 4 months or under, with the exception of some London &ldquo;fine&rdquo; trade bills&mdash;4 per cent.  Overdrafts on British or Irish Government Stock, banks' own stock or shares or other marketable securities transferred, or against francs or American dollars&mdash; held by the bank at its absolute disposal&mdash;4 per cent.  Overdrafts on assigned life policies within the surrender value of the policies&mdash;4 per cent. Collateral loans on transferred marketable securities other than British or Irish Government or banks' own stock or shares&mdash;4 per cent.  Collateral loans on British or Irish Government or banks' own stock or shares transferred&mdash;3 per cent.  &ldquo;Fine&rdquo; trade bills domiciled in London&mdash;3½ per cent.  All other bills, overdrawn accounts not included on the list I have given, 5½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator ought to come down to earth and say what rates on these ought to be charged in these cases, and as well say what rates should be charged on deposits and what rates of interest should be paid.  I think the figures quoted by Senator Jameson show, whatever Mr. McElligott had to draw attention to in the quotation given here, that the margin <Col N="1508" /> between the rates given to depositors and the rates charged to borrowers is the same in the Free State as it is in England, that is a difference of 4 per cent., but when we deal with excessive bank rates, or when we are asked to discuss them, we ought to get some information as to the amount of excess that is there so that we can see to what extent there are any grounds for discussing the matter, apart from asking the Executive Council to come in and control matters.  Senator Sir John Keane pointed out that banking is not a monopoly in the way that railway companies, gas companies and other public utility societies are, that persons wishing to start a bank are free to do so, and that persons are not compelled to deal with banks here, and in fact persons have been known to deal with banks outside this country.  If there is a stranglehold on Irish industry here, as is suggested, as a result of the present conditions of affairs, then those who want to help Irish industry might exercise themselves and start a bank.  The matter of the rates is, I think, one the Senator ought to deal with if he wants his argument to be taken seriously</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to follow in any way the speech of Senator Connolly.  It has been dealt with in detail by Senator Jameson. The only reason why I arise is because of a statement made by Senator Counihan, and for which he adduced no proof whatever.  He said he was satisfied that the ordinary borrowers in England obtained much better terms than they did in Ireland.  I confess there was a time when I was under exactly the same impression.  I never had any personal dealings with an English bank, and I am not able to speak first-hand, but I have made careful inquiries into the matter. I have spoken to Senators who do not agree with me politically, and they told me they had accounts in Irish and English banks, and I made inquiries on the other side.  I would like to challenge the statement made by Senator Counihan.  I do not believe that it is true or could <Col N="1509" /> be justified.  I would much like to have proof to the contrary.  I would like to have proof that the contrary is the case.</P>
      <P>As I said before I do not propose to take up the time of the House by going in detail into the matters raised by Senator Connolly.  I was also going to read the rates which have been read by the Minister.  I would like to say as my own definite conviction, after some little experience&mdash;and it is a point of great interest on which there may be difference of opinion&mdash;whatever may be said for the formation of a central bank and a certain State control I am quite satisfied it would not be a gain to the State or to the individual. If you were to have the ordinary banking transactions of a commercial bank carried on under State control or auspices I do not believe it would be a gain or be wise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am strongly of opinion you cannot have State control of the rates, and no State control of the business. That would be impracticable, for if it has control of the rates it will have control of the people who will receive overdrafts&mdash;I mean the conditions&mdash; and that would lead virtually to a State bank.  I think it would be impossible otherwise.  The motion we have before us here is that, because of excessive rates, presumably excessive rates under the present conditions, action should be taken.  I suggest that no proof has been adduced that the rates at present are excessive as compared with those of any of the countries we have to compete with.  I am very sorry Senator Connolly did not expound to us in detail the methods which he has in view, because it is a dangerous thing in the interests of the country to state that you are going to pull down the existing system and give no indication of what you are going to set up in its place.  I would like to hear, privately or otherwise, from Senator Connolly how he proposes to set up a banking system which would cut the country off from the money rates of other countries, and he is right in saying the rates are controlled internationally.  How he can do that without in any way injuring <Col N="1510" /> our external trade I fail to see.  I think the House should vote against the motion, mainly because its premises are not proved, and also because I am opposed to State control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was loathe to take part in this discussion, because I do not think the Senator, in drafting the motion, was wisely advised in regard to the form in which it appears.  I am afraid I have to criticise him for a lack of indication as to how the Executive Council could attempt to control the rate of interest.  I look upon the question in a light somewhat different to any of those who have previously spoken. I do not see how the Executive Council can control the rate of interest of the present banking system.  I realise, as has been stated by one of the prominent members of the Party to which Senator Connolly belongs, that capital will look for and will obtain its price, and if a man has money to lay out through the banks or otherwise, he will find a price where the highest rate of interest can be obtained.  I am not clear as to how the Senator would like the Executive Council to proceed to control the rate of interest charged by the banks.  On the other hand, I am not satisfied with the defence of the banks that has been made this afternoon by Senator Jameson and his colleagues.  One would imagine that it was the right and only proper method of borrowing and lending, that it should be done by these private banking institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that in the circumstances of this country, and I suppose every other country where capital has to be operated and used, and interest charged for the use of it, that that particular kind of transaction cannot, being as it is an absolutely vital and essential feature of the economic life of the country, be left entirely in the hands of individuals who confessedly are primarily interested in the business for the purpose of making profits for those who are shareholders in the business. That was said in this House, that the <Col N="1511" /> business of the banks was to look after the interests of the shareholders in the first place.  There, I think, is the essential fault in the case made on behalf of the banks. This business, which is vital to the progress of the country, should not be run for the sake of the private interests of shareholders, but the supreme consideration in the direction of policy should be the interests of the community, and the private interests of the shareholders should be subordinate.</P>
    <P>As it happens the process of borrowing and lending money&mdash;it happens through some decree of providence, I suppose&mdash;is to allow bank shareholders to pay to themselves very high rate of dividends, and also to put by large sums not belonging to the depositors but to the shareholders by way of reserve.  That may be a decree of providence, but it happens to fit in so nicely with the banking practice of all countries that it is private interest that is supreme in the minds of the banking directors and not public welfare.  Then we had two illustrations, I think of falsity of reasoning.  We had a reference to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the fact that they were charging 6 per cent. interest, but I think I am right in saying they have to pay 5 per cent. on the money they are lending, whereas the money the banks are lending is being borrowed at a very much lower rate of interest than that.  The margin between what the banks pay for money deposited and what the banks get for money lent is very much wider than the margin at which the Agricultural Credit Corporation obtains capital, and the prices at which they lend.  We had the statement of Senator Jameson regarding business capacity.  He quoted quite rightly and opportunely the report of the Banking Commission.  Unfortunately, I had not prepared myself for taking part in this discussion, but I seem to remember certain paragraphs in the report of the Banking Commission in which comments were made on the avidity and the earnestness with which bank managers had <Col N="1512" /> forced upon farmers money for the purpose of buying land at peak prices, with a kind of intimation and assumption that peak prices were going to prevail for ever.  In the expectation that peak prices for commodities would continue with consequent high prices for land, the banks fell over one another to throw money at farmers to buy land at these peak prices.  That is an illustration of the failure of bank directors to understand anything.</P>

At the moment I have only got the Final Report, but I think that in one of the Interim Reports a statement substantially to that effect will be found. That statement indicates that the banks did encourage borrowers to buy land and that they would lend freely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the Interim Reports by me, but I find the following on page 13 of the Final Report:</P>
      <P>Many such farmers purchased land at maximum prices during the post-war expansion period, and not a few of them borrowed heavily in order to make these purchases.  They are thus in many cases indebted to the banks or to other lenders of money for the remainder of the purchase price, which is, in many cases, far in excess of the immediate realisable value of their lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> That merely confirms an earlier statement of a similar kind which is more definite.  Possibly Senator Douglas will be able to confirm me in this, that what is charged against the Land Bank in this respect is equally chargeable against the Joint Stock Banks with a much longer experience. However, that merely points to the fact that the banks are in business as private enterprise bodies and in their transactions are thinking primarily of profits for their shareholders.  I am not decrying that at all, but I am of opinion that unless it can be proved to the public with complete satisfaction that the margin of profit which the banks are making is inevitable, and that in the conduct of their business it is not private interest that predominates but the public interest, then I think a case has been made for a very close and sympathetic inquiry into the possibilities of an alternative system which would inevitably, and as a matter of duty, make the public interest its primary concern and not the private interests of the banks.  My interpretation of this motion is that it must mean a close inquiry as to an alternative system, and not attempt to control the present banking system through the rate of interest, which, I think, is impossible.  With that reservation, I am prepared to support the resolution.</P>

      <P>I should just like to make a few remarks on this resolution which asks that the Government should take steps to control the rate of interest.  I think I am correct in stating that in no country in the world, with the possible exception of Russia, does the Government interfere with the banking system and attempt to control the rate of interest.  If we were to attempt to do anything of the sort here we would simply be ostracising ourselves amongst the civilised peoples of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be admitted that some of the speeches we had on this motion were somewhat fantastic.  In spite of all that has <Col N="1514" /> been said I still remain convinced that the existing system, the method of charging interest, the allowance made on deposits and the difference in the margin all require investigation. Senator Johnson correctly interpreted what I am aiming at when he said that he presumed what I wanted was an inquiry.  The motion suggests that the Government should take such steps as may be necessary to control the rate of interest charged by the Irish banking companies on loans and overdrafts.  I would like to deal in some detail with various statements made in the course of this debate.  It was generally assumed by Senator Jameson, and by some other members of the House, that I seemed to lean towards being perfectly satisfied with the British banking system if it were applied to this country.  I think I made it quite clear in my speech that I had no delusions as regards what prevails under the English banking system, or for that matter under the banking system as at present conducted throughout the world.  Senator Jameson made a great deal of capital, so far as he could, out of my statement that the banks generally throughout the world were suspect: that the system is under suspicion everywhere.  I have no reason for changing my view on that, nor has the Senator given me any reason why I should do so.</P>
      <P>I desire to make it clear that I do not think there is any merit whatever in the English banking system as we know it.  In the course of my speech last week I said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I know it will, and can, be argued that the English bank rate, though advertised at 3 per cent., does not prevail in quite a number of commercial and business transactions on the other side. What I want to point out is that we here have to consider the rates charged by the Irish banks from the Irish point of view.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that is the basis of my argument.  I quoted last week the Minority Report submitted by Mr. McElligott in his capacity as a member of the Banking Commission. <Col N="1515" /> I repeat the question I asked then: is Mr. McElligott satisfied, or has he got a reasonable explanation, with regard to the query raised in his Minority Report?  Senator Jameson complained about my extreme statement&mdash;at least he seemed to think the statement I made, that the bankers in this country have got a stranglehold on industry and production, was extreme.  I think if the Senator were to read the various economic reports that are published, the analyses of economists generally on the systems of banking as they affect industry to-day, he would agree with me that there is grave cause for suspicion and grave reason to feel that the banking system, however honestly administered it may be, is, as a matter of practical politics, not doing its job in relation to agriculture, industry and to the ordinary things that matter to the people.  Lest the Senator might think me prejudiced in making that statement I would like to read for his information one or two quotations. The first is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the opinion of this Council the time has come for the introduction of a national currency and credit system whereby the volume of currency and credit and the rate of interest would be freed from external influences and regulated more in accordance with our requirements.</P>
    <P>That is one portion of a very important statement that was made last week.  The second portion reads as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we had a national currency based upon the nation's ability to produce goods and backed by real wealth (actual and potential) on demand, we should be as well able to redeem its value in goods as in gold.</P>
    <P>The final paragraph of this statement reads:</P>
    <P>To sum up, under our present régime we are not masters of our own monetary policy and we are needlessly and recklessly allowing grievous handicaps to be placed on the shoulders of our industry <Col N="1516" /> and commerce which would be swept away if we had a national currency administered and organised to meet the requirements of our trade.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These were the opinions expressed at the annual meeting of the Manchester Association of Importers and Exporters held last week.  They show, at least, that there is grave reason to think that the banking system, as administered by these wiseacres of bankers, after all their years of experience, has fallen down and is seriously suspect.  If Senator Jameson desires to investigate this matter further he will find the references I have given in the &ldquo;Manchester Commercial&rdquo; in its issue of Saturday week last.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Banking Commission.  Senator Jameson attempted, quite honestly and fairly, I think&mdash;in fact, I am sure&mdash;to cloak over everything in the way of economic financial evil in this country by reference to the Banking Commission.  When we turn to the Report of the Banking Commission what do we find?  That the Banking Commission was constituted of people connected almost entirely with banking.  With the exception of the representative of the Department of Finance, those who constituted that Commission were all bankers.  I suggest that it is quite unfair and unjust to assume that bankers are likely to give an unbiassed judgment against themselves. I submit that there is nothing in the Reports of the Banking Commission which attempts, in any way, to get at the root of the economic problems of this country.  This official Report simply covers up the present system of banking as carried on here; it simply whitewashes the bankers in their administration of the banking machine, which accepts the British system that has spread its activities all over the world.  The Report of the Banking Commission does not attempt in any way to investigate or realise what are the economic needs of the people engaged in agriculture and industry in this country.  I suggest, judging <Col N="1517" /> by the intervention of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in this debate to-day, that we are not any nearer to getting an investigation now than we were at the time that Commission reported; that even if the present Ministry did set up a new Board to make an inquiry that we could not expect results different to those produced by the Banking Commission.</P>
    <P>Senator Jameson to-day made a reference to the American gentleman who presided over the Banking Commission. I happen to know a good deal about America.  I have no more use for an American economist at the head of a Banking Commission than I have for a banker from any other country at the head of such a Commission. In saying that I am not questioning the integrity, the goodwill or the disposition of bankers. The problem that we are faced with is this: Are we to go on indefinitely with the existing system of banking and currency when we see all over the world the collapse in economic life that has taken place due to the manipulation of the banking machine?  We know that we cannot live on gold, yet we are working on a gold basis.  We know that America has, perhaps, fifty or sixty per cent. of the gold of the world in her custody, and how is she to-day?  England is committed to a gold basis, and she is due to pay an internal war debt of £360,000,000 per annum on a gold basis, and yet we know that only £90,000,000 of gold are produced per annum.</P>
    <P>People who live in banks all their lives ask, how it is done?  It is done by paper and the manipulating of cheques and the safe average which the banker knows he has through the clearing houses of the banking system.  He knows each day what the average will be and that there is very little to pass from one bank to another when the day's count is done.  I have been told to read and study, but I suggest that some of these wiseacres of bankers should do a little reading and studying.  I do not profess to be dogmatic about this, but we have a banking system which, it is plain to the world and to ordinary <Col N="1518" /> thinking people, is in a state of moral collapse at the present moment in the wealthiest country in the world.  I ask what is wrong?  There is a market, there is any amount of capacity for consumption and there are surely enough of idle people ready to take up productive work.  I suggest that the missing link is to be found in this: that the bankers of the world have the control of credit in the hollow of their hands.  There is one point I would like to emphasise and it is this: that I have accused no banker, or no group of bankers in this country, of any malevolence towards the Irish people. What I do claim is that the system is wrong, that it has, under stress, failed to function properly to meet the economic needs of the community. It is the system that I have indicted, and I have indicted it consistently.</P>
    <P>Senator Jameson dealt with another point, namely, the queries that I put for information.  Mr. McElligott, in his Minority Report, asked for more detailed information and I repeat that more information is required.  It so happens that I have been doing a study of the annual banking reports.  Senator Jameson, apparently, assumes that I do not know that there is such a thing as a bankers' annual balance sheet and report.  I am going to be very specific on this matter.  I want to know what is to the credit of current accounts; what is to the credit of deposit accounts; what is the amount of overdrafts in the case of agriculture; what is the amount of the overdrafts for commercial and manufacturing purposes.  I also want to know what overdrafts are given for investment in foreign securities.  I want to know further what overdrafts have been available for investment in national securities. These are a few details that, I presume, Mr. McElligott asked for in his Minority Report, and I suggest that the bankers' analyses should contain these.  They have not done so. I repeat the statement that I made last week that no man could make a true economic analysis of the returns the bankers give.  Whether that is deliberate or not I do not know, but <Col N="1519" /> it is something that the Department of Finance or the Department of Industry and Commerce should insist upon.</P>
    <P>Senator Jameson also referred to the statement I made with regard to the rate per annum charged by the banks on the basis of making up their clients' books half-yearly.  I pointed out that the rates charged by the banks was on a per annum basis, and that if a man was charged £300 at the end of six months on the basis of a six per cent. rate, that he paid then for the half-year an additional 6 per cent. on the £300.  That has not been contradicted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HonJameson" hpid="Mr. Jameson Mr. Jameson">

      <P>There is no such thing as that.  The rate varies from day to day, and is calculated from day to day.</P>

      <P>Senator Jameson asked whether, if the Fianna Fáil Party came into power, they would control the rate of interest and control the deposit rate.  The policy of Fianna Fáil is to interfere and set the economic machinery of this country right.  I, as a member of that Party, argue, whether rightly or wrongly, that we cannot set the economy of this country right without first starting at the root, which, in my opinion, is the banking business. Therefore, it will be the Fianna Fáil policy, let it be clearly understood, to interfere with the banking system.  I am not going, at very short notice, to allow myself to be baited into saying what they will <Col N="1520" /> do.  We will attempt to apply all the intelligence&mdash;we are not supposed to have any&mdash;that we have to the governmental activities of this country, and will aim at one purpose, namely, that the economic machinery of this country will be set in motion to work for the people of the country. The standards of British and American finance, of Bank of Ireland directors here, or of bank directors anywhere else will, if necessary, be set aside.  We may be accommodating, and will be accommodating to the banks provided they see our point of view as regards the future economy of this country. If they do not, there is legislative machinery which will have to act. That is pretty definite.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane referred to what he called the revolutionary attitude of my last speech.  I am not going to dispute that.  I think that anybody who looks at this country, and we are interested primarily in this country, and sees what wealth has done elsewhere, ought to be able to learn some lessons from it.  We ought to realise that, in so far as we are acting for the welfare of the people, we ought to make ourselves cognisant of the evils that have gone on in really wealthy countries, and if a revolutionary attitude is necessary in finance, then why not?  Many revolutionary things have been done in regard to the standards of living during the past ten years.  Many revolutionary things will, I suppose, take place within the next ten years. We hope for a revolution in finance and in the control of banks.  We hope that any government that is seriously interested in the welfare of its people will realise that it can do nothing under the accepted system; that it will require a revolution in finance and in the banking system to make a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State controlling the banks! That seems to be a terrible thing. That is the bogey that we are all terrified at.  What is the present position? The State at the present time is controlling much more vital things than banking.  I have watched the political evolution in many countries.  I have watched it <Col N="1521" /> at close quarters in the United States.  What is happening here at present is not that the State controls the banks, or that the State intends to control the banks, but that the banks are at present controlling the State.  When we had a bank here that set out with that particular idea it was boycotted by the State itself, though it was its own child.  It was reared during a period when different ideals and different ideas to those held by the people then in power permeated the people of this country.  The Land Bank grew out of that.  It set out to do something that the other banks would not have allowed it to do before.  I need not go into details with regard to that. The Bank of Ireland took over the Land Bank.  It took over not the business of the Land Bank, but bought out, or attempted to buy out, the idea that was behind it.  That idea could not have been bought out but for the neglect of that particular institution by the State itself.  In other words, the State discarded it as if it were an illegitimate child of its own.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson has saved me the necessity of referring to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  As regards the money available for the Agricultural Credit Corporation, of course we have a fair idea of where it comes from.  The Corporation charge 6 per cent. on the money they loan out, and make one per cent. on the transactions.  There is no mystery about that.  Senator Sir John Keane referred to monopolies.  I never suggested for a moment that there was a monopoly amongst the banking institutions in this country. But there is such a thing as an Irish Banks Standing Committee, and the difference between that and a monopoly I do not see, because it works on an agreed basis of operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has intervened in the discussion. I am glad to see the Minister here and to see him interested in the matter.  Mr. McElligott did make a point, and this is really dealing with the only point that I had to speak on as regards what the Minister said, <Col N="1522" /> when he mentioned the discrepancy in the rates of interest charged by the English banks as compared with the Irish banks.  There was a discrepancy of 3½ per cent., and he wanted to know why the rate in this country was one per cent. above the rate paid in England.  That has not been answered.  I would not propose to use the position of the Bank of England in any sense as an argument for my case.  But I felt, and I feel, that when I quoted the Minority Report signed by the chief official of the Department of Finance that my argument had been strengthened.  It put forward something that had not at least a Fianna Fáil bias.  I am content to say that that Minority Report of Mr. McElligott's has not been answered, nor have my charges based on that report been answered.  From what he says I know that Senator Johnson is very anxious for a further and deeper inquiry into the whole problem. I would be very glad if that inquiry took place.  I do not see much hope of it, but I would prefer not to have any inquiry rather than to have an inquiry by a commission of bankers sitting on themselves.</P>
    <P>Now to sum up the whole issue, and give my reasons for bringing this forward&mdash;the position in this country is that we are exporting at present human beings and importing most of the commodities that we require. Various things that we have in our minds as regards economic development and progress can only be possible if the Executive make up their minds that the capital and credit required for this development is made available on reasonable terms.  We in our Party hope that this present Government, or our Party when they come into power, will see and arrange that these economic problems will be tackled, and they can only be tackled, by loosening up credit in such a form as will enable the various works to be carried out.  Remember, in spite of what we have heard to-day, and in spite of what we have been advised to read up by the speakers here, some of the best and most brilliant economists have come round to the <Col N="1523" /> opinion to-day that gold is not what it was.  We have been advised to-day to study economics.  I suggest to those who advised us to read up these matters themselves.  The idea of the gold basis is steadily disappearing amongst intelligent bankers as being a proper basis of currency.</P>

      <P>Credit.  I did not mean to quote Henry Ford as an economist, but I do suggest here that he is a bigger business man than anything we ever had in this country.  He happened at one time to be the victim of an attempt by the bankers' ring in the United States to squeeze him out of business or to insist that he would instal on his board of directors such certain nominees as they themselves would supply.  For once, and I think only for once, Wall Street was beaten, and it was beaten to the ropes by a man who happened to have a marketable commodity and who was able to put it on the market and turn it into cash, thus making enough credit for himself literally to damn the banks, and say to them: <Col N="1524" />&ldquo;You be damned.&rdquo;  That is actually what happened.  That is one outstanding instance of where an individual controlling one huge industry has been able to stand up to the banks.  He summarised the position as regards the wealth and credit of the country (U.S.A.) when he said:</P>
      <P>The wealth of the world neither consists in, nor is adequately represented by, the money in the world.  Gold itself is not a valuable commodity, but it can be so manipulated as the sign of wealth as to give its owners the whip-hand over the credit which producers of real wealth require.</P>
      <P>That is not quoted as an economic argument.  It is quoted as the experience of a plain business man. We have heard a good deal about plain business men in the Seanad.  I suggest that the motion is worthy of support mainly as it is the first step towards getting Government intervention as regards the regulation of banks in this country.  I ask the Seanad to support it because I believe there will be no economic prosperity in the country until the banks are dealt with on a reasonable and intelligent basis.</P>
