      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to suggest to the House and to the Minister that the Second Reading of this Bill should not be taken until after the Recess.  It is a Bill to amend the Currency Act of 1927 in certain rather important phases.  It requires <Col N="1862" /> a great deal of consideration, for the Currency Bill of 1927 was, as some of us will remember when it was going through this House, a very complicated and technical measure. I do not think it would be right to take this Bill now at the fag-end of the Session.  It requires more consideration than it could get now with twelve or thirteen other Bills before us.  There is no particular hurry about this Bill, and I suggest that it stand over until next Session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fair amount of urgency about this Bill. After the Currency Act of 1927 was passed there were funds transferred over to London and invested in securities as a backing for the Currency Notes.  The rates of interest at that time were comparatively high in London.  You are now in a period of very cheap money, and the loss of interest, even for a few months, is a very considerable consideration to this country.  I am not in any way insistent on this matter, but on the mere material point of view, on the money side alone, it is well worth while to consider this Bill now, even though we sit a week or two longer.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I beg to support what Senator Dowdall has said.  This matter of currency is one in which the Seanad is greatly interested.  It is a matter in which all the members of the Oireachtas should be more interested than they are.  But we are getting extremely inquisitive about these matters.  There is a proposal in Section 2 of this Bill for investment <Col N="1863" /> in securities of the Government of the United States of America. That proposal, in my judgment, is a very good one.  I do not think that there is anything in this Bill to which I could offer serious objection, but I think we have not got sufficient information on these currency questions to enable us to deal intelligently with Bills of this description. I have read as carefully as I could the report of the Currency Commission, and I find that a good many of the conclusions arrived at in that Report are not borne out by the arguments contained in the Commission's Report.  I would like to say to the Minister, supposing there is to be an adjournment for the consideration of this measure, that we should have the minutes of evidence that were taken before the Currency Commission.  I have endeavoured to get these minutes of evidence.  I know that other members of the Seanad and members of the Dáil have made the most industrious efforts to procure those minutes of evidence.  They are not printed, but are in typescript.  Those minutes are in the office of the Minister for Finance.  They would be of great value if made available to the members of this House and of the Dáil. I understand that in the course of that Commission some discussions took place and some evidence was given of vital importance to this country.  In my opinion, notwithstanding the findings of that Currency Commission, the amount of currency notes in circulation in this country is at least four or five millions short of what it ought to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Walter Nugent</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator thinks he has irritated me he is making a mistake.  I got up to say what my friend, Senator Brown, has just said, that I do not think anybody could give stronger arguments for the postponement of this Bill than Senator Comyn has given.  Senator Comyn has rightly said that the matter requires a great deal of consideration and we have not got the information about the Bill to-day which would enable us intelligently to discuss it.  Therefore I am supporting what Senator Comyn has said.  I thought at first that the Senator really meant to second Senator Brown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small Bill and it only deals with minor points.  I do not think it is very controversial.  At <Col N="1865" /> the same time, if there are any Senators who want to read up any matter connected with it, I do not want to force the House to deal with it now, and I will give them an opportunity of reading up the matter.  A good deal of the evidence&mdash;indeed, large portions of the evidence&mdash;given before the Currency Commission was confidential.  That is, the banks or the various witnesses made disclosures which they would not have made if the material was to be published. I would not undertake, therefore, that the minutes of evidence would be published.  The personnel of the Commission was selected partly to get people who had a good deal of direct knowledge of currency matters so that they would not be dependent on the evidence to the extent that a Commission normally is.  That is to say, a great deal of the evidence was evidence that would not even appear on the minutes if the minutes had been printed, because this was evidence that was brought out in the discussions between the Commissioners, who were people who had personal knowledge of the various factors themselves.  Therefore there are two objections to the evidence being published&mdash;first, that parts of the evidence could not be published because it was given in confidence, and, in the next place, parts of the evidence could not be published even if the minutes were to be printed, because all the evidence on which the Report was brought in would not appear in the minutes.  The minutes were not a complete picture.  A great deal of the information on which the Commission acted was brought to the Commission, not by witnesses, but by members of the Commission themselves. I could not undertake, therefore, to publish the minutes of evidence. There are various reports and comments made on them, and the Senators who wish to consider the matter could examine the reports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that would be right because it would be a partial disclosure of the evidence, and no disclosure is better than a partial disclosure.  It would be much better not to disclose part of the evidence when the whole is not to be disclosed.  The members of the Commission were known.  People may say that they were prejudiced, but even allowing for prejudice Senators could examine the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">

      <Col N="1867" /> The following recommendation stood in the name of Senator Counihan:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 1.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>Since I put down this recommendation on the Order Paper I had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Minister. He has given me an assurance, which he is to repeat on the Final Stage of the Bill, that he will accept a more modified form of accounts from farmers, something on the lines which are being accepted at the present time from ordinary traders.  In view of that assurance, I do not wish to press the recommendation.</P>
      <P>Recommendation not moved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Before passing from Section 17, I would like to ask the Minister what is the present position that is sought to be amended and what are the restrictions that have to be removed?  The section says that &ldquo;the Minister may from time to time, as and when he thinks fit, invest any moneys for the time being standing to the credit of the Exchequer Account in any bonds, bills, notes, or other securities issued by or on behalf of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and maturing within twelve months from the issue thereof and carrying the direct obligation of the said Government in respect of both principal and interest.&rdquo; Is he debarred to-day from investing money in that way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The present position is that the money must be held in the account in the bank.  We have been generally able to arrange a special rate of interest for money we hold on account in the bank.  It <Col N="1868" /> was thought that there might be occasions when we might get a better rate of interest or earn a better rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister why he should not take wider powers to invest in securities other than British securities?  Why does he not take power to invest in American securities if he thinks they are better, as he is doing in the Currency Bill?  I am not objecting at all to this section, but I think that the Minister should take power to invest in whatever securities he thinks proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>These will be short-term investments.  It is simply proposed that when we issue a loan, or in certain other circumstances when the State is in possession of a large sum in the Exchequer Account, we will be able to invest the money.  The Currency Note Fund Account is on a different footing, as there will be much bigger sums always there. When you are dealing with short-term investments you do not want to invest in American securities, because there is the question of the exchange to be considered, and you do not want to be in a position in which you may be involved in a capital loss.  It is because we think that in short-term securities there will not be any loss involved in the capital position that this proposal is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should deal with it now.  This is where it is proposed to make repayment out of the capital of the Local Loans Fund to the British Fund in respect of local loans outstanding.  The entire sum proposed to be granted here is £1,150,000, and I would ask the Minister to say how much of that sum represents land purchase annuities in respect of the Land Purchase Acts prior to 1891.  How is it that they are not paid under their proper name and why are they returned as a payment to the Local Loans Fund?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the Act under which the advances were <Col N="1870" /> made.  I could not tell the Senator how much represents these land purchase annuities because this £600,000 which has been paid annually in connection with local loans is a compound sum.  That is, it is payable annually for a period of 20 years, and it will then cease, while the various local loan advances which have not been repaid will continue to be repaid here after the end of the 20 years.  I presume a calculation could be made showing what proportion of the £600,000 might be related to land purchase advances and what proportion might be related to other advances, but I have not that at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in reply to a question in the other House stated that the amount of the annuities was approximately about £200,000 a year and that we were paying them under Article V. of the Financial Settlement of 1926. Article V. of that settlement reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Irish Free State Government agrees to discharge their liability outstanding on the 1st April, 1926, in respect of the Local Loans Fund by the payment of an annuity, payable half-yearly, of £600,000 to the Fund for a period of 20 years, payable on the 1st January and the 1st July in each year, the first half-yearly payment being payable on the 1st July, 1926.</P>
      <P>I do not observe that there is any reference in that clause to land purchase annuities and unless the original advances for land purchase under these Acts were made from the Imperial Local Government Department I do not know what connection they have with each other.</P>

      <P>This Bill seeks to give effect to one of the recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission which called attention to the fact that in many parts of the Gaeltacht children have to travel long distances over bleak country in order to attend school and, therefore, were unfit to profit fully by the teaching that was given them.  The Schedule in the Bill does not include the whole Gaeltacht, that is the Gaeltacht as it is generally understood, but only those portions in which the conditions of the people are very bad, and the distances the children have to travel are the greatest.  It has been compiled with the assistance of officers from the Departments of Education, Local Government, Agriculture and ourselves. There is a map hanging in the ante-room which will enable Senators to see the areas that are embraced in the Schedule.  It is always a difficult matter to draw boundaries in fixing areas of this kind.  Any boundary that would be drawn could give rise to honest criticism.  Objection is taken because of certain excluded areas which people think should be included, but I think that in this case it cannot be said that there are areas included that ought to be excluded.  I consider the Schedule has been compiled with very great care and judgment.</P>

The Bill is in effect an extension of the existing Acts that apply to urban areas only, and extends the application of these Acts to those rural areas in the Gaeltacht mentioned in the Schedule.  The provision in the earlier Acts is that half the cost of the food shall be provided by the local authorities. The Bill is permissive, and it requires the good-will of the local authorities to put it into force.  The more confined the area is, and the more obviously poor it is, the more easy it will be to get the local authorities to co-operate.</P>
    <P>In the second place, the provision of meals for children in rural areas has not yet been conceded in other parts of the country, and those who are most friendly to the Gaeltacht will understand that over-stating the case for the Gaeltacht might do more harm than good.  Everyone admits that there are certain exceptional circumstances in the Gaeltacht that require exceptional treatment, but anyone who knows the country will know that many areas in the Gaeltacht are as comfortably off as certain areas in the non-Gaeltacht. The conditions in many portions of what is generally understood as the Gaeltacht are quite as good, and in many cases better, than certain pockets in non-Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>The provision in the earlier Acts, that part of the money spent on food for the children should be got back from the parents, is excluded in this Bill.  That is following up the recommendations of the Gaeltacht Commission, with which I entirely agree.  Of course, it is quite likely in practice that many of the parents will contribute in kind.  Some of the children will bring from home with them bread, butter, milk, and so on, but I am against asking for any money payment for any food that the children may receive.  Meals will be provided by the county council acting through the boards of health, and the boards of health may be assisted by committees, including persons who are not members of the board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1873" /> Clause 7 provides that it will be no part of the duty of teachers to assist in the provision of the meals, but I am quite aware that the teachers themselves are extremely anxious that a Bill of this kind should become law, and, in fact, I believe the teachers will bear the greater part of the burden of the administration of the Bill when it becomes law.  They will, however, do it voluntarily, and I believe they will do it more efficiently for that reason.</P>
    <P>Clause 9 of the Bill limits the contribution from State funds to £10,000.  Assuming that the county boards of health and the county councils and local authorities only pay an equivalent amount&mdash;they must pay an equivalent amount to have it effective at all&mdash;it will provide a cup of hot cocoa or milk with a substantial slice of bread with butter or jam for each child in the school area. That is not an extravagant meal, but I believe it will very materially improve the physical and mental condition of the children who, having left home three and a half or four hours before, have just begun to cease to pay attention to what the teacher is saying, and will help to sustain them for the remainder of the day.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to support this Bill.  I think it will prove of the greatest importance in the country, and, especially, to the people of the Gaeltacht.  I know myself places where children have to walk three miles to school and three miles back again.  That is rather hard upon them.  It is too far, especially as they have to go all that time without food.  There are districts excluded from the operations of this Bill.  I do not know to what extent we can vary this limit of £10,000 which prevents the scheme <Col N="1874" /> being extended to those districts.  I know a district very well myself and its exact position with regard to Irish.  It is registered on the Gaeltacht map as being 80.7 Irish-speaking. I would be sorry to guarantee that fact myself, still it is registered by people who made it their business to find out.  There is a large population of Irish-speaking people there. I wonder could the Minister extend this a little further?  The particular place I am speaking of is very much more Irish-speaking than Arran and many other places.  Arran is only partly Irish-speaking.  When the proper time comes I may move an amendment that one or two of these areas be included.  I congratulate the Minister on not making it obligatory on teachers to do the work, because I feel sure they take an interest in this matter and will do what they can to help it.  In fact, I do not see how it could be done without the aid of the teachers.  You would have to have a special cook and all sorts of difficult things would have to be done.  It would be better for them to do the work, and I feel confident they will do that work in an excellent way.  I support the Bill as strongly as I can.</P>

      <P>No Bill that could come before us should have a fuller measure of support than this.  Is it to be a condition of this Bill that only children of Irish-speaking parents are to benefit under it? Whether children can speak Irish or not, if they are hungry they should be fed.  I think the sooner this Bill is made general all over the country the better.  I have been associated with a society known as the United Irishwomen, which, in my view, never got proper recognition in this country.  It is part of its business to supply meals of cocoa to children.  In many places outside the Gaeltacht it will be found very necessary to extend this Bill.  There are very many such places where the children require meals, and I hope at some time or other the Bill will be extended all over the country.</P>

      <P>In the administration of this Bill when it becomes an Act <Col N="1875" /> I think great care should be taken to let the children know that the bread is not the bread of charity. I looked carefully at the Schedule, and I see that the County Clare is not included at all.  I do not think I shall propose an amendment for its inclusion.  I have a faint recollection of the time when bread was distributed in some of the schools in the west of County Clare&mdash;rather I should say an attempt was made to distribute it&mdash;and I know that the children absolutely refused to take that bread and ate turnips on their way home.  I am only saying this for the assistance of the Minister in his administration of the Gaeltacht. It is not in any sense a hostile suggestion on my part.  It is for his assistance that I give him that information. The great thing is to let these children understand that their fathers are paying for the bread they get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as far as it goes, but I think it does not go very far.  In the Gaeltacht Housing Bill, which is now an Act, the Gaeltacht was defined with the assurance that the Gaeltacht housing provisions were not to apply except to a very small portion of the Gaeltacht. Now we have another definition of the Gaeltacht which is a very much smaller portion still, and I suppose that with every new Act which is intended to apply to the Gaeltacht we will have a new definition of the Gaeltacht.  I suppose the Minister has certain reasons for confining the provisions of this Bill to a very small portion of the country. I would like to have from him a statement as to whether he feels confident that, even in respect to those small portions of the country, the local authorities and other persons who are likely to have influence in the administration of this Act will co-operate.  If the Minister has any confidence in that I think it will be very helpful.  I would like to know, too, if he can tell us approximately the number of children that will be covered by the areas scheduled in the Bill.  It is not clear to me <Col N="1876" /> whether in working the Act the boards of health will be able to select separate schools.</P>
      <P>I can imagine, for instance, one area in which one, two or three schools will be quite willing to administer the Act, while other schools in the same area may not find it practicable to administer the Act. In such an eventuality, will it be possible to appoint special committees in respect of special schools or must the Act be administered in all the schools in a particular area?  If that is not clear, I hope it will be made clear before the Bill becomes law, because I think it would be very undesirable if, owing to unwillingness on the part of certain authorities, teachers and so on, in one school in a district, the neighbouring schools in that district should be deprived of the benefits of the Act.  I agree with Senator Miss Browne in expressing the hope that at some time, not in the distant future, the principle underlying this Bill will be extended to a very much wider area than is covered in the Bill, if not to the whole country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is agreed that the service of providing school meals for children in the poorest areas in the Gaeltacht is one that should be undertaken. The rendering of that service, however, will mean a tax on the poor in those areas to the extent of half the cost of administering a scheme.  I fear that the Minister will not be able to get the ratepayers in these very poor areas to agree to the raising of the rates necessary for the provision of these school meals. Therefore I feel that while the Bill is permissive it will not be put into operation.  It has to be remembered that in parts of the Gaeltacht the rates are very high.  That is the case in Kerry, and in Galway I understand they are 11s. or 12s. in the £.  These poor areas need a measure of this kind most, but I fear that as long as the Bill is permissive the local authorities, with the rates at their present high figure and in view of the poverty of most of the districts concerned, will not put the Act into force at all.  Take the ratepayers as <Col N="1877" /> I know them all over the country. They are not willing to pay the rates if they can get out of doing so.  That is the mentality that will have to be met when dealing with a permissive measure of this kind.  If the local bodies can see any way of reducing the rates they will do so, but they are certainly not going to place any extra burden on the ratepayers for the provision of these school meals, especially in what are some of the poorest areas in the country.  It is a blot on the measure to have it permissive.</P>

      <P>The carrying out of this measure will depend largely on the county boards of health.  The Act, as Senator Wilson has pointed out, will be of a permissive character.

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on having introduced this Bill.  I am glad, too, to see that the Bill has received the support of all Parties in the House. I am not going to offer any criticism on the Bill, because I am convinced that the Minister has cut his coat according to his cloth.  I welcome the admission of the principle in this measure of feeding school children.  Whenever a Government, the present or any other, brings forward a measure proposing to contribute to the feeding of school children all over the country, it will have my support.  The duty of providing for the feeding of school children is one of the most important that could fall upon the taxpayers, inasmuch as action of that kind will fit the children physically to benefit by the instruction given to them in school.  As regards getting the co-operation of the school masters and school mistresses, I am glad that the <Col N="1878" /> voluntary principle has been adopted in this measure.  It is well to see them associated with it, because on their co-operation will depend largely the success of the experiment that is to be tried under this Bill.  In addition to the intellectual benefits that the country will derive from the operation of a scheme such as that contemplated under this Bill, it will, I think, in other ways benefit in the matter of domestic economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot regard myself as an unconditional supporter of the Gaeltacht.  I think that this Bill is an attempt to provide an open-air workhouse on the western seaboard.  One of the reasons why, I think, the children in these areas are in need of food is due, not so much to poverty as to the fact that their parents are of the feckless type.  After the month of November milk is not to be had in most parts of the Gaeltacht.  That is not due to the fact that the ground is so poor that it will not grow turnips, but rather to this: that there is not sufficient done in the matter of the stall-feeding of milch cows.  The fact, at any rate, remains that the children are fed on stewed tea, and the result on their nerves can be seen in the statistics of the different asylums throughout the country, particularly in Ballinasloe Asylum, which provides a mental home for the Gaels.  I think that the Department of Agriculture should make the granting of housing facilities in the Gaeltacht dependent on a certain amount of husbandry being carried out, particularly as regards the stall-feeding of milch cattle.  If that were insisted on suitable means could be available to provide for the support of the people, instead of waiting, as happens at present, for the yearly remittances from their daughters who have sought service in America.  It would remove the sense of dependency which is in the Gaeltacht at present, and which will continue to be a scandal if we are going to raise what is supposed to be the typical original, but peculiarly privileged, class of Irishman, <Col N="1879" /> and not turn him into a sort of inmate of an open-air workhouse by encouraging grants for relief.  That sort of thing is not very complimentary to those who want to foster Gaelic culture by constant endowment, if it is constantly to be needy.</P>
      <P>A certain amount of the want that is to be found in these areas is due to a lack of husbandry.  It is true, of course, that though in these areas there is plenty of space, there is not sufficient nutriment in the soil to support large families.  What happens is: when the people cannot support themselves on barren patches of land they are obliged to emigrate. That is no disgrace to any country such as this, which is not highly industrialised. The superfluous citizens have to emigrate, and the only alternative course to that would be to arrest increase in the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Wilson pointed out that many of the areas dealt with in this Bill are some of the poorest in the country, and that to expect the local bodies to increase the rates so as to provide meals for the school-children was a blot on the measure.  I think that the cause of a lot of the poverty in these areas is largely due to a lack of proper husbandry, particularly in the matter of the stall-feeding of cattle.  It has been found possible in the ease of Denmark, which has worse land but better farmers than Ireland.  There the cows are stall-fed, and there is milk all the year round.  As an example of what might be done by the introduction of a proper method of husbandry, I might refer to an old model farm that at one time was managed by the Department in the West of Ireland.  It was taken over by a private individual who is now carrying on there a thoroughly thriving industry in the raising of fruit, jams and honey.  I think that the housing benefits which the Government are about to give the people in the Gaeltacht should be made conditional on their practising a provident system of farming, particularly in the matter of providing milk.  I think that should be done before you <Col N="1880" /> impose a demoralising tax for free food on the same already highly rated poor districts.  It is asking the people there to live by sucking their thumbs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it would be rather bad policy to wait to pass a Bill of this kind until such time as the farmers of the Gaeltacht became efficient.  There are thousands of children wanting food, and it is our duty to try and provide them with that food by some means.  Senator Wilson struck the key-note as regards the weakness of this measure when he pointed out that it is permissive. I take it that the area of charge under the Bill will be a county-at-large one.  That, of course, is fair and equitable.  I am afraid, however, there will be a disposition on the part of some county councils, especially well-to-do ones, not to strike the rate necessary to give effect to the Bill.  It is a pity in that respect that the measure was not made a compulsory one.  Measuring the amount that will be required from local authorities by the maximum grant that the Exchequer is going to give, the charge that will have to be imposed locally will not be a very big one.  I think that the measure ought to be made a compulsory one.  This Bill is for the Gaeltacht.  I take it, however, that the children of parents who are not Irish-speaking themselves will get the benefit of the Bill. Otherwise the arrangement proposed would be unreasonable and inequitable. As well as I remember, it was pointed out when the Gaeltacht Housing Bill was going through that people who did not speak Irish would not be eligible for grants under it. If that were the case with regard to this Bill there might be a disposition not to provide for children who were needy simply because their parents did not speak Irish.  I hope that is not the intention of the Bill.  If a regulation to that effect were made when the Bill became law it would spoil the whole effect of the Act.  No child who is in need should be neglected on the grounds that its parents were not Irish speakers.</P>

      <P>I can give no guarantee that the local authorities will adopt this measure.  When confining the measure to a small area, I had in mind the hope of getting local authorities to adopt it.  The fact that areas that are obviously in need of a measure of this kind are included in the Schedule offers, I think, a greater chance of getting local authorities to adopt the Bill than would otherwise be the case.  While I cannot give any guarantee that the local authorities will co-operate in putting the Act into force, I am almost certain that they will do so. One of the counties referred to by Senator Wilson is Galway.  I have before me a resolution that was passed by the Galway County Council last December that a measure of this kind should be introduced and made law.  The resolution protests against the action of the Government in adjourning consideration of a Bill to provide meals for school children in the poorer areas of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be.  I think that they knew at the time what the terms of the proposed Bill were going to be.  At any rate, I am satisfied that the county boards of health, acting through the county councils, will co-operate in this matter.  If they do not, then, of course, the Government contribution will return to the Exchequer.  The position thus created would have to be a subject for consideration as to what should be done, whether we should make this compulsory or not.  There is no question of charity in this thing at all, and I do not like the tone of Senator Gogarty's speech.  There is no question at all of trying to create a position in the Gaeltacht of having the people living on doles or home assistance.  The idea is to put the people of the Gaeltacht into a position in which they can help themselves. The policy of my Department <Col N="1882" /> in dealing with the Gaeltacht is so to arrange matters that the people will be enabled to eke out a better existence than they have at present.  There is no intention of merely supplying them with doles and charity and, as far as the meals in the schools are concerned, I am satisfied things can be so administered that there will be no tinge of charity.  Children in every school in the scheduled area can have a meal, but they need not if there is any objection.  The teachers can make it perfectly clear that there is no charity about the matter, that in fact it is a right.  As Senator Miss Browne and other Senators suggested, I would like to see the same right extended to other parts of the country.  However, that is another day's work and the duty of another Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnson asked what would be the numbers affected by the Bill.  The number of schools in the scheduled areas last year was 337 and the average daily attendance 19,032.  Of course the rate will be levied on the county as a whole. It is the county councils that will put the Act into force.  If they find that their obligations will not mean more than £1,000 or £2,000, they will all the more likely adopt it, so that the increase in the rates will be infinitesimal. With regard to the question Senator O'Farrell raised as to whether there would be any differentiation, all the children in any school in the areas will be entitled to meals.  There will be no question whatever as to whether the child's parents are Irish speakers or not. Whether the children are Irish-speaking or not will not enter into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Moore stated that he knew one large Irish-speaking population which had been excluded.  I know other areas that have been excluded. There are areas in Kerry that I would like to see included, if it was only from the point of view that they are in my constituency, but they are not so poor as the areas that are included.  I did not interfere in the inclusion or exclusion of any particular area.  I left that to officials <Col N="1883" /> whose duties bring them into close contact with different parts of the country, such as the inspectors of national schools, local government inspectors and inspectors of my own Department.  I left it to them to draft the schedule.  If an Irish-speaking district is excluded it is because the conditions there are not so bad as in the areas included.  Certain schools in the areas may not choose to avail of the Act at all, but that will not preclude other schools from doing so.</P>
    <P>As far as the Bill is concerned, boards of health will have power to form committees.  What I imagine they will do is this: They will add, in addition to the members of the board of health in the area, persons in particular school districts, so that local persons will be associated with the boards.</P>

      <P>I would ask Senators to look at Section 10.  It deals with the general liability of the Board for rates and provides that this undertaking shall not be treated as a public undertaking, so as to exempt it from rates, that it shall be treated as a commercial enterprise, which indeed it is.  The part of the section which I want to have amended is this: &ldquo;other than Section 96 of the Principal Act.&rdquo; Section 96 of the Principal Act is the most curious section that I have ever seen in any Act of Parliament.  It is the section to the Principal Act, the Act of 1927, which provides that the Shannon works, which are situated in County <Col N="1886" /> Clare, shall be exempt from rates. The Minister has in this Bill declared that the Shannon works are an ordinary commercial undertaking.  In the Act of 1927 by Section 96 he says that the works of this commercial undertaking shall be exempt from rates.  My object is to delete that reference to Section 96 in Section 10 (1).  I would urge upon this House that the Shannon works in County Clare, which are admitted by the Minister to be an ordinary industrial undertaking, shall be liable for rates just as a cobbler's shop in Ennis as an industrial place of business, or as the small farmer's house and farm are liable for rates.</P>
      <P>I want to say that I do not believe that this injustice to County Clare is the invention of the Minister himself, because when he introduced his Bill in 1927 it passed through all stages in the Dáil without any reference to the exemption of rates.  It went through its stages in the Seanad, but on the Report Stage Section 96 was introduced, which provides that the Shannon works shall be exempt from rates.  I think that malicious idea is not the idea of the Minister.  It must have been suggested to him, and it is the most impolitic, the most reactionary, and the most dishonest section that ever appeared in an Act of Parliament.  I ask the House to consider what it is. The Shannon works, just like the gas works in Dublin, according to the ordinary rule of law would be liable for rates.  The erection of the works has caused great expense to the local authorities in County Clare. We have produced figures showing that the actual expense in connection with hospital accommodation and other matters, leaving out of account altogether the wear and tear of roads, has cost the local authority £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have it also that the land taken up in the County Clare, and exempted from rates by reason of the fact that it is now part of the Shannon works, was valued at, I think, £1,000.  There is a loss of rates amounting to £500.  We also know, and this is a figure that is not <Col N="1887" /> fully ascertained yet, that there are certain fishing rights on the Shannon which were rated to County Clare, and which were destroyed at Killaloe, or materially injured and in respect of which County Clare will suffer a loss of £200 or £300. Therefore, we have a loss on rated property of over £1,000.</P>
    <P>We have incurred great expense in relation to the Shannon scheme. We had the right by law that these natural resources of the County Clare, in which works of a big enterprise have been put up, to have these works rated just as you in Dublin have the right to have big enterprises such as the gas works, and works of that kind, rated.  That right has been taken away from us to our loss.  Not alone are the Shannon works exempt, but the farmers and shopkeepers of County Clare are deeply wronged because of the expense they have been put to in consequence of the erection of the Shannon works, and the small farmers, the harassed farmers, of County Clare have had their rates and expenses increased in consequence of these works.  I would like to know what answer the Minister has to that.  Senator Johnson referred to Section 10 and also Section 11.  Section 10 described the Shannon works as being a commercial undertaking, that is not public buildings.  Now what is the meaning of Section 10?  I suggest, and I charge here, that the object of putting in Section 10 is to prevent the County Clare now or hereafter from getting the relief from rates that it would get if the Shannon works were to be regarded as public works. You know that relief is sometimes given in respect of public works, but we are to get no relief from rates on the grounds that the Shannon works are public, national buildings.  We are to get no relief from rates on the ground that they are ordinary commercial industrial buildings.</P>
    <P>The ratepayers of Clare are hit in every way that malice could devise. I do not think this is the malice of the Minister.  I think it is the malice <Col N="1888" /> of more experienced minds.  Here is another consideration.  The Minister in his rating proposals in this Bill says all new works erected for the purpose of electricity supply shall be exempt from rates.  Of course, that is merely rounding off his theory. The place that suffers by that is County Clare.  Then there is this curious provision in the Bill, that all old works, all works acquired, that is, converted stations and things like that, the Minister takes over are to continue to make a contribution to rates, but they will not pay.  Here is the third extraordinary provision in this Bill, revolutionary I might say if it had not a precedent in the Act of 1898, that the buildings taken over are to be subject to a standard payment, which is not either to increase or to diminish.  I know where the Minister's advisers got that standard payment.  They got it from the Act of 1898, which was advantageous to the landlord.  In that Act the rate was standardised at 2/6 in the pound, and the tenant is now obliged to pay 12/6.</P>

      <P>Let the Minister not say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to me, as he said to Deputy Hogan in the Dáil.  We will come to that section later, and I do not want interruptions from the Minister in the course of my speech. That is what the Minister has done. He did it on the very last stage of his Bill in 1927.  He did exempt these premises from rates, to the damage of County Clare.  We have suffered loss to the amount of £700 or £800 a year by what he has done. We have incurred an expenditure to the extent of £1,000, and the local expenses of County Clare will be increased, as I charge and believe, by £3,000 or £4,000 a year in consequence of the erection of these works which will pay no rates.  The Clare farmers will have to pay additional rates.  This is an unheard-of measure. <Col N="1889" /> I challenge the Minister to say where he got the precedent for conduct of this kind.  I have been endeavouring in my own mind to ascertain why it is that County Clare has been selected for this special severity.  I have been asking myself whether it is because the poor ratepayers of Clare, poor now because of continued oppression, have never submitted to a foe, whether it is because the farmers of Clare have been the leaders in this country in the battle for religious equality and national freedom.  Is it because the people of the county of Clare have for the past fourteen years supported Eamon de Valera with steady, unswerving loyalty?  Is that the reason it is selected for the dishonest treatment to which the farmers of Clare have been subjected by the Minister or his advisers?</P>
      <P>I will say this&mdash;perhaps for the day, perhaps for the year, we may have to endure, but we have never been defeated, we have never submitted, and this ridiculous, dishonest provision will not remain long on the statute book of this country.  I do not wish to say anything that would be regarded as injurious to the Shannon scheme or to the national development of this country, but I say that if it is the intention that this injustice to the ratepayers of County Clare is to be continued, it is a bad omen for the Shannon scheme.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  From the beginning the Minister in charge of this Bill was anxious to see that the scheme would succeed.  In the beginning certain measures were taken, but it was afterwards seen that they were not sufficient to make the scheme pay, and on the Fourth Stage of a Bill in this House it occurred to the Minister that he might get another advantage for the Shannon scheme, and he, perhaps having been persuaded by his advisers, introduced this section exempting the Shannon works from rates.  He has tried that in other parts of the country, where claims were made by the Electricity Board to have no rates paid on similar <Col N="1890" /> buildings.  The Minister also gave the right to take over the electricity undertakings in Dublin, Rathmines and elsewhere, without any compensation, and for one of the most extraordinary reasons I have ever heard.  He said the ratepayers of Dublin were robbing the people by putting the proceeds of the charge for electricity to relief of the rates.</P>

      <P>The Minister's mind is very subtle.  That is the way the thing went on.  Now he is going back of that by saying that the electricity scheme is a commercial undertaking, and that in other parts of the country it should be charged for rates.  Why he should exempt poor Clare from that I do not know.  I suppose I could guess his methods, that he will get up and point out the enormous advantage Clare has had in the way of labour for the electricity scheme.  The Minister says that Clare having got all these advantages, they say they will not pay anything.  The fact of the matter is that this big scheme of electricity was provided for the benefit of the whole of Ireland, and not for the benefit of Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact, Dublin gets <Col N="1891" /> greater advantages in the matter of charges for electricity than Clare is getting or than Clare is likely to get.  I do not think that the excuse he will put forward will bear much weight with me, and I hope it will not bear much weight generally in the Seanad.  It is only fair that these buildings and other works that are put up in Clare should be treated in the same way as Dublin is treated in regard to the gas works.</P>

      <P>When Senator Comyn was speaking, I thought it necessary to read the section he was dealing with, and I could not find in that section any reference at all to the rack, the thumb-screw or the stake in the treatment of Clare. Really I cannot see any evidence of malice.  I am rather surprised that the Senator should make such a tremendous onslaught in respect of the very small grievances that Clare is provisionally suffering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is just and reasonable that the Clare County Council should be reimbursed for the loss of the rates which they were unable to gather from the properties which had been taken over by the Shannon scheme.  I do not think that it is just or reasonable that the national station for generating electricity which happens to have been built on the Clare side of the river should be liable to rates to the Clare County Council.  The Minister has, in deference to what he considers to be good policy, endeavoured to make this whole scheme dissociated from direct State control. That is to say it is being run as a kind of private public utility corporation.  I am not going to quarrel with that at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the method that has been adopted for the administration of this great undertaking, we must assert that it is a national scheme and it is for the general public benefit.  That being so, that <Col N="1892" /> part of the scheme which is devoted to the generation of power for the whole country has no special liability to the County Clare in respect of rates.  Though there may be justification for proclaiming the liability of the Board in respect of these other hereditaments touching the transmission scheme of the system, I think there is no justification for any claim on the part of County Clare that the power station at Ardnacrusha is liable to rates in that county.  I think if there is any justification for liability at all in the matter of rates it will have to be divided pro rata over the whole country and not confined to Clare alone.  I think the Senator is entirely too strong for what is just in the claim he is making.  I think there is justification for the assertion that where the county council has been deprived of certain rateable values they should be compensated for that deprivation.  Otherwise I cannot follow the Senator at all.</P>

      <P>I have not the honour to come from the Banner County, but I am going to vote for Senator Comyn's amendment.  On the general principle, in the interests of the common or garden ratepayer I will vote for the amendment.  I have a great objection to any Government being exempted from its liabilities towards local taxation, and I object very much to the extension of that principle.  I think every Government should pay rates for its public buildings and for the buildings that it occupies or for the property that it owns.  In so far as Senator Comyn's amendment is in support of the principle of the interests of the common or garden ratepayer, I certainly object to any extension of the Government's exemption from rates wherever it happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may I would like to reply to some observations which have been made by Senator Johnson. He says he read this Bill to see whether there was any justification, upon his construction of the statute, for the statement I have <Col N="1893" /> made.  If he will read Section 10 (1) (a) he will find this:</P>
      <P>(a) for the purpose of determining the liability of the Board for the payment of any rate leviable by a local authority, the use or occupation by the Board of any hereditament, tenement, or premises otherwise rateable to such rate is not and never was in use or occupation by the State or a Department of State and does not and never did confer the exemptions arising by reason of use or occupation by the State....</P>
      <P>In face of that how can Senator Johnson say that this is a State enterprise or that this is a national enterprise when the Minister is careful to put a section into this Bill to the effect that it is not or never was any such thing?  I ask why has the Minister put that in?  Has he put it in for the purpose of depriving County Clare of the contribution to which Clare would be entitled in case the Shannon works were regarded as public buildings?  The Minister will say to me, &ldquo;No, Clare can get nothing in respect of public buildings; Clare is too disturbed; there are too many barracks there, there is too much already allowed to Clare in respect of the exemptions on public buildings.&rdquo;  He has said it.</P>

      <P>My answer in anticipation of any case he makes here is, &ldquo;Well, the times may improve; we may have fewer police barracks, and we would become entitled in the case of the Shannon buildings becoming public works to some contribution in lieu of rates.&rdquo;  Senator Johnson said with great benignity, &ldquo;Oh, give Clare £400 or £500.&rdquo;  We will not take £400 or £500.  We will have our rights or nothing.  We are entitled to have these buildings rated at their full rateable value, and we say that these works at their full rateable value will bring in £40,000 a year and we claim it.  That is what we claim.  We will not have any little gifts or any little charitable <Col N="1894" /> donations from the benignity of Senator Johnson or even from the hand of the Minister himself.  We must have our rights.</P>

      <P>Certainly we will have our rights or nothing.  It may be possible for the Oireachtas to deprive us of our rights now, but we will persist in our claims and eventually we will get our rights as we have always got them.  There is another matter to which Senator Johnson has referred.  He said, &ldquo;Oh, this is a great national scheme.&rdquo;  Let every scheme be nationalised if this is to be nationalised; let him introduce socialism all over the country; let him nationalise the gas works; let him nationalise everything in the country and let the Minister himself be on tip-top ruling everything. Now the less that is said about nationalisation in relation to the Shannon works, the better, I think, at the present moment.  We have made a claim in the Dáil; we have made a claim in the Seanad that this is a work used for commercial purposes, that under the laws in existence for the past 300 years, as long as rating laws have been in existence, that this is rateable property. We claim that we are entitled to have that property rated, and that we are entitled to be paid in ease of the ratepayers of the County Clare.  I say this confidently that the Minister has no answer to that contention.  He has no answer which anybody who understands the rating law would accept for one moment.</P>

      <P>The Senator says: &ldquo;Let us get the benefit of those laws.&rdquo;  Now as to the matter of loss and gain, what are the facts?  The County Clare loses a hypothetical sum of £1,000 per annum.  To get this amount the Senator singled out the number of people who were treated in the county homes and the damage to the roads. But the contractors remade all the roads round the area of the scheme about which anybody could say that damage was done through the operations of the Shannon scheme.  In addition to that, where we diverted roads we had to build new roads, and in every case in which a new road was built it was built to a greater width with a better surface than the old road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were built according to the desires of the local authorities in the areas concerned. They knew what was ahead of them. They decided it was better to get new roads laid down on a bigger size than the old roads which had been destroyed.  On the question of roads, the County Clare, so far from having suffered anything, has actually gained.  There is then the matter of the people who were injured or fell ill.  Most of the people who were injured went to the Limerick County Home.  The trouble that was being caused in consequence led to a certain agitation there.  On the investigation by the Department of Local Government and Public Health through its medical inspectors, there were final arrangements made whereby the contractors paid what was regarded as the proper sum per day for the maintenance of anybody who was taken to the county home.  I <Col N="1896" /> am not conscious that there is anything outstanding against me or against the contractors by reason of the people who were treated through illness or through accident in the county home.</P>

      <P>If the Senator has not spoken about the patients treated in the county home I shall not deal with that matter.  There is no such bill either for patients or for roads, as the Senator mentioned, and I challenge him to produce the details of such an account.  On the question of the rates Senator Johnson said he could not see anything in this Bill which specifically segregated out the County Clare for ill-treatment. Nowhere in this or in any other Bill dealing with Shannon electricity is it established that County Clare is to suffer special damage or loss except to the extent that that county, in common with every county in the Free State, is not going to benefit by Shannon works becoming liable for rates.  Every county suffers and Clare has not suffered different to the others in this respect.  If there is a transformation station in any county, to the extent that that piece of ground on which it is built was heretofore rated as agricultural land, such land is treated similarly in all parts of the country. Wherever a transformer station is <Col N="1897" /> erected in any county that station is exempted from rates and in that way the whole country suffers as well as Clare.  There is a definite pooling of resources as far as that is concerned.  Three counties might be said to have suffered more than the rest&mdash;Limerick, Clare and Tip perary.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnson is quite right in saying that there is no singling-out of Clare.  What has Clare suffered? The Senator brings forward certain items&mdash;lands which used to be rated and are no longer rated, the land which used to be where the canal now is, and the land that is somewhere about the power house, whatever portion of that is in County Clare.  There is a matter of some £408 lost to Clare County Council by reason of that&mdash;£408 per annum.  The Senator puts in another claim of some hundreds of pounds in respect of losses to fisheries. Again I query these figures.  I want to say in reference to the £200 which was mentioned in the Dáil and which has been put at £400 or £500 here to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The phrase has been used that this was a commercial scheme.  This is one of the <Col N="1899" /> many phrases which people have attempted to put into my mouth. The first time it was stated in this House that I had said it, I denied that I had said it.  What I did say was that it was a scheme run under a system of commercial management; in other words, that I was going to get away from Civil Service control and to get people to run it on business lines.  Everybody's money went into the scheme.  If it had not been for the backing of the scheme by the State as a national scheme, there would have been no scheme.  If we had to wait until Clare developed its resources there would have been no Shannon scheme.</P>

      <P>What I did say was that there was so much Government property in Clare already that if the whole Shannon works were added and were dealt with as Government property, no special exemption being granted, the Clare local authorities would not get one penny piece extra.  That is a statement I make again.  On the ordinary system of rating Government property when the sum derived thereby exceeds a certain point no further rates are paid.  If the whole of the Shannon property were treated as Government property <Col N="1900" /> and if we took away the specific exemption under Section 96, County Clare would not derive one penny extra in payment of rates.</P>
      <P>The reason why this item was introduced so late in the 1927 legislation is that at a late stage in the Seanad a discussion took place on the matter of income tax.  From that we came to realise that if we proceeded on the lines we had intended and handed over the scheme to the Electricity Supply Board the idea of Government property would no longer shield the scheme, though in regard to rates we always intended our construction to be a Government scheme.  It was backed by the credit of the whole people of the State and we felt that a certain exception naturally flowed from that, and in the end we put in a specific exemption.  That applies also to areas which have not been so loyal and true to Eamon de Valera as County Clare.  The malice that is supposed to inspire this proposal seems not to exist even in the Senator's imagination. It does not even exist in his imagination, but he simply brings it forward for the purpose of rhetoric. It is not a sincere belief.</P>

      <P>I stated in the Dáil, and I think it is right, that at some time, but not immediately, the losses which Clare is suffering by the subtraction of the £400, and anything else in the way of fishery losses, should be given back to it.  Senator Comyn may vote against that when we bring it forward as it would be compromising his claim, but I think it should be done.  I do not think it should be done at the moment.  I said here in the Seanad on the Second Reading that I want the scheme left as it was handed over to the Electricity Supply Board&mdash; the Board facing up to a certain expenditure and knowing what it had to meet so as to enable it to apportion the charges for electricity.  I said <Col N="1901" /> that we should leave it so for a year or two until it was fully paying its way.  I do not think, again, that Clare suffers very much in this, because the canal stretch that has been taken for the purpose of the power-house and the power-house itself, under the ordinary local government law and local government policy, apart altogether from the fact of its being an electricity undertaking, would be exempt from the majority of its rates for a period of years.  That is the local government policy at the moment with regard to new buildings, and I simply want that applied here.</P>

      <P>The Senator has not been fully aware of what has been going on all around him.  Senator Comyn wants to delete this exemption under Section 96, but he does not want to delete Sections 10, 11 and 12.  He does not want to disturb this scheme, which has been adopted at the moment as expedient. What would be the situation if Section 10 were amended as Senator Comyn wants it to be and the rest of the Bill left as it is?  Here is the result.  At the moment we are fixing on the Board under Section 11 a payment in perpetuity which amounts to about £50,000.  We are actually fixing a valuation, and if rates remain as they are at present in certain areas, the payments which the Board will have to make will be <Col N="1902" /> round about £50,000 or £60,000.  Take out the exemption granted by Section 96 and a sum of £130,000 will be put on the Board.  Part of that addition will be the £50,000 which is imposed under Section 11.</P>
      <P>If we are going to wipe out the exemption under Section 96, we should scrap Section 11.  We should say to Dublin, &ldquo;You are not going to get the £30,000 that you are at present getting,&rdquo; because if Senator Comyn's idea is right, and the property is to be valued according to the amount of property located in particular counties, and if Clare is going to get this £40,000, Dublin is going to lose some considerable part of its £30,000.  I consider that an outrageous proposition.  Hereafter, when this scheme comes to be rated, it should be rated completely on a new basis, and the only way is to take the scheme, not according to constructional value, but according to the revenue it secures, and divide the rate liability over areas according to the revenue they subscribe&mdash;not according to where the property is situated.  The value arises from the revenue coming in and not from the areas where the property is situated.  That will be putting on the Board a payment of a little more than is put on it at the moment.  I ask the Seanad not to refuse to continue the exemption under Section 96, and so throw £130,000 on the Board, and then pass Section 11, which throws on the Board an additional fifty or sixty thousand pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the end the consumers of electricity are going to pay for it.  Remember, the Board could, if it liked, decide to apportion the amount it must pay in rates against the consumers in the several rating areas. If County Clare was to get three-fifths of its rates they might have to pay so much for its electricity&mdash;that hereafter no industry depending on electricity for its power could be started in the County Clare because of the prices that would have to be charged for it.  The proposition outlined in this amendment is indefensible. I ask the Seanad to abide by <Col N="1903" /> the decision it previously took: to regard this as a national scheme, and continue to hold that it should be exempt from rates.  Senator Sir Thomas Esmonde spoke of the liability of the Government on property. The position with regard to Government property in County Clare is this, that while this is not to a certain extent a Government scheme&mdash; it has been handed over to a Board to operate it&mdash;it is still a national scheme, the idea being that electricity should be made available at cheap rates through this national development.  Government property already brings in so much in rates to County Clare that no addition would be derived from the Shannon works if regarded as Government property. Senator Colonel Moore quoted a famous expression: &ldquo;That it was immoral to derive profits from municipal undertakings.&rdquo; I want to say that is not my phrase.  That phrase was used by the then Town Clerk of Dublin before the Private Bill Committee that considered the Liffey schemes.  I quoted it, and said that it was a great phrase.  I still think it is a great phrase, but it is not my phrase.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section which I am seeking to have deleted provides that for the purposes of the assessment and the levying of any rate leviable by a local authority, the valuation of any hereditament or tenement rateable to such rate and becoming vested in the Board, shall, so long as it continues in the occupation of the Board, be deemed to be liable to certain rates based on the valuation at the time of the taking over.  Sub-section (2) of the section provides that whenever any hereditament or tenement which becomes vested in the Board is taken over, so long as it ceases to be in the occupation of <Col N="1904" /> the Board, the Board shall continue to pay perpetually the rates which are leviable upon that hereditament. I cannot think it is just to the Board that in the case of premises taken over in the course of the undertaking and in the working out of the undertaking, no matter what may happen to those premises, whether they hand them over to some other business concern or whether they become decrepit and entirely unused, rates should continue perpetually to be paid upon them.  I think it is an imposition on the Board and that it is not just. The section is more than generous to the local authority.  I do not think that in any circumstances it can be justified.  I think there ought to be a limit of time&mdash;I do not mind what the limit is, whether it be ten years or twenty years.  This idea of a perpetual annuity on premises which in the ordinary course of events might not have been retained by the old authority or have gone out of use should not be imposed on the Board.</P>
    <P>Let me for the purposes of analogy take this case.  In the course of development we can visualise the possibility that a system of distribution of electricity from house to house might come through the invention of some sort of a transportable battery. It might be much more convenient to householders who are at present using gas.  If that were so, gas undertakings would become of little value.  The analogy would suggest that the organisation, whatever it may be, that is indicated in the production of this new method of electrical power transmission is to be liable for the rates that these gas undertakings had hitherto paid. I think that is unfair.  I cannot understand why the local authority should seek to impose a charge perpetually upon the Electricity Supply Board. I think this ought to be justified before we pass it.  I suggest there should be some limit of time put in sub-section (2), and that this should not be a perpetual charge, irrespective of what class of hereditament it might be or what the possibilities <Col N="1905" /> of any such building would have been if there never had been any Electricity Supply Board.  I would like to hear some justification for this proposal.  Unless the justification is very ample, I think the House should not pass this section as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to say that I would much prefer to see an amendment limiting the obligations of the Board to a period of time rather than have the matter considered on the deletion of the section in this way.  Frankly, this section is a mere expedient.  This section was suggested to us by the Department of Local Government, local authorities, and by other people directly interested.  Under Section 12 the Board is free from liability to rates in regard to new buildings. When they read that section they might say to themselves: &ldquo;We are now being involved in the payment of very heavy rates on, say, the Dublin station.  It would pay us better to depart from these premises altogether and build new premises for ourselves, because in that case the new premises will be free from liability under the next section.&rdquo; In that way they would get out of the particular obligation that we are seeking to put on them.  That is hardly likely to happen&mdash;especially as legislation will have to be introduced within the next three or four years to amend all this, but there is a danger.  While Section 12 remains as it is, perhaps Senator Johnson might consider an amendment to it in some way to prevent the danger that I am alluding to coming about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case was put to us in connection principally with the Dublin and Cork stations.  The Board might say that in comparison to the value they were getting from these stations it would pay them better to close them down and build new premises for the purpose of getting them free from rates.  We do not want that to happen, and it is not likely to happen in the immediate future.  The Senator might wish to put in some limit of time to Section <Col N="1906" /> 11, but I would like to have both sections considered together.  As I explained before, this is an expedient. We want to secure certain local authorities in the matter of rates that they have been in the habit of getting from certain undertakings. At any rate, we want to secure that, before what they have been in the habit of getting is taken from them, certain notice will be given to them before the bringing in of new legislation, so that when preparing their annual budget they will know exactly what they can count upon.  We secure that in this way, that we indicate that the Act will have to be amended in order to get a better adjustment of the conditions as between the electricity consumer, ratepayer and the taxpayer, but this is frankly an expedient.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 13 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.&mdash;The exemptions from rates conferred by Section 96 of the Principal Act and by Section 11 of this Act, and the provisions of Section 12 of this Act, shall continue in force until the 31st day of March, 1932, and shall then cease to be operative.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister when dealing with Senator Johnson's amendment said very frankly and truly that Section 11 is only an expedient, and he hoped it was only a temporary expedient and said he expected some measure would be introduced limiting the time during which it was to operate. I have in this amendment provided <Col N="1907" /> him with the necessary machinery for putting an end to that little expedient of his.  The object of the amendment is to provide that when the Shannon works in Clare become a very prosperous business concern&mdash; a time which the Minister himself assumes will be less than two years&mdash; that they and transformer stations all over the country and the rateable hereditaments connected with the Shannon works shall become rateable. And also anomalies and provisions for permanent payment which Senator Johnson alluded to will come to an end.  I do not want to weary the House by a repetition of the arguments, which the Minister described as rhetoric, which I used on the first occasion when this matter came before the House.  I can assure Senators that my observations were not intended to be in any degree rhetorical; they were addressed to the House from the feeling which I entertain as a ratepayer in the County Clare and which is shared by other ratepayers in the County Clare, that we have not been treated fairly in the matter of the rating of the Shannon works.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that when the scheme comes to full success he hopes to recast the entire rating with regard to the Shannon scheme.  He estimates that the scheme will come to a complete success within two years, and my amendment is to this effect: Why not legislate now and let the people see exactly where they stand?  Let the farmers of the County Clare understand that, although they may be rated now for the upkeep of the roads and for the various county charges that are thrown upon them by reason of the erection of the Shannon works, still that will come to an end at a certain stated time.</P>
    <P>In this amendment I am simply putting in words what I learned to be the hope of the Minister, and what is my own hope, that at the end of two years the Shannon works will be a flourishing commercial undertaking, quite able to pay its own rates and able to relieve the farmers in Clare.  I am claiming on the other amendment for the full rateable <Col N="1908" /> value of those premises, but the Minister said: &ldquo;No.  They will not have that full rateable value; that rateable value will be scattered all over the country.&rdquo; I am willing, and the Clare farmers are willing, that this rateability should be extended, and as far as possible.  We want only what we are entitled to.  But I take this opportunity to tell the Minister that under any fair scheme of rating under the existing law, apart from Section 96, we expect considerable relief and that we deserve that relief.  We are entitled to it and we need it, and need it very badly, in the County Clare.  I do not expect from the Minister any serious opposition to this amendment, because it is, if I may say so myself, lawyer-like. It is in the spirit of the law that when you are passing a Bill you ought to make it provide for the circumstances of the case so far as you can foresee them.  That is all I have attempted to do in this amendment, and I hope the Seanad will accept it.</P>

      <P>It must be a matter of enlightenment to lawyers to hear the Senator describe his amendment as lawyer-like.  He feels that he wants to legislate more or less along the lines that I myself had suggested. What would he get if this amendment were carried?  He gets whatever portion of the Shannon works is located in the County Clare valued and rated according to the present law.  I stated that I did not want that.  One reason why I would not accept the removal of exemption is that I hold that the rating and valuation laws with regard to hydro-electric undertakings should be changed.  If the Shannon is to pay rates it should pay according to the revenue which is derived from the areas from which the revenue comes and not according to the location of the property.  In addition, the Senator wants to have enforced until March, 1932, and then dropped the exemption from rates conferred by Section 11.  The exemption of Section 11 only lasts until 1932, but wherever it imposes rates <Col N="1909" /> it goes on.  That was what the Senator must have had in mind when he said his amendment was lawyer-like. That is what is there: &ldquo;The exemption conferred by Section 11 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>

I do not want that.  It would be quite unfair, and if I bring in legislation it will not be to achieve that situation.  But in addition what does the Senator propose in his amendment?  That the <Col N="1910" /> ordinary law should take its course, and that Dublin ought not to have guaranteed to it £30,000, and other local authorities throughout the country&mdash;Cork and other areas&mdash; ought not to have guaranteed to them what they are now guaranteed under Section 11.  All these places would be deprived of certain things which they are now counting on, and they would have to be given to the County of Clare or a big proportion of them.</P>

But Senator Comyn's idea is that whether they use those buildings or not, under some new system of valuation that is to come into force rates will be struck on them.  The actual effect of the amendment would be that Clare would get, I think, some £50,000, and that sum would have to be subtracted from the rest of the country. I think the whole thing should be left as it is, as it requires a great deal more than simply saying &ldquo;take away these exemptions and let the ordinary law in.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill I pointed out that the rating law, as it applies to hydro-electric undertakings, is quite unfair, and that it may have to be changed; secondly, that the operation of that law in so far as it is based on constructional value and location is wrong, and that the basis of future assessment ought to be the areas from which revenue is derived. The third point is that it will require time to get a better understanding of the Board's position. All these matters will require an amount of legislation.  I ask the Seanad not to agree to this amendment. If the amendment were accepted the Board would have immediately to sit down and prepare its budget for the next couple of years on the basis of what is going to happen in 1932.  In other <Col N="1911" /> words, they would have to look on themselves as liable for £50,000 or £60,000 in Dublin, Cork and other local areas, and the additional money that would be taken away from them if the exemptions under Section 96 were removed.  Obviously they could not make charges now, knowing that two years later they were going to have thrown on them £120,000 in rates, plus the £60,000 that we are putting on them.  They would have to make provision immediately to meet that.  It would be deceiving the public to ask them to pay certain charges now, knowing that in two years they would have to face an additional charge of £120,000. That is a proposition that I say is as hopeless as ever was presented, and I want the Seanad to throw it out.  It may be said that I am not bound to bring in legislation to meet the small injustices that I have more or less admitted Clare is suffering from, in addition to the counties of Limerick and Tipperary with regard to land seized for the purpose of the canal.  I am bound to meet that if my hands are not tied.  But in fact the circumstances do bind me.  I am not going to bind myself as to the date when that legislation will be introduced, but I should say that it will be introduced within three years, and certainly within four years.  I would not like to bind myself to any earlier period than that.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Senator Foran, I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 13, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;in&rdquo; in line 62 to insert the words &ldquo;or at.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 makes provision for compensating certain employees who lose their positions as a result of the closing of the generating station and of its being vested in the Board.  The last line in the section refers to employees employed by the Board in such generating station.  The proposal in the amendment is to cover <Col N="1912" /> a small number of people to which Senator Foran referred on the Second Reading debate.  For instance, the Dublin generating station has five men employed inside as stokers attending the furnaces.  They had four men engaged on the work of unloading steamers and removing the coal to the generating stations. The men inside are covered by the Bill but those outside are not covered because they were not employed in but outside or at the station.  It is true that they were not whole-time permanent employees in the ordinary sense.  They were what might be termed permanent-temporary men, such as one finds in the Civil Service. When the steamers arrive the same four men were always employed, and practically the whole of their time was engaged on the work.  They lose their work as a direct result of the closing down of the Dublin generating station, and they lose it just as much because of the operation of the Shannon scheme as the men who were inside.  This amendment is to ensure that they shall be covered by the Bill.  The number is small as far as compensation is concerned.  I do not know whether anybody would be affected at the Cork station.  I hope the Minister will favourably consider the matter.</P>

It only brings in men employed outside or at the station.</P>

      <P>I have had the four men that Senator Foran's amendment refers to under discussion with the Senator on several occasions. I do not see that this amendment meets their case.  Compensation at the moment applies to certain people engaged in the generating stations.  I do not think the insertion <Col N="1913" /> of these words &ldquo;or at&rdquo; covers the case of the special men that Senator Foran has in mind and it opens the door to others.  I do not know what the words might cover. I have a number of cases under consideration. On the exact details given by Senator Foran I think the men about whom he is concerned have a pretty good chance&mdash;I cannot put it any higher&mdash;of securing compensation. But if they do not secure compensation it will not be because they are ruled out by the absence of the word &ldquo;at.&rdquo; I do not think that putting in the word &ldquo;at&rdquo; would cover their case.  The general condition of the compensation clause is: Are they considered to be in a particular type of employment?  Is their work to be considered a type that ends with the closing down of the generating station?  If so, they will get compensation; if not, they will not get compensation.  I appeal to the Senator not to press the amendment as it will not do these people any good.  If I find that the men were turned down by reason of a rigid definition of the wording of the section I will consider it my duty to come forward with legislation at least to give an opportunity of having this matter argued.  I do not know where this would lead to, and I would prefer if it were dropped. In addition to the details of work, Senator Foran gave me communications from the men concerned, as well as their ages, and I have guaranteed to him that I will put it to the Electricity Supply Board, particularly in the case of the two senior men, that they should find employment for them and recognise that their employment has to a certain extent been diminished by the operations of the Act.  In fact, I will make that case with regard to the four men.  I can make it more vehemently in regard to the two senior men.  I do not think the Senator's amendment will meet the case and it might lead to difficulties.  I ask the Senator to reconsider the matter before pressing the amendment.</P>

      <P>On Section 14 I would like to ask the Minister if he is able to say anything with regard to the items proposed to be dealt with in the last amendment on the Order Paper which was ruled out of order.  This section would cover certain people whose services were dispensed with&mdash;that is to say, in the Dublin tramways generating station. In the case of Cork the tramways company provided the city with electric light and electric power, and the traction portion of the service was really in later years, only a sort of side-line or by-product, and it is reported with a good deal of authority that the electricity contract for Cork City having been taken from them, the company do not intend to continue the tramways there, as a result of which a number of people will be thrown out of employment. I know this is an attempt to widen the scope of the Bill, as far as the provision of compensation is concerned, in order to bring employees of the traction section of the industry within the compensation provision, but it is undoubtedly as a direct result of the operation of the scheme that the Cork tramways will cease.  I understand that representations have been made to the Government through the President, who is the senior representative of Cork City, and I think it was as a result &mdash;at least I was under that impression&mdash;that the amendment of Senator Foran was put down, which has now been ruled out of order.  I would like to know from the Minister what is the position in relation to tramways of that kind.  Can they close down without legislative permission? What is the length of notice that has to be given; what is the earliest date at which they could close, and whether in his opinion <Col N="1915" /> any protection can be included in any legislative order or other act that may be taken that would in any way protect the men who lose their employment as a result of the closing down of the tramway system?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On that I might be permitted to answer Senator O'Farrell?  I have had the position of the employees on the tramways side of the Cork Electricity Company brought under my notice.  I would object very strenuously to any widening of the compensation terms so as to bring in that type of person. I think people engaged in generating or electrical distribution works have a right to be considered.  However, the situation as I understand it in connection with the Cork tramways is this: At the time the agreement was entered into for the purchase of the electricity station representations were made that the tramways should at any rate be carried on for some period to enable the internal transport situation in Cork to be continued, and there was something approaching agreement made.  I am not a party to that transaction and cannot speak with any authority.  I understand something approaching an agreement was come to that the Cork tramways would be carried on for at least one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator raises a point following that, if and when the Cork Tramway Company seek to abandon the tramway undertaking, can they do it by their own act or must they have legislative sanction?  It is very doubtful if they can.  There is great doubt as to what can be done by Order or how they could be permitted to get out of their obligations as an undertaking, and particularly <Col N="1916" /> how they can rid themselves of their obligations with regard to the streets, way-leaves and fixtures.  I think it is more than likely that legislative action would have to be looked for before the abandonment of the tramways could be brought about.  Then would be the time to raise the position of these men to see whether they could be dealt with.  I hope I do not excite too much optimism in these people.  I think that people who come hastily to the decision that a tramway undertaking anywhere, and particularly in the city of Cork, is bound to be closed down are jumping to conclusions.  I think there are developments ahead that will rehabilitate the tramways and that they will be much better than they are at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is hardly relevant to the Bill.  I am sure the Senator's question is prompted by rumours going around that are without foundation and that have been definitely inspired in certain quarters. I have heard of people who are anxious to sell machinery and plant and who would naturally be inclined to discount the Shannon scheme.  These rumours came to me three or four months ago, and then and more recently still I made inquiries into the matter. There is not the slightest truth in any of these rumours.  Certain rumours may have been started because the Board found they could not accede to requests from certain towns and villages which were placed outside the line of development as regards installation, but that did not arise from the fact that there is not current enough, but simply that in these cases there was not an economic proposition because of their situation.  If anybody hears any rumours to the effect that the number <Col N="1917" /> of units we expected from the Shannon development are not forthcoming they should know that these rumours are without the slightest foundation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a complaint in Dublin with reference to housing. Owners of private residential property, a good deal of which is tenement property, are making efforts to get clear possession and are putting out their tenants without offering alternative accommodation.  They are doing this for the purpose of converting the ground floors of the property into business premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the North Strand Road there is a terrace of houses on this side of Newcomen Bridge.  Some years ago these houses would not cost more than £200 each.  The average number of people in each house is twenty or thirty.  On account of the development of the new area in Marino and Killester, brought about by the housing schemes of the Commissioners, a new avenue has been opened up.  A huge number of people pass up and down the North Strand now.  The landlords are availing of the development that has taken place and are converting private property into shops.  People are so anxious to get shops in that area that they offer high rents to the owners of the property. I know that one landlord has been offered £800 each for these two-storeyed tenement houses.  Most of the tenants in these tenements are decent working-class people.  They are now being put out to make room for shops.  What is the Minister going to do about the matter in view of the fact that his Department are <Col N="1919" /> not able to build houses quickly enough to deal with the present scarcity?  The cases I have referred to are only adding to the trouble of the Minister and those responsible for dealing with the housing problem. I ask the Minister to take into consideration cases of that kind and to do something to stop the wholesale evictions that are taking place in consequence of the conversion of residential property into business premises.</P>

I do not think that that regulation has been in any way interfered with by the Commissioners, and if that is so I think the Commissioners can stop at once what the Senator has complained of, or whoever is acting in the capacity of the Chairman of the Public Health Committee can do so.</P>

However, if the Senator will give to me the specific details I will see that such information as can be made available from the Department will be made available to the Senator.</P>

His industry certainly cannot be disputed and his ability has been apparent to us all in the piloting of this Bill.  I would like even at this stage, although I am sadly disappointed with many of the terms of the Bill, to congratulate the Minister on behalf of the citizens of Dublin for what he has done.  I only hope that the Bill which is about to pass will be the forerunner of a much greater and better Bill for the city of Dublin. I wish to remove from the House any little misunderstanding that may have arisen in reference to what I said about a particular section, on which I feel very strongly.  I would just make the remark that, even at this last stage, if the Minister would reconsider the matter and withdraw that terrible commercial franchise, speaking metaphorically, I would feel I would be almost inclined to throw my arms about his neck.</P>
