      <P>I am sure it is the desire of the Seanad to pay a tribute to the memory of our late colleague and friend, Senator Sir Bryan Mahon.  He sat in the Seanad practically since its inception and we, his colleagues, all grew to love him. His career was the career of many young men in this country.  He joined the Army and served in many countries with great success.  He ended up his military career by being appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in Ireland, and I think everybody who had any dealings with him then will recognise that he handled a difficult situation with tact and with understanding. He had great faith in human nature; he was an absolutely honest man, and, if sometimes he was unfortunate in his faith in human nature, perhaps, he was happier than some of us who have not that same faith.  Wherever he served abroad I know, from my friendship with him, his thoughts were always for this, the country of his birth.  It was always his desire to spend the evening of his days at home in Ireland, a desire which I am glad to say was granted to him.  He had a great love for his country, and did everything in his power to promote its welfare.  When the new conditions came into force here he worked hard and steadily to make them a success, and every day that he saw its prosperity improve was a delight to him. We, in this House, shall see him no more, and it only remains for us to <Col N="3" /> offer to his relatives a tribute of our respectful sympathy in their loss.  I move: &ldquo;That this House do place on record the expression of its regret at the death of Senator Sir Bryan Mahon.&rdquo; The motion is one to which I am sure the House will assent unanimously.</P>

      <P>I think it is appropriate that I should second this motion.  I knew Senator Sir Bryan Mahon for the greater portion of his life, and we had always been intimate friends.  I examined him for his first commission.  We have been together in war and peace, on the Turf and in other fields of sport, and in the Seanad.  In one and all he was remarkable for the simplicity of his manners, and the invariable uprightness of his conduct.  I might enlarge on each of these matters, and give examples if this were an appropriate occasion, which I think it is not.  I will only add that during his long and diversified life I have never known any person more kind in his heart, more honest in his principles, and more upright in his conduct.</P>

      <P>It will be necessary, according to sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Seanad Bye-Elections Act, for an Order to be made directing the Clerk to inform the Minister for Local Government and Public Health of the vacancy in the Seanad caused by the death of Sir Bryan Mahon, in order that steps may be taken to have such vacancy filled.  Is it the wish of the House that such an Order be made?</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>As Senators will see, the Bill is a very simple one.  One of the principal objects of the Bill is to give the Currency Commission a wider choice of securities. At present, it is confined to British securities maturing within a period of twelve months.  When the original Bill was passed there was a comparatively wide range of such securities available.  Conditions have altered since then and the range of choice is very limited indeed&mdash;so limited that it is believed the earnings of the Currency Commission would be unduly restricted if this Bill were not introduced.  The Banking Commission did not recommend that any such restriction as appears in the Currency <Col N="5" /> Act should be imposed on the Currency Commission, nor was any such restriction included in the original Bill.  In the course of the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas, an amendment was inserted restricting the Commission to securities maturing within a period of twelve months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a proposal in the Bill also to enable the Currency Commission, if it thinks fit, to invest in securities of the U.S.A.  The United States of America is, in fact, the only country outside Great Britain in which we think it would be wise at the present time, or within any time foreseeable, to give the Currency Commission power to invest.  Conditions being as they are, I do not think this power is likely to be availed of by the Currency Commission. From the point of view of returns on investments, it would not be a wise act to purchase securities of the Government of the United States. Having regard to the great wealth of America, its undeveloped resources and the position it holds in the financial world, there is no doubt that the securities of the Government of the U.S.A. are as safe as any that could be found.  There is a consequential provision in Section 4 which is of less consequence.  Section 5 deals also with a minor matter&mdash;the defacement of notes.  That can be dealt with in Committee.  The principle of the Bill is directed to giving the Currency Commission a wider choice of securities so that it may, without endangering the funds of which it has charge, make larger earnings.  There is no compulsion of any sort on the Currency Commission.  The Currency Commission is so constituted that it may be trusted to take a very conservative and careful course.  It is a body which might be described as semi-independent.  It consists of three members appointed by the banks, three members nominated by the Minister for Finance and a Chairman chosen by those members.  The members hold office for fixed periods. No Minister, even if he were disposed to do so, could suddenly change the character of the Commission even as regards the nominees of the Minister for Finance.  As regards the other <Col N="6" /> nominees, no Minister could change the character of the Commission at all.</P>

      <P>I should like to have further explanation as to why this proposal is made.  It is a definite and absolute departure from the recommendation of the Banking Commission. I am not able to say whether the Banking Commission was wise or not in what they advocated but they were very positive in their recommendation that &ldquo;such legal tender notes as may be issued shall be equal in amount to British Government obligations held for their protection.&rdquo; Paragraph after paragraph refers to these legal tender notes being based upon British Government securities.  I do not express any view for or against the change, but the change being so definite and positive, it seems to require a little more justification than has been given. Are we to take it that the members, or any number of the members, of this Commission agree that circumstances have changed to such an extent that there should be a departure, or is it the view of the Government that this Commission was not infallible in its judgment?  The amount of justification the Minister has given is not sufficient to warrant this change in the law.</P>
