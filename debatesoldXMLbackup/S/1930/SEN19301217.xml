      <P>Before the business commences, I wish to inform the House of a matter which, in my judgment and I hope in the judgment of the House, is a breach of privilege.  Last evening, as I was coming into this building for the purpose of interviewing another Senator, after I had passed the cordon at the outer gate and was approaching the steps to Leinster House, I heard the command &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo;  At the moment, I did not think that that command was intended for me.  Soon afterwards the same command was repeated in a louder and more peremptory voice.  I then looked up and I found that a rifle was levelled at me. I was then ordered to advance to be recognised; and I did, in fact, advance to be recognised, up to the steps leading to the entrance to this building. That was an arrest.  It was a breach of privilege and, in my judgment, a distinct breach of one of the Articles of the Constitution.  I do not wish to say how serious it might be if an absent-minded Senator or some person who thought he was in no sense intended happened to be coming in and were in my place.  He might very easily have got shot.  That is the danger. I do not raise this question merely because of the personal danger to myself or because of the prospect of danger to other members of the Seanad or Dáil.  I raise it as a matter of constitutional privilege and a matter of constitutional right.  I think that no Senator should be liable to be challenged within the precincts of the Houses of Parliament, and I merely <Col N="198" /> mention the matter on the first occasion to you and to the House, and it is for you then to see what steps should be taken.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill that anyone interested in the wine trade that has Portugal as its origin will be glad to see introduced.  The wines of Portugal, as any connoisseur in wines knows, have a specially distinctive character of their own.  Some of the faked and fraudulent wine manufacturers take advantage of this and try to pass off their products as having some connection with Portugal.  The passing off of such, in many cases worthless articles as the wines of Portugal is detrimental to these wines. There are faked and medicated wines now on the market and the trade in them is growing.  Those wines depend entirely for their trade on the glowing advertisements and exaggerated statements made about them.  For instance, one firm makes the statement about its wines that they have been recommended by 20,000 doctors.  These wine firms, for their own purpose, <Col N="199" /> imitate the labels and general get-up of the port wine, and by their cheapness they induce the poorer classes to purchase them.  The wines of Portugal are not cheap and they cannot be sold to leave a certain margin of profit except at high prices.  These cheap wines to which I refer are manufactured practically in some back yards or places of that kind.  On analysis it is proved that they have neither medicinal nor stimulating effects, though they are bought by the poorer people with the idea that they are wines of a stimulating character.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance made a promise two and a half years ago, in the course of the Budget debate, that he would have this matter looked into. He also made the statement that there might be a case for prohibiting their sale on the grounds that he personally believed that they were frauds and should be prohibited in the interests of public health.  Though two and a half years have since passed, nothing has been done.  There was a Bill passed in 1887 dealing with the infringement of names in this matter of wine, but these sellers of cheap wine ignored that, and the law is practically a dead letter at present.  I am sorry the Minister for Finance is not here, because it is he who made the promise that something would be done in the matter.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise two points in connection with this Bill. It seems this is the proper time to do it.  Unfortunately I could not very well hear the speech of Senator MacKean, and I may possibly be referring to some of the points he has raised.  If so I beg to be excused.  It seems to me that if I read the Bill correctly its object is to prevent certain kinds of wine which are made in Australia, and which are advertised as being of the character of port, from being sold.  I believe that is a false description, but it is presumably a legal description to give.  That seems rather arbitrary.  I hope the Minister will give an explanation on that matter. That is the main thing I have in mind.  On this Bill, the Portuguese Treaty Bill, I would like to ask what <i>quid pro quo</i> do we get?  If it is proposed <Col N="200" /> to make this Treaty with Portugal, presumably it is because it is mutually beneficial.  I would like to know in what way it is beneficial to the Free State, and whether the interior constitution of the inhabitants of the Free State is being looked after, or certain commercial advantages? Perhaps the Minister would enlighten us on those two matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Senator Bagwell is the exact point adverted to in the Bill.  It is intended that for the future wines shall not be sold in this country bearing the description of port unless they come from the region named, such as the region of Douro in Portugal.  That is deliberate, and that is the intention of the Bill.  The effect will be to prevent the sale in this country of Australian wines under the description of port or madeira.  That will not be allowed in future.  I do not know whether the Senator ties up his remarks on that point with the general question he asked as to the benefit this country is getting under the Treaty.  Of course that is not before the House.  This is only a subsidiary matter.  The Treaty is a commercial treaty, and it has nothing to do with constitutional or political or other matters.  It is purely a trade treaty, and it is established on the most-favoured-nation basis as between the two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, amongst the nations on the Continent there is a feeling growing that a geographical description, such as exists in this case, should be limited precisely to the products of that geographical area.  We are keen on establishing that principle ourselves because we want to have definitely recognised certain products that used to be and are known by certain names particular to this country.  We are anxious to have these products defined definitely by those names in future.  Some of these names have lapsed into ordinary trade descriptions. We are fully in accord with the French, who are particularly keen on this matter with regard to wines.  The Portuguese are similarly interested, and we are anxious that these names should apply to the special <Col N="201" /> products of the country concerned. In our own case the word &ldquo;Balbriggan&rdquo; is applied to certain types of goods, and so also is the word &ldquo;Limerick&rdquo; applied to certain types of foodstuffs.  On this point we are very ready to agree with the Portuguese. We think the movement is spreading, and we think that ultimately we will have these names associated with particular products of our country.  The point that the Senator has made is the one which we aim at. It is our intention to prohibit the sale of Australian wines that are sold here as Madeira or Port, or even sold with the explanatory term, &ldquo;character of&rdquo; and &ldquo;type of.&rdquo;  They will have to be labelled as Australian wines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak, but, arising out of the remarks made by the Minister, I would like to know from him what will be the effect of the Bill on wines of the character of Port, so-called, that are made here and in England.  As the Minister is probably aware, there is wine made in Dublin, Belfast and England.  It is of a very inferior quality.  It is not much drunk in Dublin, where it is known by the name &ldquo;Cheerio.&rdquo;  In Belfast it is called &ldquo;Red Biddy.&rdquo;  The consumption in Dublin is, comparatively speaking, very small, but there is a large consumption in Belfast, and the wine is doing a great deal of harm there.  I have reason to believe that the Northern Government have done a great deal to suppress the sale of the wine, but so far they have not been very successful. I am quite unprepared on this subject; if I had had notice I would have placed myself in possession of figures and other information.  I would like to know if this Bill will stop the manufacture of this particular stuff&mdash; call it beverage if you like, but that is the wrong word for it.  It is a highly alcoholic drink, and the duty is so small that it is quite out of proportion to the duty charged on other spirits, wines and malt products.  If it were possible to stop the manufacture of that wine I think it would be very beneficial for the body politic.</P>

      <P>This Bill has no direct application to what the Senator spoke of.  If there is an attempt made <Col N="202" /> to sell wines which are imported from countries other than Portugal, and which are described as Port or Madeira, or the character of or type of Port or Madeira, it would be illegal.  As regards this wine described as &ldquo;Red Biddy,&rdquo; it would be quite saleable. The term &ldquo;Cheerio&rdquo; might be quite a false description of the after-effects of he consumption of the wine so-called.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of the Bill is to reduce the rates of contribution from what they are at present to the rates set out in the First Schedule while keeping the benefits as they are. The rates of contribution are going to be lowered to the point denoted in the First Schedule.  This is made possible by the fact that while the Unemployment Insurance Fund can hardly be described as being actually clear of debt at present, the contribution income exceeds the amount that is paid out from it yearly by a sum of £360,000. There will be a debt on the Fund as from 1st January next of about £300,000, and we propose, in order to give the benefit of this to industry immediately, that we should, to a certain extent, fund that debt of <Col N="203" /> £300,000 and pay it off in a period of from seven to nine years.  In the meantime we can give this reduction, which amounts to about 3d. per week in the case of the employer and 3d. in the case of the employee.  Of course, it is not so right down along the line, because there are different contributions for men, women and children.  In this way, as between the employee and the employer, there is a saving in contributions to the Fund of about a quarter of a million per year, and the saving to the State is between £46,000 and £60,000 per annum by reason of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it might be taken generally that the unemployed, or the employed people at least, should be thankful for this Bill.  As a matter of fact, it constitutes a grave act of injustice in the case of every unemployed man who has been paying unemployment contributions for the past few years.  Some years ago the unemployment benefits were drastically worsened in the Saorstát.  The Minister insisted upon putting unemployment insurance on what he termed a real insurance basis&mdash;a sound, actuarial basis.  In other words, no benefit was to be paid out except what was actually subscribed for by the employers, the employed, and the State. He went a little bit too far; he put it on too good an insurance basis, with the result that the unemployed have been paying far more than they have been getting.  The Fund was in debt to the State to the extent of about one and a quarter million pounds, and that is now being paid off at the rate of £360,000 per annum, with the result that in a few years there would be a substantial surplus, after making all allowance for the payment of benefits. The Minister has decided, therefore, that, instead of improving the benefits at the present rate of contribution, he will leave the benefits as they are, inadequate though they may be, and reduce the contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who knows anything about the subject knows that the unemployment insurance benefits here are far and away less favourable than they are either across the Border or in Great <Col N="204" /> Britain, and the manner in which the regulations governing the payment of unemployment insurance contributions are administered results in the present position, that even if the total of those on the unemployment registers&mdash;a total which is not at all representative of the number of people unemployed&mdash;in or about one-half only are in receipt of unemployment benefit.  That is because of the shortening of the period during which they are entitled to benefit.  A man gets only a day's benefit for every stamp.  A stamp, of course, is put on each week, so that if he is three months employed and is then thrown out of work he is only entitled to two weeks' benefit.  On the other hand, if he is eight or ten years in employment, and he has been contributing to the Unemployment Insurance Fund during all that period, and he is then thrown out of work, the most he can get in any one year is 26 weeks' benefit.</P>
    <P>We are living in very abnormal times and a man, when he gets out of employment now, may be not only months but years unemployed.  But no matter what amount he has contributed, or how many years he has been contributing, he cannot get more than 26 weeks' benefit.  Then there is a waiting period of six days before he can get any benefit.  I think the Minister said in the other House that that waiting period was originally based upon the practice of the trade unions in paying benefit to their own members.  I am not sure that that is absolutely correct, but if it is, it was based on a very ancient practice &mdash; a practice that obtained when the position in regard to industry was normal and when long periods of unemployment were almost unheard of. No union that I am aware of has practised that for a good many years now. They realise that they are dealing with an abnormal period and that special methods have to be resorted to.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that we should base our unemployment legislation on a normal basis.  I suggest that he cannot very well do that in an abnormal period spread over a big num ber of years; in effect, an abnormal period that, in a sense, has become the <Col N="205" /> normal condition of affairs, especially when the present contributions allow of better benefits.  Surely it was not the proper way to go about it, to reduce the subscriptions and leave the benefits as they are.  The Minister contends that they are trying to meet abnormal unemployment in another way: that a sum of £300,000 has been voted for relief works with a view to mitigating the hardships of the unemployed. It is possible that many men who would otherwise be entitled to unemployment benefit, and who have paid for it, will have to go on to that relief work and take work that would otherwise be available for other men who very badly want it.  The benefits that the unemployed have been subscribing to for a number of years past, and that are now beginning to accumulate in the form of a surplus, are being confiscated from them&mdash;absolutely confiscated&mdash;because they are getting no credit for the time that is past and the accumulations that are accruing, and the employer who is now contributing, and the man who is employed now, are getting the benefit of these people's extra contributions in the past.</P>
    <P>I suggest that not only is that an injustice to those who have been subscribing, but that it is also a very unstatesmanlike and short-sighted way of dealing with one of the most vital problems of the day.  The relief of 3d. per week to the employed man, to the man now in industry, is absolutely negligible, and the relief to the employers, except they have a very large number of workers, will also be negligible.  I have not heard of any employers who have asked for any reduction.  If they have done it they have done it in quite a silent way, and the Minister cannot certainly state that there has been any demand for it, while there has been a demand for better employment conditions here.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this, and that is the fact that if it were possible to raise the unemployment benefit to the same level as that obtaining across the border, that would take away from the Northern Minister for Labour one of the excuses and indeed the principal excuse which he advanced against the establishment of a <Col N="206" /> reciprocal arrangement between the two States.  I do not agree that was a sound reason, but he contends it is, and at least our own Minister will be able to take it from him and make him face up to the position created.  At the present moment employees who go from the Free State and work in Northern Ireland, though they may have paid contributions for months and years, if they are then thrown out of work and come home are not entitled to any benefit.  If they work in the Free State and live in Northern Ireland and come home they get no benefits although they have been subscribing all the time.  Men who go to Great Britain and work there, when they are in semi-permanent employment for years and then find themselves thrown out of work and come home, get no return whatever for their money.  The principal excuse advanced&mdash;and I certainly term it an excuse&mdash;is that our rates of benefit are so low as compared with those obtaining across the border and in Great Britain, that the Minister cannot see his way in either case to establish a reciprocal arrangement. That excuse could be taken away, and taken away at least for some time without any expenditure to the State, by merely continuing the present arrangement.  I think it is a great pity that the Minister did not see his way to deal with the position in that way, seeing that we were in the happy position of being able not only to pay for the benefits that were being got but would in a few years have accumulated a substantial reserve which would meet the requirements of the situation.  For that reason I shall vote against the Bill.  I think it is unnecessary and uncalled for, and it certainly is not the right way to deal with the position with regard to unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the House there are other people involved in this matter than the employed.  The Senator says the employed have no reason to be thankful for this measure.  But I suggest that the country as a whole has very good reason.  This is the fructification of a policy of placing insurance upon a <Col N="207" /> sound basis and of avoiding the demoralising abuse of insurance such as we have seen in other countries, and especially in a country where the rates are higher than they are here.  The Senator, I think, in this matter speaks with a certain degree of class consciousness, and I suppose he would say I do, too.  I do not deny it.  I think we are both partisans, and if we are honest I think we will admit it, that there is a very large element of partisanship in politics, and why suggest any illusion?</P>
      <P>The Senator talks as if there were only one class of contributor to this Fund, and that the employee.  He surely knows, although it may not be convenient to state it, that the employers and the State also contribute, and that this is not either a class or a personal matter.  It is insurance; it is a collective matter; and the employers and the State are also entitled to recognition for the contributions they have paid in the past.  I suggest that this Bill does give proper and adequate recognition to all classes.  There is a very large element of psychology in these matters.  The more these benefits are given, the more they are wanted; and the easier they are to get, the more they are exploited.  I congratulate the Government upon the very firm stand they have taken in this matter.  I think the House will generally be conscious that the example of the Government in this matter is one that many other countries envy very much.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this Bill we ought to take some notice of the history of this matter.  Because of the fact that the Insurance Fund has now become profit-making, if I might say so, the Government propose that the contributions of the employers and the employed should be reduced.  For years the Fund was in a state of what the Minister describes as bankruptcy. Why was the Fund in a state of bankruptcy? Was it because it was insolvent, or because the scheme was insolvent?  Or was it because very abnormal circumstances made it insolvent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme as originally proposed was quite solvent.  But after the events <Col N="208" /> of 1918 hundreds and thousands of people were loaded on to this particular fund who never had any right to be on it, and it was because of this fact that the Unemployment Insurance Fund became insolvent, with the result that in this country the employed people who contributed to the Unemployment Fund were deprived of the benefits that people in other countries, where this Act was first introduced, were able to secure.  The difference between the benefits paid across the water and in Northern Ireland and what is paid in this country is astounding. It shows that the working-class people in this country, because of certain events, and the change over that followed, were put in a great deal worse position than they would have been if the change had not taken place.  Now, when we have got over this difficulty and wiped out this great deficit, not because of the insolvency of the scheme, but because of the loading on to the Fund of people who never contributed to the Fund and never should have been on the Fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right, and the Senator's colleague wants to put them back again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister admits that the Fund became insolvent because people came on to the Fund who were never entitled to be upon it.  For that reason I say that people who paid insurance contributions were deprived of the benefit that they should have received in time.  Our objection to this Bill is that the Fund is now solvent, and has been made solvent at the expense of the employed contributors, and if Senator Sir John Keane wishes, the employers also; still I have yet to learn that whatever the employers contributed came out of their private pockets.  It was the industry that paid for it, not the employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>It was out of the industry <Col N="209" /> it came, not out of the private pockets of the employers.  The result now at any rate is that this Fund has become solvent, and I do not want to load anybody on to it that is not entitled to receive benefits on it.  But I want to give a decent extension of benefits to those who contributed and who are entitled to them.  The benefits paid are roughly one day's benefit for every stamp contributed, with 26 weeks' benefit if you have sufficient stamps, in one year.  It does not matter if you had been paying contributions for ten years if you become unemployed you only get 26 weeks' benefit in one year, and I say that these benefits ought to be extended for a further period.  The people who usually get unemployment benefit at the present time are not the type of persons that go into unemployment for the sake of being unemployed.</P>
      <P>We know that a number of men became redundant in the railway service, and that although some of them thought they were entitled to pensions they found afterwards that they would not get them.  Some of these people had stamps to their credit for ten years, and after six months' benefit they found that they had no hope of further employment and were cut off. In that case the benefit should be extended. Benefits all round should be extended, and as this scheme is solvent something better should be done than merely reducing the rate of contribution. That is not the way to solve the unemployment problem or to save industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane talked about partisanship and said that Senator O'Farrell was class-conscious.  Senator Sir John Keane admitted that he was class-conscious, and that there was always partisanship in politics.  In dealing with this great question of unemployment there are other considerations than political considerations to be looked into.  There is the human consideration, the starving man or woman, and there is no partisanship in giving a loaf of bread to that class. Surely such people are entitled to some consideration instead of having a Bill such as this introduced for the purpose of taking a small percentage off <Col N="210" /> the contribution.  I think the Minister should have followed the lead given across the water and give decent benefits to the insured persons, instead of making decent people paupers. That is the object we have in view, and for that reason we are opposed to the reductions in contributions.  I go further and say that a large number of workers who are in permanent employment and paying to the unemployment insurance scheme have no objection to continue paying, if it means that those who have been less fortunate will get the benefit.</P>
    <P>There has been talk about this scheme being based on a scheme that was formerly provided by the trades unions.  Before ever an Unemployment Insurance Act was dreamt of by the State, the trades unions, out of their own funds, provided for their unemployed members.  The State was never asked for any contributions.  There is no doubt that if a man gives up to 30 years' service in an industry, that industry is entitled to contribute towards his upkeep when he is unemployed. Otherwise you are going to make a machine or an animal out of him.  If a man gives a number of years' service to an industry, that industry owes him something, and is morally bound to contribute towards his support when he is unemployed.  These are the reasons why we are opposed to this Bill and why we ask the House to vote against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in the unhappy position of having to look for information in respect to this Bill.  As far as I can recollect the Unemployment Insurance Fund became insolvent by reason of the fact that uncovenanted benefits were granted for a period of two or three years, so much so, that uncovenanted benefit was regarded by labour people as something that the Insurance Fund should have given under ordinary circumstances.  I am only asking for information.  I am not opposed to having a fund for the benefit of a man who is idle.  I want to get the facts.  When I heard Senators on the Labour Benches say that the Fund is not giving as much as it was originally intended should be given, I wondered if that was a fact.</P>

      <P>That is the point.  I want to get the facts.  I daresay that when that Fund was started certain regulations were laid down in regard to what would be paid out in case of unemployment.  It has been stated here that the unemployed persons have not got what they should have got. I would like to have that matter cleared up.  It was pointed out that if a person had stamps to his credit for ten years that he could only get benefit for 156 days of the particular year.  If he contributes stamps for ten years he will have paid, in actual cash, £20 and he gets in benefit in one year £20; or 156 half crowns.  He gets that continuously for ten years perhaps, until his stamps are expired. Therefore I think he is doing very well.</P>

      <P>For the last ten years 9d. per week has been paid by the contributor.  That amounts to £2 a year and if the insured person gets 26 weeks' benefit I think he is doing well.  I am not saying that he should not get more, but I say that the case made by Labour Senators is not the exact case that the Seanad ought to vote on.  It should be inquired into. I am not in favour of uncovenanted benefit, and I am not in favour of as much money being paid out here as is paid in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I know cases in Great Britain where the insured people get more from the Fund than they would if they were working.  From personal inquiry I know that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to another aspect of the matter that was raised by Senator Connolly.  He stated the other day that the agricultural labourers are not insured, and he regretted that fact. <Col N="212" /> The agricultural labourers are not insured, and rightly so.  The way to help unemployment amongst agricultural labourers is to extend the principle of giving them houses and plots.</P>

      <P>Cottages have been built throughout the country, some of them with four rooms, to which is attached an acre of land, and they are let at a rent of 1s. 2d. per week. Cottages are of more benefit to the labourers than anything the Insurance Fund would ever provide for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  If the labourer who is idle had a plot of land he can get more out of it than if he was paying into an Insurance Fund.  That is the right way to deal with unemployment amongst the agricultural labourer and that scheme should be extended if he is to be helped.  Of course we know that there have been abuses in connection with the tenancy of these cottages, but an agricultural labourer who has a cottage of four rooms and a plot of land in North County Dublin can get much greater benefit from that bit of land than he would ever receive from an Unemployment Insurance Fund into which he had paid 9d. a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this reduction in contributions for various reasons.  One of these reasons is that a very important section of the community&mdash;the agricultural labourers&mdash; are not provided for.  There is no provision by which these men can be kept fit for employment during extended periods of unemployment such as they have suffered during the past few years.  Senator Wilson says that he is opposed to extending unemployment benefit to the agricultural worker.  He gives us very glowing accounts of the amount of wealth a cottage-holder is able to get out of an English acre of a garden.  That was a very different account from the story we heard this day week of the destitution and hardship <Col N="213" /> which people with 60, 80, or 100 acres were suffering.</P>

      <P>The distance which you can extend a labourer's garden is very limited, particularly in the Co. Dublin, to which Senator Wilson referred. When we have claimed portions of land for landless men, it has always been put up to us that a holding of less than twenty acres is not economic, and we are told that the greatest trouble the Land Commission have had throughout the Free State has been the elimination of holdings of three, four, and five acres.  Here we have Senator Wilson suggesting the extension of the labourer's plot to two three acres, so as to convert the labourer into a sort of mongrel&mdash;a man who will be neither a farmer nor an agricultural labourer.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that the surplus money which has been paid in by the contributors to the Fund for the past few years, which has practically suceeeded in wiping out the big deficit that existed eight or nine years ago should not be utilised in this way.  Instead, I suggest that this Bill should be extended so as to embrace the agricultural workers&mdash;a class which, I submit, is the most important in the community.  We hear every day that the principal industry of this country is agriculture.  If there be any section of the community which deserves well of the people as a whole, it is the agricultural workers, because they are producing the wealth which is keeping running all the cities and towns and which is maintaining the professions, the politicians, the Government, and all the rest.  I think that that is undisputed.  I suggest that instead of frittering away this surplus in giving relief of a penny or twopence a week to the worker and another couple of pence to the employer, and reducing the contribution of the State by £50,000, the proper and sensible thing to do is to extend to agricultural workers the benefits enjoyed by every other working section of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the benefits ought to have been so framed that there would have been no nest egg laid up at the end of each year.  After 1920, this annual profit of £300,000 was made. How has that been applied?  It has been applied towards paying off the deficit on the British fund, which, I submit, the workers of this State were, in justice, under no obligation to pay. Next, it was applied in paying off the deficit of the fund in the Saorstát.  If I am wrong, the Minister will correct me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1920 to 1922 benefits were undoubtedly paid to persons who were not under covenant to receive them.  As Senator Wilson said, uncovenanted benefits were paid during those two years.  In 1923, uncovenanted benefit was stopped, and we came back to the very conservative working of this scheme, whereby £300,000 a year which ought to have gone to the workers was kept from them.  What happened then?  In 1925, there was a proviso issued&mdash;I am surprised that Senators on the Labour benches who spoke so ably on this Bill did not note it&mdash;by which an insured person must have twelve stamps affixed after going out of benefit before benefit can be renewed.  If I am wrong in that, the Minister can correct me.  That was a further limitation introduced in 1925. Justice can be done, without any reduction of or increase in contributions, by giving benefit to the insured person before he has twelve stamps on the book.  Justice could also be done by repealing this regulation&mdash;that employees who draw twenty-six weeks' benefit in one year cease to be in benefit irrespective of the number of stamps they had to their credit prior to unemployment.  A workman might have been paying since the scheme first came into operation&mdash;he might have been in constant employment all the time&mdash;and he might have to his credit £30 worth of stamps, the men in employment with him having, perhaps, to their credit thousands of pounds worth of stamps, and yet if he is out of employment <Col N="216" /> for twenty-six weeks, he can get no more benefit.  I think that is wrong.  There are a few other matters which require attention.  In the first place, we ought to have a full register of the unemployed.  We ought also to be in a position to know in any one week, or on the first of any month, how many persons had applied for employment, say, in the City of Dublin and how many were refused or were unable to get employment.</P>
      <P>This is a matter which I do not wish to put forward in any controversial spirit.  I am not class conscious as between employer and employee.  I would say this for Senator Sir John Keane, although he himself phrases it in a way which is, perhaps, rather uncomplimentary and unjust to himself, I do not believe that he is class-conscious, because from my observation of him during the last two or three years I believe that he is a man with an essentially honest mind, and no man with an essentially honest mind who goes into this question can fail to see the strength of the arguments put forward from the Labour benches to-day.  I differ fundamentally from Senator Sir John Keane when he says that the present position of affairs is the fruition of a sound policy.  What is the sound policy?  A policy which keeps from the workmen £300,000 a year.  I would differ very respectfully from Senator Sir John Keane in regard to that.  I submit that, in so far as it is a fruition of anything, it is the fruition of an unsound policy, a policy which deprives working men of the full benefits to which they are entitled.  Therefore, having listened to this debate, we are going to support Labour, if the matter goes to a division, for the reasons which they themselves have urged.</P>

There was a chariot, as they call it, coming down Broadway with a large number of drums and a flourish of trumpets. I went over to see what was happening and I found that it was a parade of the American Non-Partisan Association. I do not think that there is <Col N="217" /> any need to be non-partisan in an issue of this kind because, to my mind, the issue is extremely simple so far as this Bill is concerned.  We are not dealing with the question as to whether agricultural labourers should be under this or some similiar scheme. We are not dealing with the question as to whether this scheme is the best. We have an insurance scheme to which there are three contributors and, as a result of the financial policy pursued it is in a strong position.  There are two courses open which would benefit the contributors.  One course is to reduce the contributions and the other is to increase the benefits for the future. At the same time, there is room for a perfectly honest difference of opinion as to which is the wiser course and all other matters are extraneous. I am of opinion that, having regard to the condition of the country&mdash;and I believe that Labour Senators know about it&mdash;having regard to the wishes of a considerable number of the contributors, a reduction of rates will be more welcome than an increase of benefits to the persons concerned.  I may be wrong, but that is the issue which we have to decide and not extraneous issues which have been raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverGogarty" hpid="Dr. Gogarty Dr. Gogarty">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole idea of the character of insurance seems to be missed.  What about the thousands of people who are never unemployed and who never receive benefits?  It is surely by counting on their getting no benefit that those who are unemployed can get benefits.  It is the idea of insurance to balance one set of probabilities against another.  Instead of complaining about the surplus being a nest egg which has not been distributed it ought to be considered as proof of the success of the scheme.  It should not be suggested that men should be put out of employment in order to benefit by this £300,000 surplus.  The other side of the matter is that if, after ten years' work an insured person is to accept ten years' unemployment, or to be insured for ten years' so that he need not work, it does not require much foresight to see that it will be possible that no one will work for more <Col N="218" /> than ten or fifteen years if he has a short expectation of life.  We would then get to the position which prevails in England where there is only a difference of a shilling between working and not working but a mighty difference as regards demoralisation. I do not mind Senator Comyn's complaints about the nest egg being sent to England, because his emphasis is nearly always much stronger than his points.  If there were not to be any surplus the fund would be unworkable because it would be bankrupt.  Men cannot be deliberately disemployed in order to prevent a surplus arising.  That is the position. As long as we keep our attention on the character of insurance which is to do an injustice, so to speak, to those who do not claim unemployment benefit for the portion or remnant of those who do, we must see that there are always people who will stay in employment and who are apparently in the position of being treated unjustly.  That is the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> at which you can arrive in considering the character of insurance. The proposition is to enable some people who are getting too much value to be unemployed for ten or fifteen years or more as they choose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Douglas went to the crux of this discussion when he said that the question arose as to whether the surplus is to be distributed by a reduction of premiums or by an increase of benefits.  He said that there was a reasonable ground for difference of opinion on that issue.  I think it is quite correct to say so. Senator Sir John Keane, perhaps, gave the key which ought to decide the lines which the Seanad should take.  He explained that on this matter, consciously or unconsciously, class interests seemed to affect the decision of the disputants, the controversialists, the partisans.  It would seem to me that the class interest of the employers would decide that there should be a reduction in the contributions, because it serves the class interests of the employer, whether as employer or as income tax payer.  On the other hand, you have over 250,000 people employed for wages in insurable <Col N="219" /> occupations who, so far as they have been able to give expression to any views on this question, would prefer to have improved benefits rather than reduced contributions.  If class interests are going to determine one's views on this matter, we will have to decide whether it is better to keep in good moral and physical condition those who are out of work to a greater degree than at present, or to save threepence a week per man employed for the employers.  I do not know whether the Minister is pleased at the connection of the two sentences in Senator Sir John Keane's speech, namely, that class interests undoubtedly would affect his view, and the views of those who think with him, and his commendation of the Government for introducing the Bill.  There is probably a clear connection between the two ideas expressed by Senator Sir John Keane, but I really think that there is something fundamental at stake in this matter.  It is not enough to speak about the insurance fund as an insurance fund, but even though we were doing so, I think that the general tendency amongst insurance companies, if one is going to speak on purely business lines, is to distribute their surplus by improved benefits and not by a reduction of premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that account alone I think the conclusion would follow that benefits ought to be improved and increased rather than that contributions should be reduced.  But really we come to an issue as to whether Senators would desire to keep an unemployed man in benefit for a longer period, or improve the benefits by one means or another out of the fund that is collected, or whether unemployed persons should go more quickly or more easily on home help, because that is what happens.  If you have an unemployed person receiving unemployment benefit for a few weeks or months and that then he is cut off, much more rapidly will that person go on home help.  If you are satisfied with the payment of five or ten shillings per week out of home help rather than to keep a man's moral state in a fairly good condition by a payment out of the insurance fund, you will vote for this Bill.  If you prefer to keep in a good, <Col N="220" /> healthy mind and stamina the unemployed man, to keep him fit for work when work comes, you will rather favour the extension of benefits than the reduction of contributions.  I think it will be agreed by any person of experience, whether on the employer's side or the workman's side of business, that the longer a man is unemployed without unemployment benefit, the less he is fit to take work on when work is offered and the less chance there is, therefore, of his getting work.</P>
    <P>I take this stand: that we have a national community which is or should be an enlarged family, that we have a responsibility to maintain in some degree of health and condition the workman who is thrown out of work through no fault of his own.  We talk of maladministration. We talk of malingering and fraud on the funds.  Those things will occur undoubtedly as they occur in fire insurance, let us say.  They are remedial by administration.  You may strengthen your Acts if you like, but the amount of malingering is very small indeed, much smaller proportionately here than in Great Britain and very small indeed in proportion to the amount of benefit that is being paid and the amount of good that is being done.  If we have any national responsibility for unemployment we have got somehow to keep the unemployed man in condition.  Are you going to do it by home help or are you going to extend your system of insurance?  I prefer to extend the system of insurance much wider than it is.  Keep on insurance by all means if you can, but why reduce benefits when you have a surplus out of the present insurance fund? If one wants to relieve local rates and if no other appeal will touch the heart of the farmers and the men from the country, that surely ought to.  Keep them off local rates for a longer time by extending unemployment benefit and use this surplus to increase the period of benefit during which unemployed men are unable to get work or, to put it another way, during which employers are unable to find or to provide work for the men who are waiting to do work for them.  This is a question of industry, and while of course at first hand, it is true that the contribution that the employer pays is placed <Col N="221" /> on to the cost of the article which he sells&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>That he cannot sell, very often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>True, very often that he cannot sell, but is it better that he should pay rates for poor law assistance? Is it better that he should pay increased charges to charitable funds? Somebody has to maintain the unemployed men.  How are they to be maintained?  Should they be maintained in something like a fair condition or are they gradually to be driven down until they become unemployable? I contend and the House should contend that the proper method is to increase benefits rather than to reduce them.  Sir John Keane interjects and says that the employer sometimes cannot sell an article, the cost of which is added to by threepence per week per man.  Well that is a factor no doubt.  The employer who employs say 100 men is out of pocket £65 per year by the payment of threepence per week or he will be in pocket by that amount if this Bill is passed. I cannot conceive of an employer of 100 men being in the position that the £65 a year is going to make a difference between his ability and inability to sell the article which he produces.  All the advantages are in maintaining and extending unemployment insurance so that the man who is unemployed for a period, a continuing period as it often is, shall be kept in as good a condition as he possibly can be so that he will be fit to do the work when it comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has argued that the scheme should be sound actuarially. Of course it is an answer to a good many criticisms that have been made heretofore, when one realises that for some years something like £30,000 to £60,000 per year prior to 1927-28 had been paid in interest on advances from the Central Fund, so that this Unemployment Insurance Fund has been paying interest on any money advanced to it out of the Central Fund.  It is said that this scheme was adopted to deal with normal unemployment and that our problem to-day is one of abnormality. <Col N="222" /> I say if we had any scheme put forward which was going to deal with the abnormally unemployed persons one might consider the Bill with a different view, but we have no such scheme.  There is a sum of £300,000 talked of for relief work.  The greater part of that is to be used for the relief of agriculture.  At the present time you have any number, I do not know the exact number, between 20,000 to 50,000 persons who are unemployed and who are not getting any benefits from unemployment insurance.</P>
    <P>What is to become of them?  If you had some scheme on hands for dealing with that number which is supposed to be abnormal then you might talk about reducing the contributions.  But I say that we ought to wait until the schemes that are supposed to be in embryo are brought into actual effect before we reduce the contribution, and that this sum of £300,000 that is at present being paid into the fund and is not required by the present scheme, ought to be held until amended benefits are introduced.  I hope the House will not agree to the Second Reading of this Bill, and that that refusal so to agree will be an indication to the Minister that we desire that he should bring forward proposals for improved benefits in respect to unemployment insurance.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether it would be possible to make some arrangements to continue benefits for a longer period than 26 weeks for those who have been paying insurance for several years without drawing anything from, the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  It does seem hard that a man should be in continuous employment for a very long period, paying to the Fund, and still getting no more benefit than a person, say, who has been paying for only one year.</P>

      <P>Senator Wilson asked me certain questions, and as the answers to his questions go right to the root of certain objections that were made by Labour Senators, I propose to deal with <Col N="223" /> his points first.  The Senator asked was it correct to say that the benefits received by unemployed people under the unemployment insurance scheme had been worsened. Senator O'Farrell not merely asked that same question but answered it affirmatively.  It is not a fact; the reverse is the fact.  The rates of benefit have not been worsened, but in so far as rates have been changed they have gone up since the establishment of the Fund.</P>

      <P>I am speaking of the money paid, not of the persons.  I am not dealing with the classes of persons who enjoy benefits, but with the moneys paid.  It is quite inaccurate to say that the rates of benefit have been worsened except to this extent, that we are not giving doles in this country. For one bad winter we did extend the benefit, particularly because it coincided with the sending back to civilian life of a very big number of men who had been in the National Army.  It was to meet a temporary difficulty. There was one other slight extension. To that extent, it could be said that we have given worse conditions than in the North of Ireland and Great Britain. We are not giving the dole, and we do not intend to.  Senator Farren, I think, objected to the number of unemployed people who never paid into the fund, but who had received benefit. The manner of payment, Senator Farren said, was worse than in Northern Ireland or Great Britain; that is not so.  If I am wrong I can be faced with the figures on the next day, and told there are the benefits paid, not the amount of benefits paid a year, because that is a multiplication of rates by numbers.  Leaving numbers out of it, I <Col N="224" /> am standing entirely on the total.  As a matter of fact, in certain respects we pay more, and in other respects we pay a little less.  On the whole, the conditions are a little bit better for the man who gets benefit in the Free State than the man in Great Britain or Northern Ireland; that is the man who has contributed to the Unemployment Insurance Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  On the whole, the situation has not been worsened by us.  It has been worsened inasmuch as we will not pay it to certain people because we have an insurance scheme, which the British have not.  We are going to stick to the insurance scheme.  People who complain of that have their remedy.  Similarly with regard to the point urged here as to hardships, although this was not on the ground of differentiation between our code and the British code, the waiting period and the maximum number of weeks over which payment was made when the British system was an insurance scheme was exactly the same. Under their system of extended benefit of course a week's payment is gone. The waiting period, as I said in the Dáil, was founded upon the practice of the trade unions at the time when the insurance code was first introduced. It was then the general practice of trade unions that they did not pay to people to whom they were to make payment until after the expiration of six days.  The trade union principle at the back of that was that if a man was only going to be out of employment for six days he ought to have some means of tiding himself over that temporary difficulty.  They would not regard it as a case in which payment should be made unless there were six continuous days without benefit.  The 26 weeks' payment is a fundamental of the <Col N="225" /> scheme, if it is going to be an insurance scheme at all.  Any change in that would mean definitely that the whole scheme of contribution would have to be revised, and if people were allowed to break in on that principle it would not be only a matter of refraining from giving this £300,000, but of piling on a considerable amount more by way of contribution to the Fund, so that it would be particularly undesirable.</P>
      <P>As regards the case raised by Sir Edward Bigger of people who have been paying for years without drawing benefit, I have less sympathy for them than those who have been drawing benefit.  They are the good lives on whom this scheme is founded.  They have been kept in continuous employment and one has to lean in these cases rather against the good lives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a definite insurance principle that you do weigh the good lives as against the bad lives.  Senator O'Farrell used the word &ldquo;confiscation&rdquo; with regard to this money and Senator Comyn, of course, fell into the trap immediately.  Senator Comyn talked of £300,000 which we are keeping from the working men.  Whose £300,000 is it?  I asked him to say that in the course of his speech but he neglected to answer me.  The £300,000 is the accumulation of the payments made by the employer, the employee and the State over a period of years. Take it for a certain year that £300,000 is the surplus.  That is a surplus arising out of overpayment by the employer, the employee and the State. We think the best way to distribute that is to give it back to these three. We do not distribute it proportionately. The employers as a class get between them £125,000, the employees as a class get between them £125,000. The State is getting the benefit of about £62,000.  We consider that that is the proper way to hand back the money that has been accumulated by reason of over-payment.  It is quite right to say that we are not handing it back to the people who have paid it.  Here again we are leaning against the good lives.  We lean against the employers of the old time.  It is impossible <Col N="226" /> to go back over a ten or twelve years' period and to hand employers back their proportionate shares.  If we are defrauding any employee we are defrauding the man who has been paying in for years and who has drawn nothing or next to nothing. We are not defrauding the man who has taken out the amount he put in, plus the State contribution and the employer's contribution.  The word &ldquo;confiscation&rdquo; can certainly not be applied to what is happening here.</P>
      <P>I have heard a good deal of demand for the reduction of the burden of unemployment insurance on employers. I have heard it applied not particularly to this as much as to their burden generally, and this is a very definite burden.  I know that employers and workers have expressed themselves as being very glad to get this remission of 3d. per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally not.  In any organisation the more vocal element would be the people whom I call the bad lives for insurance purposes. They would naturally not like to see the Fund depleted.  I have been asked on very inadequate grounds to raise it to the same level as in Northern Ireland and take away one of the objections raised when I tried to make a reciprocal scheme with Northern Ireland. Senator Farren was sufficiently frank about the matter to say he did not believe in the claim made by the Northern Minister.  Nobody, I think, who heard that claim would believe that it was the reason for the objection raised. I certainly am not going to do what I consider to be an unsound thing in order to take away one complaint from the Northern Ireland Minister when he has about eight reasons for refusing to do what we requested him to do.  Anyway, that problem of the migratory labourer is a thing that we are striving to get settled.  If it means that some extra payment has to be dispensed, we <Col N="227" /> are not going to default if we can get a settlement that we think to be an equitable one.  Senator Farren fell into the mistake of talking about railway men with ten years' stamps to their credit.  I would like to see that unique person, a railway man with ten years' stamps to his credit.  If there is one to be found in the grades that accepted&mdash;I do not mean the shop men &mdash;he certainly has a claim for a refund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The shop people are not deprived of unemployment insurance when out of work.  I am not going to deal with the agricultural labourer. That matter is irrelevant to this issue. If Senator O'Duffy wants to test that. let it be tested by way of resolution. I will listen to what the agricultural men have to say with regard to the payments of premiums in order to have a scheme for the agricultural labourer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Duffy also spoke of this as if we were distributing moneys we have on hand.  I would like people to realise the exact situation.  The debt at one time amounted to between £1,250,000 and £1,400,000.  That is being paid off year by year.  At the moment we are at least £400,000 in debt.  At the beginning of the year we expect to have the debt reduced to a £300,000 figure.  As Senator Johnson has said, the interest on that has been met during the period the debt was running.  We intend to meet the interest over the period it will still continue to run.  We believe in giving this fillip to industry at this time and in postponing payment of the debt for a period of from seven to nine years. That will depend, of course, on the number of contributions that come in. We will still be meeting the debt.  The debt will be paid off and the interest will be paid at the same time.  If we do not pass this Bill by the 1st January there will be £60,000 in hand, and we think it is better to do it in this way when there is a definite indication of an upward trend in business.  We prefer to do everything at this point to give whatever fillip there may be in this instead of hanging on to the contributions <Col N="228" /> and merely paying off the debt for next year.</P>
    <P>Senator Comyn said he thought we should have a full register of the unemployed. I have spoken on this matter of the register of the unemployed before, and I do not want to go into it in detail.  The sooner, I think, the situation is understood by Senators the better.  I would like to find out what better system there is than the present one.  If a man is out of work and if he wants to go on the register of the unemployed all he requires to do to get on the register is to get a sheet of paper and something with which to write.  He writes his name and address and he posts it on to our offices without even putting a stamp on it.  If the pressure of unemployment does not make a man do that then I do not consider that the weight of unemployment on him is sufficient to make us consider him.  What other system is there except a house to house search.  If a house to house search is embarked on what are the administrative costs of such a scheme going to be?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have got that remark.  I have stated this over and over again and the better it is known the more accurate my figure will be.  In the past five years 16,000 vacancies per annum were filled through the medium of unemployment exchanges. If a man sees that he has at any rate a chance to secure one of the 16,000 vacancies filled through the unemployment exchanges and does not take the trouble to get a sheet of paper, write his name and address on it and post it without expense to himself, I do not think we can take any account of that man.  The pressure of unemployment cannot be so severe on him. Let some other system be thought out, if this is not the proper system to keep the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson talked about the difference between home help and unemployment insurance benefit.  I have often heard from Senator Johnson that the unemployment insurance benefit as paid is just barely sufficient to keep a man at a sort of starvation point. <Col N="229" /> Apparently there is a big psychological difference between depending on unemployment insurance and on home help.  In the one case you consider yourself a beggar and a pauper, kept on charity, while in the other, even with extended benefit, a man is merely kept in a sound condition.  I fail to see the difference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can hardly imagine anything worse being said about the way home help is distributed than what has been said about unemployment insurance&mdash;the paltry benefits a man will get for himself and his dependents.  In answer to the arguments advanced that there has been no demand from the employers for this reduction, I must say that I have heard very little demand for increased benefits.  I have heard a great deal of demand that the benefits at present given should be to a greater number of people, and that in opposition to that there should be 30/- or 22/- a week instead of 15/-.  We are not going to have extended benefits. It may be a wrong point of view, but we prefer to say that industry should be made to support the people who are normally in industry when unhappily they go out of industry.  Anything beyond that is not a matter for the industrialists, but for the taxpayers generally, by means of relief works and schemes of that sort started from time to time.  We prefer to have the industrial group meeting the expenses of the people in industry who go out of employment over a particular period.</P>

      <P>Might we ask the Minister to deal with the point we all made, that he would extend benefit to the extent that the surplus accumulated would enable it to be expended?

      <P>I have been asked about the 26 weeks' maximum.  My answer is that when the Unemployment Insurance scheme was founded as an insurance matter the attitude taken up was&mdash;I may not be so clear on this as on the matter of the waiting week, but I think the trade unions were in agreement on this point&mdash;that there must be some maximum as to the period within a year during which persons unemployed would be entitled to draw benefit in order to give them an incentive to go back to work.  If there were no such maximum, and people were entitled to benefit for 52 weeks in the year it meant that they would treat unemployment insurance as a kind of savings bank.  This is not a fund to which people pay in money and then draw it out.  The people who receive benefit are not the only people who contribute. There are other people paying into this fund.  The State pays and the employer pays.  The fund is based on an actuarial basis, and there has to be an incentive that a man should get back to work.  There is the maximum of 26 weeks, but one generally finds that that maximum is taken in periods of two or three weeks here and there, and that it has the effect of putting people back to work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole principle of the scheme is that men in insurable occupations can draw up to the value of their stamps for a period of 26 weeks with the over-riding condition that if a person goes out of insurance he has, so to speak, to serve again some term in industry before he becomes eligible for insurance benefit.  The whole scheme was very carefully worked out. At the time that it was worked out it was stated that the contribution income was more or lesson a conjectural basis, but we had it definitely stated that if it proved to be more than sufficient <Col N="231" /> in the sense of bringing in a greater amount in income than the amount paid in benefits in the year there was then going to be a reduction. That was stated at the beginning, and it was on that basis that the people went into it.  With regard to increasing benefits, this is somewhat in the nature of a contract.  It may be said it was not freely entered into, and that if employees as a class had the handling of it it would have been built up differently.  It was put before them on a particular basis and they accepted it.  The original basis was a certain contribution.  The maximum benefit payable was 7/- a week with, at that time, no dependents' allowance.  In the late days of the war it was raised to 12/- and now, as far as we are concerned, it comes to 15/-, with dependents' allowances introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>At first it only applied to those industries such as ship-building and the building trades, in which, as we know, there is in and out employment&mdash;many breaks in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the foundation of it at the start, to deal with intermittent employment, and the basis of the scheme was not to provide for people mainly out of work, but for people who over a yearly period have spent more than 50 per cent. of their time in employment. Now there is an attempt to extend it and to make it a charity.  If industry is to be asked to pay it should be asked to pay only for those who are ordinarily occupied in industry.  It is now being put to me to extend the benefit, to pay more.  Why should I pay more?  If we were clear of debt there would be £300,000 collected in the year. The State gets less remission under this Bill than either of the other two parties.  Why should we say to people who are unfortunate enough to go out of work that we are going to raise it from 15/- to £1, and in exceptional cases to 25/-?  We should not say that <Col N="232" /> we are going to give to the good life, as well as to the bad life, this amount per annum.  I think the Bill is on a most equitable basis, and merely to defeat this Bill will not secure the other thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan) Patrick J. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather complex Bill and perhaps the best procedure would be to explain a few of the principal sections. Section 3 is the first of any importance.  Under the original Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act the maximum quantity of eggs that could be taken by a farmer across the border without being tested, graded and packed, in accordance with the regulations, was 11 lbs.  We are, under this Bill, removing that disability and the farmer can now take any quantity of eggs he likes over the border. Section 4 is also an important section It gives the inspector power to detain a package or a consignment for a reasonable period to allow of examination. We found that there was a practice growing up at the North Wall whereby shippers rushed consignments of eggs to the ship-side at the last moment so as to avoid inspection.  In order to get over that practice we are giving the inspector power to detain the consignments when contraventions of the regulations are observed.  In the event of five per cent. of any package being wrong, the inspector may detain the whole consignment.  This section aims at overcoming the difficulty we were in by reason of the fact that the shippers used to take advantage of the original Act.  A number of them would combine in bringing large quantities of eggs to the dockside at the last moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important section is Section 6.  It empowers the Minister to refuse to re-register a registered owner who has been taken off the register.  Under the original Act if the registered owner of a premises committed certain offences his registration was cancelled. After a bit the practice grew up of the registered owner applying immediately for re-registration after his first registration had been cancelled, and we found we were coerced into agreeing to the re-registration.  The position was we could not refuse to re-register the premises when they were suitable and properly equipped; if the premises were suitable in the matter of equipment and plant, we had no option but to grant the application.  Under the original Act certain persons were registered as owners and, no matter how suitable the premises or the plant or equipment might be, they would persist in breaking the regulations.  We are taking power under Section 6 to <Col N="235" /> refuse to re-register the person whose registration has been cancelled.  Section 5 makes it essential that the registered owner, or one of his employees, is technically qualified and competent to test, grade and pack eggs properly.</P>
    <P>The object of Section 9 is to safeguard the home consumer.  Under Section 15 of the original Act all packages of eggs exported from registered premises had to bear a brand consisting of an ellipse with the letters &ldquo;S.E.,&rdquo; and the identification letter and number assigned to the particular premises.  We had to withdraw the right to use these letters in a case of certain exporters.  Registered proprietors whose registration would be withdrawn might continue to use this brand on packages of eggs for home consumption.  To some extent that would be a fraud on the consumer. When people see the mark they might think he was still a registered exporter or dealer, because they would know it to be the national mark, and they would buy the eggs on that basis.  The point is that that man might have had his registration cancelled.  Under the section we take power to prevent any registered owner whose registration is cancelled from using these particular letters.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a somewhat important section.  At the present time eggs are graded into certain weights.  Each great hundred of extra selected eggs must weigh not less than 16lbs.  There is a minimum weight for each egg. Selected eggs would be a lesser weight, and medium eggs would be a lesser weight still.  We found a practice growing up of shippers exporting eggs as extra selected, and putting on the box a notice that the eggs weighed 17lbs.  That conveyed that not only were the eggs over 16lbs. in weight and extra selected, but that they were, in fact, 17lbs.  In some cases we found that this particular mark was not a fair description of the article inside. There is no necessity for anybody to grade eggs in that way.  If they grade them as extra selected they must weigh 16lbs.  It was properly open to anybody to obtain a higher standard and to say that the eggs per hundred weighed 17lbs., but we want to ensure <Col N="236" /> that the eggs shall be up to the description applied to them.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with the sale of dirty eggs.  In Part II of the Bill the register of preservers is dealt with. There were certain provisions in the original Act for preservers, but for some reason they were inoperative. We have met with a certain amount of trouble in the administration of the original Act by reason of the possibility of mixing preserved eggs with fresh eggs.  Under this Bill we will be in a position to trace preserved eggs into the stores, and from there to the markets.  We are establishing a register of preservers, and all persons exporting preserved eggs must be registered. Part III. of the Bill is not of very much importance.</P>

      <P>Sub-section 4 of Section 20 refers to eggs intended to be preserved by a particular process or processes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to deal with eggs preserved for a commercial purpose. There may be other purposes for which eggs would be preserved, and we would like to make exceptions in that case.  This Bill will regulate dealings with eggs meant for commercial purposes.  There may be other purposes for which eggs would be preserved which would not be commercial. We will not be in a position to deal with them.  Part III. empowers the Guards to assist in the detection of dirty eggs, and gives them the same powers as the inspectors of the Department formerly had.  These are the main provisions of the Bill.  It is an endeavour to make the original Act water-tight.  While the provisions are in no sense revolutionary, they are nevertheless necessary, and we believe that when we have obtained them we will be in a position to get after any abuses that occurred under the original Act.</P>

      <P>Coming from a county that I may claim to be the most important poultry-raising centre in the Free State, I welcome this Bill and these new regulations.  The regulations in the original Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act have helped to improve the Irish poultry business, and the regulations <Col N="237" /> in the Bill now before us are to remedy what is defective in that Act. It is regulations such as these that have made Denmark what it is.  I am sure that every poultry raiser in the Free State will welcome the Bill, and I am sure the Seanad will gladly pass it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about it, this Bill is very severe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenBrowne" hpid="Miss Browne Miss Browne">
      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be too severe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. MacEllin Mr. MacEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes, it can.  I have no objection personally to severity where it is needed, and I say this much, that no honest trader has any objection to the severity in the Bill.  Mayo is one of the counties most interested in the poultry business, and it is one of the counties most interested in legislation dealing with eggs. As the figures will show, it is one of the leading counties in egg production. I believe it exports almost a third of all the eggs exported from the Free State.  I would like to quote some of the figures which affect my own county.  Last year we produced in Mayo 98.6 million of hen eggs and 38.5 million duck eggs.  That, approximately, works out at one-third of the egg production of the Free State in Mayo, or about £600,000, so that it is a very big industry in our county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Realising that fact, a lot of people met recently in Mayo with a view to seeing what they could do towards increasing egg production in our county. This was aimed, not so much at an increase in the number of hens, but towards increasing the number of eggs per hen.  A deputation from that meeting was received by the Minister, and I think what they had to say was appreciated by him.  I do, not, however, want to prejudice what he said there.  At the present time it is very essential, and I would like to impress upon the House and the Minister that it would be almost criminal on the part of the Minister and the Government if they do not meet the case put up by the deputation, as it is only a matter of a few thousand pounds.  It is a demand that should not be turned down, because the people interested are representative of all sections of the <Col N="238" /> community, and in this matter they are sufficiently enthusiastic to make the scheme they are putting forward a success.</P>

      <P>Has this any connection with the Bill?  It seems to me to be extraneous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. MacEllin Mr. MacEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am speaking about is not, I submit, extraneous to the egg trade and egg production.  I do not want to go outside the scope of the Bill, but there are numbers of matters that I would like to bring before the notice of the Minister in connection with it.  One aspect of the matter that was put before the Minister is very important, and will be very important in the near future in our county in view of the fact that emigration is stopped, and girls must find some other means of livelihood in the country.  For that reason it would be most essential to set up the Institution that we are talking about, so that girls can go into that Institution to be trained with the object of getting employment in egg farms and poultry farms throughout the country.  There is no reason why farmers should not departmentalise their farms in the same way as shopkeepers and others do it, and thus let this department of egg production work out its own salvation. I believe myself that if the farmers departmentalised their farms and secured the services of girls sufficiently trained in the egg and poultry industry, they would find that these girls would be able to prove that they would be entitled to whatever salary they would get, because, in my opinion, they would show a profit for the farmer at the end of the season. Employment would be found for large numbers of girls in that way.  Girls would be more inclined to take up such work than ordinary domestic or household work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that is not generally known or spoken of, and I do not know if the Minister could give us any information on it in connection with the production of eggs.  It is only recently that I heard of this system myself.  It works out in this way: that in mid-summer the hens are locked up for a month or six weeks.  They get <Col N="239" /> no exercise in that period, and they go off laying.  They get a considerable reduction in their food, too.  At the end of a month or six weeks they are let go round again, and given plenty exercise, and they go back to the production of eggs.  In this way those hens are made lay during the winter months when eggs are scarce.  I do not know if there is any scientific reason for this, or whether what I have mentioned has been well established. In any case I have seen this thing tried out and worked out by two farmers who were interested.  There is one man at present who is supplying 200 to 300 eggs a week to the market, while his neighbour next door has no eggs to sell.  I think there must be something in it.</P>
    <P>As far as this Bill and this legislation are concerned I must say that while it is doing good, and it has done good, as far as the egg trade is concerned, it has tended enormously to increase the overhead charges on the people in the trade.  The traders had to go in for building enormous stores which cost them a lot of money. All that has increased the overhead charges and an increase in the overhead charges means less price to the producer.  In any way it tends to knock the poorer people out of the trade altogether.  It has limited to a great extent the number of people in the trade and it has limited competition amongst the egglers in the trade.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect in connection with this matter of handling eggs.  It is this, that these eggs must be kept in the stores separate from all other goods and materials.  No other materials or goods are allowed to be put into the store with them. The reason alleged for that is that the eggs become contaminated if they get in contact with other goods.  If that is so I think myself that the danger of contamination applies not only when the eggs are in the store but when the eggs are being collected around the country.  If it is absolutely necessary to have these separate stores for eggs it is also necessary that no other goods should be kept in the vehicle in which the eggs are collected <Col N="240" /> around the country.  At present it works out in practice that the collectors of these eggs keep them in these vehicles with other goods.  As often as not the eggs are kept in the lorries or carts from morning until midnight until the collector arrives home. Sometimes, indeed, the eggs are kept in the lorries until the following day and all the time they are lying in contact with other goods and materials, more in contact in fact than they would be in the stores in the towns where such elaborate arrangements have now to be made to keep them separate.  If it is necessary to go ahead with all these elaborate buildings in the towns, it must be far more necessary to separate the eggs from other goods in these vehicles.  I should like to know what the Minister has to say about it.  I believe myself that if the other legislation was justified, they should go the whole hog or else scrap the regulations dealing with the houses in the towns which have put many traders out of business owing to the expense they would be obliged to incur on these new buildings.  I even go further and say that if it were feasible or desirable vehicles that could be confined to that trade should be relieved of the road tax and of the hawker's tax so as to compensate these people for having their vehicles confined to that trade.  The general principle I am going upon is that anything which tends to reduce overhead charges will naturally come back to the producer.  Competition will do that.  The legislation so far has all tended towards increasing the costs. The result of it is that the prices of eggs are not what they ought to be.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I should like to mention, and that is our market on the other side.  I believe that that market could be considerably increased and that our prices there could be considerably increased.  There is some neglect somewhere so far as our prices are concerned when we compare them with the prices received for Northern Ireland eggs.  There is no doubt that our prices are very much lower.  In some measure that may be deemed to be the result of the difference <Col N="241" /> in marking between the Irish Free State eggs and Northern Ireland eggs. I believe that is the only reason, because our eggs are as good as, if not better and fresher at present than, the Northern Ireland eggs on the British market.  There is, therefore, only one thing to do, and that is to popularise the trade mark of the Free State eggs, to make the consumers in England believe that they will not get fresh eggs unless our mark is on them.  At present their idea is that eggs are not fresh if they bear any mark.  I believe it is the Government's business to popularise the mark and to get back on the people who have no mark.  It is not actually that the eggs want advertising. I believe it is the mark that wants advertising.  If we go in for an intensive campaign of advertising the mark the consumers will have more faith in the mark; it will give them security for the future and they will look for the mark on eggs, rather than for eggs without the mark.  It is important that the matter should be dealt with immediately.  I have not very much further to say with regard to the Bill.  I may have some amendments to bring forward in Committee, but I should like to know what the Minister has to say generally on the Bill before I decide what I shall do.</P>
    <P>There is just another point I should like to mention, although it may not be altogether relevant to the Bill, and that is in regard to the egg grading, testing and packing machine that my brother invented, and which was exhibited at the Spring Show last year.  I am glad to say that we shall be in a position to put that machine on the market within the next few months.  It has been perfected, and although it has been considerably changed it is now much more efficient than it was when first placed before the public. We have done away with the straw-packing end of it.  The machine now automatically packs into these cubicle cases and, although the box is slightly changed, it is a better box all round. As I say, the machine itself is packing into cubicles.  Not only is each row filled, but the machine itself will automatically push forward the case, so that the next row of cubicles will be on the machine for receiving the next line <Col N="242" /> of eggs.  It is a very efficient machine at present.  It is a machine which will be practicable and workable, lend to efficiency and help further to improve the grading, testing and packing of eggs in this country.  Although, as I say, the box is different to the regulation box, it is a better box all round. It will be acceptable on the other side and, I have no doubt, judging from the enthusiasm and anxiety for its success shown by the Minister at the last Spring Show, that we will not find much difficulty in getting the Department here to adopt the box that will be necessary.  As I say, we hope within the next couple of months to place it on the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator MacEllin has very properly said that Mayo is a very important county in this matter of egg production.  He says that the value of the eggs exported from that county amounts to £600,000 per annum, being, as he said, one-third of the actual value of the eggs exported from the country. That is not, however, quite correct. Our egg exports amount to about £3,000,000, so that Mayo actually does, to its credit, produce one-fifth of the amount of eggs exported from the country.  It is satisfactory to have the statement made by the Senator, whose opinion must be valued in this regard, being as he is a farmer and trader, and a member of a family that has given very considerable time and attention to the development of a certain article which may make for the better grading and packing of eggs in every country as well as our own.  I hope we shall apply it to our own advantage in this country.  When he, more or less, welcomes the Bill, I think it is reasonably certain that we are likely to accept it. His few criticisms were not very severe. He did say that the regulations which are to be imposed by this measure are severe.  He said, as well as that, that the honest trader was not likely to be affected.  That takes all the bite out of the word &ldquo; severe,&rdquo; as applied to the regulations.  If the honest trader is not to be affected, we in no way, I take it; are going to set ourselves out to cater for or to make things easy for the dishonest trader.  He is the one type of trader that we must in no way <Col N="243" /> attempt to cater for.  It is an indication of the time that no great plea has been made in either House on behalf of the dishonest trader.</P>
      <P>Senator MacEllin gave us a picture of opening up a new line for the employment of girls who otherwise would emigrate.  He spoke of the departmentalisation of farms.  That, I am afraid, is not going to be such an easy matter. I have often heard it said, and have not yet heard it contradicted on the basis of any sound argument or reason in logic, that a farm could be run on factory lines, but I am afraid that the question of the departmentalisation of farms is going to provide difficulties that will have to be analysed much further than merely being referred to in such a discussion as this.  Senator MacEllin said that overhead charges are likely to be increased as a result of the imposition and extension of these regulations.  I think he might more fairly say that the imposition and the extension of these regulations might seem to increase them, but that really they did not do so.  He very properly said that where you have to erect new buildings and to add equipment that entails increased expenditure without giving adequate results you might seem to be going backwards somewhat. But the fact is that this increased expenditure is going to be incurred in the production of a better article which, if the ordinary economic doctrine applies, is going to command a better price in the world's markets, and if that better price is to be secured for that article, the return from the sale of that article is going to give back to our people something more than counterbalancing their expenditure. So that you cannot refer to the added expenditure without referring also to the increased monetary returns for our own people which will be actually for their good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator MacEllin referred to the circumstance that the price obtained for Northern Ireland eggs, and for British eggs, in the British Market is something greater than that obtained for Irish Free State eggs within recent months.  It is obvious to all of us that the British Government brought in legislation, entitled &ldquo; The British Merchandise <Col N="244" /> Marks Act,&rdquo; in which it was enacted that all eggs imported from countries outside Great Britain and Northern Ireland should bear some mark.  Because eggs were to bear that mark, whether they are our own, Chinese, Danish, French, or from any other country except Great Britain and Northern Ireland, it was an obvious deduction for the British housewife to assume that that domestic article which bore no mark was a fresher egg than that from other countries.  It was obvious that these eggs should command a higher price than eggs that were marked, and the result is that the domestic egg secured for the producer a slightly better price than the other eggs, including our own.  That is the position, and the main purpose of our Minister is to counter that position, and he is endeavouring to counter it by the introduction of this very Bill, which will make for the production of an article which will secure such a reputation that the British housewife will come to the conclusion that our egg is as good as the egg of the English producer.</P>
    <P>That, I take it, is his main purpose. Senator MacEllin says we will not do that without advertising our mark. But the very first thing before we enter on a campaign of advertising is to endeavour to build up our reputation and to put on the market a high-class egg, which is the purpose of this Bill, that will stand up to the reputation that we hope to establish, which will be uniform in quality, and then let us advertise it and make it known.  When we have done that it will be soon enough to embark upon a big campaign of advertising, and when that day comes I hope we will support the Senator if he puts forward such a plea.</P>
    <P>One word about the measure itself. I take it this Bill will amend the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act of 1924.  In attempting to attain this ultimate object it confers upon the Minister and his officers greater power.  Probably the Minister when introducing the Bill of 1924 himself had in mind that it might be necessary to go the &ldquo; whole hog,&rdquo; as some people describe it, in discussing this matter and to secure for himself such powers as are going to be given to him in this Bill.  Whatever <Col N="245" /> his mind may have been in that direction certain developments in the last year must have made the Minister make up his mind that this legislation is absolutely necessary.  The facts are that until a year ago many of the Minister's inspectors were employed visiting premises of certain Irish traders.  For some reason, with which I am not acquainted, these inspectors were removed to the ports for the inspection of goods in actual transit, with the result that, I think, they were not able to give the same attention which they had previously given to the goods on the premises of traders; with the further result that many dishonest traders took advantage of the position and placed on the market a very inferior quality of article for which they got a fairly high price which was secured as a result of the reputation which has been built up by honest traders in other areas.  The dishonest traders reaped the reward.  It was not a question of the innocent suffering with the guilty; it was a question of the innocent suffering for the guilty. That condition of things had to be altered, and I take it that this Bill is to prevent any repetition of this and to ensure that a better article is put on the market in future.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of talk about development at the present time and in the face of world competition it is rather difficult to hold our own even in the matter of the export of eggs.  But to develop the market requires that we put a better quality of egg on the market.  We should aim to secure quality as well as quantity.  Quantity brings its own reward sometimes, but one thing is certain that quality always brings its own reward.  If we want to get quantity we should first aim at quality.  By securing quality we will get a better price and as a natural corollary quantity will follow. There is a big field for development in the egg and poultry trade.  We export to the extent of £5,000,000. There is practically no limit we cannot reach in that respect.  It is in a way a home industry because the farmer's wife and the woman in the cottage can produce eggs and poultry just as economically as they can be produced <Col N="246" /> in the highly equipped poultry farm.  There would be very little extra trouble on the housewife to produce at least 10 per cent. more eggs.  If by these regulations we instil into the minds of the people that there must be greater care in the production of eggs and perhaps introduce better breeds of fowl, feed them more scientifically and produce a cleaner article, it is not asking too much.  I do not think these regulations will be in any way unnecessarily severe.  If they are a little bit severe and if they do bring the reward of increased prices and better reputation in the market then I think we should be actually glad to see such a measure put into force.  There is very little to be said against this Bill.  I could have said a whole lot more in its favour but I think it is unnecessary because I am sure the House will welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect of the question that I would like the Minister to deal with.  There have been very serious complaints in England recently about the quality and the condition of Irish eggs when they are placed on that market.  I think everyone was astounded at the complaints because of the very great efforts that were made to ensure consistently good quality.  I am reliably informed that the principal cause of the complaints is the delay in placing the eggs on the market.  There is delay in transport. Certain shipping agencies are canvassing egg dealers in various parts of the country, particularly in the west, and they get them to route their goods by Limerick, Galway, Sligo or some western port via a long sea route.  The eggs are taken at intermittent periods by the owners of lorries to these seaports, where the sailings are of a very irregular character, and where it is often necessary to store the eggs for a week, or maybe longer, to await a sailing.  Then they go at a snail's pace around the coast, with the result that by the time they reach an English port they are, in all fairness, unfit for human consumption.  I do not know whether the Minister has any power to insist that perishable traffic of that kind, which is being worked under State supervision, to an extent, should <Col N="247" /> go by the quickest and shortest route, in order to be marketed in proper condition to the consumer in Great Britain. I know that the attention of the Department has been drawn to the matter and that the complaint is being made that the inspectors are not doing anything in that respect.  The expectation is that these complaints from the other side will become more numerous and more serious as a result of this very serious development.  Above all, quick transport is of the first importance for a perishable commodity. If eggs are allowed to be dragged along a road at a very slow rate, then have to wait at the seaport for a steamer before they proceed by a slow route instead of a quick land route and a short sea route, they are going to be unfit for human consumption or in an inferior condition when they reach the consumer in Great Britain or anywhere else.  I hope that if it is in the Minister's power he will see that the inspectors pay some attention to the route by which eggs are consigned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no clause in the Bill referring to the marketing of eggs and other Irish produce.  I have been residing in London for the last three or four months, and I made it my business to visit several stores to ascertain if Irish goods, more particularly eggs and butter, were for sale.  I very much regret to say that my experience was almost entirely that they are not to be had.  If Irish eggs or Irish butter are asked for, I was invariably told that they could not be obtained.  They were not exposed for sale as other produce was, such as butter from New Zealand, and eggs, the country of origin of which was not specified.  Irish butter or Irish eggs as such were practically unobtainable. I do not exactly know what was the reason.  I do not think very much advertising is done; I do not think there are many people pushing the Irish trade.  We have a very efficient Trade Commissioner in London, I believe, but for some reason or other Irish produce is not to be had.  I think it would be a good thing if sufficient money were available to spend some of it on advertising and pushing, as far as possible, <Col N="248" /> Irish produce of that description, at any rate, in London.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if the regulations for disposing of stale eggs, or of eggs that are not fit for export, could be strengthened, so that such eggs would be destroyed.  From my experience, travelling through the country during the last few months, it is becoming quite a customary thing to have stale or bad eggs served at meals.  I am afraid we will have the same experience in regard to meat.  I put that up to the Minister, but he said that was not for his Department.  I am afraid our legislation in regard to the export of eggs has tended to have all the small and the stale eggs used on the home market.  I find that it is almost impossible to get fresh eggs for sale, even by paying as much as 3s. 6d. a dozen for them.  In my opinion that matter should be looked into by the Minister, and if eggs are found to be stale, or not fit for export, they should be destroyed, so that they would not reach the home market.  It is quite possible they do a great deal more damage to the people in that way than is gained by the amount of money brought into the country by the sale of exported eggs.</P>

      <P>I intend to support this Bill, as I have consistently supported every Act which has been passed in this House for the improvement and better marketing of agricultural produce.  I am convinced that the slipshod methods which prevailed in the past must be scrapped if we are going to hold our own in the British market in future.  The poultry industry is a very valuable one.  Senator O'Hanlon pointed out that our poultry and egg exports are value for £5,000,000 a year.  If we take into consideration the amount consumed in this country the production would possibly be value for £10,000,000.  Any industry that produces £10,000,000 worth yearly is worthy of consideration.  The Department of Agriculture has certainly done a great deal to promote the production of eggs and poultry but I contend that it can do a good deal more. <Col N="249" /> The production could be doubled if the people of the country gave a little more attention to the proper feeding and housing of poultry and the breeding of proper laying strains.  I would recommend the Minister to employ more instructresses to go amongst the farmers' and the labourers' wives to point out the necessity of having fowl fed and housed properly.  If I might make a suggestion to the Minister he should put it up to the Minister for local Government to give him a grant to supply houses for poultry in every cottage.  All the Acts and marketing regulations that have been passed have been all to the good.  My complaint is that we are not going fast enough.  On the other hand, the Minister has neglected to some extent, the most important branch of the agricultural industry&mdash;the cattle trade.</P>

      <P>Any person who&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  sells, exchanges, or barters, or offers or exposes for sale, exchange, or barter any eggs which are externally dirty or which are unfit for human consumption. whether such sale, exchange, or barter is or is not made subject to the condition that the eggs shall pass a particular test; or</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the amending Bill, we give powers to the Gárda Síochána which the inspectors had formerly, and we <Col N="251" /> are enabled to make regulations dealing with dirty eggs.  In fact, it is almost impossible to regulate the home trade.  What can the Gárda or inspectors do when eggs are sold which are bad, but which are not externally dirty and which look quite well in the shop window?  No inspection can be sufficiently comprehensive to reach every retail shop in the country.  On the other hand, an exporter whose foreign trade is being rigorously controlled is under a great temptation to deflect eggs which are not good enough for the export trade to the home market. Up to a point, I am afraid that that is inevitable.  We can control the sale of dirty eggs but we cannot get away from that particular tendency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that something should be done if it is possible to do it.  How you are to do it is the question. There are different grades of stale eggs.  There are eggs that are good in parts, as the curate said.  Then there are trade eggs.  They are eggs that are not exactly fresh, but they are excellent eggs to eat.  We eat trade eggs every day in the year.  Anybody accustomed to eating fresh eggs will know the difference between a perfectly fresh egg and an egg laid a few days previously.  You will get eggs that are not perfectly fresh but which are quite eatable.  When we take bacon and eggs in any hotel, we eat those eggs.  You could not describe them as bad eggs.  They are somewhat cheaper than fresh eggs, and they are bought by the poor and for confectionery purposes, and so on.  We cannot stop that.  The tendency of all this legislation will be to get the best eggs out of the country and leave the worst.  That, I am afraid, is inevitable.  The only way of dealing with the situation is, as Senator Wilson suggested, to let the customer try to get better eggs.  It is practically impossible to control the sale of eggs in the home market.  We have provisions here which give us all the powers which we would want to deal with the sale of dirty or bad eggs, but it is impossible to exercise them unless you proceed to make regulations governing the sale of eggs in every shop in the country and proceed to appoint officials to inspect every shop <Col N="253" /> in the country.  What we have done in this Bill is, I think, a step in the right direction.  We have given powers to the Gárda Siochána to confiscate dirty eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator MacEllin said that we have taken powers under this Bill to prevent export premises from being used for any purpose except the grading, packing and export of eggs, and he assumed that that was because the eggs might be contaminated by other goods.  That is not exactly the question.  You might have eggs and butter in the same shop window and the butter would not contaminate the eggs, nor would the eggs contaminate the butter.  Again, eggs and bacon would not contaminate each other.  It is not because a couple of pounds of butter might contaminate the eggs in the store that we prevent butter from being stored there.  It is a matter of convenience.  We want to have used a commodious store, with plant and equipment to deal with the eggs in such a way that they can be properly graded and packed, and to do that we find it necessary to confine the store to eggs exclusively.  That is the reason why we do not allow an egg store which is registered to be at the same time a bacon store or a butter store.  It is a matter of convenience&mdash; not because we are afraid the eggs would be tainted.  Certain things will taint eggs&mdash;onions, for instance, or anything which is contaminated itself, or odours or exhalations.  But you could have bacon and eggs and groceries in a shop and the eggs would not be in any way contaminated.  We cannot make any regulation with regard to lorries collecting eggs that we could not make with regard to a shop. I agree that a lot of harm is done by these lorries.  The eggs are collected sometimes under unsuitable conditions &mdash;perhaps in wet weather.  The lorry or the straw may not be extra clean, and there is no proper inspection.  It would be desirable if we could control the collection of eggs by these lorries, and it would be a step in the right direction if we could make a regulation that a lorry used for collecting eggs should not be used for any other purpose. But, again, can we do that?  To be effective, it would require an immense amount of inspection.  There <Col N="254" /> are hundreds of lorries of one kind or another&mdash;motor or horse-drawn&mdash;engaged in the transport of eggs or transferring eggs from the store to the shipper or exporter.  Can we control them?  I do not think we can.  There are quite enough inspectors being paid for by the taxpayer to administer these two measures.</P>

      <P>The Guards, after all, have certain duties in connection with law and order which they must perform. From the point of view of the civilian or the man in the street, it might be that the Guards could do a certain amount of this work.</P>
      <P>I do not think, when it is examined, that it is possible that they could do very much.  I always find, when new legislation of this sort is suggested and when I mention the difficulty about employing a large number of inspectors, that people generally say, &ldquo; What about the Guards?&rdquo;  The same remark applies to such matters as drainage. It is well-known that people do not clean their drains as thoroughly as they should, and that drainage in this country is not in as good a condition as it should be.  When legislation is introduced in that direction, and when it is suggested that it should be compulsory, people say, &ldquo; The Guards will look after that.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about arterial drainage now but about small drainage.  There are a hundred and one things which people do not do, but which they ought to do in their own interests, and it is suggested that we should introduce legislation and make them do these things.  At that rate we would have to employ every man in the country as an inspector, and people would still say, &ldquo; What about the Guards?&rdquo;  The Guards, for all I know, might do more inspection, but we must have some general principles in such matters.  It is debatable whether the Guards could do more inspection or not.  Even if the Guards did all the <Col N="255" /> work that a man could do in twelve hours in the day, you must contemplate the employment of a tremendous number of extra inspectors, and in that event we would become an over-inspected country.  In this country everybody is inclined to improve everything except the morale and character of the people.  Something must, however, be left to the people themselves.  Inspection will be no good if it tends to sap the character of the people and give them the point of view that they are entitled to do anything provided they are not caught.  Over-inspection would lead to that, and would be bad from that point of view.</P>
      <P>I think that the form of inspection which we have at present is drastie enough.  What I would like to do would be to devote our attention to the export of eggs; let us finish that and make it effective.  Let us confine our work within narrow limits and, having finished it, let us see where we are.  At some future date perhaps some other Minister for Agriculture or some other Department of Agriculture, heartened by the results of this particular experiment, may go a little further and introduce further drastic Draconian legislation.  Senator O'Hanlon really put my point of view and said things which I wanted to say on this Bill in a way in which I would like to say them. He made one point, however, with which I would like to deal.  He said that I had in mind in introducing this Bill certain incidents which happened last year.  Of course I had.  Things were in an unsatisfactory condition in England.  Complaints were made by certain merchants in England with regard to our eggs.  We examined the complaints and found that certain merchants on the other side were to some extent to blame because they held the eggs and did other things which they should not do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also found&mdash;and this prevents us from making complaints against anyone outside&mdash;that a small number of shippers on this side traded on the good name which our eggs had established and were taking advantage of the fact that we had taken our inspectors off premises and put them on the ports.  Incidentally, the ports are the <Col N="256" /> proper place to examine anything.  I may say that to my mind a small number of inspectors at the port are more effective than a large number diffused over a large area.  As I say, when we took a number of inspectors off premises and put them on the ports a certain limited number of traders took advantage of the good name which we had established for Irish eggs.  Of course, we hear all about their depredations and the results of their operations, but we hear practically nothing about the big majority of conscientious traders who still keep supplying a good article.  There was, as I say, nothing about them, because people in England expect to get value when they purchase an article.  When they get what the seller professes to deliver, they say nothing about it.  They just take it because that is their standard.  When, however, they get something worse than what the seller professes to deliver, they go to the Press and avail themselves of any publicity they can get.  They make open complaints to the Press concerning the operations of a small number of Irish traders who were not supplying what they ought to supply and what they professed to supply.</P>
    <P>I think that with the added strength which this Bill gives us, we will be able to get after those few traders.  In any event, I think we have had sufficient powers under the original Act.  It is a question of exercising them, and so far as the Department are concerned, we intend to exercise them drastically. The Act was passed in 1924, and when it was pointed out that these powers might be used, it was said that it was bureaucratic to give powers of this sort.  Nevertheless, there has not been a single case raised, either in the Dáil or Seanad, in which it was alleged that any individual or organisation was penalised unjustly by any administrative act of the Department, and that notwithstanding the fact that we administered the Act fairly drastically.  I think that that shows that if you administer an Act fairly all round, without favouritism of any kind, people will co-operate with you, even though it is drastic.  We propose to administer the Act of 1925 even more drastically, but also equally, in future.  We propose <Col N="257" /> to avail of the added powers which we will get under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Hanlon and MacEllin are right in thinking that it will be necessary to overcome the particular difficulty we were in by reason of the fact that English housewives have come to the conclusion that an egg without a stamp is fresher than one which bears a stamp.  There is only one way of getting over that difficulty, and that is to get a better reputation for our eggs. When people constantly buy eggs marked &ldquo;S.E.&rdquo; and find that they are invariably good value, then our eggs will get as good a reputation as those that are unmarked.  It is when we reach that point that we can advertise. I think we have nearly reached that point now.  It is important when you advertise eggs to ensure that you can deliver them.  I think, for instance, it would have been a mistake to have advertised our eggs extensively in 1925. The thing to do is to make the eggs perfect and then talk about them.  We want to be sure that we are in a position to deliver a standardised article, and when we are in that position, we can go in for advertising in a big way.  I am not saying that we have not done any advertising.</P>
    <P>We have done some advertising. What I mean is, that we have refrained deliberately from doing more advertising for fear our eggs would not be up to standard.  We have done some advertising through the Empire Marketing Board, and our trade representative in England has advertised in different ways, namely, through various exhibitions and by getting the cooperation of firms like Harrod's and Selfridge's to give displays of Irish produce.  All the big multiple stores have lent their windows for advertising purposes.  We have done a considerable amount of effective advertising, but, on the other hand, I admit that if we were sure of the consistent quality of our eggs we could afford to spend more money in that direction, and we would probably get increased dividends. We intend to advertise in a big way the moment we are certain that we can deliver the goods.</P>
    <P>I have not received any serious complaints about delays in transit. That is the point to which Senator <Col N="258" /> O'Farrell referred.  Shippers try to get out eggs by the shortest route and as a rule succeed.  There may be something in what Senator O'Farrell says to the effect that eggs are taken by long routes but such cases have not been brought to my notice so far. Another point is that when eggs arrived on the other side they were held up by shippers and left in the English stores.  We have information of that sort.  There is no doubt that a certain number of English shippers acted unfairly by holding our eggs up and selling them later as fresh.  We are precluded from dealing with that particular situation as we would deal with it, owing to the action of some of our shippers who have put us in the wrong.  We have adopted the principle that the man who seeks equity must do equity.  We have not been in a position to deal with English shippers some of whom, I may say, can be as tricky as anyone else. We cannot deal with these people until we put our own house in order and when we do that we can talk big and effectively.</P>
    <P>In regard to the point made by Senator Guinness I may point out that we do not sell much produce in London.  The Senator should remember two things in that connection. If he walks into an ordinary shop in London at present he will not find our butter there as this is the off season. Even if there was no prohibition on imported butter here there would be very little of our butter on the other side just now.  To a large extent the same remark applies to eggs.  For these reasons you will not find Irish produce in England at present.  London, at any rate, is not one of our principal markets.  Our market generally is along the west coast but this year we got on the east coast. This year, in fact, our butter went further in that way than last year. It has got to the east coast and into quarters of England where it never got before.  This was due to two causes.  One reason was that the price was particularly low and that the discrepancy between Danish and Irish butter was particularly great this year.  In that state of affairs, especially <Col N="259" /> in England where the consumer has not too much money to spend at present, people were willing to make experiments with Irish butter and big stores which never handled it before bought it.  I am glad to say that their experience of Irish butter has been extremely good.  There has been nothing in the Irish Press during the past few months except lamentations and wailings about the butter industry. While all that has been going on, I can state definitely that Irish butter got a reputation in the English market this year which it never got before.  It got into places where it never was before by reason, as I have pointed out, of the low prices, of the discrepancy between Danish and Irish butter, and owing to economic conditions in England.  I am assured by English buyers that Irish butter this year was better than in any year since 1924.  They had not a single complaint to make and I was told by some of the most important men in the trade that it had come to stay and that people who bought it for the first time would continue to buy it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is the reason why, as I said, it has gone into parts of England in which it was never used before.  I might say that, taking prices as a whole, there is not anything like the big discrepancy in the price of Irish and Danish butter that formerly existed.  This year the discrepancy fell in favour of Irish butter as compared with last year by a couple of shillings. Towards the end of the season there was a big difference in the price of Irish and Danish butter by reason of the fact that a large quantity of Colonial butter, which had been kept in cold storage, was released in London, and that brought about a big surplus.</P>

      <P>This Bill is divided into five parts, Parts II., III. and IV. being the most important portions.  Part II. deals with certain relations between my Department and the new Sea Fisheries Association.  Part III. deals with the licensing of auctioneers and salesmen, and Part IV. with the conditions under which fish must be kept for sale in retail shops.  The necessity for the Bill, in so far as it affects the Association, is, first of all, to enable me to hand over certain assets which are at present vested in me to the Association in order to enable them to carry out the task committed to them, and, secondly, to strengthen the powers of the Association to enforce the hire purchase contracts which we hope will be entered into by the members.  Clause 2 (a) enables me to transfer the boats and gear in the hands of the Department.  Clause 2 (b) enables me to transfer the sums outstanding and due to the Department in respect of loans previously made.  That does not mean that any borrowers who do not consent to this arrangement will be transferred to the Association against their will.  I believe myself that the method of repayment of loans under the new arrangement will be such as will make practically all the fishermen borrowers very anxious to avail of the new conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possibly, Senators may not know that the present arrangement for the repayment of loans to the Department is by way of half-yearly instalments. In the case of the bigger borrowers, especially when there was a bad slump in the fishing business, it was very <Col N="261" /> difficult to meet these instalments and, of course, many of them have fallen very badly into arrears.  Under the new system they will pay the Association out of the catch.  In fact, what will happen is this, that the fisherman borrower will hand over his fish to the Association to be sold through the agent of the Association, who will deduct a certain percentage from the cash received for the catch to repay the loan with interest, and for certain other purposes as outlined in the rules. One cannot say definitely, of course, whether all the borrowers will accept this.  At any rate I could not say definitely, because the Association would have to be consulted in the matter as to whether or not they will take every borrower.  I only wish to point out that no borrower will have his liabilities transferred from the Department unless he is willing.  There is just an element of compulsion which may enter into the matter, where outstanding loans are in arrear and where they are being written down, as I propose to do in a Bill which will be introduced early next session, immediately after the Christmas Recess.  Certain arrears will be written down very considerably, and a condition of the writing down may be that future payment of any amount left over will be made to the Association.  The second purpose, I pointed out, of the Bill in so far as it affected the Association is to strengthen the powers of the Association in dealing with persons who contract with them under hire purchase. Clause 3 should be read in connection with Section 6 of the rules of the Association dealing with the hiring of fishing boats and gear with the option of purchase.  I should first of all like to say that the word &ldquo;hire&rdquo; does not mean in any sense that a fisherman borrower might go on paying for ever and never become the proprietor of the boat or gear for which he is down as borrower.  You will see, under the paragraph lettered (j) on page 14, that after the borrower has paid up the full amount with interest he becomes the absolute owner of the boat and gear himself.  That is the method adopted by the directors, and is considered to be the best way of dealing with the point.  The present system is that each <Col N="262" /> borrower should find two solvent sureties.</P>
    <P>Under the new scheme the borrower will be given the loan for the boat or gear without any other surety than his own and the surety of the catch.  I believe this will be loyally worked by the general body of fishermen, but the directors of the Association felt that they wanted fairly strong powers to deal with the few persons there might be who would attempt to defraud the Association, and, as I contemplate, the person who has got a loan from the Association, who contracts with them to hand over his fish and who, instead of doing that, goes into some other port where an agent of the Association may not be and sells there instead of putting his fish into the hands of the Association so that they might sell and deduct the percentage to which they might be entitled under the contract.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any necessity to deal in any great detail with the character of the Association and the rules.  I might say that the rules are practically as handed to me by the directors of the Association.  I was against any avoidable interference with the rules because I felt that this was their method of dealing with the problem. The objects of the Association are set out at great length in Rule 4. I think they cover any activity necessary for the development of the industry. The organisation contemplated is directed of necessity, for the moment at any rate, by a central committee. There has been in the past no co-operative unit through which you could build from below.  We are building from the top downwards.  Provision is made under Rule 140 whereby regional committees may be formed and if there is any local desire for them eventually probably you will have an association formed of a great many local branches affiliated to that central body at the top.  In the meantime, pending the setting up of these regional committees the Rules from 130 to 137 show how the members of the committee will be elected.  It is a fairly cumbersome method and will probably be expensive, but the directors think it is worth while.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is provision made for payment of expenses for representatives <Col N="263" /> of the fishermen from different areas when they come to attend a general meeting of the Association. The aim of this provision is to give as far as possible every member a direct interest and influence in the society. It will also probably have the effect of making the committee more inclined to listen to propositions put up from the various branches in the country.</P>
    <P>Coming to Part III of the Bill, Clause 5 deals with the licensing of auctioneers and salesmen.  Perhaps I should first mention that Clause 4 provides that in any area which may be specified the provisions of this part of the Act as to licensing of auctioneers and salesmen will apply, and that its area will first have to be defined as one to which this part of the Act applies.  Clause 5 provides that as a condition of being given a licence as auctioneer or salesman, such person will not be otherwise concerned in the fish trade.  I anticipate that one of the primary works of the Association will be trying to provide better markets for fish, and markets in which the fish will be sold by auction, or some other method of negotiation, and the object of this part of the Act is to ensure that in every market of importance this transaction will be carried through by persons, and in such a manner as will avoid even the shadow of suspicion.  That is not intended to be any reflection on the way business is carried on at the moment, but if there is to be an extension of markets in different parts of the country, I think it desirable that the business of selling fish in these markets should be regulated in a manner above criticism, so that there may be implicit confidence in the case of persons consigning goods from a distance to a particular market.</P>
    <P>This part of the Act will not be put in force probably except at the request of the Association or some other responsible party.  Part IV deals with the conditions under which fish is to be sold in retail shops.  Fish is a very perishable food, and I think it is a matter not only in the interests of the industry, but also in the interests of the public, that it should be kept and <Col N="264" /> sold in a proper hygienic condition.  I think, also, that in fact these provisions will be good for the retail trade itself, because when the public feel that the fish is being kept under proper hygienic conditions, I can quite easily imagine that there will be a greater consumption of fish.  Clause 12 requires that there shall be a general state of cleanliness, good water supply, and so on; that a fish slab will be provided and that the fish shall be free from contamination.  Clause 13 provides also for the avoidance of contamination and the storage of fish, when not actually exposed for sale.  Clause 14 provides for the inspection in order to see that these conditions are carried out.  These provisions, under the Act, will become operative immediately.  I have no intention of starting off an immediate inquisition in the matter.  I shall look for an early improvement, but again I should be rather inclined to wait for representations from the Sea Fisheries' Association or some other responsible authority who would have a very direct interest in the conditions under which the fish were sold. I do not mean that I intend to let this portion of the Act become in any sense of the word a dead letter, but it is not my intention that it should be exercised in any way vexatiously.</P>
    <P>The only other clause that would call for any comment is Clause 18 which deals with the expenditure incurred in carrying out the Act.  So far as expenditure is concerned I do not expect any additional staff will be required for that.  We can deal with any inspection necessary under the Bill with the existing staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation of the Bill as a whole, and I am glad that efforts are being made to deal with the fishing industry in general.  There are just a couple of points which I would like the Minister to explain in connection with the administration of Part IV., if the Bill becomes an Act.  How do people selling fish from carts in the country districts or small towns fare?  Will they be affected under the provisions of Part IV.?  Secondly, I would like to know if the Minister intends to enforce sub-section (c) of Clause 13 <Col N="265" /> which states: &ldquo;There are not at any time on any date in such premises any offals removed from fish on any previous day.&rdquo;  It seems to me that that is a pretty difficult matter to enforce. Who is to decide it?  Is the inspector the sole arbiter, and must the shopkeeper be bound by his decision? While there are certain features in the Bill which I do not like, generally speaking I am in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on having introduced this Bill, the general plan of which I give hearty approval to, but there are many details, I think, which would require close examination and consideration before actually passing it.  I would like to say that contrary to the views expressed in the other House by certain Deputies I think the Minister is well advised in paying special attention to the retail selling of fish, that is to say, the regulations of sales retail.  I am convinced, from some examination and thought about this subject, that until there is a much more regular supply and a satisfactory preparation of fish for the consumer that the demand for fish within this country will be very limited.  It will continue to be considered to be a kind of penalty or punishment that people should eat fish, instead of being eagerly sought for.  Unfortunately, in many places, indeed, the consumption of fish is looked upon as a kind of penal provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think one of the causes of that is that the method of retailing has been so unregulated that the chances of getting pleasing, edible fish in a small town are scant and until that state of things is remedied and fresh fish in good condition and well served is easily obtainable we shall not have a real demand for fish in this country. I think it is wrong to assume that the development of the fishing industry will have to be dependent upon the sale outside this country.  Yet one hears discussions about the fishing industry being necessarily involved in the provision of large fleets of large vessels, which in the present state of the demand within this country means inevitably shipment to England and all the risks that that shipment involves. <Col N="266" /> I think the line the Minister is taking of proceeding to the regulation and improvement of methods of selling retail is a line which will lead to greater demands for fish and, therefore, a more regular market for that which is caught.</P>
    <P>The Minister has circulated a copy of the rules of the Sea Fisheries Association. He had told us here that he has accepted these practically as they were submitted to him by the directors. Looking through them, not very closely but still with a certain amount of care, I am inclined to think there should have been more examination by the Minister than he appears to have made.  Some of them are rather loose and involve powers which, when coupled with the Bill, may do injustice and may not be satisfactory.  I am inclined almost to think that the rules, in view of the powers given to the Association, should be a supplement or a schedule to the Bill.  But apart from that, we must have regard to the rules when dealing with the Bill.  That involves a certain amount of care in the examination of the Bill.  I take Rule 2, the definition of &ldquo;fresh fish,&rdquo; and the reference in Section 13 regarding a person who offers for sale fresh fish in contravention of the section.  Fresh fish is defined as &ldquo;fish which has not been salted, smoked, cured, or otherwise artificially preserved.&rdquo;  I know that it used to be the practice in the case of herrings, and sometimes of mackerel, to add a little salt and to sell them practically as fresh fish.  It occurs to me if that practice still prevails that the conditions of Section 13 in respect of some classes of fish can be very easily evaded by the application of a very light scattering of salt or brine upon what is nominally fresh fish.  That is a matter of detail, but it ought to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Section 2 gives the Minister power to vest in the society property which he has and which was handed over to him by the Congested Disricts Board on the coming into operation of the Free State.  I think it is quite right and desirable that boats and equipment for fishing that have been handed over to him by the Congested Districts Board <Col N="267" /> should be vested in the society in view of the functions they are to perform, but I hesitate very much at paragraph (c) of sub-section 1 which states &ldquo;any land situate in Saorstát Eireann which is for the time being vested in the Minister by statute, deed, contract or otherwise.&rdquo;  The Minister is the Minister for Lands and Fisheries, and while it is not by any means the intention it will be possible under this Bill for agricultural land to be vested in the society.  Further, there is no condition in the society's rules, which are not statutory, which would secure that the land which may be handed over by the Minister to the society should be retained and utilised for the purpose of the fishing industry.  Therefore, the proposition amounts to this: that any land at present vested in the Minister for Lands and Fisheries may be vested in the society, and the society may do what it wishes with those lands subject, I think, to the sanction of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo; And upon such terms and conditions,&rdquo; etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that, and was going to draw attention to the fact that when the Minister is vesting these lands on certain terms and conditions, the terms and conditions are not to be approved by either House as Orders of this importance usually are. They are not even to be subject to revision within the twenty-one sitting days, or, shall I say, to veto by either House of the Oireachtas as such Orders usually are.  I suggest to the Minister, not in respect to the conditions made regarding buildings and other equipment, but certainly in respect to the conditions regarding land that it should not be vested absolutely in the society.  I think that is desirable; that he should retain a permanent veto over the disposal of those lands by the society.  I think that is a very important point, because the powers that are sought, or that may be given under the Bill&mdash;it is not by any means clear what is the intention&mdash;would allow any land vested in the Minister, in respect of agriculture, to be handed over to the society, and <Col N="268" /> that the society may, subject to the conditions which may be imposed by the Minister and may be revoked by him, dispose of those lands in such manner as they wish.</P>
      <P>I now come to Section 3, which gave rise to a good deal of discussion in the Dáil, where it was modified.  I am not sure that the modification amounts to very much.  The modification amounted to the deletion of the alternative of imprisonment for a breach of contract on the part of a fisherman.  There is left in the Bill a fine of £20, or possibly £60.  Whether I am right or not&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;I think that in common practice&mdash;I do not know whether it is by any Interpretation Act or anything of that kind&mdash;the alternative to the nonpayment of a fine is imprisonment. But, leaving that aside, I am hesitating about the wisdom of this section for several reasons.  I am inclined to approve of it for the reason, quite apart from the merits of this Bill, that it establishes a principle which I do not think has yet been established in law, although in practice it has been admitted in the Trades Unions Acts.  It is establishing the principle that a voluntary society is able to make rules and regulations governing its members, which rules imply a contract between the society and the member.  Should those rules be altered at any time, then the altered rule remains the contract between the society and the member. The member is bound to that, and a breach of it would involve a fine.  It would become practically a penal offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very important principle, and I doubt very much whether it has been embodied in any statute hitherto. I am not sure that it is desirable to embody it in any statute.  There is just this point, that I am distinctly in favour of the thorough organisation of all kinds of all-embracing voluntary societies dealing with functional activities of an economic character.  I am inclined to favour giving such a society that authority over its members, implying almost statutory or at least legal control over the members of a voluntary society.  If, after thorough consideration, after <Col N="269" /> weighing the pros. and the cons. of that principle thoroughly in respect to all kinds of associations of this nature it were agreed to, then I think this ought to pass, but I think the principle has not had sufficient examination.</P>
    <P>I do not know, for instance, what the position is in regard to the Incorporated Law Society, whether a member who commits a breach is liable to a fine in the courts, or whether it is a statutory offence for a member of that society to break some of its rules.  It may be that the principle is embodied in that kind of incorporated organisation. But here we have a society which is not being legalised in the same way and which is not being given a charter.  It is a voluntary organisation which compiles its own rules, which rules are registered.  When the rules of the society have been registered, then the power to alter them is within the society itself.  This gives the society very great authority over its members.  I think we, at least, ought to examine closely Section 3 before we approve of it.</P>
    <P>Apropos of that, may I call attention to the fact that this section provides for a liability, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £20 on any member who, having agreed with the society to pay, in the manner specified in the contract, certain amounts with regard to the repair and renovation of boats, etc., fails to do so? If he does what the Minister says is possible, goes outside his contract, and sells his fish through an outside agency and in that way evades the obligation of his contract, he becomes liable to a fine.  But one of the rules says that the contract itself may be altered.  Rule 14 says: &ldquo;The form and provisions of the said contract ... may be varied at an ordinary or extraordinary meeting of the society provided that intimation of the resolution proposing to vary the same shall have been given in the notice convening the meeting and that such resolution shall be carried by the vote of at least two-thirds of the members voting at such meeting, either personally or by proxy.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the voluntary contract for co-operative marketing.  It is <Col N="270" /> not concerned with the point that the Senator is dealing with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that.  There is however a provision regarding an alteration of the rules of the society.  In the case of Rule 168, I notice there that there is a difference between a decision to alter the rules and any other decision of the society.  The society may at an ordinary meeting decide, by proxy or by person present, to alter any decision previously arrived at, but in regard to the alteration of rules it is provided that a rule shall only be altered by those present and voting, provided notice has been given, but I can find nothing in the rules which defines how the notice shall be given. Proxy voting may be very useful, and it may be necessary in such an organisation as this, but we should be very careful to provide that every member of this society should have notice of the meeting and of the purpose of the meeting, and that there should be no possibility of altering the rules without such notice having been duly given.  I may have possibly missed a rule which ensures that notice shall be given, and the manner in which it shall be given.  It must be borne in mind that many of these members will be in out of the way places, and notices published in the daily newspapers would not be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come to Part III, dealing with licences to sell fish.  I am not quite clear what is the intention, whether it is intended these licences to sell fish, whether by auction or wholesale trade, are only to apply to the selling of fishermen's fish at a fishing station or are to be applicable also to the auctioning of fish in the wholesale market. The section speaks of a district, the district to be defined in an Order the Minister shall make.  It then goes on to enact that a licence shall be granted to a person &ldquo; to sell by auction fresh fish or to act as agent for the sale by wholesale of fresh fish or to do both of those things.&rdquo;  It makes it an offence for any person to endeavour to sell fish who has not got a licence.  That raises some rather difficult questions.  I was speaking first of the selling by auction of fishermen's catches at the station.  It is not <Col N="271" /> to be assumed that fishing stations shall be occupied entirely by boats whose owners are members of this association.  In fact, it is likely that the larger fishing stations will be mainly manned by boats from other places, and I am very doubtful whether it is wise to make such a limitation as this in paragraph (d), Section 5, that the person to be licensed &ldquo;is not employed, engaged or otherwise concerned in the sea-fishing industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us take a place like Killybegs, or possibly Dunmore East.  If you had herring fishing and considerable fleets of Scottish or English boats come to fish at those places, it is not desirable, I think, that any local auctioneer who has a fish licence, and who may know nothing about the value of fish in the English market, and may have no direct contact with the markets, shall have a monopoly of the auctioning of that fish.  I know that in practice many people who are engaged either as owners or part owners of sea-fishing boats are also auctioneers, and they are in contact with the markets, and know the value of fish in both England and foreign markets, and it is better that such persons well informed about the value of fish should be capable of auctioning the fish on behalf of such fishermen as I have in mind.  I am leaving out fish belonging to members of the association. This provision deals not only with the selling of fish belonging to members of the association but fish belonging to others.  If perchance this question of licensing applies also to selling by auction in the Dublin market, there, again, I think it is not safe or desirable to limit the granting of licences to persons entirely disconnected with the sea-fishing industry.</P>
    <P>It has been found that boat owners are sometimes auctioneers and sometimes also retail fish merchants, and it may appear rather a strange thing, perhaps, but it is true nevertheless, that consigners of fish to the wholesale market often prefer to send to an auctioneer who is acquainted with the business at all sides.  I know it is alleged against the fish trade that <Col N="272" /> there is a good deal of chicanery, and a good deal of short knocking occasionally, but on the whole it is found that these merchants who are auctioneers and also fishing-boat owners are better qualified to market fishermen's fish effectively than the casual auctioneer belonging to other trades and who may have a fishing licence but who may not have direct or close contact with the fishing industry.  I am doubtful of the wisdom of that particular condition regarding the giving of licences&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be more than a minute.  I was going to suggest that the Seanad ought to have the opportunity <Col N="273" /> of dealing thoroughly with the Bill, and if possible, a Special Committee might be set up to examine with the Minister the sections of the Bill and the rules of the Association, with a view to improving the Bill and making it as valuable as possible.  I am very desirous the Bill should be a success, and I feel that it has not had consideration of the kind it ought to have had, and we ought not to fail in our duty in that respect.  I think the way the Minister has approached the problem is the right one.  I think it is well that he should take powers to consider the retailing as well as the wholesaling, and also, to most people the most important but not necessarily the most valuable part, the equipment of the fishermen.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that practically every suggestion that has been made within the last few years regarding the sea fishing problem, the encouragement of fishermen and their training, the provision of boats and gear, facilities in marketing and assistance in the formation of societies&mdash;all these are in a cycle that has been gone through.  We have had fishing stations established; we have had boats supplied to fishermen, and marketing arrangements and very successful fishing operations instituted, but they have declined, and we are now asked, not, I must say, in this Bill, but in speeches and articles, to go through the same process again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assumption is always made that if you put nets in the water the fish will come into them.  It is a false assumption, as the Minister knows.  My view in this case is that it is almost the whole duty of the Ministry in the matter to eliminate, as far as possible, what is necessarily a gamble; to reduce and eliminate chance as much as possible.  The fishing industry is a gamble from the beginning to the end, and the aim should be to reduce that gamble as much as possible&mdash; from the attempt to get the fish from the sea to the risk of meeting other fish in the same market with a consequent lamentable fall in prices.  I think the Minister, by the process he has adopted, is going a long <Col N="274" /> way to minimise the risks of losses which are natural to the industry.  I would like to help the Minister to make the Bill as watertight as possible, so that it will not be necessary to come to the House in a few months to effect amendments which we ought to have foreseen.</P>
