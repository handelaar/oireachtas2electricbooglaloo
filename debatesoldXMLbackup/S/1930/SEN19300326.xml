      <P>I desire to inform the House that, in the case of two Bills on the Order Paper for consideration to-day, the Ministers in charge of them are unable to attend. In the circumstances, it is desirable, I think, that we should postpone consideration of them to our meeting on Wednesday next.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health who is in charge of the State Lands (Workhouses) Bill is unable to attend owing to a family bereavement, and the Minister for Agriculture who is in charge of the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Bill, is unable to attend owing to illness.</P>
      <P>Ordered: That both Bills be put down for consideration for Wednesday, 2nd April.</P>

      <P>On this motion I desire to ask the Minister for Finance the following question of which I have already given him notice.  The question is in this form:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister has frequently stated that there is a liability on the Free State to pay yearly to Britain large sums of money.  For clarity I may mention two of the largest items:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  £1,000,000 (this year), being the sum allotted by the British Parliament for pensions <Col N="814" /> of the discharged men of the R.I. Constabulary, their widows and children.</P>
    <P>(b)  A sum of about £3,000,000 a year, being the amount at present of the land annuities.</P>
    <P>These with other sums amount to about £5,000,000 a year (at present), which when capitalised amount (probably) to over £100,000,000.  At the same time the Minister has issued official statements that the debt of the Free State does not amount to £20,000,000.  I think he has stated it is much less, but I put it at £20,000,000.  I would like to know why the items I have mentioned, which he has stated to be &ldquo;liabilities,&rdquo; are not included in his statement of the debt; and what difference (if any) there is in his mind between a &ldquo;liability&rdquo; (which he accepts and pays) and a &ldquo;debt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think if the Minister for Finance were to clear up this matter it would be a help to Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I need take up much time in answering the Senator's question.  First of all, if there is any reason for capitalising any liability in respect of pensions, there is an equal liability in respect of all.  That is to say, that if we should capitalise the payments made in respect of R.I.C. pensions in estimating the State debt, then equally we should also capitalise payments in respect of old age pensions, of civil servants' pensions, and all pensions of that sort.  In fact, if we were to capitalise pensions as a liability I do not know that we should not capitalise all other liabilities, such, for instance, as the payment of civil servants' salaries and so on.  Of course, if we were to do that we would reach a ridiculous position.  With regard to the land annuities, that is a liability that, fundamentally, is due by the farmers to the holders of the land stock.  The functions and responsibilities of both the British Government and the Free State Government in respect of these land annuities <Col N="815" /> are, as one might say, mainly those of a conduit pipe.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in reply to my question on the Committee Stage of this Bill, said that a similar case might arise with regard to old age pensions and to all other pensions.  He also said that the land annuities were a debt due by the farmers to the stockholders.  All these statements are incorrect.  The old age pensions paid direct to the people by the Treasury here are quite different to the payments referred to in my question.  We do not pay the R.I.C. pensions here.  What is done is that the Minister for Finance sends direct to the British Government a sum equal to the R.I.C. pensions, but our Minister does not pay the pensions direct.  I want to know why he does not pay the R.I.C. pensioners direct?  Apparently, the Minister has contracted <Col N="816" /> to pay to the British Government a sum equal to that which is paid to the R.I.C. in pensions.  As the Minister does that, it seems to me that he accepts that as a liability, that he cannot deny that it is a liability of the Treasury here to the Treasury in Great Britain.  Therefore I say that, if anything is a liability, that is one.</P>
      <P>The Minister's statement in reference to old age pensions is not correct. With regard to the land annuities, the money which the Minister pays over is paid direct from the Treasury here to the Treasury in Great Britain.  That money is not paid, and never was paid by the people here to the stockholders. The Minister knows perfectly well that it was paid into what was called the Land Account.  The Minister has arranged, apparently, more or less on his own account, to pay a sum, in respect of the land annuities, direct to the Treasury of the British Government.  If it was a case of the people who had bought land paying the money over to the stockholders it would be a different thing.  The Minister knows quite well that the people here never paid that money to the stockholders.  It was paid into what was called the Land Stock Fund, and in regard to that the Minister has undertaken to do an extraordinary thing&mdash;that is, to pay an amount away annually whether he collects it or not.  He has to pay a definite lump sum over each year to the Treasury of the British Government whether he collects it or not. In the same way he is committed to pay a lump sum over to the British Government on account of R.I.C. pensions.  Therefore, for my part I am unable to see how these payments differ from any part of the National Debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many matters which I might discuss on this Bill, but I do not intend to go into them now.  I am referring to these matters because under this Bill the Minister is taking power to borrow.  The Minister is now proposing to raise another loan, or rather a piece of an old loan.  In order to do that, and to obtain favourable terms, he goes around <Col N="817" /> issuing statements that the National Debt of the Free State is only a small sum.  I think he has put the figure at thirteen million pounds.  He deducts from that what he considers are assets.  As far as I know, the Minister has never put the National Debt as high as twenty millions.  I maintain that this statement of the Minister is perfectly incorrect, because I submit that you must take into account the liabilities of the State to a foreign Government.  I have mentioned two of these liabilities. There are many others.  There is a direct liability, not from the people but from the Treasury here, to pay over to the British Government in respect of land annuities a bulk sum whether these moneys are or are not collected.  I assume, therefore, that is as much a liability as any other debt.  I cannot see any difference between it and any other debt. Therefore, when the Minister makes out these reports in order to make the newspapers favourable to him and goes around acclaiming the wonderful benefits that have been derived, without going into debt, he was doing so under false pretences. If any business concern were to make the statement that its assets were so much, and left out all mention of its liabilities, as apparently is being done in this matter, it would very soon find itself landed in gaol.  Goodness knows what is going to happen Ministers one of these days.  I do not know, but something of the same sort might happen one of these days.</P>
    <P>There is also the circulation of the statement that this State has the smallest national debt in Europe.  We have that statement made in spite of the fact that we are paying five million pounds a year to the British Government for which we do not receive anything in return.  If that sum is capitalised on the basis of relative taxable capacity as between this State and Great Britain, and at the rate stated by the Minister himself, it will be found that the national debt of this State comes to the sum of £858,000,000, whereas the national debt of Great Britain is only about £700,000,000.  That statement is <Col N="818" /> quite correct, and nobody can contradict it.  Senators may laugh, but I defy anyone to contradict that statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>He will be very rash if he does.  There is nothing easier, of course, than to stand up and say it is wrong, but I maintain the figure is right.  The Minister has admitted that he pays five million pounds a year over to the British Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>For a period of seventy years.  When we are all dead the payment may come to an end.  We have been paying that sum now for a number of years, so that up to date we have paid a total of thirty-five million pounds to the British Government for which we have received nothing in return. As to the relative taxable capacity of the Free State and Great Britain, the Minister for Finance himself has put the figures at 66 to 1 or 100 to 1.5.  In the Dáil, in December, 1925, he stated that was the estimate made by the British Treasury.  I suppose he will not go back on that statement now.  If anybody chooses to multiply the sum I have given by 66 he will find that the national debt of this State is eight hundred and fifty-eight millions&mdash;that is according to our relative taxable capacity.  The British Government is complaining that their country is being ruined because they have a national debt of seven hundred million pounds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If any Senator takes the trouble he can make the calculation himself.  Take the sum of five millions a year and multiply that by 66.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would give you the figure of three hundred and thirty millions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="819" />
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>You have first to capitalise the five million a year. That will give you roughly about one hundred and thirty millions. Let us take it that the figure is one hundred millions, and multiply that by 66.  If Senators do that, they will find that, according to relative taxable capacity, our national debt is greater than that of Great Britain. Anybody who knows anything about common arithmetic cannot deny that fact.  The Minister for Finance also stated that we have the smallest national debt in Europe.  He goes around asking people to invest their money on that statement, whereas it is quite untrue.</P>
      <P>Somebody may yet have him in the dock for making these statements. I would not like to see him in the dock altogether, though I may say he deserves it for the way our finances are being treated.  He and other people have gone around praising this debt, asking people to put their money into what he described as the safest security in the world and saying it is a splendid thing for this country to have this debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any of us had a great friend and saw that he was getting more deeply into debt year after year, never making an attempt to meet his liabilities or to pay his debts, never balancing his budget but going on year after year borrowing money, we would surely say to him that he was going headlong into ruin.  We would not say to him that he had any reason to be delighted with his position.  The position with the present Government is that they are borrowing money year after year, sometimes five million pounds at a time, sometimes more and sometimes less.  They are getting more and more into debt, and all the time holding that up as an example of what wonderful things they are doing for the country.  I maintain that this money which passes direct by agreement from our Treasury here to the British Government is a liability of this State.  We are getting no return for all that money.  When the Minister talks about the assets of the State he must speak of its <Col N="820" /> liabilities, too.  The position with regard to the old age pensions is altogether different to the money that we pay over to the British in connection with the R.I.C. pensions and the land annuities.  The old age pension money is paid to our own people here, and there is no necessity to count that.  As regards these two items that I refer to, that is money which we pay to a foreign Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether the Senator desires that this matter should be treated facetiously.</P>

      <P>The smiles will not appear in print, and it may be that some of the lamentable doctrine preached by the Senator will affect certain elements in the country and outside of the country to the disadvantage of this country.  The Senator has put forward certain theories regarding the liabilities of the State and how the Minister had deceived the public by minimising those liabilities.  I suppose that one may imagine that hard-headed business men who are running banks and insurance companies and the like are just as capable of examining the national accounts as most of us. They at least, do not believe the story that the Senator has put forward, notwithstanding that they are well aware of the national commitments. If they did think that there was such doubt and such misleading as alleged I have no doubt that the National Loan would not be standing at its present figure.  If the Minister were tempted to examine the case made by the Senator, I would suggest to him, if it is allowable that even such debts or liabilities as are indicated by the Senator ought to be capitalised before you can arrive at the sum denominated debt, then equally the Minister ought to arrive, if at all possible, at the capital sum denoting the assets.  After all, the national assets are potentially very great indeed.  If we are able to capitalise these, I think that the accounts would be more clearly square <Col N="821" /> than the Senator suggests.  At any rate, my first point is that you cannot capitalise one particular type of liability without capitalising all the liabilities, and if we are going to capitalise these liabilities you must equally capitalise the assets, even potential assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnson said that the smiles will not be recorded. When I saw some Senators here smiling at what my friend Senator Colonel Moore had to say, I thought to myself.  &ldquo;Well, we are a very lighthearted people!&rdquo;  Did Senator Moore utter one word that cannot be substantiated?  What he has said is that the sum of five million pounds a year is being paid out of this country to another country in respect of claims which we on our part do not allow&mdash;that is, export of capital amounting to five million pounds a year.  Capitalise that in any way you like, and the capital sum is at least one hundred million. Senator Colonel Moore then went on to say that the financial strength of the Free State is only one sixty-sixth part of the financial strength of Great Britain, and that in order to arrive at the correct proportion you must multiply the figure of one hundred and five or one hundred and thirty millions by, I think he said, the figure of 66, and then do you not get more than the capital liabilities of Great Britain&mdash;with all her dependencies and all her resources?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very serious question we are discussing.  I am afraid that with all our smiles and our lightheartedness, we do not consider how serious it is.  Senator Johnson, I am sure, must have read a report which was published some days ago by a body in England which looked into this question of finance.  The Committee which published that report had on it leaders of the trades union movement in England.  The whole burden of their song was this, even as regards England: Bring down taxation in order that you may get employment for the people.  That is the burden of our song here to-day&mdash; bring down taxation in order that you may get employment for the <Col N="822" /> working man.  Pay what you are bound to pay, certainly.  I, for one, would never consent to repudiate a single shilling of what we are legally bound to pay.  I am equally certain that we should insist that we are not going to pay more than we are legally bound to pay.</P>
    <P>In the last three or four years Senator Moore has been an open protagonist of a particular movement to have an investigation into what our liabilities are in respect of this money that we pay to England. He has been a protagonist of that movement.  The movement has flourished under his inspiration, and no matter how much Senators may smile&mdash;and the smiles are not taken down&mdash;the people are thinking about what the Senator has said.  He has a case, and we want that case investigated.  We also want taxation reduced in order that the working man may get employment.  We are not in favour of this lighthearted, smiling, whistling call for increased loans.  So far as the national loans are concerned, that is loans contracted since the Free State came into operation, of course the money we have borrowed seems very small in comparison to the borrowings of other nations which are longer established.  I think it is wrong that we should continue borrowing. Senator Johnson said that we have potential assets, and should take account of our assets.  So far as I can see, the only asset that we have is an asset which we would spend if we could spend it&mdash;that is the grass that grows every spring. That is the only asset that we have in this country.  As for industrial development and the giving of employment, there is no such thing. There is no desire whatever for industrial development.  There is no genuine impulse in this country towards industrial development, and if the grass did not grow in the spring, you would have nothing.  So far from smiling at what Senator Colonel Moore said, I think members of the Seanad should take it seriously and ponder upon it.  I venture to prophesy that what Senator Colonel Moore has been saying for <Col N="823" /> the last five or six years will become the central and dominating factor in another six or seven years.  I would not say a word against members of the Seanad, whom I have known for the last twelve or eighteen months, smiling at a man when he makes a mere slip, but what I do say is, behind that smile let there be in your minds the determination to consider well what the Senator has said on the subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that it would not be wrong to do anything to destroy the effect of two Senators who have just spoken.  It would perhaps be better instead of smiling at them that Senators should pity them because of their pathetic waste of time on these ridiculous points which they have raised again and again.  The point was raised with reference to the R.I.C. pensions being paid through the machinery of the British Government, but the fact that that is so makes no difference whatever.  These pensions were arrived at on service given during the time of the British Government. The pensions of postal officials and the pensions of many Civil Service employees are paid direct by this Government to people who resigned since the change of Government, or people whose pensions were otherwise payable direct. They are not different fundamentally in their character from the R.I.C. pensions.  They are paid to people who live either here or outside the country as they choose, and the R.I.C. pensions are paid to people who live here or outside the country as they choose.  A great many of the R.I.C. pensioners live here, and the same applies to civil servants whose pensions are paid direct by the British Government to the Saorstát Government.  In nothing is the character of the payment altered by the fact that it is paid through the agency of the British Government, and in no characteristic whatsoever in respect of the R.I.C. pensions, so that these pensions are precisely the same as the liability in respect of any other pension, and to suggest that they should <Col N="824" /> be capitalised at 4½ per cent., 3 per cent., 6 per cent., or some other rate of interest that we choose, and should be added to our national debt is patently absurd.</P>
      <P>With regard to the land annuities, they are fundamentally a debt due by private individuals who are the borrowers.  They are from their national aspect in no way different from the debts that a trader here owes to a wholesaler in England from whom he has got goods.  They are simply private debts due by private individuals, and some of the creditors live here and some outside the country.  A substantial proportion of the land stock is held here, and a substantial proportion of the land annuities go to pay the half-yearly dividend on that stock held here.  If we were for any reason able to calculate the liability in respect of land annuities as a public debt, we would have to put against it the capitalised value of the land annuities due by the farmers, and we would have a cancelling out if we were to do that, but there is no reason why these private debts should be included in a statement of liabilities issued by the Government any more than an account of the debts due by any private firm which might have issued debentures, or have debentures held in England, or which might have bought goods in England and not yet paid for them. The debt due by the farmers is much the same as a debt due by a shopkeeper, or by a manufacturing firm, for the purchase of plant or the erecting of machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you go into private debts you have to go into private assets.  If we were to take into account for national purposes the debts due by private individuals to outsiders, then we have to take into account the assets held by private individuals outside, and as has been frequently said in connection with the income tax, they reach a very big sum.  But that would be a sort of thing that has no relation to ordinary governmental accounts.  Senator Colonel Moore began by seeming to suggest that the returns were inaccurate or misleading.  They are not.  Every <Col N="825" /> factor in connection with the whole matter is known, and nobody except somebody with the mind of Senator Moore would take the reading of it that he does.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if it is true that Lord Halsbury, who was Lord Chancellor of England when Wyndham's Act &mdash;which created the land stock&mdash; was going through the House of Lords, said that these land annuities were part of the national debt of Great Britain.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Section 3, sub-section (5).  To delete all after the words &lsquo;in camera&rsquo; down to the end of the sub-section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to give effect to opinions that were expressed here on the last occasion.  The section provides that all Court proceedings in regard to affiliation orders shall be heard in camera.  The second part of the sub-section makes provisions for publication in certain circumstances <Col N="826" /> where an affiliation order is granted by the Court.  There is permission to publish, and it is made mandatory, in fact, that the name and address of the person against whom the affiliation order is made, shall be published.  The effect of my amendment is to delete all the words after the words &ldquo;in camera,&rdquo; and to make no provision for any publication. There are strong arguments in favour of hearing a case in camera, as there are strong arguments against.  To take one argument against publication, unsavoury details may be disclosed.  I am disposed to think that whatever the other effects may be, it is desirable that a case should be heard in camera, but if cases are to be heard in camera, let that principle be observed throughout, and let there be no publication. The section provides for no publication in the event of a person against whom proceedings are taken proving himself innocent.  It was suggested that provision should be made for publication in such circumstances. I do not see how provision can be very satisfactorily made.  On the whole, I think the better course is merely to provide that the proceedings shall be in camera, making no provision for publication of any kind.  It has been argued that publication may nullify the effect of the affiliation order, as the person affected may lose his post or be ruined in business, and in that way the affiliation order could not operate.  I look upon this Bill as a protection for the lives of those unfortunate children who are born out of wedlock, and who have nobody to take any interest in them during their childhood.  It is not intended merely as a punitive measure against the putative fathers of the children. Unless it is so intended, I see no reason for leaving in the concluding part of the section.</P>

      <P>I am in the unfortunate position that an amendment I intended proposing to this section was late.  I am very glad of the opportunity of referring to the amendment which was proposed.  I agree the Bill has for its object the protection <Col N="827" /> of child life.  It is really the charter of these children of illicit love.  I support the amendment by Senator O'Farrell, but I suggest to him that it would be an even better method of dealing with the matter to meet the objections which were raised by the Minister for Justice. As the Minister said on the last occasion, the words &ldquo;in camera&rdquo; connote a kind of secrecy in the conduct of cases.  That was not intended and is not desirable.  My view would be that in a case where an application is made for an affiliation order power should be given to the Judge to exclude from the Court all persons whose presence in the Court was not desirable in the public interests. That would include all the Peeping Toms that come in to hear cases of this description.  It would allow the principle of the open court to remain unassailed, and I can assure the Minister that that is an important consideration.  You can carry your point in another way by leaving it to the Judge to exclude persons whose presence is undesirable. I would also leave it to the Judge to decide whether publication should be allowed or not. Gentlemen of the Press who are there in the ordinary course of their work may if they like take a shorthand note, but I would not give them the right to publish anything in connection with the case unless they applied to the Judge and got leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Farrell made a good point when he said that the Bill as it stands means the compulsory publication of the name of one of the parties, but there is no obligation on the Press to publish any names.  The Bill as it stands provides for compulsory publication, but my suggestion to the House is that the matter should be left to the discretion of the Judge to say whom he would exclude. It should be also left to the discretion of the Judge as to whether a case should be published.  There are many cases in which an affiliation order is sought in which it would be desirable in the interests of the parties there should be some publication. <Col N="828" /> A man or girl may be very seriously wronged by the talk that has gone on in regard to an affiliation order even before the application comes to be tried.  The only way that that wrong could be righted would be, perhaps, by a judicious publication of some of the circumstances that came out during the course of the case.  For that reason, although I support Senator O'Farrell's amendment, I think it could be further amended in the way I have indicated, and I intend to bring in a further amendment on these lines on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>With all respect to Senator Comyn.  I think the proposal he has outlined dealing with this matter would cause a tremendous amount of complication and difficulties.  The amendment before the House is simple, and does what is required.  It says these cases shall be heard in camera, and the sub-section stops at that.  That is a simple, straightforward non-legal &mdash;if I may use the term&mdash;way of dealing with the matter.  It is easily understood from the layman's point of view what the position is. We do not want to be hedged around with legal technicalities.  By leaving to a Judge discretion as to whom he shall let into the court during the hearing of a case would lead to endless complications.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Comyn's point is covered by Senator O'Farrell's amendment.  If &ldquo;in camera&rdquo; means anything it means the public are to be excluded from court.  I think if you want to reach the class of people the Bill proposes to deal with you must have these hearings in secret.  If people who get into trouble for the first time are dragged into open court, it is perfectly certain they will lodge no complaint.  As to publishing names, what is the good of it?  I listened attentively to what Senator Comyn said, but I could not see that he proposed anything not covered by Senator O'Farrell's amendment.</P>

      <P>I had reached practically the same conclusion as Senator O'Farrell as a result of the debate which took place last week on this subject.  I am not in entire agreement with the one point made by Senator Farren about the amendment being clear to the non-legal mind.  If you take the amendment and stop at the word &ldquo;camera,&rdquo; will that prevent publication?  Is it quite clear that a newspaper cannot publish?  I think it would probably be necessary to add words to the effect that no publication shall take place.  If you leave it as it is, we will not be in the exact position that Senator Sir Walter Nugent has suggested.</P>

      <P>There are one or two points I should like to have cleared up.  On hearing the Minister's speech last week I came to the conclusion that the members of the Dáil, when voting on this issue, had not informed themselves properly of the meaning of the words &ldquo;in camera.&rdquo;  I have endeavoured to inform myself as to their meaning.  In Halsbury's &ldquo;Laws of England,&rdquo; there is no definition of them.  I understand that if a Justice or a Judge hears a case in camera, a record is made in Court.  That record is not available to the public. I should like to be made clear on that, because I was in much the same position as Senator Comyn in being late with regard to an amendment which I wished to bring forward.  It is rather doubtful whether it is wise to have these cases heard in camera. <Col N="830" /> In this Bill we are trying to protect the child and not the father or mother.  The hearing of a case in camera is simply to protect these two individuals, and it is no protection to the child.  I do not intend to go further than asking the Minister whether he will give some information on the question as to whether publication of proceedings in camera by the Press is possible or legal.</P>

      <P>I listened very carefully to the debate on this Bill on the last occasion.  I have had some experience of local administration. There was always great difficulty in bringing these cases into Court owing to the examination of the mother.  The Bill proposes that if an affiliation order is obtained against a man his name and address shall be published.  If it is desirable that the mother's evidence should be tendered in camera it is only fair that the man against whom the affiliation order was sought should be protected likewise, and, in spite of what Senator Comyn has said, I think the way proposed by Senator O'Farrell is the right way to go about it.  If there is then any publication that an affiliation order has been granted I imagine that would be a matter of contempt of Court, but that is purely a legal point.  I speak subject to the correction of the Minister for Justice, but it seems to me the fairest way of dealing with the question is to carry Senator O'Farrell's amendment, for which I will vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in a rather awkward position, because I am an avowed opponent and enemy of hearings in camera, and now I find in various parts of the Seanad people who differ from me, and saying &ldquo;we do not know what in camera means, but we are in favour of it though we have not the remotest idea of what it means.&rdquo;  I notice that there appears to be a split in the Labour Party upon this matter.  One Labour Senator was in favour of leaving in the words <Col N="831" />&ldquo;in camera,&rdquo; as he said every man in the Seanad would know what they meant.  But another Senator of the same Party with experience of the Dáil and Seanad says that in camera is obviously a legal term, and &ldquo;for goodness sake tell us what it means.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to be the position at the present moment.  The only one as far as I know where &ldquo;in camera&rdquo; was used implicitly was in the Incest Bill.  There are certain powers for hearing in camera in the Children Act, but there it is clearly defined who can be present.  I would rather complete publicity in open court, but I agree more with Senator Comyn than with most of those who have spoken.  Under the Children Act where there are certain indecent offences against girls they have to be heard in camera.  All the witnesses may be present and also Press reporters may be present. That is how &ldquo;in camera&rdquo; was defined there.  If you are going to have &ldquo;in camera&rdquo; at all I believe you should have the Press.  It is another safeguard. It prevents a person bringing charge after charge and wandering round the country successfully victimising men.  There is also another thing which the Senate should bear in mind.  All men are not supermen.  Judges and District Justices are men, and it is a good thing when exercising their powers and performing their duties that the eyes of the public should be upon them.  I think that is a great help. A particular Justice who has got a fad in one direction might give no decrees in cases of this kind although there might be no more kindhearted person, and there might be another Justice who might decide in the girl's favour against the weight of the evidence.  That is possible, and it is highly advisable in the interests of the clean administration of justice that the public should know exactly how justice is being administered and that the Press should be there to report&mdash;not to report indecent detail, because that is guarded against by the Censorship Act&mdash;but <Col N="832" /> to report in a sensible manner.  Senator Esmonde asked me if there were publication would that not be contempt of court?  No, because the District Court is not a court of record, and has no power to punish for contempt of court unless there is contempt of court of a particular nature, <i>in facie curiae</i>, contempt done within the precincts of the court.  It has not got any power to punish for contempt of court which contempt is not done actually in the presence of the court.  If there were publication, even though the statute says there should not be publication, it would be a dead letter unless you prescribed punishment for the publication. I would again urge upon the Senate that, at any rate, it should not exclude the Press.</P>

      <P>I am heartily in agreement with the amendment. It puts things in the proper position. As to the suggestion made by Senator Comyn, I do not think it would work in the interests of those it is supposed to work for.  I think the very fact of a girl knowing that a Justice may clear the Court or may not do so, would probably prevent her from going into Court.  That has been the difficulty experienced by social workers, and that is why &ldquo;in camera&rdquo; has been put into this Bill, as a result of the representations that were made.</P>
      <P>A great many people do not understand why these cases should be in camera, but social workers and clergymen interested in these girls put their point of view before members of the Dáil, and stated that unless the cases were heard in camera the girls would not go into Court. The Bill can easily be amended afterwards if it is found necessary. For the present I think anything like what Senator Comyn suggested would only complicate matters.  I would ask Senators to vote for the amendment.</P>

Not to have the Press present, but to have a hearsay case published against either the man or the woman concerned would be, I think, more mischievous, and would defeat the object of having it in camera.  I think the matter would require more careful consideration before we insert this amendment.  We would need to have something more than that there should not be publication.</P>

      <P>This is a very simple matter, and when I was drafting the amendment I was under the impression that before this sub-section passed the Dáil there was some legal interpretation of the words &ldquo;in camera&rdquo; and their effect.  I am surprised to find that the Minister does not seem to be quite clear as to the definition, and that it may lie with the House to interpret the phrase.  I am rather disposed to ask the House to vote for the amendment, and if it requires any amplification it can be done on the Report Stage.  I think we should adopt the principle of the amendment.  Senator Comyn has suggested another arrangement&mdash;to leave the matter to the discretion of the Justice.  I see a good deal of practical difficulty about that.  He suggested that the Justice would be enabled to remove from the court what might be termed Peeping Toms and so on.  Would there not be an amount of difficulty about that?  You would cause a tremendous amount of personal offence to people.  A man <Col N="834" /> is charged with a certain offence, and the girl in the case can have no assurance in advance that various people who should not be there would be removed before the case came on. She has to rely on the chance that the Justice will remove those who should not be there.  Frankly, I see no object in having the Press there unless you allow material publication of the facts.  I am in favour either of open court in the ordinary way or in camera pure and simple.  I say there is really no half-way house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to make up one's mind how to vote on this amendment.  I agree that if we passed the section in the shape it is now in Senator O'Farrell's amendment, it seems absolutely necessary.  I was very glad to hear Senator Mrs. Wyse Power explain the reason for the sub-section, to induce these girls to come to court and state their case.  Unless they are given protection so that their names will not be known they will not go to court.  I take it that is the object of the sub-section.  Before the <Col N="835" /> House comes to a decision it should consider whether it would not be doing greater evil in trying to remedy one evil by allowing a clause to appear in an Act by which an accusation could be brought against an ordinary citizen, where the name of the accuser is not to be published.  There are temptations to have an accusation made against one class of individual instead of another class.  We have been looking at this matter from the girl's point of view.  But look what it means to the liberty of the subject. What happens?  The girl's name is not to be published.  She may make an accusation against an individual, and as the Bill stands the name of that person can be published.  In order to prevent that state of affairs, Senator O'Farrell is attempting to amend the section&mdash;a course with which I thoroughly agree.  I doubt very much from the discussion whether the people Senator Mrs. Wyse Power referred to are going to get what they want.  Unless the clause is altered much more materially than Senator O'Farrell's amendment would alter it, I do not believe the privacy they want will be obtained.  I think Senator Mrs. Wyse Power should look into the matter before the Report Stage with someone who knows more about the law and advise the promoters of the clause whether it will give them what they want.  I doubt if it is going to do what the promoters think it will do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point is that we are creating a state of affairs that in the interests of the community we should be very slow to create.  I would not like to be alone in my house with any clever and designing servant girl if my wife was away for a night or two.  If the sub-section is left as it is, is it not open to any such girl to bring an action against her employer?  For hundreds of years such cases have arisen.  Both the girl and the man should be able to secure justice. Senators want to try to do what they can for the girl and for the <Col N="836" /> child.  But in order to do that we must not put a clause in the Bill which has been proved time and again to be wrong, in all common justice to the community, to benefit one particular class.  Let there be justice done to all, and let the Seanad look at the class of people we will be dealing with.  We are not dealing with a highly moral class of people; we are dealing with girls whose idea of their conduct is such that they are not very particular about their honour.  This clause is a temptation; it holds out a temptation to prove a case as simply as possible.</P>
    <P>If such a clause were in any other Bill the Seanad would throw it out at once and would not give it legal sanction.  The Seanad should take more time to consider this clause before passing it.  I doubt if the proposal is going to do what the promoters think it will do.  I think we are establishing a principle of law that we should be very slow to establish and that we should not put on record the principle that one citizen can accuse another citizen of an offence and that the case is not tried in open Court.  Try to apply that principle to any other offence and it will be rejected.  I doubt whether we should break what is the great principle of common justice for the good that might be done under this Bill.  Otherwise the Bill is an excellent one.  I think we would be treading on most dangerous ground if we pass this section as it is worded.  If it is to be passed I would prefer to vote for some amelioration of Senator O'Farrell's amendment.</P>

      <P>May I quote some statistics which will to some extent clear up what I regard as a certain amount of sentimentality about the question of not going into Court?  The Commission for the Relief of the Sick and Destitute Poor reported that in 1926 when they made an examination of these matters there were two classes of unmarried mothers&mdash;one of them were first offenders, amounting at that <Col N="837" /> time to 629, and the second class, for which they catered specially, amounted to 391&mdash;that is practically over 600 of one and 400 of the other.

For a person who is prepared to blackmail a man open Court has no terrors.  It is the person who is not the blackmailer we want to protect.

      <P>I am sure that most Senators who have at any time been members of boards of guardians will remember that the difficulty that there always was in getting girls to help the guardians to bring a case before the court was because there was always an understanding arrived at which, of course, the girl who came before the guardians would not tell of, but which could be inferred owing to her unwillingness to give any particulars or help the guardians in any way, the understanding being with the man who has got her into trouble that if she in any way divulged his name or got him into trouble he would cut her off and she need never look to him any more.  That has been the experience in the vast majority of cases of this sort, and it is not the hardened culprit at all, the girl of loose character, but the innocent girl who falls for the first time.  These were the girls we found we could get no help from whatever.  Individual members of boards of guardians knew that that understanding had been arrived at.  The whole of the discussion here seems to range around these words &ldquo;in camera,&rdquo; as to which there seems to be no specific or definite meaning.  It is a technical term, subject to qualifications in the Children Act.  I would suggest that Senator O'Farrell should leave the matter over and not press his amendment at present, because I can see that what he wants can be arrived at by another set of words. The term &ldquo;in camera&rdquo; means anything or nothing.  We can put down in plain English what we require&mdash;<Col N="840" /> who shall be present and who shall not.

It is not specifically to approve of the provision that applications must be heard in camera: that is not prejudiced by acceptance of the amendment.  The acceptance of the amendment would mean that the following words shall be deleted: &ldquo;and publication of such cases shall be limited to the statement of the fact that an affiliation order has been granted in a particular court against a person whose name and address shall be included,&rdquo; that is to say, the part of the sub-section which everybody admits ought to be deleted is sought to be deleted by the amendment, and why that should be put back to another stage I cannot understand. It is quite within the power of the Seanad to delete the whole sub-section on the Report Stage if it wishes, but the idea of the Seanad would be carried out absolutely by the acceptance of the amendment.</P>

But if it means that the clause will be finally passed, and that anybody who votes for the amendment will not get another opportunity of saying what he thinks about the clause, then I would have difficulty in voting for it. But once it is clear that we can on the Report Stage have the matter fully debated again I will certainly vote for the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After the word &ldquo;findings,&rdquo; in line 35, to insert the words &ldquo;as relate to period of service.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is to say, that the prohibition, if I may call it so, of any review of the findings will be confined to a prohibition of the review of the report of the Board of Assessors in those matters which they were required to report upon by the Military Service Pensions Act.  If my amendment were inserted it would still leave the position as the Minister has declared it should be; but it would still make it possible for the Comptroller and Auditor-General to satisfy himself that the rate of pension that was being paid was calculated according to the rank and according to the terms set out in the Act.  The insertion of these words would not affect detrimentally in the slightest degree the case made by the Minister in support of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me remind the House of the procedure.  Under the Military Service Pensions Act an applicant for a pension makes his application to the Minister for Defence on a prescribed form, which application is referred to the Board of Assessors by the Minister.  The Board reports to the Minister on a prescribed form as to the military service of the applicant&mdash;that is the phrasing of the Act.  Section 3 (2) says &ldquo;the Board of Assessors shall examine every application, and they shall have power to make inquiries,&rdquo; and so on, &ldquo;for the purpose of making a report to the Minister as to the military service of the applicant.&rdquo; That is the purpose of the inquiry by the Board of Assessors.  The report is to contain findings upon the following matters:&mdash;The military service of such applicant in Oglaigh na hEireann, the Irish Volunteers, etc., the military service of the applicant <Col N="843" /> in the National Army, and the period of service in each of such forces.  So that the duties of the Board are clearly set out, and those duties have nothing to say at all to the rank of the applicant.  It is the Minister who issues the certificate of military service, which has to be according to the report of the Board, but the Minister may then grant a pension to be calculated according to the period of service and paid at a certain rate, to be based upon the rank of the applicant at the time he left the National Army, or in case of those who were already out of the Army in 1924, at the time they left the Army.  But I assume I am right in saying that there are at present a considerable number of men in the National Army who have obtained certificates of military service, but are not yet drawing pensions, and will not be entitled to draw pensions until they leave the National Army.  When they leave the National Army their pensions will be based upon the rank they had attained at the time of leaving the Army, and unless that is a lower rank than the rank held on the 1st of February, 1924, &ldquo;the rate of pension shall be based upon the rank at the time of leaving the Army.&rdquo;  It is, therefore, impossible for the report of the Board of Assessors, which may already have been sent in, to contain particulars as to the rank of the applicant when he has left the National Army, although it is true that in the form of report set out in the regulations there is a line which reads: &ldquo;Rank of the applicant as defined in Section 4 (3) of the Act.&rdquo;  I do not know why that should have been inserted in the form, and it can only have been of value in respect of those who had already left the National Army at the time of the report being made.  In any case, the Board was not required by the Act itself to make a report on rank.</P>
    <P>The point of the amendment is this, that the Comptroller and Auditor-General ought to be in  position to assure himself that the <Col N="844" /> rate of pension that is being paid is in accordance with the law and is not in excess of the rate which would be due to a person according to the rank he held when he left the National Army, unless that were a rank lower than the rank held in the old service.  But if this section is passed in its present form, even though a mistake had been made in the rate of pension, quite apart from what was granted for the period of service, in so far as the rate of pension was based upon rank there would be no cheek henceforth if this Bill passes in its present form. Therefore what I seek is that the prohibition of review which is contained in Section 2 shall be confined to the period of service of the applicant and shall have no relation or regard to the question of the rate of pension in so far as that rate of pension was based upon the rank of the applicant when he left the National Army.  There is no promise of secrecy, there is no likelihood of there being any difficulty with people outside the State when one is questioning, if it were necessary to question, the rate of pension so far as that is based upon the rank which the applicant held when he left the Army. That is information that is at present and that has at all times been in the possession of the Minister for Defence, and so far as it is within Ministerial knowledge, because there has been no promise of secrecy and because nobody will be prejudiced in any degree by the examination of the records in respect of rank, I ask the Seanad to agree that Section 2 shall be confined to those findings which refer to periods of service and do not relate to rank at the time of leaving the Army.</P>

      <P>I think that the amendment is very reasonable.  The principle of this Bill is, of course, to exclude from the review of the Comptroller and Auditor-General certain documents upon which public funds have been paid out and will be paid out.  Everybody will admit that in principle that is wrong. There may be reasons for it, but in <Col N="845" /> principle it is wrong.  If that is so I think it is desirable that the matter should be confined within the narrowest possible limits.  The findings of this Board of Assessors are on the military service in Oglaigh na hEireann, etc., and in the National Forces, and the period of service.  I agree with Senator Johnson that there is no conceivable reason why the rank of the person upon which the allowance paid to him is measured&mdash;which is one of the factors upon which his allowance is measured&mdash;should be kept from the review of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  If this Bill is necessary confine it within the limits of the necessity.  I understand that that is the principle underlying the amendment, and I would submit that that is a wise principle and that it ought to be accepted.</P>

      <P>If the case were as simple as Senator Johnson presented it, I do not think that I would have very much objection.  As a matter of fact, I think that really the case that he has in mind has been operative all through in the cases that he described.  To begin with.  I would point out that the regulations were laid before the Oireachtas, and are binding on me equally with the Act. In 1926, I think&mdash;at any rate some four years ago&mdash;the question as to whether the Board had to find on rank as well as on period was submitted to the Attorney-General, and his advice to us was that the term:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The military service of such applicant in the National Army would include a finding as to his rank in that Army.  The period of service is provided for in Section 3 (3) and (c), and the rank would be one of the chief matters of importance, apart from period of service.  This is recognised both in the application form and in the report form.  The appropriate pension is based on rank. Such statement as to rank is, in my opinion, a relevant matter for determination by the Board and <Col N="846" /> within their jurisdiction to determine, and is accordingly a finding under Section 3 (6).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson referred to a section of the Act which states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Every report as to military service of any applicant for a certificate of military service shall contain findings upon the following matters, that is to say:</P>
    <P>(a)  the military service of such applicant in Oglaigh na hEireann or in the Irish Volunteers or in the Irish Citizen Army or in Fianna Eireann or in the Hibernian Rifles; and</P>
    <P>(b)  the military service of such applicant in the National Forces or the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann; and</P>
    <P>(c)  the period of the service of such applicant in each such force or body as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>In paragraphs (a) and (b) it is set out that they must give their military service, specifying their respective services in each of these; in paragraph (c) it says, as something distinct from (a) and (b), that they must state the period of the service. I think that if what Senator Johnson says, namely, that with regard to (a)&mdash;the military service of such applicant in Oglaigh na hEireann and these other bodies&mdash;meant only the period of service, then I do not see why there is the statement that they must also bring in a finding as to the period of service.  That seems to me to have been indicated there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator will notice that (a) and (b) say that they want information as to military service, and (c) says that they want information as to the period of service.  Incidentally, whether I am right or wrong, the regulation is equally binding on me&mdash;and it was presented to the Oireachtas in due form&mdash;as the Act.  The legal advice we had on the matter some four years ago, as I said, was to the effect that the military service included a finding as to rank.  Now Senator Johnson brings up the case of men who are in the Army now. A man may be a lieutenant now; he may leave in three years as a major&mdash;I think that is the sort of <Col N="848" /> case he has in mind&mdash;and he says that when it comes to the real deciding factor as to what that man's rank for pension purposes is, it will be according to the records in my office, unless it be that the Board finds that he had a higher rank in the previous body than he has at the time of leaving.  The report of the Board has been available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General all through; there has never been any question about that.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General has a right to ask for any papers that are in my possession, and at any time he could do so if he saw that so-and-so had gone out and had got a pension with his rank assessed on leaving the Army as a colonel.  That was made perfectly clear to him by the report, which was available to him too.  But if he had reason to doubt whether that man was a colonel or not he then has the right and the power to ask for the file of that officer and see what his rank was.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, I see no objection whatever to the Comptroller and Auditor-General, or any other competent person, coming to me and saying: &ldquo;This man has gone out of the Army as a colonel.  We would like to see what proof there is that he was a colonel.&rdquo;  The Comptroller and Auditor-General would be perfectly justified in asking me that, I think.  But the Senator is aware that in an earlier period in the Army we had not complete records.  I have no doubt that there are cases of men drawing pensions implying that they had service in the National Army and we may not have any record of the service, because in the early days there were occasionally no records, or incomplete or inaccurate records.  In such a case the Board had to consider the question of rank, based upon evidence put before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I understand what Senator Johnson has in mind.  Before the Board brings in its report it applies to me for a certificate as to rank, and a certificate as to the rank is supplied.  Senator Johnson says <Col N="849" /> it may be that I, or somebody under me, would attribute a higher rank to a man than that actually held by him.  He states that there should be means of finding out whether that was done or not.  I think that that means exists.  If I have not records of the earlier period certainly the Board would have to find on something other than records.  Where the Board has found that the higher rank was the rank on leaving the Army, and when it based its assessment on that rank on a certificate from my Department, it will be found on the records in my Department. These records are available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson may say that this thing does not allow the Comptroller and Auditor-General to take action. It does not, I suppose, but he can report to the Public Accounts Committee that as far as he can see a man is drawing a pension as a colonel who had not been a colonel. That may happen.  Of course, it may be that the man in pre-Truce days, or in the early period before our records began, held a rank which had to be assessed as equivalent nowadays, say, to that of a colonel.  In these cases there is no difficulty, but in any real case where there is a question as to whether the certificate, being itself based upon a report from my Department, of his rank on leaving the Army, and there is doubt whether it might not imply a rank higher than he held, the Comptroller and Auditor-General has power to ask for these papers from my office.  What would be the position?  I am speaking a bit away from my book, but I think in pretty well every case where the finding of the Board was higher than the actual rank of the man leaving the Army we referred the thing back to the Board.  I would not say that was done entirely, but I think it was generally done.</P>
    <P>In such a case if Senator Johnson or somebody else came to me and said: &ldquo;This man was in the Army until 1927 and left the Army then with the rank of captain, but his pension is that of major.  How is <Col N="850" /> that?&rdquo;  If it seemed that the rank for pension purposes was based upon his rank on leaving the Army, then naturally I would summon the Board together again and say: &ldquo;This may have been a case of a mistake, and I would ask you to go into the case again.&rdquo;  But the Board may have based its finding of rank on evidence which was put before it but which is not now available.  I think the Senator will understand that in some of the early periods&mdash;in 1924 or some earlier period&mdash;we did not always have records and that the only means of assessing the rank was the evidence put before the Board. In those cases the Comptroller and Auditor-General is excluded, as I am excluded.  In other cases any documents which are available to me are available to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  But I think that the Senator, in moving the amendment, has presumed that in every case the finding of rank was based on the rank at the time of leaving the Army, which itself was based upon the certificate supplied by my Department.  I think the case he has in mind can be met, but his amendment to my mind does tend. first of all, to a reading of the Act which is against our legal advice as to the meaning of the Act, and, secondly, it tends to segregate certain aspects of evidence from the evidence that was put before the Board and to review that evidence. I think that the case put by Senator Johnson may be met without this amendment, but I think the amendment as it is would do much more than Senator Johnson has thought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a case in regard to officers whose ranks were not very clear or definite up to 1924 in the Minister's records; but this Bill is not dealing only with pre-1924 officers, and while I make no concession from the case I made on the Second Reading as to the general question, let us for the moment assume that he is right in respect of the pre-1924 service.  Let us take 1928 or 1929 service.  An officer is leaving the Army in 1929 or <Col N="851" /> 1930 and he is entitled to a military service pension based on the rank which he held at the time of leaving. That is not contained in the report upon which the military service certificate is granted.  Therefore the rate of pension cannot be assessed on the report of the Board of Assessors, it has to be calculated according to the rank at which the man left the service.</P>
      <P>The Minister asks us to trust to his or his successor's willingness to reconstitute the Board and request it to go into the case on account of new evidence.  But here we come to the kernel of the whole question.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General has authority under the Constitution to check the spending of State funds by the Minister.  The Minister says &ldquo;If you bring forward any indication to me that something is doubtful or not quite satisfactory, I am willing, or I may be willing, to call into being a new Board of Assessors and ask that new Board to review the evidence which I will allow to be handed over.&rdquo;  That seems to me to be limiting the authority, the power and the control of the Comptroller the Auditor-General and we ought not to agree to it.  If the Seanad concedes, as it has done, anything in deference to the plea of the Minister in regard to all the difficulties surrounding the revolutionary activities and so on, well, so far so good.  It is accepted.  But here we have a question which does not at all touch these revolutionary activities. It deals with the services of men in 1930, and yet the Comptroller and Auditor-General is going to be debarred from auditing except at the discretion of the man whose accounts are being audited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the least the Seanad can do in this matter is to ensure that, so far as the moneys that have been paid away on the basis of services rendered in 1930 in the National Army are concerned, that these shall be subject to the full and undoubted audit of the Comptroller and Auditor-General. If the Minister says that right should be retained by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, <Col N="852" /> except for pre-1924 cases, well, there is a way in which his case can be met.  That is to say, the provision regarding the period of service referred to in my amendment, may be held not to apply to the pensions of men who left the Army in 1924.  In that case we would be only ensuring that the Comptroller and Auditor-General would have the continued right to audit as fully as he wished in respect of the rank of those cases where the Minister had the knowledge within his possession.</P>
    <P>He said that, as regards the 1924 cases, the knowledge was not in his full possession, but in these latter cases the knowledge is in his possession, so that there should be no barrier against the auditing of them, even conceding all that the Minister urged in his argument on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>First, as to the effect of putting this word &ldquo;rank&rdquo; into the report of the Board of Assessors, I would point out to the Minister that, notwithstanding his argument as to the effect of Section 3, sub-section (3), all these separate lines regarding the period of service make no reference to the rank in the separate forces mentioned.  Rank is defined by sub-section (3) of Section 4 as follows:</P>
    <P>Every military service pension shall be based upon the rank of the applicant at the time of his discharge from the National Forces or from the Defence Forces of Saorstát Eireann or the rank held by him on the 1st day of February, 1924, whichever of those ranks shall be the higher ...</P>
    <P>so that when the Board of Assessors were asked in these forms to indicate the rank defined by sub-section (3) of section 4 of the Act, it was the rank at the time of the applicant's discharge and not the rank held in these various forces&mdash;Oglaigh na hEireann, the Irish Volunteers, the Irish Citizen Army, Fianna Eireann, or the Hibernian Rifles.  Therefore, the case which the Minister built up on that proposition falls completely and cannot be sustained.</P>

      <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides that:</P>
      <P>So much of sub-section (6) of Section 3 of the Principal Act as enacts that the findings of the Board of Assessors set out in their report shall in all cases be final and conclusive and binding upon the applicant is hereby repealed and in lieu thereof it is hereby enacted that such findings as so set out shall be and, in the case of findings set out in a report made before the passing of this Act, be deemed always to have been final and conclusive.</P>
      <P>Take, for instance, a case such as the Senator referred to, that there is a man in the Army now who last year was a lieutenant.  He may be in the Army now as a colonel.  My trouble is that it does not follow that a pension is going to be based upon his rank on leaving the Army. If that was so the matter would be perfectly simple.  In the case of a man leaving the Army his rank is based on his rank as published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  It is in my office and is available for the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  On that point I am entirely with Senator Johnson. I do not say that these things become more or less available for that officer by virtue of anything in this Act or anything that the Senator may have put into it.</P>

      <P>It does not say anything of the kind.  Sub-section (3) of section 4 says that every military service pension shall be based upon the rank of the applicant at the time of his discharge, or the rank held by him on the 1st day of February, 1924, whichever of those ranks shall be the higher.  He is reported then by the Board of Assessors, some time after 1924, to have been a colonel or a major.  That is binding upon the Minister.  It cannot be reviewed by the Comptroller and Auditor-General nor can it be reviewed by any authority whatsoever except at the discretion, first of the Minister, and second of the Board.  Notwithstanding the possibility that this report with regard to the rank of the pensioner is wrong, there is no review of it.  Despite the knowledge upon which a pension has been calculated, that the applicant is, say, a colonel in the Minister's office and a major in the report, the report is not reviewable.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General may have the information, and if he raised the question in the past it may or may not have been objected to.  Here we are now saying with malice aforethought, as I should say, that henceforward the Comptroller and Auditor-General can be stopped from looking at these things if you wish, looking at these things if the Minister wishes.  The Minister may grant permission; he may be willing that the evidence as to rank should be made available; he may think that desirable, but if he wishes he may prevent any question as to rank being raised, because it has already been decided by the report of the Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave private notice to the Minister that I proposed to raise a question with the object of enabling him to make a statement with authority with regard to the Army and polities.  Those who read Sunday newspapers will probably have seen in the &ldquo;Sunday Independent&rdquo; a translation of a leading article which appeared in a weekly paper called the &ldquo;Star.&rdquo;  The paper is fairly well known in a general way to be expressing the views of the Party which constitute the Government, and it is credibly believed to be inspired, and its editorial policy directed if not written, by prominent members of the Executive Council.  I am not asking that any member of the Executive Council in his individual capacity should refrain from going a little beyond what his membership of the Executive Council would require. In view of the important questions discussed in this article, and possibly, the unintentional meaning to be taken out of it, I think it is desirable the matter should be ventilated. The article was written in Irish, and a translation of portions of it appeared in this Sunday paper. I have had a separate translation made of the article and I think the greater part of it is sound doctrine, but the latter part seems to me to contain a kind of doctrine that has been treated as reprehensible and dangerous&mdash;first in respect of the Ulster Covenanting agitation, and, second, in respect of the agitation which Ministers fought so resolutely. The latter part of the article says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the Government are the servants of the people.  If it were apparent that they were not obedient to the people, it would no longer be necessary that the Army should be obedient to them.  An officer of <Col N="859" /> the Army, speaking to the Cadet Corps in Galway University College a couple of weeks ago, said that if Fianna Fáil were to come into power and were to proceed to change the Constitution, the Army would have no business to interfere. In a way that was true.  But if Fianna Fáil were to set about changing the Constitution against the will of the people, or if they were to set about reducing the Constitution to fragments, with a view to depriving the people of their supreme authority, it would be a different state of affairs, in our opinion.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the Fianna Fáil Government would be only a tyranny.  There is no more important duty on a citizen than the preservation of our freedom and the smashing of any tyranny which is established.  It is difficult to destroy a tyranny except with sword and rifle.  If it should become a duty to destroy a tyranny in the Saorstát, it would be the duty of the soldier to move first, as he is best equipped for the work.  Thus, the position is: Fianna Fáil has nothing to fear from the Army if they are good boys; but if they are bad boys, the Army will be highly dangerous to them.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the doctrine there is one which is quite definitely antagonistic to the sound doctrine which the Minister has so often preached himself regarding the Army.  The Executive Council at any time, according to our Constitution, is set up by and is responsible to and may be removed by the Dáil. When the Executive Council ceases to command a majority in the Dáil it ceases to hold office, and in our method of Government the only test whereby one can judge whether a Government is doing the will of the people is the fact that it retains a majority in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>If a Fianna Fáil Government is in office presumably it has the support <Col N="860" /> of a majority of the Dáil.  The suggestion here is that the Army may be the judge and that if it is not satisfied that the Dáil by holding in office a Fianna Fáil Government is fulfilling the will of the people then the Army may come in and destroy the tyranny.  Therefore, it would seem incumbent on the Army, as such, to make itself conversant with the course of public policy and of the will of the people.  If at any time it adjudged that the Government was not carrying out the will of the people, then it would be for the Army to step in.  That is a doctrine that has been popular in some countries in recent years, but it is not the doctrine the Minister has latterly preached.  In view of the circumstances of the publication of this article, and in view of the possibility that it will be taken as representing the views of the Ministry, or at least of influential elements in the Ministry, I thought it well the Minister should have an opportunity of stating with some precision what is the Executive Council's view of the duty of the Army in relation to the Executive Government.</P>
    <P>According to the Defence Forces Act which we are now about to renew, the Executive Council is Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and its officers are bound by their oath and by law to obey the lawful commands of the Executive Council.  It is surely not a good doctrine, and it is certainly not a constitutional doctrine, to preach that the Army should be judge of what is the will of the people, when there is a Parliament with an Executive responsible to it to determine what the will of the people is.  Perhaps the Minister himself had a considerable amount of influence in persuading the Oireachtas a year or two ago to deprive the people of their right to a referendum, and is very much responsible for ensuring that this Oireachtas which represents the people is responsible for defining what the will of the people is.  To preach any doctrine which might be interpreted as meaning that the Army is to be the judge of what the <Col N="861" /> will of the people is, and that if it thinks the will of the people is not being carried out by the Executive Council for the time being, it is for the Army to step in and remove that Executive is surely a very reprehensible doctrine, and I hope the Minister will not give the slightest encouragement to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRobinson" hpid="Mr. Robinson Mr. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister when he intends to bring in a permanent Defence Forces Act.  When I asked the Minister last year when he intended to bring in a permanent measure I did so because I thought it well that the Army should have some sense of security.  Since then the Minister has introduced a Military Service Pensions Bill, and created a new Army under the name of a Volunteer Force without the sanction of the Oireachtas.  That is why I am anxious to know whether he is going to bring in a permanent Bill this year or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a suggestion in Senator Robinson's speech that I created a new Army against the will of the Oireachtas.  I say anything I did was within the powers given to me by the Oireachtas. If any one suggests that I exceeded those powers, or that I arrogated to myself powers that I never possessed, that is a sort of remark I am not satisfied to sit down under.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRobinson" hpid="Mr. Robinson Mr. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister knows there was a very great stretching of his powers in connection with the creation of the Volunteer Force.  He put men into the permanent Army for about three minutes and then transferred them to the Volunteer Force Reserve. There is no use in saying that that was perfectly legal.  It was more or less a trick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Senator.  The bringing in of the permanent Act depends on the length of time it takes me to get a proper conception of the ultimate form of the Army.  Senator Johnson sent me word that he was going to raise a question regarding the <Col N="862" /> article.  I got the article and read it.  I agree with Senator Johnson, but I was unable to follow his translation. I did notice that his translation is not exact.  A sentence in the original article&mdash;&ldquo;Is deacair, de ghnáth tíorantacht a bhrise ach amháin le faobhar claidhimh agus airm theine&rdquo;&mdash;should be translated &ldquo;It is usually difficult to break a tyranny except by means of sword and firearms.&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;usual&rdquo; there makes a certain difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the article brings in a certain number of hypotheses.  The first part of the article says that it is part of the Army's duty to defend the Constitution of the country.  In saying that the Army should interfere it postulates beforehand that constitutional government has ceased to exist and that a tyranny exists in its place.  What would be the position in that case?  It is hard to say.  I agree with Senator Johnson that as long as there is constitutional government with the Dáil and the Seanad &mdash;the Oireachtas&mdash;with a Government answerable to them according to the law of the land, the Army has no duty but to obey the orders of the Government.  When he raises the question of what I might call hypothetical constitutional law, if the Government gave orders to civil servants or the Army which were beyond the powers of the Government, or if the Government itself were not constitutionally constituted, or if it gave orders contrary to the law, speaking as a layman without special knowledge, then I am afraid it is their duty to obey that law.  If, for instance, the Minister for Finance asked the Department of Finance to hand over certain money to him, and not in accordance with law, the civil servant knows if he does that he could be prosecuted for doing it. I agree that it is the duty of armies to be submissive and obedient to the lawfully constituted Government of the State.  As long as the Government is a Government, and as long as it has not ceased to be so by virtue of some act or lack of act, undoubtedly the Army must obey. Where there is no Government there <Col N="863" /> is a condition of anarchy, and in that case I do not know&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The article says: &ldquo;If Fianna Fáil were to set about changing the Constitution against the will of the people.&rdquo;  I take it they cannot change the Constitution except by lawful means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If they change the Government by lawful means they are still the Government and the Army must obey.  If that is the point the Senator wants to make I agree, but I think I made my position perfectly clear on that point on many occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move for leave to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to continue the Shop Hours (Drapery Trades, Dublin and Districts) Act, <Col N="864" /> 1926.  The House will probably remember that in 1925 a Bill limiting the hours that shops should be opened was introduced in this House and afterwards passed in the Dáil. In 1926 a new Bill was introduced into the Dáil which amended the previous Act and extended the time at which shops were to remain open, particularly on Saturdays, to 8.30 p.m.  That Act expires in July next. The Act which it is now proposed to extend is not the original Act, which was repealed, but the Act introduced in the Dáil and passed here after a compromise.  My reason for extending it for approximately three years is that I believe the whole question of the closing of shops generally will in the meantime be considered by a commission or committee.</P>
      <P>Leave to introduce granted.</P>
      <P>Ordered that the Bill be printed and circulated.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.35 p.m. until Wednesday, April 2nd.</P>
