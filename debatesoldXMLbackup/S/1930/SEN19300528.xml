      <P>This is a short Bill which extends, for another year, power for the acquisition of premises for the housing of the Civic Guards.  The Board of Works have not yet succeeded in building new premises all over the country for the Civic Guards, though they are getting on with the work with reasonable expedition.  This Bill enables premises to be kept on for the use of the Civic Guards.  I may say that the powers under it are exercised in only very few cases, and in no case are they exercised so that hardship <Col N="1258" /> is caused to the owners of the premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take advantage of the Second Reading of this Bill to call attention to what I consider an important matter in connection with the provision of houses for the Civic Guards.  I was informed quite recently that in connection with the proposed erection of a Civic Guards barracks in the suburbs of Dublin the plans submitted provided that Irish material and Irish stone should be used.  I understand that the Department of Finance refused to sanction that, and that as a result foreign materials are about to be used in the erection of the building.  It appears to me an extraordinary thing, when we erect barracks for the housing of the Civic Guards and put a tablet on the outside of them in Irish to indicate that the building is occupied by members of the Gárda Síochána, that the only thing Irish about the structures are the men who occupy them.  The action taken by the Department of Finance in this matter strikes me as an example of economy gone mad. Within a few miles of where it is proposed to erect the barracks in South Dublin there is ample building material of the finest quality available for house building.  I think it is a shame that the money which the people contribute and portion of which is intended for the erection of these buildings should be exported out of the country for the purchase of foreign materials.  There is not much use in calling a building an Irish building when the only thing Irish about it are the people who occupy it.  I take this opportunity of raising this question and of calling the attention of the Minister to it.</P>

We ask for internal loans and when we get them we propose to expend the money externally. I think that is a shame.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Bill there are certain matters to which, perhaps, reference should be made at this stage.  On the question of area and the boundaries proposed for the city and the borough to be set up, the position with regard to the Bill in its present shape is: Taking the city first, the area which the old city had was 8,358 acres; the new city will have added to that 3,316 acres, this being the area of Rathmines and Pembroke, and 7,099 acres being the added rural areas.  Therefore, the area of the new city will be 18,773 as <Col N="1260" /> against 8,358.  Taking the 1926 Census figures, the population of the new city will be 403,961, made up as follows: Population of old city, 316,693; Rathmines and Pembroke, 73,367; added rural areas, 13,901. The valuation of the new city will be £1,747,000, as against the valuation of the old city of £1,335,000.  The area of the new borough formed into one local government unit by the association of Blackrock, Dun Laoghaire, Dalkey and Killiney, will be 4,182 acres.  The population will be 37,079, and the valuation, £171,908.</P>
      <P>The acreage of the old county area, including urban area, was 219,581 acres.  The area of the new county, including the urban area, is 209,166 acres.  The population of the old country area was 188,961, as against 101,693 for the new county.  The valuation of the old county was £942,822, as against £530,661 for the new county.  The extension of the city proper has been very considerable in area&mdash; from something over 8,000 to over 18,000 acres.  The density of the old city was 38 persons per acre.  In the new city it will be 22.5 persons per acre.  The density in the case of the borough will be 8.9 persons per acre. Comparing the density in the city with the density in the case of some other cities, we find that in the case of Liverpool, where the population in 1922 was 826,000, the density is 39. In the case of Bristol, with a population of 383,000, the density is 21.5; Birmingham, with a population of 945,000, has a density of 23.2 per acre.  London, with a registered population of over four millions, has 60 persons to the acre.  In Belfast the density is 27 persons per acre, and in Cork the figure is 29.23.  The density as an index of the extent that is brought in, from the point of view of being urbanised, is fairly normal.  A great deal of discussion took place as to whether the area of the borough ought not to be included in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I failed to be convinced that there could be efficient administration of the borough in 1930 and 1931 immediately <Col N="1261" /> after a very considerable extension of the city area had taken place, and immediately after the setting up of a new system of council and manager.  There will be sufficient problems to be dealt with following the introduction of the new system that will require the closest possible attention from the new council, problems for officials in co-ordinating the administrative machine with the new circumstances. All these problems will be sufficient to tax the labours of the members of the new council without asking them to look after the coordination and administration of an additional four areas that, up to the present, have had four separate councils.  The farthest point of these areas from the centre of the City is nine and a quarter miles.  Apart altogether from the fact, as indicated in the Private Bill brought before the Seanad in the beginning of 1924-25 by the Councils of Blackrock, Dun Laoghaire and Dalkey, that there is the clearly expressed public opinion in that area that they require a council to look after their own area&mdash;but, apart altogether from that, we feel that the separation of the borough from the City at the present moment will mean a better and more concentrated administration of the City's affairs.  It will certainly mean a better and more concerntrated administration of the borough's affairs by not taking away the borough from the county and thereby reducing considerably, in addition to the reduction that has already taken place, the financial foundations on which the administration of the county rests.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable amount of feeling that the area around Dublin which is administered as a city should be very much greater than is proposed in this Bill. I do not know that the extension of the present area is going to be as rapid as a lot of people think, but in so far as there is such urbanisation going on outside the area of the proposed City Borough, we are making provision in the Bill by which after inquiry, by means of provisional <Col N="1262" /> order procedure, other further areas can be taken in, into the borough, into the City, or into the urban district of Howth.  We have extended the City on the northern side to touch the urban district area of Howth at Kilbarrack lane.  Therefore, the whole circumstance of Dublin Bay is under urban control. The extension of the City to Howth controls the main road approaches from the City to Howth, so that the Bill contains provisions by which, under the simple machinery of provisional order procedure, the City or the borough can have its area extended.</P>
    <P>There was also considerable talk as to the desirability of having a central control for certain special services.  If we take water as an example of that, I am not persuaded that there can be a more satisfactory arrangement at the present time than the one that exists, whereby the City supplies Howth with water under an agreement and at a price on the quantity taken and registered at the meter.  In the same way the City supplies the borough at certain points under a special agreement.  There is a further provision in the Bill under which the borough and the City can arrange between themselves for the laying of pipes or the repairing of pipes, or for the further extension of pipes either in the City or the borough. The borough, if it wants an extension of pipe mains in the borough, can arrange, if it wants to, to have that carried out with the City machinery. In so far as there was a very strongly expressed desire that there should be an examination as to whether some superstructure raised above the City Council and above the City Manager could not more satisfactorily and more economically carry on what are called common services, provision is made in the Bill under Section 100 by which the Minister for Local Government will set up in five years' time, and then inside 10 years' time, an inquiry directed to consider the general question as to whether any amalgamation of areas or extension of areas should take place in the neighbourhood of <Col N="1263" /> the City, what services might be more satisfactorily and economically run centrally, and any other financial arrangements arising out of that.  So that there will be an inquiry in five years and inside 10 years' time whether any more satisfactory arrangements or any other arrangement is required in connection with the matter.</P>
    <P>As subsidiary to that idea it was rather pressed that there should be set up now some kind of conjoint body that would do joint work on matters of common interest.  I do not consider that a standing body to deal with matters of general interest would be of any use.  In the first place I very much object to the setting up, at this particular moment, over the Council of the City of Dublin any other kind of authority.  We are focussing responsibility and authority in the Council of the City of Dublin, in the council of the borough and in the county council, and I think it would be only diffusing their responsibility and undermining their authority if any superstructure of authority was raised above that. And we made provision in Section 77 by which, on the application either of the Council of the City or the borough an <i>ad hoc</i> body of reference can be set up to consider any special matter definitely stated in the resolution to be a matter of common interest, and requiring discussion. The body set up in an <i>ad hoc</i> way at the moment by the borough council or the City Council to consider an important matter will, in the first place, be a most suitable body to discuss matters that require discussion, and in the second place it will only be set up on some specific matter of real importance, because the Council of the City and the council of the borough and the council of the county council are not completely cut away from one another in ordinary circumstances, and you will have the ordinary exchanges on matters of public interest and the ordinary interdiscussion by members of the City Council, the <Col N="1264" /> borough council and the county council.  There are many matters of common interest that may, in a harmonious way, be dealt with by one or other of those bodies without formal investigation and without a more elaborate and wide-flung arrangement.  I think that if there is a real problem requiring extension of area or requiring further organisation, adequate provision for investigation and for taking action is provided for in the Bill.  The Bill provides for the necessary financial adjustments and for transferring debts and assets and all that from any of the abolished bodies to their successors.</P>
    <P>Both in the borough, and in the City, the principles of the managerial system of local government is introduced more or less on the lines of the arrangements in the Cork Bill.  There are certain points of difference that might be referred to.  In the first place the Seanad will remember that the principle as arranged in the Cork Bill was that certain reserved powers, including powers over money, were reserved to the Council.  The Council had responsibility to pass the estimates in whatever form they liked and to strike whatever rates they liked; all other responsibilities and duties were conferred upon the Manager.</P>
    <P>Some things that were implicit in the Cork arrangement have been made explicit in the present Bill, and some additional powers are given to the Council.  As regards the reserved functions it will be found there is explicitly further reserved to the Council the control and sale of municipal estate, the position with regard to the attendance of the Manager at meetings, the provision of information and the preparing of any necessary plans and details of work for the Council.  As I say, these were more or less implicit in the Cork arrangement but they are explicit in this Bill.  The period required to elapse between the receipt by the Council of the statement of expenditure and the estimates has been extended from fourteen, to twenty-one days, so that there may be more <Col N="1265" /> adequate consideration by the Council of the proposed expenditure for every year prior to the striking of the rate.</P>
    <P>The majority required before an application can be made to the Minister for further extension of reserved functions has been reduced from two-thirds to a plain majority. In addition there has been introduced into the Bill an arrangement by which, after suitable notice, and on the passing of a special resolution to that effect, either a majority of two-thirds of the members present at a special meeting, or more than one-half of the total members of the Council, can, on passing a resolution, in connection with any specific thing which is normally the function of the Manager, require the Manager to carry out that matter.  But that power is given only in respect of specific matters and the resolution cannot be passed either in a general way or covering a whole class of matters.  In addition the Council is given power to frame rules regarding the acceptance and general dealing with tenders, the power of accepting contracts being still reserved for the Manager.</P>
    <P>The Council of the City will consist of 35 members, 30 elected by ordinary local government electors, and five elected on a special commercial franchise.  The City will be divided into five electoral areas.  The Council will consist of 14 members, and there will be one electoral area. The introduction of the special representatives on a commercial franchise into the Council of the City calls for comment on two matters.  In the first place the local government franchise is based mainly on occupation of premises in respect of which rates are paid by the occupier.  Taking the figures for the old city, approximately, £600,000, out of a valuation of £1,200,000, represents business premises occupied for business purposes as distinct from premises occupied for residential purposes.  Hitherto the greater amount of that valuation while paying rates, has been unrepresented in the Council by direct <Col N="1266" /> representation of the persons who pay those rates.  It was felt that that was not equitable and in accordance with the general principle of the local government vote, and the difference, when you take into consideration that this valuation is 50 per cent. of the total valuation, is inequitable, and fails to recognise that.  It also secures that companies as distinct from the private individual should have votes.  Up to the present they were debarred from having votes.  At the same time by making a special franchise for persons occupying premises wholly or partly for commercial purposes, giving them that small representation of five elected members on that register out of a total Council of 35, we are integrating into the general administrative Council of the City a class of persons that in the first place is entitled to be represented there, and whose services there will be valuable, that is those people responsible for the management of the general business of the City.  So that both these desirable matters are met by the provision of this special franchise.</P>
    <P>Senators will realise that under the old system of rating there were a very large number of different rates raised in the City; the incidence of those rates in many cases differed.  The powers of recovery differed, and generally the incidence differed in a number of ways.  All these are now consolidated into the general municipal rate.  There is only one rate which was left outside, and that is the police rate, which is a vanishing rate.  A very considerable amount of laborious and unnecessary work will be saved in the Accounts Department in the City as a result of this.  Arising, however, out of that consolidation of the municipal rate, certain exemptions that existed in the past have to be provided for.  There have been certain properties in the City that did not pay the improvement rate; others, the domestic water rate, and so on; and it has been considered that such exemptions as existed up to the present should be <Col N="1267" /> secured to the persons who enjoyed them in the past.  The amounts of money they paid for a certain number of years have been taken, and the Bill provided that in future there will be rated to the full municipal rate in respect of a particular percentage of their total valuation&mdash; that particular percentage of their total valuation being shown in one of the Schedules.  These exemptions apply to certain institutions, and to certain classes of hereditaments, such as railways, and, in the case of agricultural land, a general percentage is taken, so that agricultural land in the city in the future will pay half the municipal rate or the full municipal rate to the extent of one-half of its valuation.</P>
    <P>There is a general application of the 1925-27 Act in the county.  Thus the rural district councils and the board of guardians will be abolished. The position of the county, from the poor laws guardians aspect, is that there are three areas in the county that were separate board of guardians areas&mdash;Balrothery area, Rathdown and the area which came into the City which includes North Dublin and South Dublin and Celbridge guardians.  The guardians in each of these areas are abolished, and powers are given to the county council to set up, as a temporary measure, a certain number of persons to carry on for them the work of the guardians in these particular areas.  These areas will, until the change is made in the new Rating Bill, which will have to be introduced before the 31st March next, continue to be the areas of charge.  Rathdown will be a self-contained area of charge, and so will Balrothery, but the county will be made one whole when the necessary legislation is prepared.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes general provision for the transfer of officers from the present bodies to their successors, and deals with general matters arising out of their continuing to serve, giving them credit in respect of pensions and gratuities for service with the abolished bodies, and making provision for compensation in the case <Col N="1268" /> of persons who are found to be redundant as the result of the rearrangement of staffs that will take place.  I think these are the important matters that require to be commented upon at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that the Bill as before us here to-day is a much better Bill than the Bill as originally introduced.  A good deal of the objections that I had to the original Bill had been dealt with and amended in a manner that, I think, will meet with general acceptance. The problem of the local government of Dublin City and suburbs is a problem that needs very careful consideration. It is a question of very great importance to the people who are resident in the locality and, I think, to the country as a whole.  The Bill is, I think, a good attempt to grapple with the problem of local government.  It has in it some very good features and, also, to my mind, some very bad features.  With the general principle of City Manager I am in agreement.  I have been, I suppose, the greatest critic in the Oireachtas of the system that has been prevailing in the City for some years.  I was opposed to it because of the manner in which it was brought about and carried on.  Speaking as an ex-member of the old Dublin Corporation, I want to approach quite frankly and honestly this question of City Managership. While I was a member of the old Dublin Corporation I would have been in favour of seeing City Managership established as the system.  I go further and say that in the old Dublin Corporation there were men and women with a sufficient sense of civic duty and of citizenship who would have been prepared to bring about a managership system similar to that proposed in this Bill.  As a matter of fact, I think they were endeavouring to evolve some better system to that prevailing at the time, and eventually I think it would have led to something on the lines of the present Bill.  The proposal with regard to the City Managership itself as introduced in this Bill is, to my mind, the proper way to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> The proposal with regard to the City Manager which is introduced is, to my mind, being done in the wrong way, but much of my objection to the City Managership has been removed by the fact that the City Manager to be appointed will be the Town Clerk.  I always believed that the Town Clerk in the City of Dublin was in reality the City Manager, and for that reason I have no objection to the City Managership as outlined in the Bill, when the present executive officer of the municipality will be the City Manager.  With regard to the powers of the City Manager, I think the amendments that have been made have improved the position as between the respective powers of the Corporation and the City Manager.  The machinery in the Bill, in case any question or dispute may arise, has gone far to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>While this is not the proper time to deal with the matter of the boundary, there are certain lines of boundary that are not satisfactory.  I am sorry the boundary was not enlarged. There are certain large tracts which were proposed to be included by the Report of the Greater Dublin Commission, embracing on the northern side, Portmarnock and the Malahide areas.  It is a mistake that the natural playground of Dublin&mdash;Portmarnock&mdash;is being excluded from the operations of the Bill.  I think it is right to say that Portmarnock Strand is the natural playground of Dublin.  Those who know it for the past eight or ten years know that crowds of people who live in the slums of Dublin bring their families there on Sundays, so that it is a pity Portmarnock is not included in the extension of the city boundary.  Of course, Portmarnock Strand will be there still for the citizens of Dublin, but I am afraid that that wonderful strand that nature has provided within a few miles of the City will not be properly developed.  I think it is no exaggeration to say that it is one of the finest strands in this country, and it is no compliment to say that it is an heirloom for the citizens.  I am <Col N="1270" /> sorry it is not included in the City because it will not be properly developed. A rural district council cannot be expected to develop it on the lines on which it could be developed if it was within the City boundary.  When I speak of development I do not mean development by erecting houses, but development for the protection of public health and for the convenience of the people using it.  It is lamentable to think that there is no pure water supply and no attempt made to provide sanitary accommodation for the poor people who go there from Dublin on Saturday and Sunday evenings.  It is the mercy of Providence that there has not been an outbreak of fever of some kind in recent years.  It is lamentable from many points of view that that area is not included in the City.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the City boundary was not extended at least to Dun Laoghaire. As long as I can remember, the claim of the citizens of Dublin was, with regard to the extension of the City boundary, to include the old Dublin Metropolitan Police area.  On the south-east that area extended as far as Dun Laoghaire, and I think it is a pity, when a new Bill is being passed, that that is not done.  I agree that the amendments made in the Bill with regard to the coastal borough have modified to some extent my objection to the original proposal, because it is not proposed to set up a rival borough to the metropolitan borough.  The original proposal has been modified to the extent that provision has been made whereby the question of an extension of the City boundary will automatically come up for consideration at a future date, without having to go to the trouble and extent of promoting a new Bill.  There is machinery provided for the extension of the City boundary at a later stage if those concerned and the Minister for Local Government agree.  An inquiry can be held and the matter arranged, without the introduction of a new Bill in Parliament.</P>
    <P>The one blot on the Bill, and to my mind the greatest blot, is the proposal <Col N="1271" /> to set up a commercial register. In this age of democracy I think it is a very retrograde step to set up a form of plural voting.  It simply means that people who have business premises, or moneyed people, will have votes according to the extent of their valuations.  I do not think that is right.  I do not suggest that there are not good men among the business element, but I say that the possession of money does not make good citizens.  I object to people having plural votes.  The proposal in this Bill is that these people will be entitled to vote at the ordinary election for thirty members of the Corporation which are to be elected on the local government franchise, and that, at a later stage, they will be entitled to elect their own representatives. I do not think that is fair. I am opposed to the whole principle of plural voting.  I think it is the blot on the Bill and I hope this House will reject the particular section that deals with that matter.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that in the Cork City Management Act there was no provision made for commercial votes.  They have no commercial register in Cork.  Surely there are large business establishments in Cork like Messrs. Ford's works, and if merchants in Dublin are entitled to a special register for representation on the City Council, surely they are entitled to the same thing in Cork.  That is an anomaly. I go further and say that in the new borough there is no provision for a commercial register.  That is also an astonishing state of affairs.  The unfortunate poor Dublin jackeens are to get the benefit of this proviso. I do not think that is fair and I protest against it.  There is no such provision in the Cork Act, and no such proposal in the new borough. People who were described some time ago as pieces of antique furniture are now to have special representation under this Bill.  Not only are they to be entitled to vote for thirty representatives in the Corporation but, in addition, they are to be entitled to have five representatives of their own.  There were <Col N="1272" /> some business men in the old Corporation; some of them were good and some of them very bad.  Some of them did not make the best citizens or corporators.  I think Senator Mrs. Wyse Power will agree with me in that.  Some of them gave good service to the city while others did not.  These are my main objections to the Bill.  I am in agreement with the general provisions, but this particular section I regard as a blot on the Bill, and when it comes up I will vote for its deletion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to express my entire agreement with the views Senator Farren has expressed regarding the commercial vote for membership of the Corporation.  I agree with him that it is an entirely reactionary step, one that should not be contemplated in this age at all, and one that I can see no argument for.  He has said practically everything that could be said against the proposal, so I will content myself by supporting his attitude with regard to that portion of the Bill dealt with by Section 30 and the succeeding sections.</P>
      <P>There is one other point I would like to deal with, and it is with regard to Section 52:</P>
      <P>(1) The Council may, if and whenever it thinks fit, make regulations prescribing the procedure to be followed in regard to the reception and examination of all or any particular class or classes of tenders for the supply of goods, the execution of works, or any other thing for which the Corporation may lawfully have invited the submission of tenders.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he is not desirous of stating definitely under what terms tenders are to be lodged, the clause is superfluous.  It is true that subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>All regulations made under this section shall be subject to the approval of the Minister and no such regulation shall be of any force or effect unless or until it has been so approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is nothing in the first sub-section which compels the Council <Col N="1273" /> as such to make arrangements for the consideration of tenders or to ensure that these tenders will be treated on a fair basis of competition. In the main, the Bill has been tremendously improved in its progress through the Dáil, and with the exception of these two points, and particularly with what might be called the commercial privilege clause in it, I have really nothing further to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>This very long Bill represents a great amount of thought.  It represents also considerable research into the municipal laws of this country, and shows a thorough grasp of what I might call the details of local government.  But it seems to me that in going into so much detail there are one or two matters which, apparently, escaped attention, and which might be observed by anyone who takes even a cursory survey of the ground covered by the Bill.  The first one was that so ably referred to by Senator Farren.  Here you have a scheme for a great city surrounding Dublin Bay, occupying, as the Minister said, one way or another, all the shores of Dublin Bay.  But immediately adjoining the city, you have a lovely strand, and land adjoining that strand at Malahide and Portmarnock which is crying out for development, the development of which is quite essential for the health of the city. It is a place which cannot possibly be developed to the advantage of the City of Dublin by private enterprise, and the Minister, with all the microscopic accuracy and attention to detail which he has given to this Bill, has failed, I think, to grasp the importance of that area to the city. It cannot be developed properly as a unit in itself, and it cannot be properly developed by private enterprise. There are no drains or roads in the area; there are no adequate road approaches from the city, and as an eminent Senator has reminded me, that is, as I think, a blot on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A property qualification has been introduced for, I suppose, the protection <Col N="1274" /> of the commercial interests. If the commercial interests are to be protected and secured by the scheme which the Minister has adumbrated in this Bill, why should not all the commercial activities of the city be under the one authority?  I refer now to the Port and Docks Board. The port of Dublin is not under the authority of the city.  If the city government is to be so framed that it will give proper protection to commercial interests why should not the port of Dublin itself be under that central authority?  Some amendments were introduced in the Dáil for the purpose of securing that the port of Dublin should come under the authority of the City of Dublin. In the early stages of the Bill, as I understand it, the amendments were ruled out because their drafting was not satisfactory.  At a later stage when unobjectionable amendments were put forward it was then said to be too late.  Of course, there may be grave reasons why the port of Dublin should not be included in the present Bill, but I think the segregation of the government of the seaport from the government of the remainder of the city is unique; it is an anomaly.  These, I think, are the two matters which have escaped full consideration.  They have been omitted from the scope of the Bill, and the reasons for the omission ought to have been fully stated and fully debated.  In my opinion, these two matters have not received the consideration which they deserved, and I hope they will receive consideration in the Seanad, when, perhaps, the Minister may be able to explain why it was that in this most comprehensive Bill, which shows a minute attention to detail, these two glaring things have been omitted from his scheme, and apparently without explanation of any kind. There are a good many matters in connection with the Bill which I am sure will receive attention in the Seanad.  The Bill has been greatly improved in the Dáil, and I am sure it will be still further amended, and, I am certain, improved, in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrington</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked by certain people living in the coastal borough to express their views on this Bill.  They are people to whose views very little attention is given. In fact, the main attention they receive is from the tax gatherer, who never neglects them, and in all probability they contribute the bulk of the rates.  Their view generally is that this Bill is good in patches, but they think that the Bill will fail if every effort is not taken to ensure under its working that economy which is most necessary.  When making his introductory speech, the Minister said this Bill is based on the Cork Act.  It will probably be within the recollection of some members of the Seanad that when the Cork Bill was before us for consideration I called attention to some aspects of it. I said that I thought it would not lead to economy but to extravagance. For that I was taken to task most severely by some members of the Seanad, and I think the expression, as well as my memory serves me, was used that &ldquo;Senator Barrington was never tired of spitting venom on the representatives of the people.&rdquo;  I was not spitting venom on the representatives of the people, but I made a forecast of what was likely to happen and, strange to say, that is exactly what has happened.  If the spitting of venom is fearlessly to call attention to matters without any regard to circumstances that will arise and to point out with accuracy what is likely to happen, I will spit venom as long as I live.  There was a provision in the Cork Act for the payment of the Lord Mayor as well as the payment of the City Manager, who was to do the work.  The Senator who took me to task is a sport, and as a sport he is entitled to his fancy.  Well, he has got his fancy, which he is never tired of trotting out for the admiration of the Seanad, and I think he calls it &ldquo;Civic Probity.&rdquo; Well, &ldquo;Civic Probity&rdquo; has romped home in Cork.  The Lord Mayor receives a salary of £1,000 a year, a Minister's salary and which if capitalised means £25,000 of the <Col N="1276" /> ratepayers' money.  My friend here shuddered to think of what would happen if the same provisions were allowed to remain in the City of Dublin Bill, and the same favourite is entered for the Greater Dublin stakes.  We do not know what it will amount to in the case of Dublin, but whatever it may be the money could be better spent than endowing sinecures.</P>
      <P>While this money was voted away with such hilarity in the City of Cork there is a tragic procession passing through the streets of Cork week after week, and some of the best youth of the country, selected by competitive examination, are driven away from here because they cannot find work.  The reason they cannot is that some of the smaller industries are being stamped out by the taxation which is unnecessarily being placed on the country.  You need only go to some of the country villages or towns, including some of the larger towns, to see many of the best business premises closed or about to close down.  People are driven into exile because there are no industries at home to give them employment. The old excuses that served so well in the past are worn out.  We were told the reasons for all this emigration were the exactions of the landlords or the exactions of the foreign Government.  These excuses will no longer serve their purpose. Emigration still continues, and, there is no doubt about it, it is largely caused by the excessive pressure of taxation here.  We must also bear in mind that under this Bill the people who will be elected as Lord Mayors will not be the class of people we were accustomed to in the past.  They will not be the people supposed to be able to do the business, because somebody else must be employed and paid to do it for them.  This Bill will be judged by the amount of good it does in the way of reducing taxation.  I hope before it passes through this House it will be put into such a form that unnecessary expense and extravagance will be wiped out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Comyn has said with regard <Col N="1277" /> to this Bill.  It must have taken an immense amount of research, labour and thought to produce.  I think that even Senator Farren, with his knowledge of the old Corporation, will admit that in this Bill the Minister has placed before us the results of an immense amount of consideration of a most complicated problem. Three matters have been referred to &mdash;business men in the Corporation, the Port and Docks Board, and the Portmarnock Strand.  I hope when Senators express a wish for the development of the Velvet Strand at Portmarnock that does not mean turning it into a Brighton or a place of that kind.  The real beauty of Dublin is that all the local areas where we go to enjoy ourselves are as God made them and are not destroyed by the hand of man.  Now, in Portmarnock the fields are filled up with tents.  The sanitary question at Portmarnock has been referred to. Some of us interested in the matter have had discussions with the sanitary authorities, for the real difficulty is the want of powers by the sanitary authorities.  That is a matter that could be dealt with outside of this Bill.  So far as Portmarnock is concerned, it is easy to get at.  I hope we will not have people coming there and putting up big piers and bathing places, and having mixed bathing along the place, but that, as far as possible, the place will be allowed to stay as it is.  As to the Port and Docks Board, if Senator Comyn had been present when the discussion took place with regard to the Act which created the Port and Docks Board he would have some knowledge of the difficulty of the problem, especially as regards the selection of the class of people qualified to do the necessary work on the Port and Docks Board.  That Act was passed in the British Parliament after very careful and exhaustive inquiry.  I doubt if any body selected in that way is a complete success, but the Port and Docks Board certainly is a practical success, as may be judged by the loans of the Board and how high they stand.  We have got a fairly useful body of men to <Col N="1278" /> manage the Port.  The people who will be elected under this Bill now before us will not be elected for that purpose, for they will have no special knowledge of the kind that will enable them to manage the affairs of the Port.</P>
      <P>I hope the House, when it comes to consider amendments with regard to the Port and Docks Board, will look seriously into the matter beforehand and make themselves acquainted with the work the Board has to do and consider whether the people, including the business men elected under this Bill, would be competent to carry out the duties of the Port and Docks Board.  Senator Farren talked about the ancient pieces of furniture, called business men, in the City of Dublin.  This Bill is for the management of an enormous business, involving the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds each year.  It is quite evident that the object of the Bill is to try and get what any of us in our business try and get, and pay large sums to get, and that is the application of the best business brains to the management of City affairs.  That is what is meant, and whether we will get it or not I do not know.  People who get elected on a large franchise are always gifted with commonsense, and, in the case of any gathering of men selected as those under this Bill will be, will probably come out right in the end, but in the management of great financial matters, if possible we should try and get people connected with big business affairs.  This proposal with regard to a commercial register is an attempt to get them, and I should say it is an attempt worth trying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probably Senator Farren and Senator Connolly are right in saying that it is undemocratic, but I have never heard very much good coming in a financial way from democracy. It may be an excellent thing for liberty, but it is not good for the pockets of most of us.  It does not produce economy.  We have seen the results in England where democracy ruled in West Ham and in Poplar.  Under the existing system <Col N="1279" /> in Dublin our rates have gone steadily down.  We believe that our affairs have been very well looked after.  When it comes to electing a City Council, that we should try and get representation for the business element seems to me a sound policy. If the City were owned by any small body of men working as a dividend paying concern, what would they do?  They would get the biggest business man they could and give him an enormous salary to manage the business.  This Bill is an attempt along the same lines.  From a business point of view it is sound if we get the right man.  Taking the business men of Dublin all round, we have no reason to be ashamed of them.  In many ways their businesses are well managed and are a credit to the City.  We have business men who would give good service to the City, but they have never had a chance.  Business men cannot go fighting elections and things of that sort, but in the election of business men under this Bill the electors to whom they will appeal will know the men who ask for their votes, will know their qualifications, and the best business men are likely to be picked out.  That, in my opinion, is preferable to the democratic system of picking out men.  You will have plenty of excellent people elected on the democratic basis, and this election of business people on the commercial register will not do the slightest harm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is introduced by the Government which set up in the City of Dublin the system of administration by Commissioners, which we have had for a period of years, and which has been attended in results by very marked economy and efficiency.  For that the Government deserves credit.  This Bill is intended to replace that temporary arrangement.  As to how long a system like that of Commissioners, successful as it has been, could be allowed to continue, being so diametrically opposed to the principles of self government, is a matter of opinion.  But now the Government <Col N="1280" /> that set up that system which has proved very successful think it has lasted long enough and that it is time to put something more permanent in its place.  The Bill aims at doing this while retaining the economy and efficiency associated with the Commissionership system, and applying it in a very much larger scale to an area containing practically all the urban and suburban population of the County of Dublin.  I am not a citizen of Dublin but I have been associated with it for a number of years, and the Bill seems to be well devised for that purpose.  I think there is good reason to hope that the system embodied in the Bill will prove successful. The commercial register is a novel feature.  Whether that is good or not is a matter of opinion.  It commends itself to me, but of course a good many other people think quite differently about it.  It is quite true, as Senator Farren remarked, that the possession of large commercial property is not necessarily a guarantee of good citizenship, but at all events it tends to be a far better qualification for a voice in the affairs of the City than the ownership of very little property, because a big stake induces a feeling of responsibility.  I think the commercial proposal on the whole is justified for that reason.  The Bill seems to me to be a very good commonsense measure and well thought out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my old colleague, Senator Farren, I join in congratulating the Minister on the amendments which have been introduced in reference to this Bill.  With most of them I am in entire agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was news for the Minister, and it may be news for the Seanad, that the question of a City Manager was very often discussed at meetings of the Corporation.  Without egotism I could go a little further in stating that it was a pet hobby of my own. Consequently, as far as that goes, I am in entire agreement with the Minister.  I think that the powers of the Manager are too great, but that <Col N="1281" /> is a matter that perhaps can be remedied when the Bill goes into Committee.  I did not intend to join in this debate at all, only for the underlying cynical feeling which seems to permeate some speeches in reference to the old Corporation. Everything possible has been done, to use a common expression, to boost up the City Commissioners.  But not a word, not a solitary word, of fair play have the old Corporation received. Indeed, sir, as one who was born in this City, as one who has mixed amongst its people all my life, as one who for 15 years or more was a member of the old Corporation, it is only natural, without egotism, that perhaps I can claim to know a little of the citizens' wishes in regard to City matters.  I speak as one who for seven and a half long, sad and weary years helped in a small way to frame the destinies of this City as its civic head.  I was helped by courageous and honourable colleagues who never shirked their duty or responsibilities to the City or to the country&mdash;not like now, not like the time of the Commissioners; these were days of actual danger. No Lord Mayor at any period and no Mayor&mdash;a position which goes back for close on a thousand years&mdash; was ever flanked by more faithful friends or more loyal colleagues as Lord Mayor or Mayor than I was during that period.  Out of their loyalty to me and my loyalty to them, I refused at the hands of my friend, President Cosgrave, the Chairmanship of the Dublin Commissioners, retaining the title of Lord Mayor with emoluments and salary of £1,600 a year.  That may be a personal matter.  I appreciated the kindness of President Cosgrave at the time, but, as I have said, out of my sense of loyalty I felt bound to refuse the offer.  I wonder how many of the Corporation traducers would do the same?</P>
    <P>During the discussion of this Bill in the Dáil I noticed that Deputy John Good, speaking on the debate on the 26th to the 28th February, Col. 1130, made a statement.  Deputy Good is a business man.  Every Senator <Col N="1282" /> here knows Deputy Good and they know that when he gets one of these mystic inspirations which come only from the skies, clouding from the heavens the sordid surroundings of this life and the troubled waters of this world, they know what a wonderful output of oratory comes to him.  He is really a scholar, a diplomat and a gentleman.  In one burst of oratory he sparkled out this wonderful gem: &ldquo;Why, all the water in the Liffey would not whitewash the old Corporation.&rdquo;  Deputy John Good in the Parliament of the State could not even refrain from talking shop.  One can always forgive one's youthful opponents for being bitter or for being biased through want of experience. But when the bitterness and the bias of early environment pursues them into old age no hope of redemption can ever be expected. When a public representative in a Chamber of the Parliament of the State makes general charges against a corporate body and that corporate body the Corporation of the capital of Ireland&mdash;without specifying those charges, without naming a solitary individual who was guilty of these charges, all fair-minded people must agree that such a representative is neither worthy of credence nor respect and that his presence is a menace to the Parliament of the nation.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to speak a solitary word here to-day on the discussion on this Bill.  I wanted this Bill, as a Dublin-man, to be discussed in an atmosphere of calm, but I felt owing to the position which I held so long, that it would be cowardice on my part not to stand behind my colleagues who stood behind me so long.  That is why I have spoken. Many attacks have been made on the Corporation of Dublin.  I understand that even within this House&mdash;I was not a member of it at the time&mdash; the Dublin Corporation has been attacked.  Subject to you, sir, whose kindness I appreciate in giving me this latitude, I will just say this, although it may be wearying to you, I am one of those peculiar beings and when I am brooding over things it eases my mind to speak out.  As <Col N="1283" /> the reputation of the citizens is at stake, as the reputation of the Dáil is at stake, I consider I would not be transgressing your kindness if I might briefly enumerate some of my own colleagues in the Corporation that have been from time to time traduced&mdash;Senator Mrs. Clarke, Senator Mrs. Wyse Power, Alderman James Moran, Alderman Alfred Byrne, and others.  Will anyone say that Councillor Farren was not an ornament to any council?  Last, but not least perhaps, there was the Right Hon. Laurence O'Neill, Lord Mayor of Dublin City.  Then we had stalwarts in the Dáil like President Cosgrave himself, who on many occasions acted as my locum tenens in the days of trouble and danger.  It may be of interest to those who do not know a great deal about what was going on fifteen or sixteen years ago, that Alderman Cosgrave acted as my locum tenens at that time when there was a price on his head and when a notorious Black-and-tan was told off to shoot him.</P>
    <P>At that time President Cosgrave, like General Mulcahy, faced danger and carried out his duties.  We had other stalwarts also in the old Corporation, men like Seán T. O'Kelly, Dr. Myles Keogh and Peadar Doyle, considered of sufficient importance to keep the Government together in those days.  There were officials in the Corporation whose capabilities enabled them to climb up to high office in the State and many of the officials of the Corporation were taken over by the Government. I could go on, but it might weary you, dealing with members of the Corporation who have been traduced in this way, but I will give you an example of one of them. You have a man of the type of Alderman Thomas Kelly, elected Lord Mayor of Dublin, but owing to the destruction of his health in an English gaol he never sufficiently recovered to take up office.  Alderman Kelly and Alderman Cosgrave, the father and the son of the Corporation in the old Sinn Fein days.  Senator Mrs. Wyse Power will bear me out <Col N="1284" /> in saying that no son was more loyal, no son more trustworthy, no son more loving, than Willie Cosgrave was to the Corporation of Dublin, a man who abhorred the sword, a Dublin-man to his finger tips, who loved its poor, its alleys, and its lanes, and who longed to do what he could for the City.</P>
    <P>It pains me beyond measure that some of my colleagues who are in high places to-day will allow men of the type of Alderman Thomas Kelly to be traduced.  I could go on enumerating many business men of that type in the City, but I am not going to delay you, although lately we had it stated on a very high authority that business men were too much immersed in their business to take any interest in municipal affairs.  But there were people, sir, of the type of Councillor Mrs. Wyse Power, Alderman Kathleen Clarke, Mrs. Sheehy-Skeffington, Mrs. Margaret McGarry and others, each and every one of them having more intelligence and more honesty in their little finger, and who have suffered more for Ireland in one hour than all their traducers, if they were mobilised into one, would undergo if they were to live for an eternity.  But there were others just as intelligent and just as honest, whose names do not come before the public eye.  Now, sir, as an old Parliamentary hand, if you will forgive the expression, there is one thing that I have been leading up to in all this.  You, sir, who have proved yourself a capable and refined gentleman, will hardly credit that a month before the Corporation was dissolved, one might put it, to ginger up the Local Government Department, a leading article appeared in the columns of a responsible Dublin evening newspaper.  It is only right that I should state that these things emanated from the Local Government incubator before General Mulcahy took office.  Remember it was a leading article, not a letter, not a chance paragraph which might have gone in.  It was a leading article.  That appeared in the columns of a responsible Dublin newspaper, describing my colleagues <Col N="1285" /> in the Corporation, of which I have been endeavouring to give you examples.  That leading article described them as &ldquo;a gang of corrupt and unscrupulous brutes.&rdquo; That appeared in a responsible Dublin evening newspaper.  These men, such as I have mentioned, with President Cosgrave at their head, were described as &ldquo;a gang of corrupt and unscrupulous brutes.&rdquo;  In that way was laid a solid foundation for the vilification of the Corporation that has taken place since in the Dáil and Seanad by the Bads, the Goods, the Toms, the Dicks and the Harrys.  With such brutal, vulgar criticism, is it any wonder that the citizens of Dublin became apathetic towards municipal affairs, and is it any wonder that we have heard the Corporation traduced many times since?  Senator Jameson will pardon me for saying that he insinuated, but said nothing but&mdash;like charity&mdash;that covers a multitude of sins.  Is it any wonder with such brutal and vulgar criticism that the people of other countries have come to look upon the Dublin Corporation as a kind of Hell's Kitchen?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we leave that point, the Senator gave me the impression that he was suggesting that this criticism in an evening newspaper emanated from the Local Government Department.  I would like to be clear as to whether I understand the Senator rightly or wrongly.</P>

      <P>No.  I am sorry if I have not made myself clear.  Nothing in the world was further from my mind than to suggest that the Local Government Board had hand, act or part in reference to this leading article.  I venture to suggest that it was done for the purpose&mdash;whether it effected it or not is a very different thing&mdash;of poisoning the minds of the citizens and gingering up the Local Government Board.  If my friend, General Mulcahy, thinks that by the remarks I have made I have thrown any reflection on the Local Government Board I will promptly withdraw them.  Is the Minister satisfied?</P>

      <P>I shall not again trouble the Seanad with the brutal remarks to which I have referred, but a benevolent Government, I presume I can call it that, stepped in and handed over the management of the City to Senator Jameson's friends, to three of these gifted &ldquo;mothers.&rdquo;  Before leaving this rather vulgar and nauseous subject&mdash;as far as I am concerned I feel that it has been dragged out of me; I have been waiting for this opportunity for the last five years&mdash;it is only fair that I should state&mdash;I was taught in my early life to be just to all men&mdash;that the largest owner of that newspaper, which his father had founded, called upon me at the Mansion House in evident distress and produced a resolution that was passed by himself and his co-directors condemning the article that I have mentioned and, further, apologising to me as Lord Mayor of Dublin on behalf of my colleagues. That was at least an honourable act, which was spoilt by the fact that not a line of apology or regret appeared in the columns of the newspaper.</P>
      <P>No public representative should object to criticism.  Criticism is the very breath and essence of progress, but no respectable Pressman, no newspaper with a reputation to defend, would use language of that kind.  Perhaps at another time I will deal with the unfair methods adopted to dissolve the Corporation, but for the moment I will let it rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will just pass to a few remarks on the section of the Bill which has been dealt with by Senator O'Farrell. Quite recently I was travelling by tram, and let me say, it is in the street, in the tram, by the fireside or by the roadside that public opinion is moulded.  The tram conductor greeted me with &ldquo;Good morning, Lord Mayor; you have done more in your day than the whole of them put together.&rdquo;  I do not know whether that was flattering or embarrassing or whether it is what my friend, Senator Milroy, would call balderdash.  The conversation took place at the time of the last Presidential <Col N="1287" /> election.  The tram conductor asked me, &ldquo;Who will get in, Lord Mayor?&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;President Cosgrave will get in again.&rdquo;  He said, &ldquo;No matter who gets in or out, I will have to keep punching my tram tickets.&rdquo;  He was a character, and evidently being one of Dublin's disillusioned citizens, I ventured to ask him what he thought of the Greater Dublin Bill.  Without any hesitancy whatever he said, &ldquo;That is the Bill that gives the rich man six votes and the poor man only one.  These are the fellows who want to stuff it down our throats.  We went out to fight for freedom for them, and having helped to get that freedom, they now want to take it from us.  Heaven help us.&rdquo;  Other sections in this Bill are of the greatest importance to the City, but in my opinion this section, I think it is Section 35, raises a big broad political issue&mdash;six votes for one man, the rich man, and one vote for the poor man.</P>
    <P>In my opinion this is a most dangerous and insidious section.  It is more far-reaching in its effects than many people realise.  It is, in my opinion, resurrecting class distinctions in public affairs in their very worst form&mdash;by money.  It is an encouragement to the Communists to make their attack on our present social system when every effort should be made to retard and not to encourage them.  It is a piercing of the main fabric of democracy laughed at by Senators here to-day &mdash;one man one vote.  It is a direct incitement, in my opinion, to strife between capital and labour.  Worse than all, it is a glorification and a wholesale recognition of the activities of the moneylender and the profiteer.  It puzzles me to find men who claim to be democrats supporting a section like this.  In my opinion it is all moonshine, trying to convince themselves by the chopping of cheap logic that they remain democrats still.</P>
    <P>If such a proposition as this were brought forward by the old Local Government Board a few years ago, what an uproar would have been <Col N="1288" /> created throughout the length and breadth of Ireland, as it was called then!  What glorious propaganda it would have provided in our fight against English methods!  How some of the young men who have become prominent since would make the rafters ring with eloquence and stagger humanity with their writings and condemnation of this proposal. How some of our young men would be told off to perform quick action, with the sound of which some of us were familiar at the time.</P>
    <P>After a fairly varied experience of political life, I generally found that a brave soldier made a bad politician, and that he found it difficult to handle politicians.  My great friend, Senator Bryan Mahon, who, I am sorry to see, is not here&mdash;if he were here I would be satisfied he would agree&mdash;would tell you that when he was Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in Ireland in 1917, only for his tact, his bravery and his humanity, the citizens of Dublin would have been butchered in cold blood.  I have documents in my possession to prove that some permanent officials were anxious for that.  Senator Sir Bryan Mahon, finding his position was becoming unbearable, like a brave man resigned, and that relieved the situation somewhat.</P>
    <P>I am sure the permanent officials are very different at the present time to what they were in those days, but I would just like to speak of one little incident that may be helpful to my friend, General Mulcahy.  When I was recognised as Lord Mayor of Dublin by the British Local Government Board, I had many interviews with Sir Henry Robinson on civic matters.  It was generally assumed, rightly or wrongly, that Sir Henry Robinson was the Local Government Board himself.  An order was made by a high permanent official against a member of the Corporation.  The order was so ridiculous that it was never carried out.  Speaking to Sir Henry Robinson I had the temerity to twit him on the matter.  What was his reply?  I hope the ladies in the Seanad will not be shocked at the <Col N="1289" /> language, but perhaps coming from a very high British official it may not be considered vulgar.  He said: &ldquo;Damn these fellows, they are always getting me into no end of trouble but, blast them, I must stand behind them.&rdquo;  In the official report of the debate in the Dáil on this Bill on February 26-28th, column 950, General Mulcahy is reported&mdash;it is extraordinary the amount of ammunition an official report provides&mdash;as having stated: &ldquo;Men engaged in business are very much immersed in their own affairs and do not go again for either national or municipal honours.&rdquo;  If this is the well-considered and studied opinion of General Mulcahy, his experts and advisers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash; it is only natural to ask why so much fuss is made about compiling a register, while according to the Minister himself it will not be availed of by the business community. I would be very curious to know what did the business men in the Dáil who voted for this section think of General Mulcahy's statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is their presence in the Dáil not a direct negative to that statement? I would be very curious to know what Senator Jameson&mdash;Senator Douglas has gone&mdash;and other business men in the Seanad think of the Minister's statement, that business men are too much immersed in their own affairs and do not go into national politics.  I think I may pass from that; Senator Farren has dealt with the business men in the Corporation.  I, like Senator Farren, am not going to claim that the business men are the end-all and the be-all of intelligence or capacity in the Corporation, but my colleagues who are around me will bear me out when I say that when they did happen, by any chance, to show intelligence or capacity they were placed in the highest positions of trust.  The business men in the Corporation, although they did not agree with what was going on during the national crisis, must get <Col N="1290" /> credit for this from me, that when the membership of the Corporation was depleted by the arrest of some of its members they ran the risk of arrest themselves.  They nobly stood by their colleagues and carried on their work in their absence. I could give any amount of data with regard to the business men in the Corporation.  I could give any amount of data as to how the Corporation was availed of. It is well that this House and the country should know&mdash;this is strange but true&mdash;that before the despised and rejected Corporation in 1918 was taken over by the Republican element, at a time when the country was floundering about for a lead and when the eyes of Nationalists and Imperialists were turned to the Corporation, Dr. Sherlock, in conjunction with Alderman Byrne, carried through a resolution at a meeting of the Corporation by a majority of 39 votes to 3, which eventually resulted in the defeat of conscription.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons why a rankling is left in the minds of so many, and why there is so much bitterness against the old Corporation. When a national emergency arose Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins, Eamon de Valera and Richard Mulcahy came to the Corporation, to the Lord Mayor and to the Aldermen to seek their aid.</P>
    <P>One of the great arguments in favour of this section is that it is to meet what has been described as inequitable&mdash;that is, taxation without representation.  During the past 30 years not a single meeting has been held in the Dublin Chamber of Commerce at which that parrot cry&mdash; taxation without representation&mdash;has not been heard.  It has been mentioned in the Dáil and it was referred to here to-day.  The question has been asked: &ldquo;What about the big business places?  What about Guinness?&rdquo; I ask, is not the humblest individual in this City of as much importance in voting for the election of members of the Corporation as the figure-heads connected with big business corporations?  Is not the humblest individual in this <Col N="1291" /> State not able to use the intelligence which God has given him just as well as any of those figure-heads?  In my opinion he is far better able to do it, because he knows the wants and the sufferings of the people far better than the moneylender, than the profiteer, than the moneyed man who spends his time gambling, perhaps, in Monte Carlo or in a saloon in Paris, or who hurries home from his night club in London and knocks at the lodge door or at the Cumann na nGaedheal or Fianna Fáil office and, with his bundle of votes, asks for instructions as to how he is to vote. That is taxation with representation. Then the loud timbrel sounds in the halls of the Chamber of Commerce, in the gilded apartments of the moneylenders, and in the cocktail parlours of the profiteers.  Jehovah has triumphed, and taxation with representation is free.</P>
    <P>There is one thing in this Bill which grieves me and it is the anomalous position in which General Mulcahy is placed.  Up to this it was admitted that the citizens of Dublin, as a whole, were capable of electing members to the Dáil to legislate for the State, but according to this new Bill the citizens of Dublin are not capable, as a whole, of electing their municipal representatives. The anomaly which sincerely hurts me is the invidious position in which General Mulcahy is placed.  I am quite satisfied, knowing what he has done in the past, knowing the temperament of the man and knowing his honesty, that he cannot have his heart in this section of the Bill. Richard Mulcahy, the man, goes before the citizens of Dublin and, like other candidates, he tells them in his election addresses, what a fine people they are, what a great and incorruptible people they are and what a charming people they are. As a whole, many of them may be, they are honest and they can do no wrong by electing Richard Mulcahy as a member of the Dáil, but General Mulcahy, Minister for Local Government, tells the people who place him in the position of being able to become Minister for Local Government, <Col N="1292" /> that he cannot trust them as a whole to elect representatives to the Dublin Corporation, except they have sandwiched in between them, as a kind of watch-dog, men who have large banking accounts.  I have heard a great deal about the merchant princes, that they are fine fellows and have great ability. Senator Jameson sounds the loud timbrel and tells us what they will do if sent into the Corporation.</P>
    <P>I wondered when Senator Jameson was speaking how many Senators had ever read what the moneyed register accomplished in civic affairs in the past.  The annals of Dublin tell us that in the years gone by&mdash;I think it was previous to 1840&mdash;the Dublin Corporation was known throughout the length and breadth of the land as the rotten Corporation.  The money furnace was in full blast, and the money register was then a reality.  It may satisfy Senator Jameson to know this, that none were then elected to the Corporation except those who might be called merchant princes&mdash; those great fellows who are going to do so much according to this Bill. These fine fellows, these merchant princes used to sit down of an evening over a glass of milk&mdash;cocktails had not as yet come to hand&mdash;and the annals of Dublin tell us, they religiously sliced out the citizens' property amongst themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LaurenceONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>And when they were tired doling out amongst themselves they gave long leases for a song, as Senator Farren has reminded me, in the case of the Pembroke estate and others.  The conduct of these genteel rogues and blackguards became so alarming that the British Government, not behindhand itself in its infamies, got frightened.  As a result of the labours of the great O'Connell who afterwards was Lord Mayor of Dublin, the moneyed franchise became a thing of the past.  Under successive Acts of Parliament there has since been no moneyed franchise in Dublin, but now the money franchise <Col N="1293" /> is going to be restored, not by the British Government&mdash;they had better sense than to do it&mdash;but by a Government of our own.  If ever a Government was elected to uphold the principles of democracy it was ours, but I am afraid it has fallen by the roadside.  If only Arthur Griffith was alive!  How his loss is felt more and more every day.  The poor fellow, what did he work in the wilderness for 30 years for? What did he die for?  Is this to be the reward of his sacrifices?  Recently the English Chancellor of the Exchequer is reported as having stated that &ldquo;while millions of men were dying, or exposed to death on the battlefield, the profiteers at home increased their wealth by £4,000,000,000.&rdquo;  Would one want to be a merchant prince to understand that?  Our Government, instead of taking some of that from these people, is, by this section, going to give them increased powers.  That statement made by the English Chancellor of the Exchequer awakens in us, in our quiet moments, feelings of loneliness and sadness for those who are gone, and in our public moments would urge us to stand firmly by the principles for which they fought and died.  Were there any class distinctions or moneyed qualifications between the millions of men who died or were exposed to death on the battlefield? No, they all stood shoulder to shoulder.  What did they die and fight for?  To make the world safe for democracy, the principle that has been laughed at here to-day&mdash; one man one vote.  What did Pearse and his comrades sacrifice their lives for?  What did the Republican Army fight for?  What did the people of high and low degree suffer for?  What is the meaning of the silence which takes place on Armistice Day?  What is it, but to give thousands of ex-soldiers time to reflect on what they have gone through for the establishment of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is just as well that I should speak plainly here to-day.  I am anxious that the special attention of <Col N="1294" /> the citizens of Dublin should be focussed on this section of the Bill. I am afraid that the citizens of Dublin generally seem to be rather apathetic on that point owing to the fact that their minds have been saturated with a lot of vulgar writings. Perhaps it is just as well that cant and humbug in public life should be nipped in the bud and stripped of its veneer of finery.  It is just as well that the people of this State and of this city should understand, as I understand, that the underlying motive in this section&mdash;I do not impute this to General Mulcahy, but I impute it to some of those around him&mdash;is to pander to the fancy of the few, and is a dole to those who, at the moment, have the balance of power.  In referring to moneylenders and profiteers I am not to be taken as making any wild and unjust suggestions that the industrious and honest shopkeepers of this city are profiteers.  In fact, most of them suffered from the monopolies created during the war.</P>
    <P>I have spoken strongly on this matter, but it is because I feel strongly as a citizen of Dublin that I have used such language.  I had to speak as I have done because my colleagues in the Corporation have stood abuse and got no opportunity of defending themselves during the past five years.  Before I sit down I would make an earnest appeal to the Minister to withdraw this section.  Do not let it be said, General Mulcahy, that you are the man to put back the hands of the clock of progress.  Do not, my friend, destroy the edifice that you helped to build.  You were prepared to lay down your life in the building of it.  Do not let it be said now in the years to come that Richard Mulcahy, Chief of Staff of the Republican Army; General Mulcahy, who bravely and nobly stepped into the breach when Michael Collins was killed, as Commander-in-Chief of the National Army, that you let down the comrades who stood beside you and fought for you.  Do not let it go out that you believe they are not capable as a whole of electing representatives to the Dublin Corporation except with the help of a <Col N="1295" /> moneyed franchise.  In calmer moments I may feel that I have said things which may have been a little hurtful, but I did not mean them. Honestly and frankly, I felt somewhat overstrung that this obnoxious section should be forced on the citizens of my native city, to belittle and destroy their reputation, and that by a Government of their own. In my last appeal I would say to the Minister: think of the comrades who fought with you and are still scattered throughout the city.  Do not insult them by this section.  Narrowing the issue down to a few words, this section means, if it means anything, that you, General Mulcahy, Minister for Local Government, will not trust the lowly citizens of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be an impertinence for me to congratulate Senator O'Neill on what is in fact, but what it would not be literally correct to describe as, his maiden speech.  I think that the section to which he has directed his remarks, that is the section dealing with the merchant franchise, is well described as an insult to the electors of the city.  I want to follow the Senator's criticism of that particular section.  The Minister, in the course of his opening statement, referred to the basis of the local government franchise as being a property basis, and on that statement he built up his case for an extension or intensification of the property franchise, and he quoted in support of that statement the fact that the business community, that we intend to specially cater for in this section, occupy premises valued at nearly half or about half the total valuation of the city.  I cannot understand the logic that starts by saying the local government franchise is based on property valuation, as property valuation, and then follows that by saying that the property owned by the business element of the community is in valuation half the total and then confines that representation to five members in a council of 35.  If there is any consistency <Col N="1296" /> in the argument then it should have half the direct and separate representation of the membership.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Neill pointed out that people who elected members to the Dáil are the citizens of Dublin.  In asmuch as they are recognised by the legislature to select competent men for the work of legislation and the overseeing of the Minister's administration, they should, one would think, be equally capable of selecting competent men to oversee the work of the City Manager.  The Minister says no.  We must have additional representation, specially confined to the representatives of business men.  If it is necessary to have a special and separate franchise to be sure that business men will be elected for the Dublin Council, I cannot, for the life of me, see what is going to prevent the next Franchise Bill containing a provision which will ensure that business men &mdash;men of a certain property qualification&mdash;shall have a special and separate set of representatives in the Dáil.  I think that, probably, is in the mind of some of the supporters of this section.  I should like to put it to the Minister, and to those who support this section, that its effect is likely to be contrary altogether to that which they would like to secure. I would ask the Minister if he remembers the pre-1918 period in the Corporation, when there was a general qualification and no separate franchise of a fancy character.  Did that electorate refuse to elect business men?  I remember, although I was not resident in Dublin at the time, that there were on the Council of Dublin such men as Councillor Beattie, Alderman Corrigan, Councillor Hubbard Clark, Sir Joseph Downes, Senator James Moran, Sir Patrick Shortall, Maxwell Lemon, and Michael Moran, and numerous others elected by the popular vote, even though they were business men. Now it is suggested that a new electorate will not elect business men because of some new influence that is supposed to have come into public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the new influence?  and <Col N="1297" /> what is going to be the likely effect? It would seem to be almost inevitable that the consequence of making a separate franchise for business men to elect five business men, will tend to consolidate the rest of the electors against electing business men. They will say &ldquo;Business men will elect business men.  Let the rest of us therefore elect others than business men.&rdquo;  And I predict that the result of this particular section will be to have fewer business men in the council than you would have if this section was not embodied in the Bill.</P>
    <P>But what is meant by a business man?  Who are the men that are to be elected as business men?  Perhaps the Minister will give us a little more information as to how and why this register is to be compiled. Every person being a rated occupier whose premises are valued at not less than £20, and if such premises are occupied by such individual partly or wholly&mdash;I am leaving firms and corporate bodies and so on on one side&mdash;for the purpose of carrying on business, profession, trade or manufacture or other commercial or industrial pursuits.  What does that include?  I take a street that I am familiar with.  I picture a certain house of £20 valuation.  The occupier is a dressmaker with one room set apart for dressmaking. She is entitled to a vote under that particular qualification.  Take the case of a woman who has a house and carries on the business of catering for lodgers.  Is that a business qualification and does it entitle her to vote under this franchise?  I can see no reason why she should not. It seems to me quite inevitable that such persons should seek and should succeed in seeking to get on the new register.  Is an insurance agent not a man who could claim to carry on some business if he lives in premises over £20 valuation and sets a part or portion off it for the conducting of his business?  Is he then not entitled to get on the register?  It will widen no doubt the number of registered electors but is that going to ensure to the business man that the particular type that it is sought to <Col N="1298" /> ensure representation for will be elected?  I think it will not.</P>
    <P>There is an implication in this section that you cannot find enough business men to be so public minded and to have interest in public affairs of sufficient depth and width as to face the electorate, and that the organised bodies which may be presumed to be in the field at election times, will consistently and with malice aforethought refuse to put all business men upon their list of nominations.  The Minister seems to forget that the whole basis of election is still on the proportional representation system and, consequently, to have the effect that is sought, there is no necessity for this particular section.  I wonder if the Minister would go down to-morrow to Longford and state that what is now proposed in respect of Dublin is to be extended to the rest of the country?  There are, for instance, more farmers holding farms under fifteen acres in extent than farmers holding fifty-acre farms.  The necessary conclusion to be drawn from this section, to my mind, would be that in a future revision of the local government franchise the farmers having the larger valuation will have a larger number of votes than the smaller farmers with a smaller valuation.</P>
    <P>I cannot for the life of me see why one can introduce, or shall I say reintroduce, into the electoral law a principle of this kind of the multiple vote for propertied people unless one intends to extend it to other parts of the country.  I have no doubt this whole question will be discussed in greater detail during the Committee Stage of the Bill, but I think for our guidance the Minister should inform us, if he can, what is his estimate as to the number of voters under this Section 35 in respect of the different categories.  That is to say, how many does he anticipate of those propertied persons will be entitled to one vote, how many to two, how many to five or six, and so on, and how many there will be as regards the total? Also, would the Minister explain to us how it is proposed, and when it is <Col N="1299" /> proposed, to proceed with the making of the new register, and whether there will be opportunity of thoroughly informing all those who might be entitled to be placed upon the register under the definition of Section 34 of their right to be there, because there seems to be an impression that it is only intended for the larger business people and the larger property owners, whereas, as I pointed out, it is apparently intended that any person who partly or wholly carries on business in premises of £20 valuation and over shall have a separate vote for a separate class of representatives.</P>
    <P>There are several other parts of the Bill that, I think, should be amended, but I shall not deal with them now.  I am in agreement with my colleague, Senator Farren, when he says that the Bill with the amendments that have been made on it makes it much more preferable when compared with the Bill when originally introduced.  But I hope the House will follow the advice of Senator O'Neill and delete all references to this particular franchise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>As only one Senator has spoken in favour of the general principle of the clause against which the last Senator spoke strongly, I think it might be no harm to give some reason why I think the principles embodied in the section dealing with the commercial register are a very desirable experiment.  I do not propose to deal with some of the criticism by Senator Johnson, as his remarks as to the effect of the £20 vote are interesting and the proposal may require amendment.  I think a great deal of the talk with regard to democracy and fair representation is very largely wide of the mark and completely ignores certain fundamental facts in the situation.  It is well known that in many cases ratepayers who were directors of limited companies were not able to obtain a vote.  In the past you had a situation in the guise of fair play and democracy by which a large number of ratepayers were unable to vote. <Col N="1300" /> Take the case of one comparatively small business which I know personally. Before it became a limited company there were four votes for four individuals.  When it became a limited company there was no vote for the local council.  Actually because of the valuation I find under this Bill there will be again four votes.  That is supposed to be undemocratic and something which cannot possibly be thought of.  I am not prepared to prove that in every case it will work out as equitably as in the one I mentioned.  What I suggest is that it is a desirable growth and that limited companies, some large and some small, have undoubtedly made a case for a change and in the Bill have, possibly, not a perfect but an interesting experiment, which is not one to be turned down lightly or brushed aside as something which is undemocratic and not to be considered. I have read so much about it that I have been unable to understand what is democratic and what is not.  I take it that what we are concerned with is that there shall be fair play and representation reasonably proportionate as regards those who have to pay the rates in the City.  While there may be excellent arguments in detail against the proposal in the Bill, I think any arrangements by which sections which were unable to vote because companies had become limited, and who will now be able to exercise some say in the management of the City, are ones which ought to meet with our commendation.  I am not able to say whether some of the objections which Senator Johnson raised might not necessitate amendments.  I do not think the House should assume that provision is being made for a vote based on wealth rather than on the rates paid.  A company may represent a thousand shareholders, and in that case four or five votes are provided. To pretend that that is undemocratic and something to be pushed aside is, I think, absurd.  The reason I spoke was because of the tendency of some of the criticism to ignore one of the fundamental factors of the case.</P>

I might have had a certain amount of trouble in connection with it, but I think for every point of trouble I got, I gave the Department about ten points, in addition to the very great amount of work the staff did themselves.  For that particular reason I am grateful for the appreciation of the measure expressed in the Seanad.  I do not quite realise what Senator O'Neill meant, but I certainly have nothing to blame the Department of Local Government for, for what he saddled me with, or for any of the points I brought up in my speech.

      <P>As long as I make myself clear I am quite satisfied.  The Dublin Council can look at Portmarnock to-morrow and see what they want to do with it in the interests of Dublin.  What I was not prepared to do was, simply because there is a big strand there, to add, in addition to the very large area being added to Dublin, another area of 2,177 acres populated to the extent of one person per seven acres, and make the City of Dublin responsible for the local government of that area, which would mean not only looking after drains and the water supply, but dealing with every matter affecting the health and lives of the population.  I realise that there are areas outside Dublin that can give service to Dublin and that will want service from Dublin.  Let those responsible for the local government code, which is a very definite code, look the facts straight in the face, and take such action as they want to take with their eyes open, after a clear examination of the <Col N="1302" /> financial commitments involved, and say where the finances are to come from.  Neither the Dáil nor the Seanad is in a position to examine the stretch that runs from Kilbarrack to Malahide and say that the City of Dublin should take that area over as a part of the local government. We have a much more satisfactory machine to carry out that examination, and with definite authority to take such steps as it thought proper to bring in those areas, or to assist them in any way.  I am perfectly satisfied with the situation as regards that, and I think the Seanad will be satisfied.</P>
      <P>In reply to a casual remark with regard to the extension of these areas without introducing Bills into Parliament any extension by provisional order will involve attaching to that provisional order a short Bill in the usual way and the running of the proposal through the gauntlet of the Dáil and the Seanad.  That simply means that the Dáil and Seanad will have to review all these proposals before any of them are carried into effect.</P>
      <P>The suggestion was made that Dublin should be extended to Dun Laoghaire, leaving Dalkey and Killiney outside.  I think that impracticable for many reasons.  I do not see why Dalkey and Killiney should be left outside if other places are taken in.  You have the position that if the drainage of Dalkey is to be satisfactorily dealt with it must be drained into the Blackrock and Dun Laoghaire drainage system.  It cannot be linked up with the city. You would then have the position that you had the drainage system of Dun Laoghaire and Blackrock in the city, but in order to provide proper drainage for Dalkey you would have to drain it into the Dun Laoghaire system, so that nothing would be served in the way of the interests of Dun Laoghaire or Blackrock by taking these places in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the Port and Docks Board the Seanad will remember that a tribunal dealing with these matters has been sitting for some time and, I understand, we are on the eve of a <Col N="1303" /> report dealing with all the ports and harbours in the country.  The Seanad will have an opportunity of seeing the results of that report and will, I expect, have their views heard in dealing with legislation for the general control of the ports.</P>
    <P>Senator Connolly referred to the section dealing with tenders.  I put in that section dealing with the making of regulations for the reception of tenders in response to pressure, so that the control of contracts generally should be in the hands of the Council.  I do not know that there is anything really involved in it.  If the Council do not make regulations dealing with the acceptance of tenders the Manager will have to make them, and probably the Manager will have to make them in any case.</P>

Whatever the British Army, the Republican Army and the soldiers have been fighting for for years past, it is the first time I ever heard they were fighting for one man one vote in the local government franchise. If we want to examine the whole basis of the local government franchise and change it, let us do it, but let us do it after examination.  There has been no examination of the basis of the local government franchise in the Dáil, and I do not know if we are going to have it here.  If Senators are to approach the matter in the way it should be approached, then I think they should put down proposals and have an examination.</P>

      <P>Do not misrepresent the present proposals.  You cannot change the proposals here on the Dáil attitude.  Our whole attitude of mind, formed, no doubt, by legislation and tradition, is to regard as rather reasonable the difference that exists between the local government franchise and the Dáil franchise. What Senators who want to criticise the present proposals have to show with regard to the business franchise is why a person occupying a residence in the city of a valuation of, say, £20 should have a local government vote, and his wife should have a vote, if she comes within the age, while if they occupy business premises ten times the valuation for the purpose of carrying on a furniture-making business, a boot-making business or a distributing business, and pay rates to the tune of the valuation, why there should be no vote, good, bad or indifferent.  That is the question to be answered.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an attenuation of the local government vote from the occupation of rateable premises and the paying of these rates.  There is this attenuation at any rate, the rated occupier and his wife can have a vote and a lodger occupying unfurnished quarters in rateable premises can have a vote, so that you have an attenuation of the fundamental principle there that the person who pays rates has a vote.  There is no desire on our part to depart in a very material way from the present local government franchise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We propose that under the old franchise 30 persons shall be elected, and with these shall be associated five people elected on the restricted commercial franchise.  There is no question of smothering them or giving the commercial people representation that their ratepaying burdens would entitle them to, because <Col N="1305" /> we do not want to depart materially from the tradition that has grown up and that as far as we know has proved satisfactory, but we are anxious to undo the injustice that in one form has been referred to by Senator Douglas, and does exist in another form where a private individual owns a concern and not a company, and we are also anxious to do away with that injustice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is our proposal for doing away with it, but we are also anxious to get it in a way that will not involve the same amount of trouble that persons are involved in in going to the hustings and joining up definitely with a political party in order to secure election. We are anxious that those who represent capacity in business would have the opportunity of being brought into our City Council, so that they could have their voices heard in the management of the City, and be saddled with the responsibility of supporting as a business community the municipal policy.  Senator O'Neill quoted a remark of mine which I am prepared to stand over, and that is the difficulty of getting business people to come in either to national or local politics.  To say that this proposal of mine here is inconsistent with the magnificent and most democratic frame of mind in which I approached some of my previous work is entirely a misreading on what is in the Bill.  I think Senator O'Neill must have forgotten what the basis of the local government franchise was when he allowed himself to elaborate his objection to this particular proposal in the way he did, because I do not think he could have committed himself to the exact statement he made and to the general tone if he had remembered in any way that the real basis of the local government franchise is that men who occupy premises at a certain rateable valuation and who pay the rates are entitled to votes.  With <Col N="1306" /> regard to the figures, may I say on the question of £20 that I realise that is probably too low, and it may defeat its object.  However, that is a matter for consideration.  Senator Johnson raised the question as to whether a girl living in a house and using one of the rooms for the business of dressmaking would be on the register.  I am not prepared at present to say that she would.  When you come to deal with a matter like that you are presented with a spectrum, and you come to the point where you have to draw a line, and it is because we had a spectrum-like difficulty in the matter that the word &ldquo;profession&rdquo; is here.  Are you to put a family doctor off the register, and say that the dentist next door who employed an assistant mechanic was to be put on the register?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, so that I am not prepared to say whether a dressmaker who uses a room in the premises as a dressmaker will be on the register, but I will say that we will have a difficulty in finding the particular points at which the qualifications will stop, but that is no reason why we should refrain from attempting to give this very just and useful representation.  Senator Johnson asked me if I could give the figures for the different valuations. Let me say that in arriving at this £20 I had in mind that, in the first place, this £20 was a figure on which the Port and Docks Board Register is made up, and, in the second place, when I sat on a Private Bill Committee that dealt with Dundalk Harbour, <Col N="1307" /> the valuation of £20 was accepted generally as the valuation that made a person eligible to be an elector of the Harbour Board.  That is the explanation of the £20.  The only figures I have for the different sections of this valuation are the figures from the present Port and Docks Register.  Unfortunately, I have not the papers with me at the moment, but the total number of votes on that register is about 4,500. It is estimated that the number on the register for the City would be between 7,000 and 8,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of multiple vote, if any person thinks it unreasonable and that it is going back to what is supposed to have been the old rotten principle of the multiple vote, I would like to know some way in which we can discriminate between the occupier of a business premises of £20 or £30 and the occupier of a business premises valued at £250.  If you are going to do what you are seeking to do here in the matter of giving a certain amount of justice to ratepayers and a certain amount of representation to persons with a particular class of experience, you must have regard to the amount of valuation, as otherwise you go deep down to the position to which Deputy Johnson has drawn attention. What is always suggested to me when I hear people making jokes about Cork and Corkmen is that it is a very subtle kind of propaganda instituted by Cork, and when you hear something suggested about what the Corporation did from 1877 or 1878 in every inquiry set up about the position in Dublin I begin to suspect, however much criticism of the Dublin Corporation may have turned in later days, that it began out of great affection for the Dublin Corporation, and was kept up almost by the Dublin Corporation people themselves out of pure love and joy and kind of self-boosting.  Certainly it is impossible to read some of the evidence in some of the old reports without putting the Dublin Corporation into the same class as the Cork <Col N="1308" /> man of to-day, and the mother-in-law and people like that about whom jokes are made.</P>

    <P>I put down that amendment to meet a point raised by Senator O'Doherty last week.

I suggest he should substitute therefor the &ldquo;committee of management.&rdquo; What we were looking for in our amendment was a check on the promoters, that is, the paid officials.  There is nothing in the Bill to compel a promoter to send out a receipt suggested by the amendment in Senator Farren's name, but if the committee of management receive notification from the purchasers of tickets that they have got no official receipt they can take the matter up immediately with the promoter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jameson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say just a few words and it is not in criticism of the Bill but in answer to some remarks made during the discussion on this Bill.  Senators have said that we who were criticising the Bill had nothing to propose and that we were really opposing a Bill which was absolutely necessary for the hospitals. I would just like to make one or two remarks about the hospitals and their present position and I want to make plain the action of those of us who are criticising the Bill and the position we have taken up about it.  The real object of this Bill is to raise money temporarily to get the hospitals out of the difficult position which they are in at present. My real objection to this Bill is that it is dealing in a temporary way with a problem that should be dealt with in quite a different way altogether.  I hold that this Bill is not going to mend the position of the hospitals at all in reality or to make them good and efficient hospitals as they ought to be.  This Bill will I hope get over the temporary trouble.  It will pay off the bank overdrafts and relieve the guarantors of their difficulties.  It will enable them to go on with their work <Col N="1313" /> and rid themselves of their debts in the next four years.  But a good many of us think it is a Bill that will interfere very much with the support hitherto given by a great many members of the charitable public to the hospitals.  If one were disposed in any way to make a suggestion of what might happen it might very well be this&mdash;there would be plenty of people who will say: &ldquo;These charitable hospitals have now gone in for sweepstakes, and why should I spend my money in subscribing to these hospitals&mdash;why should I not spend my money in buying a ticket on the sweepstakes?&rdquo;  In that event the hospitals would get about 20 per cent. of that money. That is why I say that this is not going to place the hospitals on a permanently satisfactory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been asked if we have any suggestions at all.  My suggestion is that undoubtedly there ought to be some inquiry by a perfectly independent body of people into the present condition of the hospitals.  They are admittedly practically bankrupt.  They are admittedly unable to carry on in their present condition.  We ought to have some independent inquiry as to whether there is not some other way beyond this merely temporary suggestion to improve the position of the hospitals.  This Bill is only postponing the difficulty and we will be in a worse position to deal with it in four years' time.  In my opinion we should have a proposition from the promoters of this Bill that during the time that this Bill keeps the hospitals going we are going to have an inquiry as to whether this large number of small hospitals should be kept on and whether it is not the experience of all people connected with hospitals in every country in the world that the way we are dealing with the problem is the worst possible way of dealing with it; whether we should not have in front of us the best ways in which the hospitals are worked abroad?  That is to say one or two or three great hospitals with enormous economies in management would really do the <Col N="1314" /> work of the hospitals as it should be done and would enable them to have money to carry out great research problems.</P>
    <P>The difficulties at present are that there is no money amongst the hospitals to enable them to carry on research. These hospitals are the schools in which our medical men and surgeons are reared and from these hospitals they get launched into their professions.  Up to now the Dublin medical schools have held a very high name and men with degrees from the Dublin schools are taken everywhere.  If we do not get modern research machinery and get special individuals paid for research work we will go down.</P>
    <P>This problem is not alone before the Dublin hospitals.  It is before the British hospitals of every description as well.  At a meeting of a great British hospital in the North of England a week ago, one big Scottish man said that he gave five years to the British hospitals to be able to carry on on their present lines.  He said that because of the great increase in taxation the usual sources of charity are going to be dried up and the hospitals will not be able to carry on as at present. Well, at the present moment we in Dublin are in the position in which the Scottish man said the hospitals in the North of England would be in in five years.  We are not taking the proper steps to remedy this state of affairs now.  The suggestion I make is that a really great committee of scientific people, with perhaps a few business people also, would be formed and go into the troubles of the present position and see what is wrong with them and how they could be remedied.  If, for instance, it could be ascertained how you could build two or three great hospitals on the most modern plans, how steps could be taken to get the money for that purpose, by a loan supported with a Government guarantee, the problem might be solved. That could be arranged by a guarantee so as to put the hospitals on a basis for dealing with the problems facing them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> I hold that Dublin in its position in the Free State ought to be a great centre for hospital work.  Undoubtedly, as far as education is concerned anyone can see what a great benefit that would be.  If we let this go on as it is we will find four years hence that we will be in a much worse position than we are in at present.  I hope that the discussion on this Bill will cause some of the hospitals hereafter to get together a committee of independent men to go into this.</P>
    <P>I should add that on that committee there should be some ladies also, for they know a great deal about this question of the hospitals. Such a committee should go into this whole problem and let us have a report on it.  If this Bill had been accompanied by any such suggestion, if it was stated that it was only a temporary thing, and that during the time that this sweepstake business was going on there would be a real inquiry into the hospitals, I would be one of the first to support the Bill.  As the matter stands at present I will not vote against the Bill, but I do not think it is of any use in really improving hospital conditions in the City of Dublin.  I am saying this because I feel that some move should be made in this either by the hospitals themselves or by the Government.  It is quite possible in this way to evolve a great scheme for the benefit of the Dublin hospitals.  It cannot be done by sweepstakes.  It can only be done by big capital and the making of a great change in the state of the affairs that exist at present in the case of hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in full agreement with the views that have been expressed just now by Senator Jameson on this particular question. The reason I have endeavoured to give all the support I could to this Bill is because I believe it is purely a temporary matter.  I know the conditions in some of the Dublin hospitals at present.  Unless some relief is got immediately they cannot carry on.  That is why I have <Col N="1316" /> done my best to help in getting this Bill through.  Senator Jameson has raised a larger issue.  I entirely agree that this Bill will not solve the problem and that some great effort will have to be made to deal with the whole position in connection with the hospitals.  This is only a weak measure.  But some effort has been made.  Senator Jameson spoke about research.  It is only a year ago that I went to one of the best hospitals in Dublin.  The master of the hospital brought me around and showed me the work he was endeavouring to do. He told me about the research work that he was having carried out in one particular disease and the dreadful scourge this malady was to the women in Dublin.  I know that he was paying out of his own pocket money in order to have this research work carried out.  That was the late Doctor Louis Cassidy.  Senator O'Farrell will remember that Dr. Cassidy waited on prominent Ministers of State asking them to get something done to help in research work but since then nothing has been done.  In view of that, those of us who have supported this Bill&mdash; I must say against our will, because of its dire necessity we were compelled to do so&mdash;believe it is the best thing that could be done at the moment.  I hope as a result of this measure that some real practical steps will be taken on the lines suggested by Senator Jameson to deal with the whole question of the hospitals as it requires to be dealt with.  In conclusion I want to say that I have been playing a peculiar role in connection with this Bill.  In my case it is the story of the poacher turned gamekeeper.  My usual role has been to criticise measures introduced. But in this case I was placed in the position of trying to pilot this. Bill through its Committee and Report Stages.  I had some passages with Senators during the debate on the Bill.  I think they will appreciate that what I said was said without malice.  I appreciate the earnestness of those who oppose the Bill, I thank them for the consideration they have given me in my task.</P>

      <P>My opposition to this Bill is owing to two causes. The first is that it seems to be a Bill that is rather a ponderous and inelegant machine for getting what is really only a paltry sum for the hospitals.  I use the term &ldquo;inelegant&rdquo; because it does not seem a graceful way for dealing with the sick and infirm, and it is ponderous because large sums will have to be raised.  I might say millions will have to be lashed about, in order to get this sum for the hospitals. It reminds me of a Heath Robinson cartoon depicting an elaborate electro-hydraulic steam-engine specially designed to kill a wounded gnat.  Those who are promoting this Bill told us that they tried other means; but that in the meantime the hospitals want money, and they say this is only a stop-gap. But the danger is that the stop may remain in the gap if this Bill is very successful.  My main objection is the matter of the danger of such a measure.  It is a thing that could have been obviated had the Minister been here&mdash;at least my difficulty in the matter could if I had realised the thing in time or had an amendment down.  I refer to the dangers that the promoters are in. Amendments introduced to-day by Senator Farren have obviated the danger of general or wholesale corruption on the part of the sellers of tickets.  But as far as the promoters are concerned there is very little protection except the audit.  There are many ways of getting round an audit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one question I would like to ask the Minister and, as he is not here, I will ask Senator Farren if he can answer me&mdash;though I am sure that the Senator could only deal with one section while the Minister could deal with the whole Bill.  As the Bill stands it is quite possible for the Minister to sanction a promoter who would have been found guilty in a Court of Justice of defrauding.  That is the position as the Bill stands.  A man who might have been found guilty of defrauding the revenue of a great deal of money can, under this Bill, be made a promoter of a <Col N="1318" /> sweepstake.  I think there should be some guarantee by those in charge of the Bill that, as far as they can, they will assure us that no such person shall be appointed promoter.  I think it is an awful pity that the Minister refuses to come here.  Whether the Minister is the promoter of the Bill or not is beside the question.  Once this Bill becomes an Act he becomes responsible for the administration of it.  For that reason I say it is a pity he is not here.  I would like to ask Senator Farren or Senator Fanning what they have to say in the matter. A public statement will do no harm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply I think the best way is to give details indicating the attitude which I propose to adopt arising out of these <Col N="1319" /> points that have been made by Senator Sir John Keane.  Senator Sir John Keane did not leave out of consideration a matter that was more or less <i>sub judice</i> as between the Permitted Undertakings Association and the Electricity Supply Board. As that is pretty well under consideration at the moment I do not propose to refer to it.  The Senator can raise that point in some other way in the House.  The Senator has asked me as to the responsibility of the Electricity Supply Board in the matter of rates and he asked me as to their responsibility in regard to income tax.  When the legislation dealing with the Electricity Supply Board was before this House I was asked by a Senator as to the liabilities of the Board in connection with these two points.  I think I made it clear that as far as income tax was concerned we did not propose to change the present law and as far as rates were concerned I have provided special exemption under the Electricity Act of 1929.  Outside of that I think I said that the Board was liable for the rates and should pay the rates.  Both these matters may be called in dispute.  Legislation will be introduced some day soon to deal with this matter and regularise the position.  The exemption conferred by the Act of 1929 will remain but everything else in the way of rates will have to be paid according to the proposal that is coming before the Oireachtas.  Income tax is also in dispute.  At the moment, I have no proposal in regard to that.  I think the position is clear.  If, however, we find that there is still time, it is likely that in order to prevent the cost of legal action between the Revenue Commissioners and the Electricity Supply Board, we will bring in legislation to regularise that position.  My view is that the Board ought to pay income tax. There may be a slight exception to be made and there may hereafter have to be adjustments as between the burdens that are to fall on the ratepayers or the taxpayers in relation to the State and the <Col N="1320" /> consumers of electricity.  That matter will arise later.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane drew attention to one item in the auditor's certificate in which it was stated that &ldquo;the amount due to sundry creditors for materials purchased, constructional work carried out and expenses incurred has not been fully vouched by us, due to the fact that statements in verification of some of the amounts shown due in the book to creditors were not available.&rdquo;  I have queried that point and found that it simply refers to this: that when the creditors' balances came to be investigated and a decision taken as to the amounts, documents were sent out to the various creditors indicating, as far as the Board's accounts went, what were the balances that were due and asking if there were agreements.  In most cases returns were sent back which were in agreement not merely with the amount stated but also indicating the allocation of the amounts against certain items.  In some accounts information had not come from the creditors, but there was no dispute as to the balance.  What was in dispute was how the money declared to be owed was to be allocated amongst the different items of expenditure.  That point will be cleared up later.  That is all that is behind the auditor's certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point made by the Senator was that in future the items for generation costs and distribution costs should be subdivided to show what proportion was salaries and what proportion was for materials and overhead charges.  I want to call attention to one item in connection with that matter and I hope that it will clear up a lot of suspicion in regard to what has been described here as the revenue account and the items in that revenue account, lower down.  These items refer to undertakings which were acquired by the Board and not at all to the Board's own operations.  That account is again segregated solely in regard to the undertakings which were acquired at the date to which this account relates.  In that connection I might say that hereafter, <Col N="1321" /> when the Shannon power is really the matter which the Board is using and on which their accounts will turn, I will most sympathetically consider&mdash; in fact, I have decided almost to accept&mdash;the Senator's suggestion that the further item of the generation expenses should be subdivided. I say &ldquo;almost to accept&rdquo; for the reason that it may be a year or two before a proper allocation of general headquarter expenses can be made. There may have to be some changes, but as soon as we can see a proper allocation of that, the items will be subdivided.</P>
    <P>The Senator's next point dealt with the small amount shown against the interest on loans.  That only means interest on loans on moneys borrowed by the local undertakings which had been acquired and has nothing to do with moneys advanced by the Minister for Finance.  That is under the heading of loans.  There is a discrimination in the accounts between the loans due by undertakings taken over and moneys advanced by the Minister for Finance from the Central Fund.  &ldquo;Advances&rdquo; is the word used for moneys advanced from the Exchequer.  That explanation would also answer the next point made by the Senator except the suggestion he made at the end as to how this capital sum of repayment might hereafter be dealt with.  We had a suggestion that a capital redemption account might be opened and that the full sums of money advanced from the Central Fund should be shown with a subtraction showing the repayments up to a certain date and the nett figure plus subtraction would be shown in lieu of certain figures shown here.  It was decided after consultation with the auditor not to have these accounts opened in this particular form because the amount of money to be dealt with was so small.  I shall again, however, consult the auditor as to the advisability of instituting that capital redemption account and of treating these sums of money in the way I have spoken of.  The suggestion that the Senator made with regard to segregating the <Col N="1322" /> sums according to the sub-head under Section 12 of the Electricity Supply Act of 1927 under which advances are made, will be adopted.  In other words, we will show distinctly how moneys are advanced under subparagraph 2 and also under subparagraph 3.  I cannot say, however, that the suggestion will be easily carried out on the revenue side, because it is not so easy to show how the two items can be segregated, as in fact we will be only dealing with one of the items, redemption.  It may be possible even on the redemption side to make a similar segregation, and I will consider that.</P>
    <P>On the question of the redemption of loans, and the very small sum which the Senator pointed out is provided this year for the redemption of loans, the Senator did not inquire so much as to the amount but rather as to what was the method of keeping the money set aside.  For instance, he talked of showing the securities in which this money was invested.  At the moment, this repayment was one of a group of cash disbursements made as soon as the cash came in.  Again it is hard to say that the Electricity Supply Board will ever have on hands sufficient money to involve it in any investing policy, but if they do have a surplus built up&mdash;say in the repairs and renewals fund which will have to be built up from year to year&mdash;and there is any money in their hands which could properly be invested, the Senator's suggestion can be adopted and a list of the securities shown.  The Senator will realise that most of the moneys shown were cash disbursements made as soon as the cash came in. The Senator referred to separate accounts and I will deal with that later.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Senator I am making my best endeavour to see that the accounts are issued earlier, but you cannot expect in the first couple of years that things should be done as in the future.  The Board is only finding its way and the form which the accounts will ultimately take has yet to be decided.  The present <Col N="1323" /> form is very different from that which the accounts will take when they become stereotyped and the office organisation is built up.  As the work increases in a certain way we will have the organisation built up and the accounts put on a different basis.</P>
    <P>Senator Jameson made a comparison with the Dublin Electricity Department and said that there should be some details given.  I have been told that the old accounts prepared under the Board of Trade regulations were devised only for the purpose of giving a lot of useless information and hiding the exact facts from everybody else.  That does not at all mean that there may not be details that could be given in the future.  It would, however, be very difficult for me to compel the Board to make any such wide division which the Senator read out dealing with the Dublin accounts, but we could divide certain accounts. The particular matter to which the Senator referred will really come in due course.  I think at the moment most people would say that it is unjust to put on the Board the task of compiling all this statistical matter when their operations have been really so limited and when in fact they have not data on which to base a statistical record.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson called attention to the fact that the auditors' report stated that &ldquo;all head office expenses have been capitalised, no portion of the sum being charged against revenue.&rdquo;  Even under the present form of accounts a certain amount of office expenses have been segregated or spread over certain accounts, but this is only a preliminary matter. It is only what one would expect in a preliminary report, which would not be so rigid as that which would appear later.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnson raised two matters of policy, one being in regard to the question of power charges.  I do not think the question of power charges really arises on this motion, but the Senator managed to get a foothold <Col N="1324" /> in the account to bring the matter up.  He raised the general question of policy, and said that the Board, by a certain method of charges, may run counter to the industrial development policy which a Government might think was desirable. That question was raised in the two Houses during the passage of the electricity supply legislation. My recollection is that my answer was, and it holds good to-day, that the Board's policy, as outlined in certain sections of the Bill, is that they charge so much for current and so much only as will enable them to meet all expenses.  That is implied in the legislation itself, if not absolutely clearly stated.  It is also stated that amongst separate items their charges should be such as would pay their expenses for that item.  If it is the policy of the Government, say, that the use of power from the Shannon Scheme should be to encourage industrial development by cheap power, and if that interferes with the Board's ability to make both ends meet, under the instructions they have, then it is a matter for a resolution to be brought in.  It is a matter for the Government to give that direction, having got their authority from the Oireachtas previously, that such works should be charged in certain ways to certain classes of consumers.  It is clearly laid down that the Board has to make such charges as will pay for the cost and, therefore, they are bound to make their charges on certain items pay for the costs.  That cannot be urged too rigidly against them, because we all know that power-users ordinarily get cheaper rates than householders, who are charged at domestic rates.</P>

      <P>The question I raised had reference to the use of power in Dublin for trams and power in Cork for iron works.  Supposing another proposal comes forward at an equal distance from the power centre as say Cork, for an entirely new class of industry, is the Cork charge to determine the charge for the new industry?  Can the Board adjust its tariff to further or retard <Col N="1325" /> a particular industrial development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Board's policy on the question of tariffs is pretty well clear.  I think the Board is bound not to make any discrimination.  They make it clear that they were dealing with rates for current for ordinary domestic purposes and not for power.  They say there are two principles&mdash;one, that the rate charges must be such that the maximum number of consumers will utilise the supplies, and secondly that the rates of supply will be such as will correspond as closely as possible to the cost of supply for particular purposes, and that there should be no discrimination in between.  Any business man will make an adjustment so that the large user would normally get better prices than the smaller purchaser, that is to say, if the larger purchaser takes it right through the year.  If he is using it only intermittently he would have a discrimination against him, just as if the smaller user were only getting it for part of the year he could not expect to get it as cheaply as if he were getting it all the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, the discrimination made gives the big user an advantage as a big user.  I think that, however, had better be left over.  There is a general policy laid down in the report.  It does not deal with power charges except to a very incidental extent.  If there is any question of discrimination arising the matter can be raised very easily and dealt with.  It could be more reasonably dealt with when you have a concrete case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was waiting to come to the Senator's remarks in the order in which I have them here. Senator Johnson raised a question <Col N="1326" /> of policy with regard to the appointment of civil servants.  That question has been put many times to me. I do not know what it means.  If it refers to a temporary appointment of two civil servants, Mr. Fay and Mr. Leyden, on the Board for three months, the explanation was that there was great overlapping between my Department and the Board, and I wanted to have closer information about the activities of the Board in relation to these items than I had generally.  These two civil servants went on the Board for that period and then came off the Board in that capacity when the period ended.  I do not know if the Senator has been talking of the general personnel of the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to speak on that until more definite questions are put to me and a more definite resolution brought forward. Senator Colonel Moore raised a point about the flat rate and he surprised me by saying that I had agreed with him in that matter.  I doubt very much if I agreed with any such suggestion, because it is impossible under the Act.  My first proposal as brought before the Oireachtas would allow a flat rate to be struck all over the country irrespective of the point to which current was to be carried, but amendments were put in, peculiarly, with a view of safeguarding the Dublin consumers against what was described as bearing the burdens of the unremunerative parts of the country.  These amendments were accepted and, under the legislation as it is, the Board could not give a flat rate for the supply of electricity. The Board may give a flat rate for the supply of electricity on the outskirts of towns and villages.  Possibly that is what the Senator meant. Four or five years ago I expressed the point of view that that would be the best way, but the bulk rate is a very small fraction of the final cost to the consumer and as far as the <Col N="1327" /> other costs are concerned, distribution charges and so on, the legislation lays it down that each area bears its own cost or, to put it negatively, that no area can be charged with the cost of distribution within any other area.  That means that ordinarily it would be only a series of accidents that would bring about a flat rate all over the country.  A flat rate is practically impossible.</P>
      <P>As to the point raised by Senator O'Farrell, I queried that with the Electricity Supply Board, and find that they are clearly of opinion that a change of policy with regard to the system of house wiring is necessary. They now intend to develop a system of deferred payments as against the hire-purchase system.  The main difference between the two systems is, that under the hire-purchase system, which they had been following, the consumer had to take standard fittings and the payments were spread over a very long period.  In the case of the deferred payment system, there is a choice of fittings given to the consumer, but payments have to be made within a shorter period.  The Board have made up their mind that the old hire-purchase system led to tremendous difficulties.  Consumers were always complaining of having to take a particular type of fitting, but did not want to realise that if they went outside the standard fittings the price necessarily had to go up.  It was also discovered that the lengthy period over which payments were spread made the hire-purchase system definitely unremunerative. The new system will have the advantage that it will give more in the way of choice to the consumer in the matter of fittings.  The Board think that while the shorter period over which the loans are spread will not weigh too heavily on the consumer, it will have the advantage of bringing in their money much quicker than the old system.  The new system will, it is believed, increase the consumption of electricity and be remunerative, which the old system was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> Senator Jameson raised the general question as to whether the Board was making a profit or loss on certain items.  He pleaded generally for a segregation of accounts as between three items.  Under the legislation passed the Board have to produce separate accounts for the generation and distribution of electricity, and, thirdly, an account which covers their other activities.  One of the separate accounts must cover their other activities.  I have consulted with the officials in my Department, and also with the Chairman of the Electricity Supply Board, and I think it will be possible to prescribe accounts for, say, installations and for the salesrooms. I think that division of the accounts would meet the main point that the Senator stressed.  Senator Jameson, in that connection, said that he was anxious, as a Dublin consumer, to find out how consumers were now faring under the new system.  I think the Senator has his answer in that I promised him the information he asked for in regard to the separate accounts.  When he gets those separate accounts he will know whether the sales rooms are being run at a profit or loss, and whether the wiring of houses that is being done all over the country is being carried out at a profit or a loss.</P>
    <P>With regard to the citizens of Dublin, I think the answer is pretty clear.  The citizens at the moment, on contract rate, have an advantage over the old rate and, in addition, they have the option of a different method of charge which, on the whole, will bring a further reduction to them.  When I say that I am to be taken as speaking generally, because it is possible that an individual consumer by reason, for instance, of the amount of electricity consumed and taken in relation to the valuation of his houses, may have to pay a higher charge than was imposed heretofore.  But, in the main, the rates that are now set out offer an inducement to the citizens of Dublin. They are a definite decrease on the rates that heretofore obtained and, in addition, the citizens have the option of a second method of charge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> The last point that Senator Jameson made is one of the most difficult things that we have to deal with&mdash; that is, with regard to the rules and regulations for the public safety. The Board have published certain regulations for the wiring of houses which are described as being provisional. These regulations govern the electrical wiring of premises to be connected with the networks of the Electricity Supply Board.  These regulations will have to be supervised and changed, but that does not finish the question.  It is not a very defensible position that we have at the moment.  The Electricity Supply Board issues regulations governing the wiring of houses, say, and decides as to whether or not they themselves have carried out their own regulations.  Finally, if anybody suffers by reason of the wiring they decide as to whether or not they are guilty of any dereliction of duty under regulations that they themselves imposed.  That is not a very defensible position.  It is one that we shall have to look into. It means that instead of my Department being able to divest itself of all responsibility and consequently of all its staff in connection with electricity, we shall have to retain someone who is expert in such a matter as this.  It is a matter for consideration whether we can get some official who, while having other duties to occupy him fully, will be able to give the time required for a duty such as this.  I am not at all holding that the present system should be continued, but there is some difficulty of getting another system arranged.</P>
    <P>I can promise that most of the things that have been suggested will be attended to in the next accounts. While promising that I have been adverting all the time to the fact that the Board should not have imposed upon it the procuring of a whole lot of information which would simply hamper it in its activities, add to its expense and at the same time serve no useful purpose.</P>
    <P>It must, on the other hand, be remembered that this Board was put <Col N="1330" /> in a peculiarly independent position. A promise was given that, in return for the very definite independence they got, the public would get the fullest information with regard to their accounts and, in their annual report, with regard to their activities. It seems to me that if we do impose something upon the Board in the way of an obligation which may involve expense that they ought both carry out the obligation and incur the expense in order to satisfy the public that their operations are being properly conducted.  There is a point beyond which I would ask the Senator not to press me to go.  I do not think that that point is anything like being reached at the moment.  I think that most of the statistics asked for can be incorporated in the accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Electricity Supply Board is to be embarrassed at this stage by the preparation of details such as the Minister has referred to, then anybody who has ever had to do with the controlling of large businesses must know that the members of the Board will have precious little time to devote to far more important matters than those mentioned here to-day.  We have been told that this Board was put in an independent position.  Its independence was implemented in the Electricity Supply Act.  The present Chairman of the Board is a gentleman who, I understand, was at one time associated with the Income Tax Department.  It is reasonable to assume that he knows something about accountancy.  Mr. J.C. Foley, another member of the Board, holds a degree in accountancy, while Mr. Egan, another member has had a very extensive commercial experience. The officials of the Board have, I take it, been picked and selected for their competence to do the particular work they are entrusted with.  I suggest it would be folly for this House or the Dáil to hamper the members of the Board at this stage of their operations by obliging them to stereotype the form which their accounts are to take, because anybody who knows what is <Col N="1331" /> involved in the matter must realise that these accounts will not be capable of standardisation until the activities of the Board attain to a greater degree of development.  To ask for a better form of accounts at the present time is, to my mind, ludicrous.  I hope the Minister will not ask the Board to prepare statistics which at the present stage of development would be perfectly useless and which would only add to the expense&mdash;an expense that will inevitably be passed on to the consumer.</P>

      <P>I thought that we were going to end our discussion on this motion on a harmonious note. Senator Dowdall, however, has gone out of his way to be rather provocative about the whole subject.  The motion was brought up in a friendly spirit, and moderate criticisms of the accounts were offered.  In almost every case the Minister has gone into the matters raised.  He admitted that the criticisms made were reasonable, and indicated that as far as possible the suggestions made would be carried out.  I cannot see what justification Senator Dowdall has for saying that we are trying to impose on the Board the duty of preparing a mass of useless statistics and a lot of unnecessary work.  I do not think the Senator was here when the motion was moved.  If he were he would have known that it was clearly understood that the suggestions made could only come in gradually.  In bringing forward this motion we are simply looking ahead in a reasonable way to get an accounting structure to meet the demands of a large expanding business. There is nothing unreasonable in doing that.  The Senator's statement amounts to this that because there are experts on the Board we should abandon and abrogate our right of criticism, and give the Board a blank cheque to do what they liked.  Rightly or wrongly we have a duty in this matter, and I suggest that we should use it with discretion.</P>

    <P>I thank the Minister for the sympathetic way he has gone into this <Col N="1332" /> matter.  I am sure he realises that we are not trying to embarrass him. I imagine that if the accounts were published earlier in future it would be possible to embody in the following year's accounts any agreed criticisms that might be made.  If, for instance, the accounts were published in September or October and as a result of criticisms made during December, then I think agreed changes could be introduced in the following year which, for accounting purposes, would, I take it, open in the month of March.  I desire to say that I am glad the debate has had the outcome that it has.  The motion has had a very favourable reception, and with the permission of the House I ask leave to withdraw it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in view of the present excessive rate of interest charged by the Irish banking companies on loans and overdrafts, the Seanad requests the Executive Council to take such steps as may be necessary to control such rate of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion was put down for discussion about three weeks ago.  After I had sent in notice that it was my intention to move it, it was suggested to me that the motion might have an injurious effect on the National Loan which was just then being launched.  I do not think that the discussion of the motion would in any way be injurious to the National Loan.  On the contrary, I think that some of the arguments which I hope to develop would have been an exposition of the value of making an investment in the National Loan.  But lest it should be interpreted in any way as being aimed at producing an injurious effect on the flotation of the National Loan, I decided it was wiser in all the circumstances to postpone going on with the motion.  We, in our Party, <Col N="1333" /> have no desire in any way to injure the National Loan or the National credit.  We are very vitally interested in the national credit, and claim that the potential credit of this country, both as a field for national development and for investment is second to none: that the potential resources of the country should be developed on a sound national basis, and that we should ignore the interests of extern elements which, it is to be feared, often count more in this country than the interests of the natives.  My reason for bringing up the motion is that there is a very considerable discrepancy between the rates of interest charged by the banks at the moment and the present value of money, not only in this country but all over the world, as well as to show that what is the accepted bankers' theory as regards the value of money in this country compared with the ordinary standard, or what was accepted as the standard, is being completely ignored in the present situation.</P>
    <P>The present deposit rate in Ireland is one and a half per cent.  The overdraft rate for commercial, agricultural, and other purposes charged at the moment throughout the country by the banks is five and a half per cent.  There may occasionally be a difference between the loan rate and the overdraft rate, and a difference between the terms which one client at a bank gets compared to the terms given to another client. There may be certain types of securities on which a bank will advance money at a lower rate than five and a half per cent., but as against that there may be loans granted by the banks on which they charge more than five and a half per cent.  What I want to point out is that at the moment there is a difference of four per cent. on the average between the deposit rate and the overdraft rate.  The published English bank rate at the moment is three per cent.  We had been led to believe in this country that we had a grievance because the prevailing Irish bank rate was always one per <Col N="1334" /> cent. above the English bank rate. We find that to-day it is two and a half per cent. above the English bank rate.</P>
    <P>I know it will, and can, be argued that the English bank rate, though advertised at three per cent., does not prevail in quite a number of commercial and business transactions on the other side.  What I want to point out is that we here have to consider the rates charged by the Irish banks from the Irish point of view.  It is not our fault that we are linked up so closely with the system of banking carried on in England and elsewhere. That is something to be regretted and something that will have to be contested.  Even those who only take a layman's interest in questions of finance and trade know that at the moment bankers' systems are very much under suspicion, not only in Ireland, but all over the world.  I venture to say that in this country we are not going to have anything like economic, industrial or agricultural development, or anything tending towards the progress and prosperity of the ordinary people, of the ordinary business and producing community, until we get right down to what is the fundamental economic evil at the present time, namely, the stranglehold that bankers have got on industry and production.</P>
    <P>I think it is fitting that I should call the attention of the House to the minority report of the Banking Commission, which is signed by Mr. J.J. McElligott, who is now the Secretary to the Department of Finance.  I desire to quote what he states for the reason that, perhaps, it will not be looked upon as a biassed opinion, as mine might be thought to be.  Mr. McElligott was a member of the Bankers' Commission, about which I will have something to say later.  In his minority report he states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The margin between the rate of interest allowed on deposits and that charged for accommodation seems to be always greater in this country than in England.  At the present time the margin here is 3½ per cent., 2½ per cent. being the <Col N="1335" /> published rate of interest on deposits and 6 per cent. the Irish bank rate, while in Great Britain the margin is 2 per cent. and 3 per cent., 3 per cent. being the rate allowed on deposits and 5 per cent. being the Bank of England rate. Movements of the Irish bank rate follow those of the English, and if the Bank of England rate were reduced to 4½ per cent. the Irish bank rate would fall to 5½ per cent., while the English and Irish deposit rates would fall to 2½ per cent. and 2 per cent. respectively. As regards both the actual rates and the margin between the deposit rates and those charged for accommodation, the position here seems to require explanation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Mr. McElligott, since the issue of this report, secured that information.  I do not know whether the Minister for Finance has got further information on the matter or whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who really is more concerned with this matter has any information.  But I quoted Mr. McElligott's statement to show that here, at all events, was a question raised on the existing system of charges for overdrafts and loans in this country as distinct from the English system, and I contend that the position to-day is worse than it was then, in the sense that there is a bigger gap to-day and less justification for that gap than at the time that that report was published.  In dealing with this matter it is reasonable to suppose that the banks could put up various arguments and, I think, the bankers did put forward various arguments at the Banking Commission.  The comparative volume of trade which would be transacted by the bank's branches, say in country towns throughout Ireland, and similar branches operating in the larger towns in England, could be used by the bankers, and I think was used, as a reason for their extra charges. It was probably not the only reason they put forward.  At all events, it must be admitted that in many cases <Col N="1336" /> the towns in Ireland do not afford the same volume of business or turnover as, perhaps, in England, and accordingly it could be argued for them that there were overhead charges and that branch control cost them more money.  I do not need, at this stage or at any stage, to explode that argument.  I did explode it when we were discussing the Bank of Ireland Bill by giving a mere statement of the financial position of the banks operating in this country. At that time I showed clearly that the paid-up capital of the Bank amounted to 8¾ millions, that the profits amounted, in that particular year, to £1,861,000; the dividends to £1,109,000, and also that the built-up reserves of the banks were equal to 125 per cent. of the paid-up capital&mdash;that is, that they had 25 per cent. more reserve, I am speaking in broad figures, than they had in paid-up capital.</P>
    <P>Anyone who attempts to argue that the banks need this rate in Ireland is, I think, not speaking by the book, and I do not think they can bring forward any figures to justify their attitude.  There are many things in connection with this position that require the light of day. I would like for an instant to deal with the problem of hidden reserves of the banks, and unclaimed balances. I understand that there is a very considerable sum of money in the shape of unclaimed balances in the banks of this country, which the banks have as assets.  We discussed within the last hour a demand for an analysis of various accounts, and I agree with that.  I agree we ought to know; it does not do anyone any harm to know whatever may happen afterwards.  I would like to know who is entitled to these unclaimed balances.  In my judgment they are something that after a period of years should come to the State with a definite guarantee from the State that if on any occasion it should become necessary to make good any of these unclaimed balances to heirs at law the State should take the responsibility.  But whatever the position there is no <Col N="1337" /> question that the banks, as such, are not entitled to hold them.  I do not know what they are holding; they do not disclose the amount.</P>
    <P>Mr. McElligott, in another section of his Minority Report, referred to the insufficiency of the data that the bankers gave us.  I agree heartily with that.  There is no man could make an analysis of the economic position of this country from the bank reports.  I do not know whether that is deliberate or not, whether it is merely following the old tradition of the balance sheets. I know it is a position which should not be tolerated.  I think we ought to know what money is to the credit of the depositors and what is done with it&mdash;how much is operating here, and that we ought to have the fullest possible details.  We do not want the bankers to disclose anything secret as regards individual transactions.  We want a segregation of the accounts in such form that they will be an intelligent guide for the Minister for Finance and people generally as to where that money is and how it is being used. Mr. McElligott, in his Report, at page 64 of the Minority Report says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A further reform consequent on the establishment of a new political entity is the segregation in the accounts and balance-sheets of banks doing business here, of the figures of assets and liabilities relating to Saorstát Eireann, and the more frequent publication of such figures.  I would recommend that something on the lines of the monthly statement suggested by the British Committee on Currency and Foreign Exchanges, presided over by Lord Cunliffe&mdash;which suggestions were adopted by the London Clearing Banks, without imposing any necessity for action by the Government&mdash;might be adopted here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the present time the value of such accounts as the Irish banks publish is diminished by the want of uniformity.  The Banking Commission itself had occasion to <Col N="1338" /> complain, in its first interim report, of the lack of statistics, and the proposed Currency Commission will be unable to carry out its functions properly unless the trend of banking movements is made clear by presentation of the data mentioned.  From the outside point of view the paucity of statistical material of this kind renders impossible the intelligent appreciation of our major economic problems, that is, the visible adverse balance of trade, the growth or decline of prosperity, etc.  Without full information on these crucial matters the framing of a sound national economic policy, or indeed, sound private business policies, is rendered extremely difficult.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the views of Mr. J.J. McElligott and, so far as I know, nothing has been done on the matter with regard to them since.  There is one other point that I think it worth calling attention to when dealing with this question of interest.  In approaching this particular aspect, I think, first of all if I am right in my interpretation, and I believe I am, and secondly if my charge is well founded, something ought to be done. Banks in this country prepare half-yearly balance sheets.  All customers' accounts are made up for six monthly periods.  Under the Banking Act of 1844, it is stipulated that a rate per cent. is to be charged, which naturally pre-supposes that that is a rate per cent. per annum.  If the banks' accounts are made up every six months the interest charged for the six months' period is not deemed to be subject to six months' interest for the balance of the half year, and I do not think it is keeping strictly within the terms of the Act to do this.  If we take overdrafts of £25,000 or £30,000 and the rate happens to be six per cent., there is a very considerable amount of money in the form of compound interest charged at the end of twelve months by being charged up in two periods of six months.  I see Senator Douglas smiling.  I hope he will be able to satisfy me on this point.  It is a point <Col N="1339" /> upon which I think we ought to be satisfied.  I think it is the duty of the Minister for Finance or some Board appointed by the Ministry of Finance to deal with this question of the people's interest.  I think as I said before, bankers are under suspicion everywhere.  I do not accuse and would be very sorry to accuse the Irish bankers of doing anything unfair.  I think they do what is fair according to their lights. I do not question their lights, but the system under which they are labouring, and possibly most of them, or at any rate a great many of them, are carrying on a traditional business in a traditional way.  They have not wakened up to the fact that they are the keystone of the whole economic structure, and that according as they act for the good of the country or against the welfare of the country the country will prosper or suffer. The banking machine, all over the world, is really getting the world in its grip, and in no part of the world, perhaps, more than in this country are we working for the bankers, and I see no prospect of it being otherwise until our basis of banking and our basis of credit and our whole system of currency is radically changed.  What that change will be I do not know, and how far the Minister for Finance will interfere I do not know, but I do know, that whether it is made sooner or later the change is coming, and it will have to come if this country is going to survive and make good.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that my argument would have been an argument that would help the National Loan.  I would like to make one or two remarks upon that.  The National Loan, issued at 93½, bearing interest at 4½ per cent. was, in my opinion, the best investment any people ever had presented to them, taking into consideration the present difficulties of the money market and the difficulty of placing any money with safety.  I think the Minister for Finance, who might have been here to-day, and I am sorry he is not, said a few days after the Loan was issued that in a <Col N="1340" /> very short time the loan would be at a premium.  I agree heartily, and I go further and say that the Loan was issued, in my opinion, at too cheap a rate, and remember this, it is the Irish people that are going to pay the interest on the Loan and to bear the responsibility for it.  The bankers may have said, &ldquo;We will do our best; we will take up so much of it and we will underwrite it all,&rdquo; but I would like any banker to put his hand to his heart and say truthfully that he could put up a better proposition than the last National Loan at the present time, taking into account the security and safety and the profit-bearing nature of the stock.</P>
    <P>In most matters that we bring up in this House we feel that we are beaten before we start.  That is to say, it is sufficient for a member of the Fianna Fáil Party to raise an issue here to have it defeated.  We have raised certain matters here not of a party nature, and I should like the House to understand that we as much as any party, and perhaps more than some parties, have very much at heart the whole national well-being, the credit and prosperity of the country.  We try to think in terms of the well-being of the ordinary citizen in Ireland, that is, the people who constitute the main body of our population, the plain people, the working people, the farmers in the fields and the workmen in the factories, and we realise that they alone are the strength of this nation and not any superficial emblems or display of prosperity as may be shown by the big picture theatres, or big business or anything else.  We think, in other words, in human terms, in terms of humanity, and I state here to-day, and will argue it anywhere else, that the real evil behind all our evils is an economic one, and the cause of the economic one is a banking one, the system of banking that we are living under.  I already said the banks here have accepted a traditional system&mdash;the British system and, indeed, the system prevailing all over the financial world. I ask Senators to look at the financial position to-day in London, in New <Col N="1341" /> York, and everywhere else, and to ask themselves are they satisfied?</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal about little factories in Ireland.  We cannot, we are told, put £100 or £1,000 into Irish factories, because all Irish factories go burst.  We have had a good deal of investments of Irish money outside Ireland in the last twelve months.  I venture to say that more money was lost in one day in the recent slump than was lost during a half century in Irish industries.  We never hear people telling us about the money that goes out of the country and is lost.  We never heard what happened with regard to the hundreds of thousands of pounds of Irish money and of Dublin money that was lost in the Hatry collapse.  We never heard about the money that is lost in all sorts of investments abroad, but we hear all about some unfortunate man who, struggling against most adverse conditions, happens to lose £1,000 of the shareholders' money in an attempt to establish productive industry in Ireland. It is time we woke up to realities and, above all, it is time that the bankers woke up to realities. I want to say that in so far as this Party is concerned we aim at controlling the system of banking.  It cannot be charged now that we are injuring the National Loan by making such a statement.  This régime has got to end, and this is but one step in the programme I visualise as being necessary if the economic salvation of this country is to be achieved.  I have not heard any reasonable argument to show me that the bankers in this country or for that matter anywhere else have not to justify their whole case.  Credit has gone west; industry has collapsed; there has been a collapse in activity.  We see it in England.  It all analyses down to the point, that the whole economic position is due to one cause, the system under which our banks are administered. It is time it was ended.  For that reason I hope what at the present moment remains of the Seanad will support me in this proposition.  It is not a Party matter.  It is an honest <Col N="1342" /> attempt to get something done and to curb the activity of the machine that is diametrically opposed to the interests of this country.  For that reason I hope Senators who are willing to judge an argument on an issue of this kind on its merits will lend their support to have the motion carried as one step in the right direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion which has been so well proposed by Senator Connolly.  Whatever the fate of the motion may be, I am very glad it has been proposed, because it is most desirable that the minds of Senators should from time to time be directed to the financial condition and to the finances of this country.  I was very glad to hear the observation which Senator Connolly made in reference to the National Loan.  This motion was postponed in order to avoid the possibility of a partisan attack upon us on the supposition that our motion was intended to prejudice the Loan.  As Senator Connolly has said, the Loan was issued in terms most favourable to subscribers. The financial position of this country is strong and sound.  We have a fertile soil; we have a healthy people who, if they get an opportunity to work, are willing, more and more, to work in their own land.  We have all the essentials of prosperity and of sound prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator very truly referred to the fact that, so far as Irish bankers were personally concerned, he made no imputation upon their honesty or upon their individual fairness.  His indictment was against the system and, so far as I understand that system, its evil is that it ties us to the commercial system of another country.  Conditions in England are quite different from conditions in this new State. England is a highly industrialised country.  Here we have an agricultural country.  We hope soon to have a balance between agriculture and other forms of industry, but so long as we are bound up financially with the greater, more powerful and more highly industrialised <Col N="1343" /> State across the water there is very little chance of that free scope which is so essential in a country like this, where we are endeavouring&mdash;I hope all Parties are endeavouring&mdash;to develop our resources as quickly and as solidly as we can.  It seems to me that there must be something wrong when credit is expanded and contracted from day to day, and from week to week, not at the will of the people, but at the will of certain mysterious persons who may be at the ends of the earth.  We saw in London the other day that the bank rate tumbled from 7 per cent. to 6 per cent., from 5 per cent. to 4 per cent., and then down to 3 per cent. without any sufficient reason so far as was apparent to the public.  I do not wish to prejudice any inquiry that may result from this motion, but it seems to me that, judging from our resources and judging from our foreign trade, our exports and our imports, we have not, in this country, the volume of currency or the credit which are essential to our free development.</P>
    <P>That is all I mean to say on this question, because I am quite sure there are other speakers who are more intimately acquainted with the question than I am, but I have this to say&mdash;that I in common with others am most anxious to have the opportunity of listening to a discussion on this question.</P>

The Senator <Col N="1344" /> has raised a whole lot of questions which will have to be looked into quietly in order to be answered. The Senator who have brought forward the motion dealt with the Currency Commission and made an indictment of the banking system of the whole country.
