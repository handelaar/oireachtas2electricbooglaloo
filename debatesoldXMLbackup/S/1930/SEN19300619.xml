      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad approves of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological methods of Warfare (1925), a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Seanad on the 19th day of February, 1930, and recommends the Executive Council to take the necessary steps to accede to the said Protocol subject to the following reservations, viz.:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  That Saorstát Eireann is bound by the Protocol only vis-a-vis those other States which have signed and ratified the Protocol or acceded thereto;</P>
      <P>(2)  That, in the event of the armed forces of any enemy State or of any ally of such State failing to respect the Protocol, Saorstát Eireann shall cease to be bound by the Protocol vis-a-vis such State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was to have been here to deal with these matters, and I presume he will be here.  In any case I assume that members of the Seanad have read copies of the Conventions that were circulated.  As they more or less explain themselves and are non-controversial it is only necessary <Col N="1618" /> for me formally to move their adoption.</P>

      <P>I was hopeful that the Minister would be here to explain the reason for these reservations. This document is dated 1925. I thought the Minister would be able to tell us whether there has been any general acceptance and ratification of this Protocol by the Powers that signed in the first instance, and why it comes about that the practice, shall I say, of experimenting in the use of asphyxiating, poisonous, or other gases is still going on.  If one gathers the truth from newspapers, and from journals of various kinds, it appears that there is a very considerable amount of experimentation in the use of these gases, all on the pretext that they are only defensive gases, and one would like to have some little explanation, if possible, as to whether any of these preparations for carrying on war by gases or by bacteriological methods have been tried in this country, or is going on here.</P>
      <P>In any case, I would like to know what is the meaning of this particular reservation, and what other States have ratified, subject to this reservation.  It may be said that the reservations are obviously necessary, but I am not quite so sure.  It seems to me the reservations are justifying preparation for carrying on war by poisonous gases, or by bacteriological methods, owing to the fear that one of the contracting parties may break away, and that, therefore, they would be all free to carry on.  These reservations suggest that that is going to be the mind of the States which are ratifying the Protocol.  There are other reasons why one would like to know what other States have ratified this Protocol, and I hope before the discussion concludes, if there is to be discussion, that the Minister will inform us on that matter, or if the Minister is not present that we might postpone discussion until we get some information on these points.</P>

      <P>The matter would undoubtedly be interesting if the Minister were here to elucidate these points, but I am not certain that it is of such grave moment as to warrant adjournment of the discussion.  The discussion in the Dáil was brief, but similar questions to those asked by Senator Johnson were put by one of the Deputies.  The Minister replied fully.  What he said appears in the Official Debates.  He stated that twenty-nine States had signed the conventions at the beginning, but that only seventeen had ratified them up to date.  As to the point raised by Senator Johnson that these reservations seemed to indicate a kind of qualified justification for the use of such methods, I think that is hardly a justifiable inference to draw from the reservation.  Obviously it would be only fair to expect when an agreement such as this is entered into between States that when one party to the agreement either breaks away or withdraws from it, the other parties cannot be expected to be bound by it.  Of course, it is regrettable that this kind of warfare should be at any time possible.  It is regrettable that any kind of warfare should be at any time possible, but it does not follow because war is sometimes adopted that the use of these gases could be justified.  I think that was the point Senator Johnson wanted to clear up, whether the State by this reservation wished to declare a certain measure of justification.  I only wish to point out that if the Senator will read the report of the Minister's speech in the Dáil he will find explicitly set out why these reservations have been put in.  Certainly they are not in any degree to give countenance to this particular method of warfare as being justifiable.</P>

      <P>It is a most unusual practice that members of the Seanad should be referred to the Report of the Parliamentary Debates in <Col N="1620" /> another House for the purpose of having explained the meaning and effect of an international agreement of this description.  In my judgment the Seanad, owing to its calmer atmosphere, the mature years and the long experience of many of its members, is an assembly in which matters of this kind should be fully and freely discussed.  It has occurred to me that perhaps the Minister for Justice, who is in the House, might be able to give us some explanation of this Convention and of the reservations.  Looking at the reservations, they seem to be reasonable. It is reasonable enough to avoid the use of these methods of warfare against countries who have pledged themselves not to use such methods of warfare, and it is also reasonable not to preclude ourselves from defending ourselves against nations that do use them.  I think that is the meaning of the first reservation.  As regards the second reservation, providing for the case of a country, that itself denounces the agreement.  It would be unfair if we were bound by it in any conflict with such a country.  It has been proved that the use of asphyxiating gas is most inhuman. We ought to have in the Seanad an explanation from the Minister.  If the Minister cannot be in attendance perhaps the question could be adjourned, or perhaps the Minister for Justice, who is in the House, might be able to give the Seanad such an explanation as would be satisfactory.</P>

      <P>That takes away from Senator Milroy's estimate of Senator Comyn's ministerial ability. I agree it is a bit of a slur that when international agreements come up for debate there is practically no interest in them.  Many of us complain of the want of interest in our international position and commitments, but we have very little right to complain if, when questions of the kind come up, even in the House, they are not to be answered authoritatively.  With regard to this resolution, I have read the documents and I have no doubt that this House ought to pass this motion.  As <Col N="1621" /> things stand, nations suffer from one another.  I wish that nations would pass Protocols of such a kind that there would be no reservations, but I am sufficiently a cynic to believe that nations would not feel themselves bound if they believed other nations had broken a particular agreement.  The observance of the Protocol would depend largely on the growth of international opinion and good will.  As it stands, I think it is of real value, and we ought to welcome it.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned for the attendance of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I regret that I am obliged to rule out of order the amendments handed in for the Committee Stage, all of which are in the name of Senator Sir John Keane.  The purpose of the Bill is to continue the increase of Rent Acts, 1923 to 1929, and these Acts are only amended for the purpose of continuing them.  Hence any amendments which seek to alter principles of these Acts are outside the scope of the present Bill as read a second time.</P>

      <P>As I have been precluded from dealing specifically with certain injustices that are contained in the Principal Act, I should like to deal with a very misleading statement by Senator O'Farrell.  He rightly said that there was no control of houses built after 1919.  In effect, that is an invitation to those who possess houses to profiteer.  Of course, they will take full advantage of their position as there are no houses to let to-day, and the housing problem has been depending in the past and will always in the future be depending on the number of houses offering to let, because the ordinary struggling person on a salary cannot afford to buy, or procure the capital to buy a house.  All these new houses are offered for sale.  Until you can get again displayed the old signboard &ldquo;House To Let&rdquo; the housing problem will remain in its present unsatisfactory position, and can only be settled by a lavish expenditure of State resources.  That is why decontrol is wanted.  You will then increase very largely the number of available houses you will have, and possibly by offering the houses to let there will be inducements owing to the increasing supply of old houses to build new houses also as the speculator did in the past, whereas no houses are available for letting now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if Senators appreciate the force of Senator Sir John Keane's argument. I certainly do not, as there is nothing in the present law that prevents a builder to-day putting up a notice, &ldquo;House to Let,&rdquo; in the house he builds.  How will the removal of the Rents Restrictions Act prior to 1919 facilitate him in that respect?  The suggestion seems to be that if you remove the Rent Restrictions Act you can make the existing houses available, <Col N="1623" /> presumably by evicting the tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>No sane person would let a house as long as that Act remains on the Statute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That Act does not refer to houses that are to be built, or that have been built for some years past.  I cannot see the force of the argument.  I know that houses are being let by speculative builders in increasing numbers.  I live in a district where houses are being built and let at what would be termed an economic rent.  They are undoubtedly exploiting the position there owing to there being no control, and they are getting the rents they are demanding.  The surprise is that more speculators do not build, seeing that they can let their houses at any price, or sell them if they want to, but I am not admitting that the removal of the rent restrictions in regard to the existing housing is going to encourage speculative builders to build houses and let them to people at rents they can pay.  As old houses become vacant, I understand they are free from restrictions as far as new tenants are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill ought to be passed.  It would be a great pity not to have a continuance of the existing law, although its existence has been rather precarious for several years, but we should not allow it to lapse so that de-control would come into operation at once.  Judging from his speech and the amendments which he had down, I think Senator Sir John Keane takes a view that is untenable at the present time.  There is a current of opinion in the <Col N="1624" /> country against allowing landlords, the owners of ground rents, and houses in towns, getting the full competitive value of these houses. If there is a flowing tide, and if there is any attempt to hold back that tide, the result, I think, will be destructive to the interests which Senator Sir John Keane purports to represent here.  Houses in towns deteriorate in value as ordinary buildings, but the prices go up year by year in the case of such houses.  That enhanced price can only be due to an increase in the site value.  An attempt was made, even before the great war, to put a stop to the exploitation of these increases in site values.  It is idle, at the present day, to attempt to stem the running tide, but what we do want is this: permanent legislation on the subject of houses in towns. Now the reason that you cannot get houses to let is this: that the law is unsettled, and that these Acts are being extended from year to year as temporary measures. Although you do not get houses to let you can get many houses to purchase. There are many houses for sale, and the real reason for that is that the landlord cannot perhaps afford to incur the risk of legislation which may be passed from year to year, the terms of which he does not know in advance.  That is the reason, I submit, why there are no houses to let.  That there are many houses to sell is an argument only for this, that we ought to have permanent legislation on a reasonable basis.  There is a lot to be said for the point of view that Senator Sir John Keane put forward.  There are some very poor people whose sole resource is the ground rent or the middleman's interest in housing.  It is by no means an easy problem to deal with, but we had the assurance of the Minister yesterday that he will bring in a measure to deal fully and fairly with this question of houses in the towns, and that at a very early date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the most convenient procedure for the House to adopt in dealing with these Standing Orders would be to consider each one separately, and, of course, to take any amendments that are on the Order Paper.  If the House expressed general disapproval of a particular Standing Order, even though there is no specific amendment down to it, it might be well in that case, perhaps, to refer back that particular Standing Order to the Committee for consideration and report. But, I think, that Standing Orders that are definitely passed by the House to-day should not come up again for consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the House will agree with the method suggested of dealing with these Standing Orders: that unless the feeling of the House is that a particular Standing Order ought to go back to the Committee for reconsideration we will take them as being passed.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Report of the Committee on Procedure Relative to Standing Orders be now considered.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the Committee, might I be allowed to say that these Standing Orders received a considerable amount of discussion amongst the members of the Committee?  They <Col N="1626" /> do not represent probably the entire opinion of any individual member of the Committee, as there were various opinions expressed with regard to them.  In many cases a compromise was arrived at, and in other cases agreement was reached after discussion.</P>
    <P>In moving this motion it is not to be taken that I am of opinion that these Standing Orders could not be improved on, or that I personally am in agreement with everything in them, but I do say, and I think every member of the Committee will agree with me&mdash;the Committee was representative of the different points of view in this House&mdash;that very careful consideration was given to every point raised, including some points which came before the Committee as the result of representations made by Senators who were not members of the Committee.  I hope very much that if there is any Standing Order which arouses a good deal of doubt in the minds of Senators it will be sent back to the Committee for reconsideration.  These Standing Orders represent the second revision in our Standing Orders made since the inception of this House.  I would very much hope that we have now reached a period when a set of Standing Orders can be adopted that will not need to be revised for a very long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>

      <P>Perhaps this would be the right time to raise a question upon which I know the Seanad feels rather strongly.  I should like to propose: that the draft Standing Orders be referred back to the Committee with instructions to draft an Order on the lines of Standing Order 51 relating to proceedings in Committee and to limit the duration of speeches.  I think Senators who are familiar with the proceedings of the Seanad <Col N="1627" /> since its inception will agree with me that, in the old days, the work of the Seanad was not by any means inefficiently done.  I do not think that the speeches made then ran to anything like the length they do now.  It seems to me that a great deal of time is wasted by the dragging in of a lot of matter which probably is irrelevant, but not so irrelevant that the Cathaoirleach could interfere.  I wonder if Senators ever think of the amount of money which the delivery of lengthy speeches involves the country in. Besides the waste of time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While I agree that the Senator is entitled to raise the matter he is dealing with, I submit he is not in order in doing so at this stage. He has moved to refer back all the Standing Orders to the Committee for the purpose of considering the one point that he has raised.  The Senator would be in order in doing that at the appropriate place, but this is not the time to do it, nor would it be in order to refer back <Col N="1628" /> all the Standing Orders simply to consider the one point that the Senator has raised.</P>

I am moving that this whole matter be referred back to them to draft a Standing Order to carry out a principle similar to that found in Standing Order 51 relating to proceedings in committee.  If the matter commends itself to the Seanad I think that ought to be done.  I think it would be only painting the lily if I were to dilate further on this subject&mdash;in fact it would be an infringement of the principles that I am supporting in my motion.  I do not know whether anyone will second my motion or not.  I leave it to the good sense of Senators to support it if they desire to save the country the expense that is involved by the delivery of unnecessarily long speeches.</P>

      <P>If the House were to adopt such a motion it would be more or less indicating that it was its decided opinion that such an order should be made.  That may or may not be so, but we have not yet reached a decision on the point.  Before we could give the necessary direction to the Committee on Standing Orders I think we would have to decide whether that was the desire of the House or not.  We might, for instance, ask the Committee to consider the question, but this is quite <Col N="1630" /> a different matter because it directs them to frame a Standing Order limiting the length of speeches. That would seem to bind us in regard to the Standing Orders later on.  I suggest that the discussion on this matter might be deferred until we reach the Standing Orders that I referred to.</P>

      <P>The proposal is that this Committee, without any expression of opinion, is given instruction to go back, contrary to their previous decision, and to provide a specific limit to speeches on all occasions, on whatsoever subject, without any distinction as to whether the speeches are to be in Committee of the House, on a resolution, or in any other circumstances.  I must confess if I were a member of that Committee and got an omnibus resolution of that kind, I would fix one day and end it.  There must be some idea of what you mean by it.  You cannot possibly say that you want to fix five minutes, or ten or twenty minutes, as the case may be, without regard to the suitability of the occasion, whether in Committee or otherwise. Long speeches are undesirable, and they are specially undesirable in Committee.  There are a great many <Col N="1631" /> circumstances in which discretion must be left to the Chair.  There may be something to be said for giving the Chair more discretion than it has at present.  I know there is a tendency to have some speeches too long.  My own personal feeling is that to curb the free expression of opinion in a legislative assembly like this by one rigid rule for all and every occasion would be to make us a laughing stock for parliaments elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I agree with what has been said by Senator Douglas.  I think it would be impossible to limit speeches on every occasion, no matter what the subject, to one specific length of time. If this matter is referred back to the Committee they certainly should be given some guidance.  I could understand giving additional power to the Chairman, but to have a hard and fast and rigid rule in this matter would be simply to make us a laughing stock.  One speech may require half an hour, and another may require only ten minutes.  To make a limit for the speech, say, of a Minister introducing a question on education, and to confine him to a short period, or any fixed period, when dealing with a matter like that would be simply ridiculous.  I hope if the Seanad refers this back they will give some guidance to the Committee and give a certain amount of latitude to them in whatever action they may take.</P>

      <P>What harm would it do us if we were to become a laughing stock?  We will become, from our prolixity, far more a subject for laughter.  If a Senator cannot express himself in ten minutes or less than ten pages of the Official Reports he ought to be limited to a specified time.  Senator Barrington's suggestion is only a direction to the Standing Orders Committee.  Surely that Committee can refuse to act on that suggestion if they wish.  It would be putting the Chair in an invidious position if the duty was put upon it of limiting speeches.  There are certain <Col N="1632" /> speakers who do not see that terseness of style should hold the attention of the House rather than long speeches, which only distract people.  I think ten or fifteen minutes' limit would give everyone adequate time to express themselves on any subject.</P>

      <P>I have not heard any complaint in this House with regard to the length of speeches.  I think if there is one outstanding feature which has marked debates in this House it is the brevity of the speeches.  There are no speeches at all in some cases.  It is those who do not want any speeches who only come here to put in their time for ten minutes or so who are anxious for this limitation.  What is meant by wasting the time of the House? One Senator might talk for five minutes and waste that five minutes; another Senator might speak for an hour and he may not have wasted a minute at all.  If there was to be any limitation at all it might be to prevent Senators, if it could be justifiably done, from speaking several times on every subject. As regards the length of speeches, I think it is very rare that we find any speech lasting more than twenty minutes, and when speeches have lasted twenty minutes they have been quite justified.  I hope the House will turn Senator Barrington's motion down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move an amendment in Standing Order 3 to delete the word &ldquo;Seanad&rdquo; and to insert instead the word &ldquo;Oireachtas.&rdquo;  I put this amendment down because I want to clarify the meaning of the word &ldquo;session.&rdquo;  The Constitution provides that the Oireachtas shall hold at least one session each year. We are rather mixed up, I think, as to what the meaning of the word &ldquo;session&rdquo; is.  In the Official Reports we have it recorded that the report is for part of the session which began in September, 1927. This particular meeting of this House is part of the session which began in September, 1927.  Yet it would appear that the common belief is that we are in the 1930 session.  I <Col N="1634" /> am not sure what the intention of this particular Standing Order is when it says &ldquo;provided the Seanad is then in session,&rdquo; and in the second part of the same Standing Order it says: &ldquo;if the Seanad is not then in session this Standing Order shall apply to the meeting of the Seanad held pursuant to the proclamation of the Governor-General convening the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  If the amendment is carried it makes no practical difference, but it would bring the Standing Order into conformity, I think, with the idea that when the Seanad is not in session Parliament is not sitting.  What I am rather desirous of is that there should be in the minds of the Seanad a clear understanding as to what is meant by &ldquo;session&rdquo; in these Standing Orders, that the same idea is prevalent through the Dáil, and that if necessary this constitutional provision should be clarified by some means or other.  We say the Oireachtas shall hold at least one session each year, and then, if the Standing Order seems to signify that the session begins and lasts continuously for a period of three, four or five years, there seems to be some mix-up, and it is rather desirable that we should make the position clear when we are now dealing with the Standing Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Johnson, by any amendment he could put down, could make the position and meaning of the word &ldquo;session&rdquo; in regard to the Oireachtas, that is, both Houses, clear, he would earn the gratitude of a great many people. It is not clear, and the powers that be, which, unfortunately, we do not entirely control, have never come together and made it clear; but in putting in the words &ldquo;Seanad in session&rdquo; in this particular Standing Order I think the Committee had a very definite purpose. Whatever &ldquo;session&rdquo; be, it is something which this House can continue, because it is something which cannot be discontinued without our consent and, therefore, refers clearly to the session of this House.  I know, because I had the <Col N="1635" /> misfortune to be on the Constitution Drafting Committee, what was originally intended when the first draft was made.  I do not really know what was in their mind when they started to carry it out, but I do, at any rate, say there was to be a definite session which was to be held at least once a year, possibly twice, which would be definitely called together, and then there would be a prorogation.  The intention was to prevent the Dáil having power to suddenly prorogue Parliament and make it impossible for this House to continue its sittings if it thought fit.</P>
      <P>As far as one can see, there seems to be a growing idea that a session is something which lasts for a number of years.  In some respects it is confined to a year, if you look at the Constitution.  But I suggest to Senator Johnson that, while I am not in a position to say, nor do I think anybody is able to tell us, in the Standing Order how we should use the word &ldquo;session&rdquo; to put the word &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; into this particular Standing Order would not help the tiniest bit, and might, at some future date, if the word &ldquo;session&rdquo; is clearly defined, possibly weaken our position and right to continue.  I therefore suggest it would be a mistake to insert these words.  Senators will notice that where possible the word &ldquo;session&rdquo; has been avoided and other words were put in where we were quite clear as to the meaning, and if you compare those draft Standing Orders with the present Standing Orders you will find that the word &ldquo;session&rdquo; does not appear nearly as often, but it seems impossible to avoid using it in this particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I be allowed to say that both Senator Wilson and Senator Comyn used the word &ldquo;if&rdquo;?  I am satisfied that there is a period in which the Seanad is not in session.  If the Oireachtas is dissolved I do not believe that this House could be called together by the Chairman and go on until Parliament had been reassembled.  The personnel of this House does not necessarily change in the meantime, and the object here is to provide that after our triennial election the Chairman shall promptly call the House together.  The words &ldquo;if then in session&rdquo; are simply to provide that if the House is not then in session, he need not do so until the whole Oireachtas has been summoned. I believe that the definition of Senator Sir Walter Nugent in substance is what should be regarded as the session, and I believe that there should be an annual session. I believe that each year there should be some kind of proclamation or <Col N="1638" /> summons on the initiative of the Executive or on their instructions by which both Houses would be called together.  Then the Dáil could end its own session, but could not, when it likes, dissolve the Seanad.  But I would not be stating the truth if I said that that has been so read by the staff, by Ministers, and others.  It has not.  We are in the position that there has not been a general agreement on this matter. There may be a case in which the Cathaoirleach could not call this House together owing to their not being in session.</P>
      <P>I do suggest that this particular Standing Order is necessary so as to provide that the Cathaoirleach shall immediately after each triennial election call us together, except in one single circumstance that he would not have authority through our not being in session.  It is not necessary in this Order to defend it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Oireachtas shall hold at least one session each year.  The Oireachtas shall be summoned and dissolved by the Representative of the Crown in the name of the King and subject as aforesaid Dáil Eireann shall fix the date of reassembly of the Oireachtas and the date of the conclusion of the session of each House: Provided that the sessions of Seanad <Col N="1640" /> Eireann shall not be concluded without its own consent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, our session lasts until we have put an end to it by consent except that we could not sit while the other House was dissolved.  Now Article 12 of the Constitution shows that there are two Houses with one Parliament.  The Article reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Legislature is hereby created to be known as the Oireachtas.  It shall consist of the King and two Houses, the Chamber of Deputies (otherwise called and herein generally referred to as &lsquo;Dáil Eireann&rsquo; and the Seanad (otherwise called and herein generally referred to as &lsquo;Seanad Eireann&rsquo;).  The sole and exclusive power of making laws for the peace, order and good government of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Eireann) is vested in the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>My intention in putting down the amendment was to get a clarification of the matter in our minds.  If Senator Douglas is indicating the mind of the Committee, then the Committee apparently is not quite clear as to the meaning of the word &ldquo;session,&rdquo; and as to what the Seanad, the officials, and the Cathaoirleach should understand from these words in the Standing Orders. If it were possible I would like again to suggest that the Committee should consider the possibility of a new phrase, and leave out the word &ldquo;session&rdquo; altogether, and find if another phrase or if another single word could not be found to indicate its intentions.  The same thing arises in No. 61.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we could understand that the word &ldquo;session&rdquo; in every case means the expiry of the Parliament, that is <Col N="1642" /> immediately after the dissolution, from the beginning to the end of the Parliament, then it would be quite understandable.  If it means a group of meetings within a specified period, or within a year, then it could be understood, but let it be understood. I am not so particular about the word &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; going in.  I simply raise the question so that there should be some clarification on it.</P>

Something may come out of it.  I may say that I am inclined to believe if Senator Comyn's contention is correct that this House can never be dissolved, these words ought to go out, but if his contention is wrong then some such words are necessary.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3)  If not more than two Senators are proposed, a vote by ballot shall be taken, each Senator to vote by placing in the ballot box a voting paper on which he has written the name of the candidate for whom he votes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This really raises a larger question. It is the question of the method adopted for the election of the Cathaoirleach.  The proposal of the Standing Orders Committee is divided into six sub-sections and there are two methods proposed. There is an eliminating process and a final process.  The eliminating process is to be by a preliminary vote, each Senator voting for not more than two candidates, by delivering to the Clerk a voting paper signed by him on which is written the name or names of the candidate or candidates for whom he votes.  That means in effect, as far as the sitting of the Seanad is concerned at which the election takes place, that is to be secret voting.  Then for the final process it is to be voting through the division lobbies.  My view of the matter is that whatever method is adopted for the first part, the eliminating process, should be reapplied <Col N="1644" /> for the final process.  It is with that intention I suggested the amendment, that the method should be by placing in the ballot box a voting paper, but I really am not very particular as to what is the method adopted if in both cases it is the same process.  I do not think it desirable that you should have one method for the eliminating process and a second method for the final process.  That is the purpose of my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly being a member of the Committee I might explain some of their difficulties in this connection.  In the first place, I think apparently unwittingly, Senator Johnson has proposed what is a very definite distinction in the final process because he proposes voting by ballot which is not proposed by the Committee, the words &ldquo;by ballot&rdquo; meaning in secret. The proposals of the Committee, in order to avoid a very large number of divisions and in order to avoid the method, which seemed by a general consensus of opinion to be very undignified, of standing up and calling out the names of Senators, are outlined in the Standing Orders submitted here which was eventually adopted after a good deal of discussion by the Committee.  It is not intended that it should be by secret ballot.  The names of those who vote would appear on the lists but might not necessarily be read out. They would appear in the Imeachta for the day and would not be secret. What the Senator does not want is to have a secret ballot for the final voting.  That is a matter for the House.  I do not favour it myself. It is the difference between secrecy and publicity and until I read the amendment I did not know what he was driving at.</P>
      <P>I do not think, with great respect to Senator Johnson, it is possible to get some method by which you will eliminate a member and by which you will, exactly by the same method, choose on the final vote one of the two unless you adopt Senator Comyn's suggestion and choose the method of the transferable vote.</P>

      <P>I remember when the arrangement was first made and I think that that arrangement was a proper one.  We eliminated candidates one after another.  We deliberately made it open voting as opposed to voting by ballot for Senators to fill vacancies, because it was thought that it would prevent secret meetings and secret arrangements of which nobody could take account and having certain things settled without knowing exactly where you were by secret sessions, cliques, and so on.  I think that was a wise provision, and I should certainly be in favour of open voting in that case.  I did not quite care for this particular plan when the matter was in Committee, but I did not think it was worth while disagreeing with the Committee.  I am in favour of open voting in this case because it has been very successful in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To delete paragraph (4) and to substitute therefor a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If more than two Senators be proposed the election shall be conducted on the basis of proportional representation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to read to the Seanad the proposed Standing Order to which this is an amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If more than two Senators be proposed their names shall be submitted to a preliminary vote, each Senator voting for not more than two candidates by delivering to the Clerk a voting paper, signed by him, on which he has written the name or names of the candidate or candidates for whom he votes.</P>
      <P>The next paragraph reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The names of the two Senators obtaining the highest number of votes shall then be submitted to the House, and a division shall be taken between them in the manner prescribed above, and the candidate <Col N="1646" /> who obtains the majority of votes shall be declared to have been duly elected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That sub-rule 4 as it stands leaves the Chair in the patronage of one or other of the big parties.  The object of my amendment is to give the smaller groups a prospect of attaining to the Chair of this assembly. We are in many ways sometimes a very happy family here.  Sometimes we have our little differences.  On questions of principle we are clearly divided.  I speak as a member of one of the two big groups.  Numerically we are small at present, but very soon we shall have a majority in the House.  Therefore I speak as a member of a Party which will be in a majority some day.  With all the greater confidence, then, I submit the amendment because its object is to enable the Seanad, if it so desires, to put into the Chair a suitable person from one of the small groups, both in order to show the liberality of our sentiments and also in order to give some mark of recognition to long and faithful service in the House.</P>
    <P>That is the reason I propose that in case there are, say, four Senators nominated, the election shall be on the basis of Proportional Representation. That would enable a member of perhaps the smallest group in the House, by gradual accretions of strength from the other group, ultimately to arrive at a majority and to attain to the Chair.  I do not wish now to go into figures, but I assure my friends that I have thought this out.  I understand that the ruling of the Chair will be that in case the principle of this amendment is accepted it would be referred back to the Committee to define the manner in which it should be carried out.  I may say that, belonging to what will be the largest group, I have no personal interest in the matter, but I put it to the House.</P>

      <P>I think there has been a tendency to treat this with a certain amount of natural levity because of the strict wording of it.  If you take it seriously it will mean that you could elect a man from the smaller groups.  If you could achieve that it would be somewhat of a millennium.  But that is very little of what it could achieve.  I take it that what the Senator means is that he wants to substitute the system of transferable voting for the method of elimination.  I do not believe that any other method would allow of a small party of six, ten or twelve of even electing a member against the majority.  If a member of the minority group were elected to the Chair it would have to be by consent of the other groups.  It should not be treated as a method by which all these wonderful things will come about.  If we stick to the method here, and if the Senator's Party comes into power we shall expect great things from him.  If that does not happen I suggest that you have not found any particular way of achieving it.  At the same time, that will be another method and a perfectly proper one of electing the Chair if there is going to be a large number of candidates, which, personally, I think there will not be.  I do not think there will be more than a couple.  If there is a large number you could have transferable votes by which you would transfer until you got the majority.  It would cause more trouble and, again, I doubt if it will achieve the result you want.  On the whole, I think the method we have is the right one.</P>

      <P>The reservations are based on the principle of reciprocity. Pretty nearly all the nations that have signed did so with the same two conditions.  I might call attention to the Geneva attitude on these matters.  Reciprocity is never regarded as a reservation.  It is regarded as something which strengthens a protocol or convention. If everybody signs with this particular type of reservation everybody is bound.  This is not counted a reservation as such.  It is regarded in Geneva as a strength because it gives an incentive to other nations to sign.  As far as practice is concerned, the fact that we signed these two reservations does not indicate that we intend to make preparation for the use of poisonous gases or any such asphyxiating type of warfare. But we would want to know what is the exact legal position under this type of convention in the event of the two items referred to in the reservation happening.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to explain more clearly the reason why we signed the resolution before the Court of International Justice without any reservation.  In the case of South Africa, they put in two reservations, one providing that disputes concerning the Government of any other member of the British Commonwealth of Nations would be settled in such a manner &ldquo;as the parties have agreed or shall agree.&rdquo; In moving the adoption in the House of Assembly in South Africa, General Hertzog said: &ldquo;Ireland was the exception, but that practically amounted to nothing, as none of the other members of the British Commonwealth were subject to the Court in so far as a dispute with Ireland was concerned.  Therefore, if Ireland had a difference with South Africa, she would not be able to bring them before the Court.  Ireland had the fullest right to do what she did, but he thought the way the Union had taken was the best.&rdquo;  It seemed, therefore, that if we had a dispute with South Africa, and we found it necessary to take the question to the Court of International Justice, we would find nobody there to answer us.  That being so, I think the Free State was at a disadvantage.</P>

      <P>As I understand the position, there was for a long time a desire that the United States should come within the scope of this Permanent Court, but certain objections were raised in the United States to what was involved in the statute of the Permanent Court. After a considerable amount of discussion, and inasmuch as the United States was not within the League, it was only by diplomacy and not by open discussion that takes place at the League that there was approval and a tentative agreement arrived at whereby if the statute of the Permanent Court were revised in a particular way, that would make it possible for the United States to accept the statute of the court.  That revision took place, and at the same time a Protocol was signed agreeing to the accession of the United States, so that the two things are very closely involved.  As to the revision, while it is important I do not think it affects our position as against the Court.  I desire to approve of it, particularly in view of the fact that it was made possible for the United States of America to become parties to this system of international jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>The Senator has covered the ground I desired to cover.  A Protocol for the revision of statutes was a necessary condition precedent to the other Conventions. No.  5 allows for the accession of the United States.  That accession was conditional, and as a matter of fact the United States has not yet taken any action.  As to the second, in addition to the point to which Senator Johnson referred, and the point raised by Senator Comyn which deals with advisory opinions, a variety of other matters are dealt with.  For instance, the number of judges is raised from eleven to fifteen by the elevation of temporary judges, and there are arrangements that the session of the courts should be always permanent, allowing for a <Col N="1652" /> judicial vacation, and there was also the question of fixing the salaries of judges.  These questions have arisen after eight years' experience of the court.  Jurists were set to work on the matter, and they brought forward this revision which all the States were asked to ratify as early as possible.  The accession of the United States to the matter under No. 5 has yet to come.</P>

      <P>We are in the happy position that our statistics, so far as material, method of compilation, form of publication, and all these things are concerned, are in line with what is required under the Convention.  In one respect only is there any important change, and that is a change we are making experimentally. From the results of that particular experiment certain other forms may be decided on.  At present, the trade statistics of imports and exports are compiled with a view to the country of consignment for a twelve months' period. We are making experiments and trying to collect imports not merely from the country of import, but from the country of production.  We are trying to discover the country not merely of consignment, but the country of final consumption.  It is a very difficult task, and could only be done in an experimental way.  In every other way, as I have said, we are quite in line.  This, however, will ensure that the statistics in future will be better compiled, more regular in appearance, and more comparable.</P>

      <P>I think I am correct in stating that this represents the efforts of a very considerable number of years, and that it is a very decided step forward.  The great difficulty in dealing with obscene publications has been that there is lack of international joint action on the part of the principal States, and this procedure may go a long way to prohibit not only their circulation but to make their production practically impossible.  I know that this is not absolutely all we would want.  It is not altogether all that we would like, but it is something to be hailed by reformers as a very marked step towards joint action, the lack of which has been a source of failure in the past.</P>

      <P>Senator Douglas is quite correct in what he has said. Our legislation is quite in line with what is required by the Convention. This is an administrative measure, and each country ratifying is, and shall be, the competent authority in its area, and will collect and transmit to the central offices certain things demanded, namely, notification of any legislation dealing with this matter, notification of punishment imposed by legislation, and notification of measures taken to prevent the passage of obscene publications through the State.  Under that particular agreement we have established a department as the competent authority, and the Minister for Justice has been designated in that way and has undertaken the duties.  It is a good step forward, <Col N="1655" /> and is the fruit of many years' efforts and agitation in these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the arguments put forward last evening by Senator Johnson in criticism of the apparent attitude of the Minister to move gradually in his policy of meeting the housing shortage in the Free State, he gave us some very interesting figures and some very interesting economic data.  It seems to be that year after year we will have extension measures like this coming on, and that may continue indefinitely. On the basis of the production of houses, Senator Johnson argued that if we were to double the number of houses we are erecting at present it would take us twelve years to meet Dublin's needs, and that apart from making good the wastage due to decay.  That means, so far as the City of Dublin is concerned, that, in the matter of the erection of houses, if the present rate of building only is maintained, we will not have the number of houses admitted necessary by the Minister's Department for 24 or 25 years.  In reviewing this whole housing business we have had put before us three different points of view. We had the point of view of the Minister, who is, no doubt, extremely anxious to have this problem solved. We had the point of view of Senator Johnson, who is equally anxious to have the problem solved, and we also had the point of view of Senator Sir John Keane, who, in spite of his plea for an economic rent, is, I am quite satisfied, also anxious to have this housing problem solved.  I want it to be understood that when dealing with this I am not trying to make any debating points, nor am I trying to score any Party advantage whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not help being intrigued somewhat when I realised that the <Col N="1656" /> Minister had to come to us with this extension Bill.  The fact that he has to bring such a measure before us is an admission that due to forces over which he has no control, he is likely to have to go on doing so for the next 24 or 25 years, without even making allowance for the decay in property or what might be a possible increase of the population in Dublin which would lead to a demand for more houses.  As I have said I was intrigued, and for one reason, mainly, that it so happened within the last fortnight the Minister in charge of this Bill, deputising for the Minister for Finance, came to this House and questioned some arguments which I made with regard to the cost of money and the prevailing system of financial control.  In my arguments on that occasion, I specifically and deliberately made it clear that the whole economic future of this country, all the social services of this country, the lives and well-being of the people are entirely and completely involved in the one great fundamental problem, namely, the control of money.  I would suggest to the Minister that if he analyses carefully, and I have no doubt he will, the different factors that make it necessary for him to come here year after year with these extension Bills he will realise that with the difficulties under which he and his Department labour it is going to be quite impossible for him to finance or to carry out building on anything like the scale commensurate with the need which he admits exists in his own reports. Let us look at the problem as it is. In this country we have workers idle in most industries and in most branches of employment.  They receive unemployment benefit as long as they are in benefit, but they are a charge on the State in one form or another.  They are an uneconomic and a losing holding for the State when they are unemployed.  As regards building, most of the materials required are available.</P>
    <P>The big problem is: what is the Minister going to do between these two resources that we have at our <Col N="1657" /> disposal, one of which is lying idle and the other of which is going to waste unemployed.  We have on the one hand citizens living or trying to live out of work, partially supported in a state of semi-starvation by the State, and on the other hand we have tenements and hovels.  Senator Sir John Keane, of course, thinks of his economic rent.  Last evening Senator Johnson analysed certain standards of living.  I am not sure whether he took the soldier's ration or the workhouse ration, but he gave us a figure which included an economic rent of 14/- out of a weekly wage of 61/5 in the case of a man with a wife and three children. The Minister must realise, if he takes Senator Johnson's argument to heart, and the deeper purpose of my argument, that the object I had in raising this whole question of the rental of money is because it is the rental that works down through the economic system in this country and leaves us without houses and without any other thing.  I do not think the Minister will make the argument that the country can afford to wait until the building trade adjusts itself.  I do not know what possibility there is going to be for the building trade or any other trade to adjust itself under our present economic system.  On the other hand, Senator Johnson can hardly hope for a sufficient wage increase to enable the worker to pay what one may call Senator Sir John Keane's economic rent, while Senator Sir John Keane can hardly expect an economic rent of 14/- a week from the average wage in Dublin of 50/- a week.</P>
    <P>We had three divergent points of view on this question.  These divergent points of view are represented by Senators in two cases, and by the Minister in the other, who want a really decent social organism in this country, who want people to have houses and not hovels, who want families to have houses and not rooms and who know and feel as we all feel that something has got to be done.  I am not prepared to propose a solution.  A couple of weeks ago <Col N="1658" /> I tried to outline what in my judgment&mdash;I may be quite wrong&mdash;is the fundamental root evil.  I went on to say that in my opinion, and I say this now quite seriously to the Minister, there is going to be no progress in the direction of housing until that issue is tackled.  This is a problem that we ought to try and face and not put it off for 24 or 25 years. We ought to sit down and tackle the question.  The question that we have to consider is, are we content to wait for 25 years to solve this housing problem?  Most of us, I am afraid, feel that when that time comes we will not be worried about the housing, the Seanad or the Ministry.  The position at the moment is that we have to realise that we are in a vicious circle&mdash;in a cleft-stick.  If we are content to sit down and admit that the thing has beaten us, then that is our decision, but if, on the other hand, we want to realise our responsibilities and feel that we have a duty here and a problem to tackle we ought to try and see if there is any way out.  We ought to try and see if the best brains and intelligence in the country cannot be got to come together to help to solve this great social problem that we have before us.  This housing problem is a very big one, but it is only one problem.  There are many others to be faced as well.  The standard of living in this country, on the basis of the analysis made by Senator Johnson last night, is certainly not encouraging. I wonder if any of us ever sit down and consider, take it home to ourselves personally, what it means to live even on 50/- a week, and consider further what it means to live on 24/- a week, which is the general rate of wages paid to agricultural workers at the moment.  In cases where they are getting 24/- a week they are expected to pay 4/-, 5/- and as much as 6/- a week for a house.</P>
    <P>The result is that they are living in lean-to's and in sheds.  Remember this is Christian humanity that we are supposed to be administering to them.  I do not want to labour the matter unduly, but I merely take <Col N="1659" /> this opportunity of adverting to the discussion that took place here a few weeks ago on what I regard as the fundamental rental.  The whole question of housing resolves itself around the question of the economic rent.  If you borrow £400 at 5½ per cent. you know what that amounts to.  You know that that is a big item in what is called an economic rent. I do not suggest that the Minister can get over this difficulty by fighting for special terms in regard to housing.  It will not, and it cannot, be tackled in that way.  What I do suggest is that this is a problem for the Minister and for the present Executive.  It is going to be a problem for any Executive, no matter what Executive comes into power. I say that no Government is going to solve it unless it is prepared to get down to the economic root, and that, in my judgment, is the cost of money and the mal-administration in the banking system that we are living under.  As I have said already, to deal with the problem we have the men available and the materials available.  It is up to the Minister to say what he would suggest that we ought to do about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this measure we have no option but to support the Second Reading of the Bill.  I have again to express my disappointment that a Bill of this character does not enable us to deal with the dreadful problem of the slums.  This Bill only deals with the normal requirements in connection with housing.  The Minister, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill in the Dáil, said that provision was being made under it for a grant of £200,000 to subsidise the building of 4,000 houses.  Not to think of the slum problem at all, the normal requirements as regards new houses would be about 4,000 a year in this country.  There are at least 4,000 families in this country setting up new homes every year.  The Bills that have come before us during the past few years have made no provision whatever for dealing with the slums.  For that reason I have complained <Col N="1660" /> repeatedly that we are not handling the situation as it ought to be handled.  When the Census returns were published it was admitted in them that the housing shortage in the Free State was 43,000 houses. The building of 4,000 houses a year is not going to meet the problem that has to be met.  Taking into consideration the circumstances of the country, it is an appalling state of affairs that the deplorable housing conditions we have should be allowed to continue as they have been for such a long period.</P>
      <P>The housing conditions are worse in this country than in any other country.  Notwithstanding our dwindling population, there is the tremendous shortage that is revealed in the census returns.  In countries where populations are increasing there might be some excuse for a housing shortage, but here where we have a dwindling population that excuse cannot be put forward.  This housing question is not a party question and should not be considered on party lines.  It is a tremendous problem that has to be faced.  We must support the Bill, because even though it will not bring about the solution of the problem that we all desire, still it will help to do a little in that direction, and I suppose we must be thankful even for small mercies.  The question of an economic rent was referred to by a number of Senators.  When that question is examined one has to realise that if an economic rent is to be paid for a house, then an economic wage has to be paid so as to enable the wage-earner to pay that economic rent.  The giving of subsidies for house-building is not subsidising the workers.  What it amounts to is a subsidy to employers to pay wages.  If a man is not paid a sufficient wage to enable him to pay rent for the class of house he is entitled to have, then the responsibility is not his but somebody else's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions may be raised about some of the arguments Senator Johnson used yesterday in dealing with the problem of economic rent. When talking about an economic <Col N="1661" /> rent and wages you have to take into consideration that there is nothing like the continuity of employment in this country that there is in other countries.  Take the building trade.  Taking the building trade as a whole, embracing labourers and skilled men, I do not think on an average they work more than forty weeks in the year, so that when considering the question of an economic rent for those people you must take into consideration the number of weeks they work.  I think it is admitted, on all sides, that every person is entitled to a decent home and we are all anxious that everyone shall have that.  I am sincerely anxious that the Government should take this matter in hands.  There is no use setting up an inquiry like what was set up before in connection with this matter.  That leads nowhere.  The Government should take the matter in hand and view it from every aspect, and if they do they will find that there is goodwill all round to help them to solve this problem.  It is not a question for party advantage or party consideration. It is impossible to be indifferent to the necessity for house-building in the City of Dublin when one goes through thoroughfares like Cumberland Street, Gloucester Street and Mercer Street and York Street, and all those frightful sores we see in the city with people living in festering slums.</P>
    <P>The provision of 4,000 houses a year will do nothing to help that. The Government will have to take some other steps to deal with it, and they will have to make provision for something more than £200,000 in one year.  I believe the problem can be solved.  We have stated from these benches that the way to solve it is to set up a National Housing Board to deal with the matter.  My idea is if there was a guarantee of continuity of employment the cost of housing would be considerably reduced.  I said on many occasions that a solution of this whole question is continuity of employment.  It is expecting too much from human nature <Col N="1662" /> that any man employed at work, if he does not see there is some hope of constant employment, is going to break his heart, in order to put himself a few weeks sooner on the street.  I have nothing further to say on the matter, only that I hope in the near future the Government will seriously take this matter in hands, and that they will deal with it in a way that will solve the problem.  Remember that some of our best citizens are living in these festering slums.  It is a crime to expect decent men to bring up their families under the conditions in which they are compelled to live at present.  We should forget everything else in our effort to try and solve this big problem which is responsible for most of the social evils we are suffering from in this country. I have to support this Bill, but in the meantime I hope that in the near future the Government will tackle this problem with a view to settling it on the lines I have suggested.</P>

      <P>Senators who say in regard to the present housing problem that what has been done in the past few years has done nothing to solve the slum question are quite right.  And when Senator Connolly says this general housing question is a question of Christian humanity it appears to me that the Christian humanity side of the business moves more to the slum side than any other.  From the Christianity side and the poor humanity side you know we are principally concerned with preparing the ground so that we can deal with the housing of the very poor, with people living in very insanitary conditions. I leave Senator Connolly to follow his own line of thought to some kind of conclusion, but I am quite satisfied that to simply face the housing problem and say that you cannot do anything with regard to the housing until you remodel and rechange the whole banking system and get a new kind of rock that you may strike and draw money from is simply running away from the question.  I think we would be all under a debt of gratitude <Col N="1663" /> to the Senator if he would follow his line of thought to some kind of conclusion and then see whether from the housing side, the industrial side, or any other side you could get anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where we are looking for the rock that we could strike and get the money from so that we would not have to pay five or four or three per cent. for it. At any rate it is the money that is wanting and we want to pay as little for it as we can.  There is certain money that can be got at present and we have to pay a certain amount for it.  Within the limits of the money available, without finding the special rock Senator Connolly is looking for, we are facing at any rate up to the solution of this housing problem.</P>
      <P>One other word in reference to the Senator.  He feels that the housing industry or any other industry cannot be made economic without cheaper money.  We cannot solve the slum problem, in my mind, as long as our building industry is in the condition that its normal workers, paid good wages according to those who organise and control the building industry, are not expected to pay an economic rent for the houses that this industry produces.  Until we can arrive at the position in which our building industry is so organised that it can produce houses that the normal worker can pay a proper economic rent and price for, as he pays an economic price for his food and clothing, until we can arrive at that position with regard to the normal worker in this industry we cannot solve the slum problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be another question.  But if the Senator thinks that the present Executive <Col N="1664" /> Council in the year 1930 is going to take upon itself the responsibility for reorganising the whole building industry in this country, I can say for the Executive Council that in the year 1930 it is not going to take on that responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate I would like to see a group coming along that would say they were prepared to take this on&mdash;to reorganise the whole building industry, and I would like to know to what extent they were convinced that, having reorganised the whole building industry, they could stop at that in their interference in the general reorganisation of industry.  So that on that point, in a country where the normal worker cannot pay the price for his house that he is expected to pay for his clothing and his food and other commodities, it is no use to say that you can solve the slum problem.  The question arises whether Bills of this kind are going to come before the Seanad for the next twenty-five years.  I think I can say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; because in the main houses built under Bills that come before the Seanad in this particular way are houses built by private persons with the aid of subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were convinced that the building costs could not be further reduced than they are to-day, then I do not think there would be any case for your giving a subsidy to private persons to build their own houses. You, perhaps, can look at it that the subsidy given to private persons to build houses to-day is a subsidy in contemplation of the depreciation in the value of the property in which they are putting actual capital of their own at the present time.  I do not think that the subsidising of private persons can continue very much longer, and for that reason I do not think that the Seanad can expect this particular class of Bill to come before them for the next twenty-five years.  There is a greater move on the part of local authorities to build houses, arising out of the <Col N="1665" /> fact that we are now providing them with money from the Local Loans Fund at 5¾ per cent. for thirty-five years.  I do not contemplate with what is proceeding at the present moment with local authorities using this money building houses for the working class that that can continue.</P>
    <P>What is happening at the present moment may be understood from an instance like this.  A local authority, building houses, takes £60 from the State as a subsidy for a house, and the local authority commits itself to what amounts to an expenditure of £118 or so of the local ratepayers' money.  It builds houses, which it proposes to let at a rent of 5s. a week approximately, this rent to include rates as well as what is supposed to go to rent.  To some extent that is happening at the present moment, and I do not contemplate that that system can continue by which the local authority built houses by the aid, let us say, of the credit or capital of the State or the local people; that they can build houses and rent them for the normal workers at a rent that is not economic.  Because if that is done by the State or by the local ratepayers' money, then you cannot deal with the housing of the very poor. If local authorities get into the position that they are going to supply to the normal workers in urban areas houses at a rent less than an economic rent, then the local authorities are going to become not only the landlords but the subsidisers of the whole working-class in the country. Where is the money going to come from in the country, because it must either come from industry in the country or from investments outside the country?  I think we have to rely on industry in the country to keep this country going.  If the money is going to come from industry to pay the rents of our houses, then it had better come from industry in wages.  The only safeguard I see upon which we can solve the housing problem here is on the grounds of getting our workers to pay a proper rent for the houses. <Col N="1666" /> That is, to get them normal houses.  If wages, or any other factor in our industrial life, requires to be reset, that has to be reset.  But I think we are simply embarking on a social morass if we accept the position that our working-class, as a whole, have to be provided first with houses.  I think every section of the people hope, and every Party is perfectly satisfied that this question of housing is a non-Party business, and a business that will be treated by everybody in a non-Party way.</P>
    <P>But before we go further on the road which is apparently accepted by so many, that the normal workers of the country must be provided with subsidised houses, we must stop and think.  Senator Johnson asked for more information than I gave him as to how the position was arrived at in Holland, as shown by the figures which I quoted.  I did give some information, and I quoted those figures.  They are the actual official figures in response to a situation that we are to sit up and take notice of and act in a way in which the City of Vienna acted.  I do not know that this is the proper time or place to elaborate what has been done in any one or two or three other countries.  The position I quoted to Senator Johnson is really the fact as far as Holland is concerned. It has been for a period of five or six years subsidising housing, houses built by the normal building industry.  The result of that has been that in consequence of the system they pursued they are now able to deal with the slum problem. Whether the principles upon which they are dealing with the slum problem will be accepted here or not is another matter.  But they are dealing with that problem now.  That position has been brought about there by insisting on the payment of economic rents in a gradual and controlled way, doing away with the restriction of rents.  There is there the complete acceptance of the position that the building industry must supply the housing of the people. There was a time when that Government <Col N="1667" /> had to come to the conclusion that they could not hope to deal with the housing question until they accepted that position&mdash;that the normal building industry of the country must supply the needs of the country.  The principle was the payment of an economic rent by the working classes and the complete withdrawal of rent restrictions.  In spite of the fact that the wages in the building industry in Holland have been two or three times what they were in pre-war days, the index figure for the cost of building is the index figure for the scale of the cost of living in the country. That was brought about by reorganisation in the building industry and the reduction in the cost of building material.</P>
    <P>There may be another time and a form to enter in which more detailed information as to what has taken place in other countries in this respect may be provided.  I only refer to the situation in Holland as a reaction to the suggestion that we are to provide for the matter in a different way.  I do not think I have any more information with regard to this position.  We have a general idea as to what has been the condition in the building industry in Vienna since the war, and what has been the condition of Holland both during and since the war.  If the results that have been obtained in Holland can be achieved by the same methods as against the results which have been obtained in Vienna, I would prefer the Holland idea to the Viennese idea as being much sounder socially and industrially.  If we go along the lines that the people in Holland have been enabled to go, rather than along the lines that the Viennese people have been forced to go, it will be all the better for the solution of the housing problem in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible for the Minister to institute a close inquiry into that position and to have the facts made known?  Of course the building of 398,000 houses in Holland in a period of seven years has <Col N="1668" /> been an achievement of enormous work.  A great deal more details are required as to how that has been brought about than the Minister has given us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as that is concerned, I am speaking for my colleagues and myself in the Executive Council.  We are examining these matters in the closest possible way, because we realise, in the first place, that there is a housing problem, and in the second place we realise the easy attitude that has been taken up by so many people of saying that the working class producers in this country need not, and ought not be expected, to pay economic rents.  We realise the terrible seriousness of allowing that to become a completely accepted principle of mind and to be used as the foundation-stone of this problem. We realise the seriousness of that, too.  There are certain schools of thought in connection with this problem of providing houses.  It would be most desirable that the different schools of thought in the matter would drive their thinking to a definite conclusion with definite facts.  The time will come, as far as we are concerned, when we are prepared to put our definite conclusions in this matter in a definite, concrete and cogent way.  It would be much more satisfactory when we come to do that, or, if necessary, with a view to hastening it, that we take that view, and those who believe in another school of thought should clear their minds so that they would have much more straight and exact thinking on the matter than if we start by half-baked conclusions and with no general and comprehensive idea on the matter.  I quite realise how unsatisfactory it is for the different schools of thought that we do not come before the Seanad and Dáil with different proposals from what are here.  I think I can see that the critics of our proposals and our policy feel a lot of dissatisfaction with our methods, but we have a similar kind of dissatisfaction about their failure to put forward definite views on this matter.  I do not think <Col N="1669" /> it is necessary for me to say anything further on the matter.  There is no good in taking the census of population and social conditions and building up arguments leading us to the production of more houses by taking, say, the example that Senator Johnson took last night.  Because if you build on that you go through the same ground, you have to add a few more figures and a few more ideas than he put before us. I do not think that such arguments would lead us anywhere.  The present proposals continue to give private persons who start to build before 1st April next, or who build before 1st October, the same kind of grant as in the Housing Act of 1929.</P>
      <P>[<i>Mr. Counihan took the Chair.</i>]</P>
      <P>Senator Comyn raised a point with regard to the Soldiers and Sailors' Trust.  I do not think that that could come up for discussion under this particular Bill for this reason&mdash;we are giving the Trust the same kind of terms that we give to private persons. We do not ask who the private person is.  We do not ask what is to become of the houses when the private person who gets the grant dies.  The Trust is controlled by three representatives of the British Government, one representative of the Northern Ireland Government, and one representative of the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are any questions which the Senator raised yesterday that require discussion or consideration I think, in the first place, they might be addressed to the Trust as a whole. Failing a satisfactory answer the questions might be addressed to the representative of the Free State, and failing that they might be addressed to the Secretary of the Executive Council.  I think the Senator will understand that there are very many aspects of the Trust that could be given consideration, but that could not be satisfactorily answered at the moment, or perhaps for some time.  Nevertheless they must in some shape or form be under consideration, and some finality must be brought about. But there are three Governments interested in the matter.  For that <Col N="1670" /> reason the property of the Trust cannot evaporate or go to some unknown person's pocket.  We include the Trust to help them to speed up and to build an additional number of houses.  We are treating them entirely as we would treat a private person.  It would be impossible for us to do otherwise or to require any other conditions than the conditions we require from a private person.</P>

      <P>He challenges us to say where that money is to come from.  He says that any Party in the State who can suggest where the money is to come from will be doing a great benefit to the country.  For several months we have been pointing that out in the country.  We pointed out that the Government is sending away five millions of money every year.  The result of sending away that five millions of money is that no money is left practically. The workers' expenses and the employers' expenses are increased because they have to pay that money. The whole social system is being degraded by sending away that money from this country to another country.  The Seanad has had on several former occasions this matter before them.  On one occasion it was almost agreed to hold an inquiry into the matter, but, unlike the Minister who challenges us now, the Minister who was then present&mdash;the Minister for Finance&mdash;declined to have anything to do with the inquiry and declared that he would not go before the Committee or that he would not allow his officials to go before it.  How can we prove anything except in that sort of way?  I do not want to continue this matter. It has passed far away now from the <Col N="1671" /> Seanad and the Dáil.  It is in the hands of the country, which will settle all these matters in quite a different way before long, I hope.  I only say this because of the Minister's and other Ministers' challenges as to how the money is to be produced for various purposes in this country.  I agree that it cannot be produced as long as they are sending away these five millions.</P>

      <P>In reply to that point it is possible, but if there are any things in the Trust that require review and correction, Senators should approach the Trust to see whether they can get these things settled.  This Bill merely provides that the Trust will get the same grants in respect of houses begun before 1st April, so that those who are interested in the matter can deal with the question after 1st April.

The Senator was the first to call attention to it.  In regard to the statement of Senator Colonel Moore, of course if we are going to solve our housing question in that way, there is one other method by which we could completely solve it.  A representative of the Senator's Party has estimated that the United States owes us £1,000 for every emigrant who goes there from this country. We could send a bill to the United States for £1,000 in respect of every emigrant sent there.</P>

      <P>I have a certain impression from the Minister's remarks, but I would like to be clear. He told us that the Executive had no way of solving the slum problem, and further that the Executive had made up their minds that the time had come that the subsidy for houses of the working-class should be abolished, and that these people should be made to pay economic rents.  That was the impression left in my mind after listening very carefully to the Minister.  I would like to put it to the Minister if it is his case that the unemployed men and the lowly-paid worker should be expected to pay what are recognised as economic rents at the present time, 14s. or 15s. per week.  Is that the mind of the Executive?  The Minister further asks was there any possible suggestion as to how money could be got cheaply.  I am going to suggest that he should authorise local authorities, particularly in areas where there is a slum problem, to have a direct housing rate.  Certainly it is the responsibility of all citizens to provide healthy and reasonable housing conditions for the workers, and to my mind a direct housing rate would make building costs and house rents very much cheaper when you abolish the interests which Senator Connolly has elaborated so ably in the House <Col N="1673" />&mdash;that is, the banking interest.  That is the means by which cheap money can be got to reduce rent, and make it possible for workers to pay what he considers and what might reasonably be considered an economic rent. I hope if the Minister cares to reply that he will make the matter clear, because the impression left in my mind was that the Executive Council had made up their minds that there was no solution for the slum problem, and further that they had come to a point of agreement not to subsidise the housing of the working classes.  I want to tell the Minister that things are coming to a bad end in this country if the working classes are expected to pay what is considered an economic rent in the country.</P>

He also said that I stated that the Executive Council had decided that the unemployed man and the poorly paid worker should be made pay an economic rent of 14/-.  He then passed on to talk of the worker.  My reply to the first of these questions is that I made no such statement; but I made this statement, that the country in which it is to be expected that the ordinary worker in industry must be provided with a house which is subsidised, cannot afford to solve its slum problems.</P>

    <P>Standing Order No. 12: &ldquo;The Cathaoirleach shall nominate at the commencement of each triennial period a panel of two Senators, either of whom shall act as presiding Senator or Chairman of Committee of the whole Seanad when requested so to act by the Cathaoirleach.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment 4:</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the Standing Order the words &ldquo;or, in his absence, by the Leas-Chathaoirleach.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a very important proposal but I think it is desirable in order to clear up an ambiguity that seems to exist in the proposed Standing Order No. 12.  This Standing Order is one of two to deal with the appointment of a Chairman over our proceedings in the absence of the Cathaoirleach or the Leas-Chathaoirleach. The idea is that in the absence of the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach we should have a panel of two Senators, either of whom may be called upon to act in the absence of the regular Chairman. In this proposed Standing Order we have the Cathaoirleach mentioned twice.  It seems to me that the word has a different meaning in the second case in which it is mentioned from what it has in the first instance.  That is a position which, I think, should be remedied.  &ldquo;Cathaoirleach&rdquo; in the first line of the Standing Order means the Cathaoirleach himself and only him, but in the last line the word &ldquo;Cathaoirleach&rdquo; may mean either the regular Cathaoirleach or the Leas-Chathaoirleach. Under Standing Order 11, <Col N="1675" /> the Leas-Chathaoirleach is given authority to exercise the duties devolving upon and the authority conferred upon the Cathaoirleach by these Standing Orders.  Let us assume that the Cathaoirleach is absent and that the Leas-Chathaoirleach is also absent.  According to this Standing Order either might nominate a member of the panel who would act as Chairman.  This seems to be merely pedantic, but it has a practical bearing, because one can imagine a situation in which both the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach being absent, two different members of the panel might be nominated, one by each of them.  Let us assume that the Cathaoirleach is incapacitated by illness over a period and that his work is being carried on by the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach, through unavoidable circumstances, is unable to attend.  The Cathaoirleach hears of that and he nominates one member of the panel.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach may nominate the other member of the panel.  We would be faced with a situation in which two men would come along armed with authority to act as Chairman&mdash;the authority coming from each of our regular Chairmen.  For that reason I propose that we give power specifically to the Cathaoirleach, and failing him, to the Leas-Chathaoirleach to appoint a Chairman to preside. In that way we would close all loopholes. Before formally putting the amendment before the Seanad, I would ask the permission of the House to make a small alteration in it.  As it stands at present, it proposes to add to the Standing Order the words &ldquo;or in his absence&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the Cathaoirleach&mdash;&ldquo;by the Leas-Chathaoirleach.&rdquo; It would be quite possible, as I have explained, for the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach to nominate different members of the panel.  By using the words &ldquo;failing him&rdquo; instead of the words &ldquo;in his absence&rdquo;  I think we would provide against all possible contingencies.  The position would then be that in the absence of the <Col N="1676" /> Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach, a member of the panel might be nominated by the Cathaoirleach to act, and if so, would act. Failing nomination by the Cathaoirleach, nomination by the Leas-Chathaoirleach would be effective, and, failing nomination by either of them, the House could proceed under Standing Order 13 and elect a Chairman for the day.  I ask the leave of the House to insert in the amendment the words &ldquo;failing him&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;in his absence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Alteration of amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to Senator Hooper that Standing Order 11 covers his amendment entirely and that if his amendment were to be introduced into Standing Order 12 we would require to go through all the Standing Orders in which there was the possibility of the Leas-Chathaoirleach acting in place of the Cathaoirleach and make the same provision that Senator Hooper proposes, to enable the Leas-Chathaoirleach to act.  Standing Order 11 provides definitely that, in the absence of the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach shall perform the duties devolving upon and exercise the authority conferred upon the Cathaoirleach by these Standing Orders.  What Senator Hooper has alluded to, I suggest, does not happen, for the simple reason that the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach act in conjunction with the Clerk.  In the extraordinary case of the unexpected absence of the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Clerk would know quite well what steps had been taken for the good order of the House.  Arrangements of this kind for the carrying on of the business of the House are always made in conjunction with the Clerk or Assistant-Clerk. I cannot conceive the Cathaoirleach, on any occasion on which he would be absent from a meeting, meeting a Senator in the street and authorising him to act as Chairman or the Leas-Chathaoirleach doing <Col N="1677" /> the same thing without informing the Clerk.  I suggest that it would be disorderly to do so.  If you made this provision specifically in the case of Standing Order 12, you would have to do it right through the Standing Orders, and it might appear that you were affecting the validity of Standing Order 11.</P>

I do say that my amendment makes for greater clearness.  It is not a very important matter, but I should like to see the amendment made if the House were agreeable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I move to delete paragraph 3 of Standing Order 25.  The Standing Order provides for motions for the adjournment for the purpose of discussing matters of urgent public importance.  It provides that such a motion may be made if the Senator within half an hour after the opening of the sitting rises in his place and states that he requests leave to move such adjournment of the Seanad for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, whereupon he shall state the matter and deliver to <Col N="1678" /> the Cathaoirleach a written statement of the subject to be discussed. Then it is provided in paragraph 2 that the Cathaoirleach shall ask those in support of the motion to rise in their places and if not less than five Senators rise accordingly he shall fix a time later in the day when the matter shall be considered.  Paragraph 3 reads: &ldquo;A matter submitted in pursuance of this Standing Order which fails to obtain the requisite support cannot during the current year be again brought forward under the Standing Order.&rdquo;  I propose the deletion of that paragraph.  It precludes the possibility of a Senator bringing on at a later period up to a year a motion which has already been refused by the House on the ground that it is not of urgent public importance.  Surely if the matter is of urgent public importance it is a matter to be raised at the moment, and I think it is absurd for us to provide against the possibility of matters of urgent public importance being raised in a period running up to a year after the original date on which it was moved.  For that reason I think the sub-section is quite unnecessary and I move its deletion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a similar amendment down.  It was for the same reason, that there seems to be a contradiction of thought.  I would put it to the House that if the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; were deleted&mdash;and it seems to me entirely unnecessary&mdash; then paragraph 3 might stand.  But when we lay emphasis upon the urgency before a question can be discussed by this method it is obvious that the same question cannot be urgent at a later period of the year. I would prefer, notwithstanding the fact that I put down this amendment, that the question should be considered as to whether definite matters of public importance, irrespective of the question of urgency, might not be publicly discussed in this way, except that it may be said that they can be raised on a formal motion.  When the word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; is in it it seems to me that No. 3 ought not to be present at all.</P>

      <P>May I point out, particularly to Senator Johnson, that Standing Order 24 provides for what is very seldom used, that is the right of raising for half an hour on the motion for the adjournment a matter of importance.  The word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; is not included there.  Standing Order 25 deals with a specific urgent matter for which the business of the House would be specially laid aside to take up and is rather intended to meet an exceptional case.  Standing Order 24 may quite conceivably be a regular and frequent procedure, but it has not been availed of in the way in which it was originally hoped it would be.  Standing Order 25 is to meet rather exceptional cases.  I do not want to be taken as speaking for the Committee.  I am only trying to help the House by putting forward what appears to me to be the opinions of the Committee.  I gathered that the reason for paragraph 3 was that if the requisite support could not be obtained on this very urgent matter it did not seem desirable that a Senator could the next day claim that it was a matter of urgent public importance.  It might render the thing rather absurd. I would like to point out that the Dáil has a similar Order but that they use the word Session.  We had a feeling that a Session might go into a number of years and we specifically provided in this section the current year which is meant to be Anno Domini.  In this case if a request were made to-day and it did not receive the requisite support it could not be brought up again during 1930, but it could be brought up in 1931. It is entirely a matter for the House. I am merely trying to explain the idea behind the Order.</P>

      <P>A matter might be considered urgent by one Senator to-day, and it might not get the support of the necessary five.  Notwithstanding that fact, the matter may continue to be urgent in his opinion, and perhaps in a fortnight's time or in a month's time it may be urgent in the opinion of ten members of the Seanad.  There is another consideration <Col N="1680" /> also, that a matter may be urgent to-day and more urgent to-morrow or in a month's time.

The governing situation is not what is urgent in the particular Senator's mind; it is what is urgent in the mind of the Cathaoirleach. He has to decide what is an urgent motion.  If he decides one day that it is not urgent it is not likely that in a week's time he will decide that it is urgent.  For that reason this sub-section seems to me to be utterly redundant and to bring that part of the Standing Order into absurdity.</P>

      <P>I am still satisfied that a Senator might make a speech not taking up more than half a sheet of ordinary notepaper.  He might like to read it and it might be a very <Col N="1682" /> useful, even though a very brief, statement to have on the official records of the House.  If this Standing Order goes through it is up to the Cathaoirleach to refuse to allow the Senator to read the few remarks that he may wish to make.  I hope that the Seanad will give the Cathaoirleach discretion in this matter and allow any member, on any occasion that he desires to do so, to read out a very short statement.</P>

      <P>There is really no necessity for it.  Senator Byrne has stated that a member might read his speech from half a sheet of notepaper. I am sure no occupant of the Chair would attempt to prevent anybody from reading a speech of reasonable length.  What the Standing Order really aims at is to prevent the House being bored by a person who might like to read newspaper extracts or quote from books. It is not intended to curb any member from reading matter to assembled Senators.  In fact, we all hope that Senators will avail themselves of committing to paper important statements that they may wish to make. There would be no objection, I am sure, to reading those statements. The Standing Order really seeks to safeguard the House from people boring them to death.  There is no intention to curb Senator Byrne or any other Senator who wants to put forward an important point of view.</P>

      <P>I have constantly advocated the same thing from the beginning.  Anybody who has followed the procedure in Parliaments knows that when an important speech is to be made, when a statement is uttered and when a great deal of importance is laid on the actual wording, it is absolutely necessary that it should be in writing and read out.  The object of that is to avoid the putting down of anything which might be contrary to the words actually uttered.  It <Col N="1683" /> has been stated here that this proposal means something quite different.  I want something done here that means exactly what it says, and not something else.  The Standing Order here reads: &ldquo;No Senator shall read his speech.&rdquo;  That is quite clear and decisive, and as long as that is there it would be improper for the Cathaoirleach to allow a Senator to read out his speech.  It is not very often that speeches are read here.  I maintain that a speech written out beforehand is much more likely to be short and more to the point than a rambling speech such as one hears&mdash; I will not say in this Seanad, but in some places.  One hears occasionally rambling, rigmarole speeches that wander in and out in such a way as to bore the life actually out of one. A Senator who would write out his speech beforehand would be much more likely to keep to the point, and it would be a much better speech than if we had a person rambling in the way some people do.  I want to put the Cathaoirleach in a proper position.  If he observes a Senator reading long statements from newspapers or books and wearing everybody out he can tell him that he must come to the point.  We only want to entrust to the Cathaoirleach the power to do that.  The words &ldquo;No Senator shall read his speech&rdquo; are very clear and definite, and the Cathaoirleach is not entitled to intervene. To say that the Cathaoirleach may do it if he likes is going along a line forbidden by the Standing Orders.</P>

      <P>I submit that all Senators can do, under the present Standing Orders, what they want to do.  I think the Senator who moved the amendment was in the House of Commons when a similar matter was discussed.  The answer then given by the Speaker was just what the Cathaoirleach here would give&mdash;that no member had the right to read his speech, but he could use notes.  It is at the discretion of the Speaker or the Chairman of Committees to decide <Col N="1684" /> whether a member would be breaking that law or not and he could allow him to read a statement such as Senator Byrne mentioned&mdash;one that would occupy about half a sheet of notepaper.  That is all that is required. I entirely agree that if it were a recognised thing that Senators could read their speeches, the debates would become somewhat interminable, and if members wanted to do it they could read papers, blue books and notes and we would never have an end to a discussion.  If Senators are anxious to read a short statement, that is already covered by the Standing Orders.</P>

      <P>I think the Standing Order before the House is too drastic. I was in the House of Commons when the Standing Order Senator Sir Walter Nugent refers to was made. I know that occasions arose in the House of Commons when it was necessary for Ministers, and not alone ordinary Ministers but the Prime Minister of England, to read their speeches.  There might be a very important document and the Minister could not trust to his memory; it would not be wise if he did so. Such an occasion might arise here and I think the Cathaoirleach should have discretion.  The Standing Order should not be allowed to remain as drastic as it is.  Take, as an example, the case of Senator Milroy to-day.  He had charge of three or four motions on the Order Paper.  The Minister's statement here was on a sheet of notepaper.  Owing to the unavoidable absence of the Minister, business was held up here for some time.  I contend that if Senator Milroy could have made that statement on behalf of the Minister it would have satisfied Senator Johnson and other Senators.  The whole information was on a small sheet of notepaper.  If the House <Col N="1685" /> desires to give this right to its members it ought to do so in a clear, bold way.  You have all seen men in this and in the other House and if they wanted to make an effective speech they wrote it out beforehand.  They tried to look at you and read the speech at the same time.  What is the use of that sort of humbug?</P>

      <P>As we are quoting Westminster, I would like to quote a saying of a pretty famous British Speaker, that one of the greatest qualifications of a Speaker was to know the right time to have a blind eye.  We have got on exceedingly well for seven years with this wording, and there has been no misunderstanding. I think in the circumstances it would be very dangerous, indeed, to introduce Senator Byrne's wording.  His wording seeks to continue these words plus &ldquo;except by leave of the Cathaoirleach.&rdquo;  I think it would be very undesirable if a Senator about to make a speech stood up and said: &ldquo;Cathaoirleach, may I read my speech?&rdquo;  The Cathaoirleach would not know if that Senator had volumes behind him from which he would quote. He might give him permission to do so, and that Senator could go on as long as his voice would last.  As it is, the Cathaoirleach would know quite well if a Senator is abusing the privileges of the House by reading too lengthy a speech, or quoting documents at too great a length.  If you give him specific permission, as Senator Byrne's amendment proposes, you will be asking for trouble.</P>

      <P>I do not think the amendment would work out satisfactorily, but I want to draw attention to this.  It is known to any Senator who has ever been in the Dáil that when the Budget is being introduced a document is quite openly read.  Senator Douglas has pointed out the wisdom regarding the Speaker of the House of Commons not opening his eyes to certain breaches, but with this particular motion in the Standing Orders we are in the position that even though the Cathaoirleach has decided to allow a person to read his speech if some offensive member of the Seanad calls his attention to the fact I think he would be bound under the Standing Orders to prevent that Senator reading his speech. I am assuming now that any Standing Orders regarding the rules of discussion which are directed to Senators would also apply to Ministers coming into the Seanad, and that the existence of this Standing Order might easily cause a little difficulty. I think the practice of the House would be better if it were continued without the presence of this Standing Order at all.  The very fact that you have got a Standing Order of this kind would cause more confusion and difficulty.  However, it is on the books and there is no suggestion of its abolition, but in view of the discussion which is taking place I would suggest for consideration that the question should be discussed by the Committee whether there is any wisdom in keeping this Standing Order in existence, and whether we should not leave it for the general practice of the House to determine what should be the rule in regard to Senators and their mode of delivering their speeches.</P>

      <P>S.O. 30.  To delete the words &ldquo;shall lapse unless moved by some other Senator&rdquo; and to substitute therefore the words &ldquo;may be moved by some other Senator with the permission of the Seanad.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Standing Order deals with the moving by another Senator of a motion standing in the name of a Senator who is unable to be present. The old Standing Order says that a <Col N="1688" /> Senator, at the request of the Senator who has given notice of any motion, may move it on his behalf. The new Standing Order now before us seeks to provide that if a Senator does not move the motion or amendment standing in his name such motion or amendment shall lapse unless moved by another Senator. I propose in such a case that it may be moved by some other Senator with the permission of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>In the past when a Senator who gave notice of motion was not able to be present Senators were in difficulty about moving the motion because nobody had been requested by him to act on his behalf.  It seems to me that the Standing Order before us swings rather in the other direction because it allows any Senator in the absence of the Senator who has given notice of a motion to move it whether with his consent or not.  It seems to me we ought to give some consideration to the Senator who has given notice and who for some reason or another is not able to be present.  It is desirable that the notice on the Order Paper should not be withheld from the Seanad without good reason.  I can conceive of a man who gives notice of motion and who is prevented from some unavoidable cause from coming to move it.  Someone else who may not be as well informed as he but who for some reason or another may want to bring it on does so and nobody in the House can stop him. That is the effect of the Standing Order as proposed.  I say that would be doing injustice to the man who has made up his subject and has gone to the trouble of putting it down.</P>
    <P>My proposal would work out in this way.  If a Senator does not move the motion or amendment which stands in his name then some other Senator might rise and ask the permission of the Seanad to move it in his stead.  It may be that the Senator who has given notice of the motion may have communicated with the Cathaoirleach or some other Senator and explained the impossibility <Col N="1689" /> of his attending and the reason for it and requested that it be adjourned until some other day.  My motion leaves the whole matter within the discretion of the House, whereas the Standing Order in front of us does not give a discretion of that kind.</P>

      <P>I would like the House to consider the position of this proposed Standing Order and the case of a Senator who has sent in notice of motion and is, as Senator Hooper pointed out, for some reason not foreseen, unable to be present to move the motion standing in his name.</P>
      <P>Under the Standing Order, either as it stands or as it is proposed to be amended, once a subject is disposed of it cannot be brought forward again in the same year.  The position would then be that if a Senator for some reason was not able to move it the opponents of it might move the motion in such a way as to secure its defeat, and then, notwithstanding the fact that the original proposer was unable to be present, he would be precluded by the Standing Orders from bringing the matter forward again.  I think some agreement should be presumed on the part of the person who sent in the notice that some other person should move it on his behalf if he is absent.  That does not apply so much to amendments to a Bill; I am thinking more of notices of motions.  I suggest that that point should be considered and that when a man is not able to be present the case ought not to be prejudged in his absence by such a motion being moved by somebody else who is not conversant with the subject or who might desire its defeat.</P>

      <P>This is again, I think, rather too bald and direct, and it might destroy the value of a discussion on an important motion.  We are well aware of the procedure which deals with a motion by what is called a reasoned amendment the counter-proposition, which is not a simple negative, although it involves a direct opposition.  A direct negative might be contained in a reasoned amendment, but a reasoned amendment would not be precluded if the word &ldquo;simple&rdquo; were to be substituted for the word &ldquo;direct,&rdquo; and I think a reasoned amendment to a motion of which notice has been given should be allowed.  This again applies rather to motions than to discussions on Bills.  I think a reasoned amendment should be allowed to be moved and discussed to a motion of which notice has been given.</P>

      <P>There are very few cases in which this will occur, and, of course, a thing of this kind very largely depends on the discretion of the Chairman.  I confess I find a certain amount of difficulty in, getting Senator Johnson's exact point I take it that the object of the proposed Standing Order is to prevent a motion being turned by means of a reasoned amendment into something which in itself ought to be a motion with notice; in other words, that the House gets notice of a motion dealing with a specific subject, and if it were permissible, with the very short notice that is allowed for amendments so to transform it, the passing <Col N="1691" /> of it would mean something diametrically opposite.  I think the object of the amendment is to prevent that being done, or, if it is to be done, that it should be done by a new motion.  If the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; would cause misunderstanding, I think I would prefer the word &ldquo;negative.&rdquo;  I am not sure that a simple negative helps us very much, but I cannot see very much difference. I would like to meet the Senator.  This is a case on which the Committee wants to get general agreement.</P>

      <P>I will give an illustration. One is aware, from the British House of Commons procedure, where there is a formal vote of confidence, and the Opposition puts down an amendment, giving reasons for no confidence.  It is not simply &ldquo;no,&rdquo; but reasons are given why the original motion should not be carried.  Although that is clearly a direct negative it is not simply a direct negative, but a negative with certain reasons.  I think we should allow the possibility of that being done, and I think the Standing Order, as it stands, would preclude it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To delete all after the word &lsquo;Seanad&rsquo; in line 10 down to the end of the Standing Order.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This, perhaps, has a certain importance and it depends upon the view that the House is to take of its position when it is in Committee of the whole House and when it is sitting as the Seanad.  It seems to me to be an undesirable thing that, in the circumstances which lead to the suspension of a Senator in Committee of the whole House, that that should be related forthwith, without any actual change but with a formal change, to the same body of people, sitting as the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be undesirable to pretend, in such circumstances as would surround suspension, that the Chairman of the Seanad, sitting in Committee, would then proceed to relate all the circumstances to the Seanad sitting as the Seanad, when all those present were fully conversant with all that had passed.  It seems to me to be an undesirable procedure, and quite unnecessary, that such a report should be made.  I <Col N="1693" /> think we should rather consider a Committee of the whole House as in effect the Seanad with all the powers of suspension that are necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that any such report would in fact be made.  At any rate, the method adopted by the Committee was simply to deal with the record of proceedings in the House which, up to the present, are never recorded. It was to deal with very important matters such as the actual suspension of a member for a period of a week from Parliamentary rights, which should be specifically the act of the House itself.  The wording of the report would be a pure formality, unless it happened that the Chairman of the Committee would be a different person, when there would have to be the formality that I believe occurs frequently in Westminster. Here no one considers that such a report would be necessary, except a few words from the Chairman, when the House would proceed to act.  It would appear in the proceedings and would appear to be the action of the House rather than of the Committee. It could be met by specifically providing that a Committee of the whole House could suspend a member.  Deleting the words would not meet the case.  On the whole, I am inclined to think that the method provided will not really prove formidable, and that it is rather simpler than providing that a Committee of the whole House may suspend.  It is quite clear that it would never do to give other Committees such power.</P>

May I put this forward, that the rule might provide that the report of the Chairman of the Committee <Col N="1694" /> of the whole House would be recorded in the proceedings of the Seanad?  If that is the object sought, that some recognition should be given of the fact that the Chairman of the Committee of the whole House acting and formally suspending, would report the fact in a formal way his word would be taken as the record of the proceedings for the purpose of notification of suspension.</P>

I have a little experience of suspensions and ejectments in other places.  I was never ejected myself, but I have seen people ejected, and I have seen occasions when people properly deserved to be ejected, where on the spur of the moment, if time was not given for a little consideration, they would have been ejected.  But time being given the result was that they were not ejected, and things went on as usual. <Col N="1695" /> I think if this rule were left as it is there would be no great harm done and I think Senator Johnson should withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>S.O. 44.  To add at the end of the Standing Order a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) When a question has been decided in accordance with this Standing Order any further motion may be moved which is requisite to bring to a decision any question already proposed from the Chair and, subject to the discretion of the Cathaoirleach as provided in this Standing Order, such motion shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the old Standing Orders there were three dealing with closure motions.  There was the first dealing with the simple closure motion, the second dealing with supplementary motions in order to bring to a conclusion any previous motion that had been put from the Chair, and, thirdly, there was a Standing Order dealing with closure by compartments. The Committee that prepared the new Standing Orders omitted the latter two of these old Standing Orders, and the one now before us is confined simply to the closure of a single motion.  It seemed to me they went rather too far in deleting the other two, and that the second course should be retained by which further motions might immediately be put from the Chair in order to bring to a conclusion any question that had been previously <Col N="1697" /> put.  Let us take the case of the section of a Bill to which amendments have been put down.  Very frequently it happens in discussions of that kind that the Cathaoirleach allows a fairly wide discussion to take place on one of the amendments, and after that discussion has run for some time somebody moves the closure of the discussion.  Now unless the proposal I have here is included in the Standing Orders, it will be still possible for Senators to go on and move these other later amendments, and there could be no closure motion moved on any of them for one hour on each.  Under the old Standing Orders if a position of that kind were reached and the closure were carried on the first amendment, the Chairman was then empowered under subsequent Standing Orders to put all the remaining amendments.  That would enable the Seanad to come to a conclusion on the general section.  There is no power to do that under these Standing Orders, and the proposed paragraph, I submit, would give that power, and would save what might easily become a serious abuse, and would, I believe, give the Seanad a businesslike procedure in respect of that point.  If there were six amendments down the closure motion could not be moved in respect of any of them until the debate on any of them had lasted for an hour.  There is an opening for abuse in that.</P>

      <P>I think that in the Committee we had a long discussion over this particular Standing Order. We had in mind the point raised by Senator Hooper.  It had been cited that in the case of amendments to sections of a Bill, that when the question was put by the Chairman that meant the amendment before the House was the question put and the closure motion only closured that particular amendment, and not the section, and the other amendments could go on.</P>

Personally I am of opinion it would <Col N="1698" /> mean an improvement to add the words suggested by Senator Hooper, and I do not think they would take away from the position stated by Senator Farren, but I can see circumstances under which a very strict reading of the Order as it is in the draft might prevent, as a result of carrying the closure motion, the completion of the matters before the House which was necessary.  I think it ought to go back to the Committee. I think it is similar to the Dáil, and I do not see that it can do any harm or take away from what Senator Farren has said.</P>

      <P>I would not like it to go back as a suggestion to the Committee that Senator Douglas's interpretation is what we desire as right.  I think when there are amendments down to the motion in respect of a Bill in which there is a series of amendments the closure motion must and would only deal with the actual question under discussion, and not the original subject under discussion to which there had been tabled a series of amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree. What I suggest is that when there is a closure it is only the particular matter closured would end, but if it was a motion which required other actions to bring it to finality, then I think there should be power in the Chair without further debate to deal with the other matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. Hooper Mr. Hooper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make this clear.  Before any other division can be taken to bring the matter to a conclusion the Chairman must be satisfied in the same way as he would under the original Standing Order that the motion is not an infringement of the rights of the <Col N="1699" /> minority, and every time it is within the discretion of the Chairman to withhold sanction to the motion.</P>

I really forget now what did happen.  It is really very awkward to have a lot of new amendments ruled out merely because one particular amendment is objected to.  Anyhow, I think it ought to be within the power of the Cathaoirleach to protect in all cases the rights of minorities.</P>

      <P>I think it is only reasonable to allow five minutes for the taking of a division.  It is a long way from the refreshment room to the Seanad Chamber, and if a member were taking a meal there it <Col N="1700" /> meant a great rush to get here in the time allowed previously.</P>

      <P>With regard to Standing Order 49, there is just a small question on that which I want to raise.  This matter that I am going to deal with arose in the Dáil when they changed the method of taking divisions there.  They began by following the procedure of the House of Commons: that is to say, the tellers were not counted amongst those &ldquo;for&rdquo; or &ldquo;against.&rdquo; With a small number in Opposition in the Dáil in those days, it was found that the numbers &ldquo;against&rdquo; were too small&mdash;smaller in fact than they actually were.  I call attention to this in the hope that if we simply adopt that precedent the tellers will be recorded and counted.  We need not alter the Standing Order to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Cathaoirleach Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Standing Order 51, it applies in general to the rules of procedure of the Seanad and the procedure of committees, with three exceptions, which are mentioned.  It seems to me that elsewhere in these Standing Orders we have made other alterations and other exceptions from the general rules of procedure in the Seanad.  I think it would be well if at the end of the first line of the Standing Order we inserted something to this effect: The rules as to procedure in the Seanad shall, unless <Col N="1701" /> otherwise provided by these Standing Orders, apply to the procedure in Committee of the whole Seanad, etc.  The point is one that I think requires further consideration, and I suggest that the Standing Order might be referred back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If this matter is pressed, of course it could be considered, but I am afraid there is a little of the blind eye in it as well. We have, in effect, two kinds of Committees. A Committee considering a Bill adopts the procedure of this House, and takes the Bill section by section as it is taken here.  But a Committee that is not dealing with a specific matter, obviously never does and, in effect, could not adopt the form of procedure followed here.  That kind of Committee appoints its own chairman, and a considerable amount of discretion is allowed to him in the carrying out of the proceedings.  The reason for this Standing Order is in case of a dispute to have something to which one could refer back. These Standing Orders do not attempt to deal with the kind of discussion that must of necessity take place before certain types of Committees. We sometimes send Bills to a Committee.  A general discussion is not desirable in the case of a Committee of that sort.  A Bill is before the Committee and it is taken section by section, with the moving of amendments and so on, the procedure followed being the same as that adopted here.  But in the case of a Committee discussing questions like, say, the remuneration of Senators, obviously that kind of formal procedure is not followed.  The danger that I see in Senator Hooper's proposal would be to make the Standing Order more rigid than it is.  I think it would be most undesirable if the Chairman of every Committee were made to feel that on every occasion the strict, rigid rules laid down by Standing Orders should be followed.</P>

      <P>The object of this Standing Order is to have something for the guidance of Committees in special circumstances.  The opinion <Col N="1702" /> of the Committee was that where it was necessary to have regulations for these committees something should be laid down to guide them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. Hooper Mr. Hooper">

      <P>One case that I have in mind is in reference to the casting vote of the Chairman.  If the casting vote is to be taken from the Chairman, as is proposed by this Standing Order, that would be another exception to the general rule that the procedure of committees should be governed by the procedure in the Seanad.  I suggest that the matter should be further considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Hooper has raised this point I do not see how we can possibly avoid sending the Standing Order back to the Committee, because undoubtedly there are other matters besides these three matters that we discussed a short time ago to be considered.  What are the rules of procedure, for instance, in the case of the suspension of a member of this House?  Are they different in the Seanad to what they would be in Committee of the whole House?  As Senator Hooper has raised this point, I think it ought to be sent back to the committee in order to have it clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to press that point before the Committee, but I was overruled.  One finds that at every Committee people speak more than three times.  Very often the discussion may be between two or three people who want perhaps some slight change in words.  A conversation goes on between them, and the matter is settled, but it takes more than three speeches, though the speeches may be only a couple of words each.  I think discretion should be given in this matter to the Chair.  Of course, if there is any obstructive practice, the Chairman could point out that we already had enough of it.  What I object to is putting things into the Standing Orders that are never carried out. This limitation is never carried out. Why, then, put them in the Standing Orders?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the words &ldquo;and he shall have only one vote&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;He shall have a vote as an ordinary member of the Committee, but not a casting vote.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the old Standing Order it is provided that the Chairman shall have a casting vote.  In the Standing Order now before us it is proposed that he shall have only one vote but it does not say whether it is to be a casting vote or a vote as an ordinary member of the Committee. My amendment seeks merely to make that clear and that he shall have a vote only as an ordinary member of the Committee and not a casting vote.  I am not now arguing whether a casting vote or an ordinary <Col N="1704" /> vote is the better.  I merely put down this amendment to carry out what I understand was the intention of the Committee and which I think is not quite clearly expressed as a Standing Order stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain matters have been put before me which convince me that this ought to be referred back to the Committee.  In the first place I do not think it is really clear particularly in view of this other Standing Order which provides that the rules of the Seanad shall apply to Committees.  The Seanad is governed by the Constitution, which provides definitely that its Chairman shall have a casting vote and if you sent this Standing Order in this form to a Committee providing that the Chairman shall have only one vote it would mean that he would only have a vote as an ordinary member of the Committee, but that he would have no strict right to a casting vote.  I think it looks as if this will have to be amended with the other Standing Orders that apply to the procedure of the Seanad in Committee.  What I am not sure about is whether the Chairman should have a casting vote or an ordinary vote.  I think in a Committee dealing with a Bill where you have members of the two Houses he ought to have a vote as an ordinary member. The chief advantage of a casting vote is that while you sacrifice something you do get a decision.  I am convinced this must clearly go back in order that it may be decided which class of vote the House would wish a Chairman of Committee to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this, the point of view that has become almost as well understood in law and practice, regarding the action of the Chairman, is that his casting vote should go with the status quo.  It seems to me that it is desirable that that should continue and that the vote of the Chairman ought to be only the casting vote and not the vote as an ordinary member.  If he is to have a vote as an ordinary member he is almost bound to vote according to his own judgment, not to <Col N="1705" /> maintain the status quo, whereas it is perhaps a desirable thing in an important Committee that the Chairman should really maintain the status quo so that the House&mdash;the larger body&mdash;may have an opportunity of deciding.  It is a matter that I think is well worthy of consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty really is, you may have a Committee of ten and you want all Parties to be represented and you get a Chairman by robbing one of the Parties of one vote, so that you actually start with a difficulty right off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>Another thing that should be considered is that a very large number of Committees are Joint Committees, and it is most important that the Standing Orders as regards the Chairman's vote should be the same in both Houses.  I respectfully suggest that it should be an ordinary vote and not a casting vote.  At least, in the Dáil that is the Standing Order.</P>

      <P>The Chairman of a Committee should have only one vote, which he should never use.  I have been Chairman of many Committees.  The Chairman never uses his vote except when the votes are equal, and then he votes whichever way he likes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. Hooper Mr. Hooper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>One consideration that I would like to be kept in mind is the fact that the proposal is to give the Chairman only one ordinary vote.  If he has an ordinary vote and not a casting vote he takes part in the general work of the Committee. In his capacity as Chairman he has to consider whether motions put before him are in order or not.  Where he has to deal with a motion put forward by other Senators he may be regarded as impartial, but where he brings forward a motion of his own it is very difficult for him sometimes to judge.  I have had some experience of my own in that connection; I found it very difficult, and it seems to me a point that should be considered in deciding whether we should give the Chairman an ordinary vote or a casting vote.  If he <Col N="1706" /> has a casting vote only in a small Committee of the Seanad, it will tilt the balance as against the rest of the Committee.  There may be six members on the Committee and if the Chairman only has a casting vote, then it leaves the decision of the Committee to practically one person; there are three people as against two. That is a rather awkward thing. I think these are the points that the Committee should consider.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that it takes very much to explain this amendment.  If there is equality of votes on any motion in Committee, it is decided automatically in the negative, and that motion cannot be brought forward again.  In that way it seems to me that you attach a greater weight to the Níl vote than to the Tá vote, and it is questionable how far that is desirable.  It seems to me that a good arrangement would be that if you can get any decision at a Committee, and there be no case of a casting-vote in the Chairman, that it ought to be permissible for members of the Committee to bring that question up again at a later date and to get a clear decision upon it.  It may be that you may have a succession of days on which there would be equality of votes, in fact, on any question.  But some time or other the Committee must come to an end, and there would be no subsequent meeting.  So long as you can keep the decision open so as to <Col N="1707" /> get a clear decision, I think you ought to do so.</P>

You would never get that Bill back if you have not some method by which the proceedings will come to an end, and there is no grievance at all if the Party proposing the amendment have equality with the Party who are opposed to the amendment.  I say that because there would be a further Stage of the Bill.  In any case there would be the Report Stage in which they would have a further opportunity of bringing up an amendment.  If you were to give the specific right that is proposed in this amendment you would have a member bringing forward an amendment again and again.  You would probably have a determined, energetic or pig-headed Senator bringing forward an amendment from day to day until somebody opposed to him might stay away, in which event he might get it passed.  I do think that discretion lies in the Chairman.  If the Chairman fails to get a decision by agreement when some report has to be made, he will find that the matter has not been dealt with at all or that it is coming forward for consideration again.  I cannot see in a Committee of that kind that any difficulty will arise at all in reconsidering an amendment on which agreement has not been reached.  I think it would be dangerous to give that discretion.</P>

Those Committees must report back to the House, and if there is an even division it is open to the member of the Committee, instead of bringing this before the Committee and threshing it out again and again, to bring it before the House.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New S.O.  Before S.O. 72 to insert a new S.O. as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>72.  Questions may be addressed in writing to a Minister but such questions shall be confined to matters relating to general public policy and administration for which he is responsible, and not to the details of departmental administration.  Any <Col N="1711" /> such question shall be delivered to the Clerk and, if held by the Cathaoirleach to be within the terms of this Standing Order, shall be forwarded to the Minister concerned.  On the receipt by the Clerk of the Minister's reply, such reply shall be forwarded by him to the Senator who put the question; and the question, together with the reply thereto, shall be printed at the beginning of the Official Report of the Debates for the next succeeding day on which the Seanad shall sit.</P>
    <P>I have a view that it ought not be necessary to have a Standing Order governing this, but it would be requisite to have the replies that the Minister might make to a question inserted in the Official Report.  It is chiefly with the object of having replies to questions that might be put forward inserted in the Official Report that I desire that the Standing Order should make provision accordingly. The Seanad has not machinery, apparently, for getting replies to questions by the procedure of the House of Lords, where you have Ministers in the House who are capable of answering questions that may be put by a member of the Upper House.  The procedure there is to raise a question by putting it on the paper, and they then get an answer from a responsible Minister. My desire is that a Senator who seeks information on a matter of public importance, not on departmental affairs, should be able to use the machinery of the House for transmitting a question of this public nature to a Minister, and to have the answer recorded in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>It may be said that it is open to any Senator to get a question of that kind put by a member of the Dáil.  I do not think that is satisfactory. I have in mind, for instance, certain questions which I put to a Minister seeking information which the Minister promised to provide, or at least to consider, and although there was no reason why <Col N="1712" /> the information should not have been given, the information has not been given.  I would like that that information, for instance, should be supplied to the House in answer to a question.  I do not want to compel the Minister to come to the House to answer the question and read it out, because the kind of question which I have in contemplation was not one which would be subject to cross-examination or anything of that kind.  I think it is not desirable that we should ask Ministers to come to the House to answer questions of this nature themselves, but it is desirable that Senators should have some formal opportunity of submitting questions to the Ministers on matters of public importance, and that the replies received by the Clerk should be inserted in the Official Report.  It is of public interest and public importance that questions of that type should be permissible. I therefore move that this Standing Order be inserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the proposed Standing Order. As a matter of fact, I have on some occasions, through the Clerk of the Seanad, sent a message to the Ministers, and I must say that I got an answer back either delivered by the Minister himself when he came into the Seanad or in some other way.  I think this is much the easier way because in many cases it might obviate the putting down of a motion.  Supposing a Senator is going to bring forward a motion. and that before doing so he wants to be sure of certain facts.  If he writes to the Minister or sends him a message asking him about these facts, and if he gets these facts he will know everything about the matter and he may not then bother putting down the motion.  It would save trouble and time in that way If the Minister says something different he can go on with the motion. I do not see any reason why this should not be done.  The objection to answering questions when Standing Orders were originally drafted was on quite different grounds. That was because at that time we all <Col N="1713" /> objected to questions being put here on local matters from Donegal to Cork.  We were not prepared in the early days to face the matter of asking questions of that kind, so we ruled out questions.  We did not then think of questions such as are now contemplated.  It was in the early days when we first made this rule, and a very proper rule it was. This, however, is a different matter. We are merely asking that the Minister should give certain information on a subject with which he is well acquainted.  He can say as he often says in the Dáil, that he will not give it, if he wishes.</P>

      <P>I am rather puzzled to know, after listening to Senators, what is the object of the Standing Order.  Senator Colonel Moore thinks that this matter of communicating with Ministers for the purpose of getting information is a wonderful privilege which individual Senators should possess.  Therefore why make this a matter of the Standing Orders?  The point that I am puzzled about is this: these communications are really extern to the procedure of the business of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can see they are simply communications between individual Senators and individual Ministers.  The records of the House are I take it records of transactions that occur during the proceedings and within the sittings of this assembly.  It seems to me that it might open up a new vista of possibilities in the way of records.  It would be alarming if matters other than the actual proceedings of the House were to be entered on the official records.  What is sought to be done by the motion in a formal way is already being done and every information of this kind is at the disposal of every member of the Seanad. I can see no positive advantage to be gained by this.  I cannot see that it will facilitate the procedure of the House in any way better than the facilities at present permitted.  I can see also an opportunity, which <Col N="1714" /> would be an inducement or an incitement to a man who wants to appear conspicuous on the records to send all sorts of interrogations to Ministers in order to have them on the records.  It will be noticed that this Standing Order is to apply only to interrogations that are of a certain character.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Questions may be addressed to Ministers and such questions shall be confined to matters relating to general public policy and administration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That seems to ask that a Minister shall set out on paper a statement of his public policy in regard to his Department. I could see much more reason for this innovation if the suggestion took the form of facilities for interrogating Ministers in the Assembly, where a statement could be made.  I could see a certain advantage in that.  Possibly it would not be a very positive advantage.  But I can see very great inconvenience being caused by the procedure suggested here.  For that reason, if this proposal by Senator Johnson is seriously entertained, I would certainly suggest that it be referred to the Committee, along with the other Standing Orders, for discussion before a decision is arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be well to make clear that a proposal of this kind was before the Committee.  I was not present, but I understand it was rejected by the Committee after a considerable amount of consideration. I should like to state briefly the reasons why I think it is a mistake to put a Standing Order of this kind down.  In the first place. you have questions addressed by an individual to a Minister.  These questions, if they are within reason, ought to be answered irrespective of the Party of the Minister, and I understand in most cases are answered whether satisfactorily answered or not, is a matter of opinion.  That, of course, is a matter of courtesy.  This proposal would make that a right.  We could only make it a matter of right by consent of the Ministry and by arrangement. <Col N="1715" /> There might be something to be said if we had power to make it a matter of right.  If we make it a matter of Seanad demand, and the Minister refuses to give an answer, that refusal would be an affront to the House itself.  That would be a very undesirable state of affairs.  In my opinion, you are not then in a position to enforce the demand. Furthermore, you would have only a few questions which are of general public interest.  I suggest that under Standing Order 24 half an hour at the end of the proceedings is the proper time to bring forward any questions of this sort, and the Minister will have to give a proper reason why he does not come here and answer them.  That is the proper provision, and it is the requisite provision to meet the position.  If you are dealing with general questions, which is not the intention, you will have requests from Senators' friends and all sorts of people who think they are represented by a Senator, and the system would be a nuisance to members, and, what is more important, would lead to a very large increase in public expense without any public gain.  I think public questions can be answered satisfactorily in the other House.  I think that is Senator Johnson's view, judging by the amendment.  You would be getting no further information.  You would be making a claim which you could not enforce, and which would lead to a grievance and the introduction of motions drawing attention to the refusal of the Minister to answer particular questions.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Douglas must have been arguing some proposal which was before the Committee but which is essentially different from the proposal before this House.  Every point he made seems to be answered by the form of this amendment in the name of Senator Johnson.  He says all sorts of questions can be put.  All sorts of questions cannot be put.  They must be questions relating to general public policy and administration.  He says <Col N="1716" /> these questions can be continued. They cannot be continued, because further down it is stated: &ldquo;Any such question shall be delivered to the Clerk and if held by the Cathaoirleach to be within the terms of this Standing Order, shall be forwarded to the Minister concerned. On the receipt by the Clerk of the Minister's reply, such reply shall be forwarded by him to the Senator who put the question; and the question, together with the reply thereto, shall be printed at the beginning of the Official Report of the Debates.&rdquo; I think it is most important for the public and for the Seanad that Senators should have the right to ask questions, not relating to constituencies, but relating to general public policy.  I have sufficient confidence in the good sense of the members of this Assembly to know that they would not abuse any right of that kind conferred upon them, particularly when the system would be operated under the direction and supervision of the Chairman of this Assembly.</P>

      <P>I am glad to learn that.  I thought he was speaking officially, and I was surprised that he was speaking in the strain in which he was, because I do not think Ministers would be wise in refusing to accede to a request of this kind. Senator Milroy, quoting Senator Colonel Moore, said Senators already have the right to send a question to the Minister and get an answer.  But that is only a private method.  It has not the authority of the Seanad behind it.  I would not suggest that anything that Colonel Moore would do would not be straightforward, but it is not a proper, constitutional way of asking a question of the head of a public Department on a matter <Col N="1717" /> of public policy.  I think the Seanad ought to accept this amendment, and include an Order of this kind amongst its Standing Orders.  I am not very long here, but I find we can really do things of a general character better, perhaps, than they can be done in the other House.  Questions of a general character asked here would receive a more satisfactory answer and more satisfactory discussion than they would receive in the other House.  Moreover, I understand from Senator Colonel Moore that these are rights we have surrendered&mdash;that we had the right to ask these questions originally.</P>

He would have to consult with, and could only give us an answer with the consent and concurrence of, his colleagues.  This amendment is not practical politics.</P>

I think it is unfair to bring forward a motion which the Minister would have to answer in the Seanad unless he knows about it beforehand, and I have always taken the opportunity of sending him notice that I was going to bring up such and such a subject in order that he might come fully prepared and documented to answer that particular question.  I think it is only fair to the Minister <Col N="1718" /> that he should be fully informed. That comes under practically the same head as this particular question. You tell him that you are going to ask a certain question in the Seanad and he comes fully documented.</P>

I would not mind if it were for the public good, but I do not think it would be.  I do not think that there is any necessity for it.  There is only one thing that I should like to add to what the Senators who have spoken in favour of rejecting the amendment have said, and that is to mention the very great pains taken by Ministers and the courtesy that they have always shown to those who write to them on any question.  I would like to put on record my appreciation of their work in that respect.  Very often I have to write to Ministers on all sorts of questions, and as soon as possible they have always answered these questions.  They go into them fully and act with the greatest courtesy.  I hope that this matter will not be referred back, but that a vote will be taken and the amendment rejected by the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I am astonished at the curious reception that this amendment has received.  A Minister is not bound to answer any question of a Deputy let alone a Senator, and I am not asking for any more rights than a Deputy has.  A Deputy has not any right to demand that a Minister shall reply to any question at all.  Therefore, I am not asking for any rights that a Deputy has not got.  I am entitled, if I can, to persuade a Deputy to put forward a question that I would like an answer to, but I think it is undesirable that I should be compelled to go via the media of Deputies before I can get a question answered which is requisite to my consideration of the Bills which are before this House.  We have responsibilities here as well as Deputies have for the carrying of Bills into law, and the information that we seek is to enable us to do that efficiently and properly.  Senator Miss Browne spoke of the trouble that Ministers take to answer questions. Undoubtedly they do.  At least, their staffs do.  Undoubtedly the kind of question that is involved in the amendment is not the kind of question that Senator Miss Browne and others send to Ministers, questions on departmental matters.  These are the questions that involve expense in the main.  There are other questions that involve departmental expense&mdash;the ordinary expense that a Deputy throws upon the State when he asks a question relating to some departmental matter.  I require, let us say, some information regarding the number of houses that have been built since 1923, before the Minister comes forward with his Second Reading motion on the Housing Bill.  This is just an illustration. I must wait until the Minister comes forward to get that information or I must persuade a Deputy to put down a question of that kind, and if <Col N="1720" /> I cannot persuade a Deputy, then I cannot get the information.  I think that is an undesirable state of things and I think that the procedure here is simple.</P>
      <P>The procedure is exactly the procedure that is adopted by a Deputy who wants a question answered in the Dáil.  There is no necessity for printing those questions on the Order Paper, because we are not asking for oral answers.  It is out of consideration for the work of Ministers that we do not ask for the presence of Ministers in giving the answers we seek.  The Minister will not be subject to cross-examination in this House over these questions that I have in mind.  I do think that it is desirable to have a procedure which would enable Senators to obtain information for public use and not for their own use.  I think that is the essence of the trouble in the minds of some Senators.  They think that the information sought is for the use of the Senator personally. The type of question that I have in mind is the type of question that I think is essential for the Senators in carrying on their work as Senators, and I think that that information which I might obtain by writing a letter to a Minister, ought to be on record in some document which is available for the use of Senators or Deputies if they look at Seanad reports.</P>

      <P>I understand that. I maintain that we ought to have a procedure within the House which would allow Ministers answers to questions to be printed for the use of Senators in their work as Senators.  It is always possible for a Minister to say, as is often said elsewhere, that it is not in the public interest to answer that question, or he can give such an answer as will not give any information.  If people are putting foolish or obstructive questions or questions merely for teasing and making the business of a Minister difficult, Ministers have <Col N="1721" /> an easy way of getting out of these things, but for questions for the legitimate use of the House, I think we ought to provide machinery and procedure which would allow that work to be done in a formal way.</P>

      <P>To add at the end of the S.O. the words &ldquo;nor shall any amendment carried in Committee of the whole Seanad be rejected on the Report Stage.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My view of the matter is that it would be better put the two things on the same level.  Let both things be the same.  Let it be that a motion rejected in Committee be rejected also on Report, or let it be the other way.  Why have two different methods?  An amendment is brought forward in Committee and it is rejected. It may be a very small House, just like the House we have now.  On the Report Stage you may have a very large House.  Let the amendment be agreed to or rejected, but put both on the same footing and that is all I want to do.  I do not care which, as long as you put the two on the same footing.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the amendment proposed by Senator Moore.  He has stated so precisely the reason why this amendment should be accepted that I feel very few words from me will be necessary. If a motion is rejected in Committee it cannot be brought forward on Report; that is the rule. But if a motion is passed in Committee I think it is only fair that it shall not be rejected on Report. Senator Moore has said what is just and I think the justice of his claim ought to commend the amendment to the House.  If this amendment of <Col N="1722" /> Senator Moore's is not carried there is absolutely no inducement whatever for us to appear on the Committee Stage of Bills.</P>

      <P>On one occasion last year on a very important Bill dealing with the Gaeltacht we waited here and gave our time and consideration to that measure in Committee. After long argument in Committee we carried an amendment against the wish of the Minister. Then the same Minister came along on the Report Stage and had down a motion to reverse what we had done in Committee and it was carried by his battalions who had not been here and who had not attended to the work of the Seanad on the Committee Stage.  That was one occasion upon which it happened and we made-no protest upon that occasion.  Now we find the Dublin Bill coming along. We carried in Committee two most important amendments and I find the Minister is doing with the Dublin Bill just what he did with the Gaeltacht Bill&mdash;he has brought in a motion for the Report Stage to reverse the decisions we got from this House on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  It is not fair to the House or to the people who attend here to discuss those measures, to proceed in that way.  It is not fair that the battalions who do not attend on the Committee Stages of Bills should be brought here on the Report Stage to vote us down.  It is, as a very eminent member of the other House has said, a strenuous argument for the abolition of the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Comyn seems to have quite forgotten, in his optimism, that in a short time he may have the battalions on his side.  I have a kind of feeling that <Col N="1723" /> there is always a grave danger that battalions will use their majority whenever they want to get something done, and I do not know that any Standing Order will prevent that in this or any other House.  We are now dealing with the question of the position on the Report Stage, irrespective of what the battalions may or may not do.  I suggest that the amendment would be a great mistake and would be quite contrary to the whole spirit of the Report Stage. Whether the new Standing Order is absolutely in every case fair enough I am not quite sure.  If new matter is introduced into a Bill on the Committee Stage, the whole object of the Report Stage is its revision, and if this amendment were adopted you may as well give up your Report Stage altogether.  It cuts both ways. It is the case in the Dáil and here, and if you suggest that whether in a full or a small House the decision on the Committee Stage in relation to new matter should not be revised, it would be better to give up the Report Stage altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other point raised by Senator Moore, on the question of what he called fair play, the new Standing Order put in by the Committee is more drastic than the previous one.  It may be that there is a feeling that it goes too far.  I am, of course, speaking entirely for myself.  &ldquo;Amendments may be moved on the Report Stage, but no amendment previously rejected in Committee of the whole Seanad shall be in order.&rdquo;  In the old Standing Order No. 70 it is stated &ldquo;The Cathaoirleach shall have power in his discretion to refuse an amendment tabled for the fourth stage of a Bill if he is of opinion that it is substantially the same as an amendment which has been rejected on the Committee Stage, and that the subject matter thereof has already been sufficiently debated.&rdquo;  The other is more drastic.  If it has been properly debated and has been rejected it is to a large extent obstruction to bring such amendment up again.  If it is a matter of a snatch division or if <Col N="1724" /> it comes at the end of the sitting with a small House, it does not seem proper that such amendment shall not come forward again.  If adopted, the proposal of Senator Colonel Moore would prevent the revision of an amendment so that the Report Stage would be ridiculous.  Amendments are sometimes carried in Committee, and it frequently happens that the movers themselves desire to make alterations in them.  To interfere with that procedure would, in my opinion, be a mistake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest, instead of carrying this amendment, that Standing Order 89 be referred back for consideration.  It seems to me to be too drastic and definite in its wording.  There are occasions when an amendment that is really necessary, not to say desirable, may be rejected in the Committee Stage either through misunderstanding or the fact that there is not a full House.  It would be ridiculous for us to insert a Standing Order which would prevent such amendment being brought on again on Report when a proper explanation of it would be given in cases where it might be necessary and desirable. The old Standing Order was far more preferable because this one is too hard and fast.  I agree with a good deal of what the Senator who moved the amendment said, namely, that if an amendment, rejected in Committee, cannot be in order on the Report Stage, it seems inconsistent to propose that an amendment inserted in Committee can be rejected on Report.  You cannot have such a contrast of procedure in that respect. I think that there is a <i>via media</i> between the two and I suggest the reference back of No. 89, so that the Committee may have it more fully considered and make it a little more elastic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite undesirable that it should be possible on Report to have a duplication of the discussion that has been gone through in Committee, and it may be possible, unless it is provided that amendments should not normally be <Col N="1725" /> allowed to come up on Report which had been rejected in Committee.  I think that this is necessary unless you are going to invite every amendment rejected to be taken on Report. I would like this present provision to be reconsidered with a proviso of this kind: that no amendment. previously rejected in Committee of the whole Seanad, shall be in order unless the Cathaoirleach is of opinion that the subject matter has not been properly discussed.  There is reason why the Report Stage should allow a rediscussion of an amendment that has been once rejected.  I think that the normal procedure should be the other way round.  I hope that the Committee, in reconsidering the matter, will take that point into consideration.</P>
