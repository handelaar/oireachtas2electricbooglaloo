      <P>With your permission, sir, I would like to mention a matter which, for the moment, takes us outside the domain of mundane affairs. One of the members of this House, who has endeared himself to us by his quiet, unassuming manner, Senator Linehan, for the past eight months has gone through the maddening agony of suspense concerning the safety of his son, Rev. Father Linehan, who is in China. The good news has now come to hand that Father Linehan and his comrade have been released from captivity, and as we felt silently with him in his sorrow we now feel with him in his joy. I think it would not be out of place if through you, sir, we extend to Senator Linehan how happy we feel at the good news he has received of the safety of his son.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Seanad hereby approves of the Gárda Síochána Pensions Order, 1930, made on the 30th day of June, 1930, by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, under Section <Col N="51" /> 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, and laid before the Seanad on the 19th day of November, 1930.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Order is very simple and uncontroversial. I think its meaning would be apparent to anyone who read it.  But as I have seen from the official report of the debate that took place in the Seanad last week, that some explanation has been asked for, I will say a word or two with regard to the points that the Order deals with.  The main object of the Order is to make provision for the cases of a few members of the force who resigned or were dismissed from the Dublin Metropolitan Police, solely because of their national sympathies, and who subsequently joined the Gárda Síochána.  It is proposed to treat these cases as regards the reckoning of previous service for pensions in the same manner as the men who were reinstated in the Dublin Metropolitan Police, and whose cases were governed by Section 3 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act of 1923.  The Order also includes a provision removing certain ambiguities in the definition in the existing Orders of the term &ldquo;annual pay&rdquo; in its application to certain types of cases.  This will involve no change in existing practice. A further provision is included for dealing with the case of a pensioner who is unable by reason of mental disability to manage his affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad approves of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between Saorstát Eireann and Portugal, signed at Dublin on the 29th day of October, 1929, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Seanad on the 20th day of November, 1929, and recommends the Executive Council to take the necessary steps to ratify the said Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion, I think, is also non-controversial, <Col N="52" /> the main purpose being to secure reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment between the two countries. However, I suppose the Seanad, or some members, will desire a little more detailed explanation, and I will endeavour to supply it.  The commercial relations between the Saorstát and Portugal have hitherto been governed by the provisions of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Portugal signed at Lisbon on 12th August, 1914.  This Treaty was denounced by the Government of the Saorstát on 12th October, 1927, and the denunciation took effect as from 12th October, 1928.  The Treaty has, however, been kept in force in the meantime by means of an exchange of notes, and it will be continued in force until the present Treaty is ratified. The present Treaty is based upon the principle of reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment, and hence it ensures that the shipping and commerce of the Saorstát will receive in Portugal the treatment accorded to the most favoured foreign country.  The Treaty consists of eight articles.  Articles 1 and 2 provide for the mutual accord of most-favoured-nation treatment to imported goods.  Article 3 reserves the position of the Saorstát in regard to preference accorded to any other member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Articles 4 and 5 relate respectively to the grant of most-favoured-nation treatment so far as concerns import prohibition and commercial travellers.</P>
    <P>In Article 6 the Government of the Saorstát &ldquo;engage to recommend to the Oireachtas any legislation that may be necessary in order to give effect to the provisions of this Article.&rdquo; A Bill has been already introduced in the Dáil in this connection, and has received a second reading.  The provisions of this Article deal with protection for the wine products of Portugal and Madeira entering and for sale in the Saorstát market, and guarantee to the consumer of these commodities the genuineness of port and Madeira wine.  Article 7 provides for the mutual accord of most-favoured-nation treatment to the mercantile marine of each of the contracting parties.  Article <Col N="53" /> 8 is a simple one, providing for the ratification of the Treaty and for the date of its coming into effect.  The Portuguese tariff prescribes maximum and minimum rates of duty, the former usually being two or three times greater than the latter.  Apart from the desirability of establishing commercial relations on an amicable basis between the Saorstát and foreign countries, this Treaty with Portugal is necessary in order to secure that Saorstát products entering that country are accorded the advantages of the minimum tariff and any other privileges obtainable under the most-favoured-nation treatment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion, but there are a couple of points, not of outstanding importance, but which may be worth mentioning.  There is a section in the Treaty which provides against the use of a trade term within this country in respect of wines which might be deemed to be a colourable imitation.  For instance, it is provided that Madeira character, or type, or quality, or anything of that kind should not be used in respect of Portuguese wines.  There is no reciprocal clause of that kind affecting Irish goods in Portugal.  Perhaps there are no such goods being sent to Portugal at present which would require that kind of protection.  But it occurs to me on reading this Treaty that if on reading this, having this line in regard to protection of goods against colourable imitations, false descriptions or deceitful descriptions, it might be useful for the Minister to follow that up in countries where many goods from this country are sold.  I am thinking, for instance, of Irish-cured bacon.  We have complaints even in this country at present of &ldquo;Irish-cured&rdquo; in respect of bacon that is merely cured here. There are many other commodities of the kind produced in this country, and have certain characteristics, imitations of which are sold in England with misleading descriptions.  Perhaps the Minister will follow the example in this Treaty and seek protection against colourable imitations of the same kind in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another feature of this <Col N="54" /> Treaty to which I would like to draw attention which, again, may not be of supreme importance, but may be indicative of a state of mind.  It is provided in Article 2 that for the application of this most-favoured-nation treatment the Irish Free State may not invoke the agreements that Portugal may enter into with Spain or Brazil. That particular provision is embodied in Article 2, which deals with other matters.  This is a kind of tail-end covering Portuguese trade with Spain and Brazil.  A reciprocate Article respecting similar exceptions in the British Commonwealth is given the honour of a special clause.  I wonder what is the state of mind that leads to that change in form?  There is all the appearance, of course, of real reciprocity, but the fact that this special clause is inserted in respect to the British Commonwealth preference suggests that we have not got away from the notion that we are economically united with all the rest of the States of the British Commonwealth.  There is something very exceptional when we are dealing with the British Commonwealth States in contrast with Portuguese treatment of Spain and Brazil. It is not an important point, but, as I said, it may indicate a state of mind and an attitude towards non-Irish communities or States which we ought to be getting away from, and I think the form might have been altered so that reciprocity should be shown even in the phraseology of the Treaty. With that comment, I support the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have it examined in all its ramifications.  Does it mean that the minimum tariff on any article must be given to the Free State, or are they at liberty to interpret the phrase &ldquo;most-favoured-nation treatment&rdquo; as they like?  That is the only point I would like the Minister to explain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am incapable of explaining it, because as a matter of fact it is one of the points <Col N="55" /> about which great endeavours have been made recently to get international agreement.  It is clear that it does not mean that the minimum tariff must, in all cases, be given to goods of the Free State because, as has been indicated by Senator Johnson, it is specifically provided that Brazilian or Spanish goods might be given less.  The broad and general meaning is that goods should be given the minimum tariffs and best treatment, but there have been growing up in these most-favoured-nation Treaties a great number of exceptions which have tended to obscure the original clarity of the meaning of the phrase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not this Treaty before me, but when I read it it seemed to me there was one thing in it which rather indicated that we have only a very elementary knowledge of geography.  I refer to the description of what is called the Island of Madeira.  I think the Madeiras are a group of islands, and in order to show that we really know something about geography that correction should be made.  There is one good point about this Treaty.  I understand under the Treaty it will not be possible any longer to sell prune wine or logwood or other things as port.  For that reason I think this motion ought to be accepted and that the Treaty ought to be ratified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point about the Treaty I would like to have inquired into.  When I was in Portugal two years ago, I understood from the shipping in the river that harbour dues had to be paid in gold, and that the docks, which are very extensive, were filled with the goods of Lisbon merchants who were unable to redeem them, such were the tariffs against other goods.  It occurs to me that this most-favoured-nation treatment might be used by some shipping clearing from the port of Dublin to obtain a reduction of these harbour dues or permission not to pay them in gold by pretending that they were of Irish harbour origin.  I think we have only one small mercantile marine left, and it would be a pitiful thing if, for instance, the British and Irish could obtain <Col N="56" /> a reduction of harbour dues in Lisbon by proving that they were an Irish company or were likely to give any benefit to this country through a reduction of those dues.  I would like the benefits to be reciprocal and not to have the benefit taken by other lines of shipping on account of their clearing from an Irish port.  An inquiry into what perhaps would be a fair comparison with other nations would be very beneficial before we decide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister if this is the first country that has given us most-favoured-nation treatment.  I thought it was included in other Treaties we made.  I would like to discover a Treaty between any two nations that does not say so.  I am afraid Senator Gogarty's hopes as to non-payment in gold will not materialise, for I feel certain Britain has a similar Treaty. Senator Johnson is worried about the Commonwealth, and thinks that the different nations should be enumerated one by one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that was so. There was a point with regard to trade terms which is one I think we could not go into without intimate knowledge, because there are some terms so long in use in the trade that they have a special technical meaning, and you cannot get away from that.  Quite recently I heard of an English gentleman who proposed to open a factory here for the purpose of finishing tweeds with a London finish in Dublin.</P>

    <Title>Public Business. - Position of the Flour Milling Industry.</Title>
    <P>Debate on the following motion resumed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That in the opinion of the Seanad the position of the flour-milling industry is one calling for the immediate action of the Executive, and that control of wheat and flour imports is an immediate necessity.&rdquo; (Mr. Connolly.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator, in moving his motion, gave a number of figures. I have been able to check those figures to some extent, but they left me with <Col N="57" /> doubt as to their fullness, and I am unable, from the statistics that are available, to come to the conclusion that the Senator has come to regarding the importance of the figures he has given. They are important, and they are important as affecting the milling trade in Limerick, but they ought to be supplemented by further information.  I feel that the information that is available will hardly bear the full weight of the argument that the Senator has placed upon it.  I think it is widely known that there is a good deal of variation in the quantities of wheat and flour that are imported from year to year.  An examination of the figures since 1924 of imports into the Free State will show that there have been variations, ups and downs, and that the 1930 figures&mdash;the figures for the nine months&mdash;while they undoubtedly show a serious change for the worse as compared with other years, do not bear quite the same construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you are looking on this matter with a certain amount of detachment and judicial consideration we have to take not one year but a series of years.  For instance, for the nine months of 1930 the imports of flour show an increase over 1929 of 7½ per cent. but they are only a very small proportion over 1928, and for seven years, 1924 inclusive, the figures vary somewhat, but they vary up and down, and one cannot judge the whole case on the figure for one year as compared with the previous year.  It is interesting, too, to take into account the ratio of flour to wheat imports.  There again we find that there are some variations, but for 1930 while the ratio of flour imports as compared with wheat, shows a considerable increase over 1929 it is not really alarming if we take the whole country.  There has been a fairly steady ratio of 40 to 60, 36 to 64 and so on from 1924 right to 1930 for the nine months period, so that we would require, if we were considering this from the point of view of the Free State as a whole, to have more information than appears at present available, and I would like the Minister to instruct that very complete figures, if possible, should be published regarding imports of flour and <Col N="58" /> wheat respectively, into all the ports of entry in the Free State.  We would then be able to get an idea of the tendency in the respective ports of flour and wheat imports.</P>
    <P>But I think Senator Connolly was well justified in directing special attention to the case of Limerick because, as I have said, there was an increase in the imports of flour of 7½ per cent. for the nine months over the previous year, taking all the ports of the Free State into account.  There was an increase in Limerick over 41 weeks of 48 per cent.  So that we have, taking all ports together, an increase of flour imports of 7½ per cent. while for Limerick port there is an increase of flour imports of 48 per cent.  That seems to coincide with the new management and ownership of the Limerick mills and, undoubtedly, it would require to receive some consideration. Here, of course, we have to take into account Limerick particularly, perhaps because it is a big milling centre and not only concerned with Limerick.  Limerick is in the peculiar position that its mills have undergone a change of ownership, and presumably they are changed in direction and in policy.</P>
    <P>Senator Connolly drew attention to a feature of the recent policy, which was a change in the grade of flour which is milled in the Limerick mill. It appears, and I think the statement made by the Senator can be borne out by evidence that is available in Limerick, that the mill which has been making what is known as baker's flour is no longer used for that purpose, and that the whole of the flour being milled in the Limerick mills of Messrs.  Ranks, are at present and henceforth to be known as household flour.  But, as he pointed out, the old brands of Limerick milled flour for household purposes are being abandoned and a new brand for Irish-milled flours is being used.  That brand is identical with the name used in Liverpool and Birkenhead milled flour.  That brand apparently is being imported into this country from Birkenhead, and considerable quantities have gone into competition with the Limerick milled flour. Henceforward the &ldquo;Millocrat&rdquo; brand <Col N="59" /> may be milled in Birkenhead or it may be milled in Limerick.  It does not matter where it is milled.  It is going to be sold under the one name, &ldquo;Millocrat.&rdquo; This may be justifiable. I take it we have no particular reason to consider a particular name of flour or any other article which may be sold by merchants in this country, but a feature of this change that has to be taken into account is that the new ownership is part of a great international organisation and the Minister has, in another connection, drawn special attention to the changes that have taken place in Europe and throughout the world in regard to economic organisation, the organisations in particular industries in one country aligning themselves with industries in other countries.  A complete change in the commercial outlook of these industries is being undergone. That is true in regard to flour milling, at least so far as this country and Great Britain are concerned. We know that Messrs. Ranks who now own the Limerick mills of Messrs Bannatyne, are part of a big milling organisation in Great Britain, and this system of rationalising the milling industry is for the benefit, protection and assistance of the industry as established in Great Britain.  What seems to me to be significant and important is that the change in Limerick is part of the rationalising process, but it is the rationalising process of a British organisation and the Limerick mills and that firm appear to be fitting into the rationalising scheme of that British organisation.  If that process continues it may have very considerable reactions and detrimental reactions upon the milling industry of this country.  I think there ought to be rationalisation, better organisation, adjustment of means to end and a clear understanding of what the ends are for the milling industry in this country.  I think if we are going to look on and remain quiet and unmoved by the rationalising scheme which conceives of the Irish milling industry as part of the unit of the British milling industry, then we are running very grave risks indeed of <Col N="60" /> losing the milling industry as a whole. I would take it to be assumed that it is desirable that there should be retained within the country the plant and capacity for milling flour.  Much would depend upon the intensity of our desire that that should be retained.  If we take it as something of no supreme importance, then, of course, we are not going to trouble ourselves very much as to what happens, but if we take it as of great importance that there should be maintained within the country an efficient, active milling industry then I think it is necessary that there should be a watch and guard over the developments and the tendencies of those developments.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I am not quite sure that the tendencies are yet showing themselves sufficiently to justify us in coming to the conclusion that the new policy has already the end of destroying the Irish milling industry.  I do not think that is yet obvious but I think the tendency, as shown by Senator Connolly to fit in the Limerick mills of Messrs. Ranks into the British organisation, is a very dangerous tendency and one which ought to be guarded against.  I think that proposals which were propounded some months ago on behalf of and by the Irish milling industry ought to have sympathetic and favourable consideration, and that the plan adumbrated at that time, to organise the Irish mills into a single organisation, giving that organisation a practical monopoly of the main qualities of flour that are in ordinary use, should be given encouragement and brought to a successful accomplishment, because it is undoubtedly true that the mills at present existing in the Free State could, with comparatively small extension, supply the needs of this people in respect of the milling of flour.  It may be that under a rationalisation scheme which covers this country, but which has as its end the satisfaction of the British milling industry will, as a natural complement of their rationalisation process, at some point find it uneconomic to mill their wheat in this country.  In the course of the discussion some months ago it was pointed out that the capacity for milling <Col N="61" /> economically overseas-grown wheat was much greater on the banks of the Mersey than in existing mills in this country, with the possible exception of one, and it was inferred, apart from any handicap respecting the position of freight and so on, that it was desirable not to allow to be developed the milling of Irish demands for flour in that mill, where it could be done most economically, all pointing to the Mersey Mills.</P>
    <P>I think we ought not to allow the flour needs of this country to be dependent on the possible superiority of technical equipment of mills in another country.  There again I am assuming that it is thought desirable that we should keep within this country a flour-milling industry.  If we are agreed that it is necessary, I think we ought to be prepared to pay a price, whether in money value or in fancy, taste or fashion, for the maintaining of those mills in this country.</P>
    <P>I think the motion is justified.  I think there ought to be control of the proportions of flour and wheat that are imported, and that beyond that there should be a direct attempt, with the aid of the Government and the legislature, to bring the flour-milling industry into a national organisation, with the clear and definite object of supplying the flour needs of the people of this country, to be run with what ever checks and controls are necessary. I believe that the cost to the consumer in this country would be very trifling, indeed, if anything, but even if some trifling addition to the cost, some trifling sacrifice in taste or fancy was required, the price ought to be paid, and the milling industry in this country ought to be secured for this country.</P>

      <P>Senator Connolly, when he introduced this motion a week ago, appealed to the Seanad not to look on it as a political matter.  He asked every member of the Seanad to discuss it purely from the point of view of how far his suggestion would help this country. Senator Connolly dealt with the question of English milling.  I am not going to touch on that, as I know nothing <Col N="62" /> about it.  I am going to confine my remarks to the general subject.  I would like to see all the manufacturing possible done in Ireland, but it has always been the habit of certain people, both in Ireland and England, to mill their own wheat.  I was for many years in the great wheat belts of America, and I can bear testimony to this, that a vast quantity of third-grade flour, known as baker's flour, for which there was little or no demand in the States, was dumped into England and also into Ireland.  You will remember that when Mr. Chamberlain took up his tariff reform campaign in England, that was one of the things that was pointed out.  The English mills in these days were in a very bad way, while low-grade flour was being dumped in from America at a price less than the cost of milling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connolly tells us that the same thing is going on in Ireland today. I suppose it is.  It always has gone on, and it is very probable that it is being dumped in here from England. The question is&mdash;how can you stop it?  I have always taken the view that a tax on that sort of flour which was being dumped on the country or a tariff&mdash;whatever you like to call it&mdash; would assist milling in Ireland.  It would not keep the flour out, and if it did not, it would not assist the millers. But if it did not do that it would be a gain for the revenue.  You cannot have it both ways.  It seems to me that if ever there was a thing which ought to be referred to the Tariff Commission this is one of them.  I have always held the view that a small farm in Ireland should be self-supporting.  It would be folly to suggest that we should raise wheat in Ireland with a view to supplying the mills.  It is impossible, but we can let wheat come in free from America, with some protection to the Irish millers to put them in a position that they could use the small quantities of wheat which would be brought to them by the Irish farmers.  I think everybody knows that the small farmers in Ireland are inclined to grow an acre or two of wheat, that they can send to the mills and get in exchange flour or flour products.  I know one place, not twenty miles from <Col N="63" /> Dublin, where I was last year.  I noticed in a house that they were using bread made from their home-milled wheat.  I do not say that it was very good, but they grew the wheat themselves and had it milled.  I would like to see as much of that as possible. It seems inherent in the people to do that thing, especially on the small farms.  I suggest that steps could be taken which would increase milling in Ireland and give encouragement to small farmers to produce such wheat as they want for their own requirements. Some regulation might be introduced that would compel mills to take this wheat in exchange for flour. It is a thing that we would all like to see.  If Senator Connolly changed the wording of his motion, he might make it such that everyone could vote for it and we could have the matter referred to the Tariff Commission.  I think everybody in the Seanad would agree to that.</P>
    <P>I think it is clearly a matter in which we would like to do something, as it is a question that is stirring the people very much at the present time.  It is also causing great thought in England. I think if this subject were ventilated before the Tariff Commission they might provide procedure by puting a tariff on imported bakers' flour. I cannot see what benefit it is for us to have this flour dumped into the country in competition with our own.  A tariff might be arranged that would give some assistance to the millers and at the same time would be of some benefit to the Treasury.  I would suggest that instead of Senator Connolly's motion you have a motion such as this: &ldquo;That we recommend to the Tariff Commission to consider whether an import duty should be imposed on certain grades of flours entering the Free State.  What steps, if any, should be taken to encourage farmers in the Free State to grow wheat for their own requirements by providing them with a market in which they could sell or exchange home-grown wheat for flour and other wheat products on a fair exchange basis?&rdquo;  In the way in which Senator Connolly's motion is worded, I would not vote for it; but if it were worded in another way I would.</P>

      <P>As a Limerick man, I should like to congratulate Senator Connolly on the great skill which he showed in making out the case for his motion.  I should also like to congratulate the seconder of the motion on the biblical knowledge which he displayed and the apt way in which he applied a certain text.  I am sure he knows his Shakespeare just as well and that he would not dissent from Antonio when he said that &ldquo;the devil can cite scripture for his own purpose.&rdquo; While congratulating the proposer of this motion, I could not help noticing that he is a most skilful special pleader. He skated over thin ice, some of it very thin, with great dexterity. I quite agree with Senator Johnson that he has not made out a case that it is the intention of the people who have acquired control&mdash;I do not say altogether&mdash;of the milling and wheat importing industry in Limerick, to shut down that industry altogether.  I do not question the figures he cited as regards the amount of wheat that was imported into Limerick, but I can say from the published statistics that until quite lately Limerick was the second port in Ireland for the importation of wheat. That importation has to a certain extent fallen off.  I know that the men who were employed by Messrs. Bannatyne and Russell were employed in connection with the carting and storage of wheat as well as the milling, and when the Senator pointed out that there had been a decrease of, I think, 40 men, he by no means made it clear to me that the 40 men had gone out of employment because of the reduction in the quantity of flour produced in Limerick.  I think, from what I know of the way in which work was carried on there, it is quite possible that those 40 men had gone out in connection with the importation and distribution of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From Limerick a great many of the smaller mills were supplied.  Senator Comyn told us of the mills at Kilrush, Ennis, Askeaton, Bruree, Ballylongford, Croom, Killaloe, and a number of other places.  No doubt the requirements of these mills, for the purpose of grinding corn, have fallen off.  Why? <Col N="65" /> Because these mills were very small mills.  Their output could not afford the cost involved in installing expensive and up-to-date machinery.  We know that, in these days of feverish competition, nobody can hope to retain a market if they do not go in for the very latest developments as regards machinery that will enable them to turn out their goods at the lowest possible price.  The Senator most adroitly started an artificial hare.  He chased him down with great skill, and just at the moment when we were hoping that he would come to conclusions with him the hare popped into a hole and we heard no more of him.  I believe that is the manner in which hares are disposed of on the dog-racing tracks.  The Senator called this hare Messrs. Rank.</P>
    <P>Now, I hold no brief for Messrs. Rank.  I never met any of the members of that firm, and I have had no communications directly or indirectly, from them, but I agree with Senator Johnson that Senator Connolly has not proved his case: that Messrs. Rank are out to destroy the milling industry in Limerick.  Senator Johnson very properly said that Messrs. Rank are the members of a firm largely identified with a very powerful association of millers in England, with command of practically unlimited capital at their disposal.  I believe that is so, and, from what I have heard of them, their character is that they are very competent, up-to-date, and experienced people.  I cannot imagine people like them expending the very large sum of money that they had to expend to acquire control of the business of Messrs. Russell and Bannatyne in Limerick with the object of closing it down.  The Senator laughs, but he failed to tell us that after Messrs. Rank got control of these places they probably found that the sites of the mills were not in the most advantageous position for executing work in the cheapest way.</P>

      <P>Beside the docks at Limerick would be a better place. Messrs. Rank applied to the Limerick Harbour Board&mdash;mind you, we were not told a word about this&mdash;for a lease for a site adjoining the docks where <Col N="66" /> the corn could be put, as it is in Liverpool, direct from the ships into a modern, fully-equipped and up-to-date mill.  The Harbour Board agreed to grant the lease, but now we come to the curious part of that transaction.  No sooner had the Harbour Board agreed to grant that lease than members of a certain party, a certain organisation in Limerick, handed in a notice of motion to rescind the proposal relating to the grant of the lease.  That looks to me rather suspicious.  In the first place, I cannot imagine Messrs. Rank coming in and spending a large sum of money to acquire this business, then coming forward and offering to expend an extremely large sum of money in erecting an up-to-date, fully-equipped and thoroughly good mill, and then closing the whole thing down.  I agree with Senator Johnson that the case has not been proved of their doing so.  In these days of feverish development no one can hope to keep his trade or secure fresh business without expending money and going in for the very latest developments.  I am not in their confidence and I do not know, but it looks to me as if the idea which Senator Johnson threw out was in their minds when they came to Limerick to acquire an interest in this business and made their proposal.  They found that Limerick was most favourably situated. It was in direct communication with the Atlantic, in the position where sea-going ships could come in, and where the corn could be unloaded at least as cheaply as it is in Liverpool. They asked for a site to erect a mill where the corn could be put into the mill for grinding at least as cheaply as it can be done in Liverpool.  Why we should fail to take notice of these facts and suppose that they have some ulterior motive in their minds in coming in&mdash;to kill, for instance, the milling industry in Ireland&mdash;is more than I can understand.  I have no faith in the modern Canutes who propose to prevent the tide of progress reaching the shores of this island.  I know that attempts were made on many occasions to prevent that, and if the House will permit me I can give some examples from my own experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I commenced my studies for <Col N="67" /> the engineering profession I was given a number of old documents and old specifications.  I found that in each of them, wherever brick work was alluded to, it was specified that well-burnt Limerick brick was to be used. The whole of the new portion of the city of Limerick was constructed with that brick.  It has stood the test of time admirably, and when I was a boy the Limerick brick works afforded a tremendous amount of employment. There was a whole fleet of barges in the river carrying these bricks to various places.  There was a special quay set apart for the sale of the bricks known as the Brick Quay. Suddenly some of those evil disposed and badly minded inventors came along, and invented a machine which enabled one man to do the work hitherto done by four, and in addition enabled a better article to be turned out.</P>
    <P>The people who owned this old established business&mdash;I may say for the information of some Senators around me that they were not of the type generally alluded to with a certain amount of scorn as capitalists but were working men who had acquired a certain amount of capital which enabled them to carry on the business&mdash;saw that they could not hope to keep their markets if they did not instal this machinery.  They got the machinery and put it up, but some of these Canutes came along and said that they would not have it.  They refused to work the machinery and smashed it.  The result is that the barges have long since disappeared and the men have gone.  I do not know what has become of the employees, but I do know the entire business has vanished.  I am anxious to show the futility of these attempts to stop progress.  Another instance occurred in Dublin. When taxis had been tried in Paris and London and found a success somebody proposed that they should be introduced into Dublin, but the jarveys combined together, unwisely I think, and got a regulation passed by the old Corporation refusing to licence anybody to run a taxi.  But that regulation has now <Col N="68" /> gone and the taxis are here, and though I am glad to say that the jarveys have not entirely disappeared, they are rapidly going the way of the stage coach and the knights in armour, of the long-bow men in their green jerkins, to join the ghosts of a long past and most picturesque but inefficient age.  I believe that interference with the milling industry, such as is suggested by this motion, would have the same effect, and I feel with Senator Sir Walter Nugent that I cannot support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give my views on the matter of tariffs, and to be excused if I again bring forward the same reasons as I expressed on former occasions in the House.  I am an advocate of protection, and think that the judicious application of tariffs to our most distressed industries would be for the good of the country.  In the case of our milling industries, I would put a tariff on all manufactured products of such coming into the country. I would put a tariff on flour.  I say this with the firm conviction of my life's experience.  I can speak of times back to my young days, and of the prosperity associated with the mills that once flourished along the valley of the Brosna, a few miles beyond Roscrea. I remember some sixty years ago that there were eight mills on the Brosna, and all were hives of industry, giving much employment to all the people in the neighbourhood.  Also, the district was noted as the best pig feeding and calf-rearing one in Ireland. This was on account of the abundance of good feeding to be had at a cheap price from the by-products of these mills; namely, pollard, cracked oats, bran, and barley meal.  I saw these mills in their heyday, and I am sorry to say that I have seen with misgivings their decline.  I may tell the House that none of them is left with the exception of the one carried on by the labours of the Monks at Mount St. Joseph's Abbey.  The only other one is a malt house.  The others are derelict, not habitable for even a mouse. I feel that this decline is due to the action of the English Government in their adherence to a free trade policy, with a total disregard for the future <Col N="69" /> well-being of these mills.  It was found that flour was sent to Roscrea to undersell the native-worked mills, and, as time went on, these millers were broken in their endeavours to carry on their trade.  These are the facts I wish to reiterate.</P>
      <P>I am not in agreement with those who wish for a tariff on oats, wheat, maize, and barley coming into the country.  I wish to give my reasons for this.  We must realise that we are up against world competition, and we cannot be sheltered behind tariff walls in the matter of our agricultural products. We must only face the issue and modify our policy to meet the changed conditions.  It is my considered opinion that the growing of cereal crops must be rearranged and balanced more uniformly throughout the country, so that all these crops may be fed to the live stock on the farms.  The feeding of live stock with the surplus grain is the best solution of the present depression in the grain-growing industry.  I can promise that where farmers turn to the better feeding and breeding of their live stock good results will follow their efforts.  Farms that grow little, or a negligible amount of corn, should use their own labour and grow a few acres more corn.  Then they will be in a position of feeding a cow and a sow more in the year, and have some ewes and lambs.  This will not entail any more risk than necessary, and the farmer will be the better off by having cattle to sell as a good store at an assured good price, and he will be able to rear pigs and lambs while, with luck and attention, he will have something which will grow into money.  I think that the future prices of store cattle will give farmers an opportunity of encouragement to follow the lines of my arguments.  It would be to the advantage of all farmers that they would be able to feed their live stock cheaper and continue to cater for the needs of our best customers, and the cattle trade will carry on without need for protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my opinion that tariffs must be applied judiciously, without fear of any possibility of the rate of living jumping up.  In the case that I mentioned, even if the price of the worker's loaf <Col N="70" /> was raised, it would be better to have more money in his pocket to pay for it.</P>
    <P>I have seen the history of England for over 60 years.  At the period I mention, say 70 years ago, the trade of England was booming.  It was a fact that iron and cattle prices ruled high together.  It meant that when the iron foundries were in full swing the trade of England for beef and mutton was in good demand.  The Colonies were only in the infant stage and were customers of England, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the Argentine.  There was no unemployment in those days.  Now for some years all these countries are producers and are sending all classes of manufactured goods, including beef and mutton, to England, and underselling English manufactured goods. They are able to do that with the aid of labour saving machinery and mass production.  Therefore, it is not surprising that unemployment is increasing daily.  I can see the great change that is taking place in the minds of England's statesmen rulers. Mr. Winston Churchill, in a speech delivered at a Unionist demonstration in Dumbartonshire, and reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> on the 8th September, said, towards the end of it that Mr. Snowden's Budget would end in a deficit.  The limits of direct taxation had been reached and there was a measure of common agreement in all parties that a tariff for revenue upon foreign imported manufactured goods was bound to come.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to see the Minister here for this debate, for in my opinion he is playing an unusual role.  In the case of the milling industry he reminds me of a certain character in Dickens. I want to tell him that while he is waiting for something to turn up, something sudden, something of a drastic nature, that such a thing is not likely to happen.  Those of us who are in touch and know what is going on in the mills realise that the milling trade of this country is being steadily strangled.  The position of the flour mills to-day as compared with it years ago is deplorable.  Some of our best and most up-to-date mills <Col N="71" /> are working about half time.  We have a Senator here telling us that he has no interest in Ranks or anybody else, and he goes on to say that Ranks are anxious to build a mill in Limerick.  I want to tell him that a mill is being built in Belfast and a dummy is being built in Limerick, and the people in Limerick have introduced a new Harbour Bill for this dummy mill while an up-to-date mill of enormous capacity is being erected in Belfast.  The Senator said that no syndicate acquired an industry for the purpose of closing it down.</P>

      <P>What Messrs. Ranks have asked for in Limerick is a site for a store&mdash;that statement is made on the authority of the Mayor of Limerick, whom we can accept as an honest and truthful person.  Now we see the mills closing down, and the best and most modern of them are running at half time.  We see this huge milling syndicate cutting out the local brand of flour and substituting their own particular brand in the country.  We have now to take Limerick as the centre of gravity for the flour milling trade.  Since the new management have taken over the biggest mills in Limerick drastic changes have been introduced, and we see boy labour introduced under the new operations, while forty men have been displaced since the new ownership. We see these boys getting no opportunity of promotion when they are put into jobs ordinarily performed by men.  We who have an interest in this matter see that it is quite possible this syndicate is irritating the workers of the mills in Limerick in order that they might force them into a stoppage of work or a strike to give them the opportunity of closing down the mills in Limerick.  We know that there is a good deal of friction and irritation going on, and the men must endure the existing conditions in the hope that <Col N="72" /> there will be Government intervention to prevent the closing down of industry in Limerick.</P>
      <P>The facts have been brought to the notice of the Minister, or his Department, and we see that he is not prepared to do anything in the matter. As to the question of tariffs with regard to this industry, speaking for myself I would not be in favour of putting a tariff on imported flour.  Once we have this huge British syndicate, with England over-milled and a surplus across the water, if we put a tariff on foreign flour they can close their mills here and still send in flour and make people pay for any tariff that may be put on.  That is one reason why I am not in favour of tariffs. Another and more important reason is that taxing the food of the people is a very serious matter.  I do not go the length of suggesting that for the sake of the employment of 4,000 or 5,000 people in the flour milling industry a tax ought not to be put on.  Even a minimum tax on imported flour would mean a tremendous revenue for the State from imports.  I urge the Minister to grapple with this question with the same energy he has shown in connection with other matters.  We realise that if things are allowed to drift the flour milling industry will be eventually <i>non est</i> in this country, and the production of flour for the people will be in the hands of the foreigner.  That is not desirable in the interests of the country in general.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House is: &ldquo;That in the opinion of the Seanad the position of the flour-milling industry is one calling for the immediate action of the Executive, and that control of wheat and flour imports is an immediate necessity.&rdquo;  That has been put up on the basis of certain statistics given by Senator Connolly and not denied, if not very carefully endorsed, by Senator Comyn.  Two or three Senators have spoken of the skill with which these statistics have been prepared, but two or three other Senators in my hearing have said that the statistics did not prove the case.  Two contentions have been made.  The first is that a deliberate attempt has been made by an English concern to wipe <Col N="73" /> out the flour-milling industry in this country, and, secondly, that something described as subtle and sinister is happening with regard to flour sold in sacks and bearing certain marks. However skilfully the statistics may have been used, I hope at any rate that there will be no question of any Senator voting for the motion if, as I suggest in fact, a proper view of the milling situation at Limerick shows, first, that in the six months up to the beginning of October of this year the actual output of flour from the Limerick mills was greater than in the six months of the preceding year.  That is the fact.  Secondly, if, admitting that bakers' flour has decreased in production in Limerick, it can be shown that the extra increase in the production of retail flour has more than balanced the decrease in the production of bakers' flour, that gives the Seanad the same conclusion as my first point.  Thirdly, if with regard to the men alleged to have been dismissed from employment it can be shown that no man has been dismissed from productive milling, whatever men may have been dismissed from the transport side of the work required in connection with milling, and that the actual hours worked by the producing staff are greater up to 1st October this year than they were up to 1st October last year are a fact, then Senator Connolly's statistics, no matter how skilfully and carefully used they are, are rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the facts from figures that I have been able to ascertain, from figures that I have taken the trouble to get and on which I put certain checks.  I wonder where did Senator Connolly get the figures that he has given us as regards Messrs. Rank.  He has not stated that.  The Senator did state that the figures had been discussed at a public meeting to which the flour millers were invited and had not been challenged or denied.  I deny them.  The other leg upon which the arguments rest is the statistics dealing with the import of wheat and flour. Senator Johnson has already dealt with that.  I had intended to go in some detail into that, but the main case against what Senator Connolly said has been put by Senator Johnson: that during a period of years the <Col N="74" /> amount imported either of wheat or flour varies, because there is forward buying, and because the condition of the market operates to prevent a man holding any great quantity of stocks. On that point, I have consulted the Irish Flour Millers' Association asking what is the situation with regard to the demand for flour.  Their reply was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The demand for flour has been rather slack for the past two months, owing to those in the trade buying from hand to mouth in view of the serious decline which has been taking place in values, buyers endeavouring to have as little stock on hand as possible.</P>
    <P>That is the peculiar situation this year: that owing to falling prices buyers like to have as little on hands as possible. Even with these conditions, what Senator Johnson has said is true: that the imports of wheat and flour for the year 1930, taking the average for the nine months and calculating on the basis that the figures for the last quarter would be much the same as those for the previous nine months, show very little change one way or the other from the average for the preceding five years, or from the average for the preceding four years, leaving out this year about which allegations are being made.  I think Senator Johnson's argument meets that.  My case is that there is no necessity for any interference&mdash;though there is still being a watch kept on the whole situation&mdash;by reason of anything that Senator Connolly has brought forward, because none of his figures can stand any examination.</P>
    <P>I will take some of the Senator's statements.  The Senator first of all referred to a statement of mine in a previous debate where I did put the question: &ldquo;Is it that there should be preserved in this country flour-milling irrespective of what the product is going to cost?&rdquo;  The Senator said that that question had been answered by a member of my own Party, who said that certain flour millers in England made a loss last year of £350,000.  I do not know what that has to do with the question that I asked.  My question had relation to the cost to the <Col N="75" /> consumer and not to the producer.  I was arguing that though I would like to preserve the milling industry, I was not going to preserve the present group of milling industrialists if they could not produce an essential foodstuff at an economic rate.  The Senator alluded to my remarks with regard to a scheme to be promoted between Irish millers and the Millers' Mutual Association in England, about which I passed the remark that I was going to watch that carefully.  Senator Connolly skipped over that by saying: &ldquo;I am not in a position to say whether there is any concerted scheme operating between the Irish millers and the Millers' Mutual Association in England,&rdquo; and he went on to say that he wished to bring forward certain particulars of what is happening, and what has happened since the 10th April, as evidence, he says, that our worst fears were to some extent justified, and the worst fears of Senator Connolly were that the flour-milling industry in this country was going to be crushed out. The Senator also talked about protecting our milling industry from further encroachments on the part of the British flour ring.  In so far as his statement relates to any schemes between the Irish millers and the Millers' Mutual of England, I will deal with that later.  The main burthen of the Senator's complaint was that there was going to be no flour-milling industry here after a bit, and that the flour-milling industry was going to be crushed out.  He went on to say that eventually we would waken up and find ourselves with all the mills closed.</P>
    <P>That is based on what are alleged to be facts, and the alleged facts are these, that &ldquo;in Limerick normal employment was given in the flour mills to between 400 and 500 hands, while the annual wages bill amounted to about £75,000 a year.  That was a normal thing before Messrs. Joseph Rank took a hand in the game.&rdquo;  The Senator went on to say that the total valuation on the two mills in Limerick was £2,971, and that they contributed to the rates of Limerick £3,639 odd for the current year.  He said that was a factor that should not be lost sight of. If that was introduced into the debate <Col N="76" /> for any purpose it was to show how badly the rates in Limerick are going to be hit if the two mills disappear.</P>
    <P>Later we were told by the Senator that the activities of these mills were responsible for half the total revenue of the port of Limerick, and that half the revenue amounted to £24,000 per annum.  Then we were told how much the elimination of £24,000 per annum must mean to the Limerick harbour authorities.  That is to say, that the elimination of the wheat imports was alleged to be responsible for £24,000 a year, and £24,000 was alleged to be half the revenue of the Limerick harbour authorities.  I wonder where did Senator Connolly get the figure of £24,000 as being half the revenue of the Limerick Harbour Board, because in the report to which he refers the entire revenue of the port for the year 1928, leaving out exceptional money spent in connection with the Shannon scheme, was £24,000.  The Senator looked for the disappearance of £75,000 annually in wages, and to Limerick being deprived of a contribution of £3,639 towards the rates of the city, and the elimination, as he said himself, of the entire import of wheat, leaving altogether out of consideration what would happen to the revenue of the harbour if that revenue from the import of wheat was substituted by an equivalent revenue from flour.  The suspicion that the Senator sought to create in the minds of Senators was that something was going to happen that would lead to the elimination of milling in this country.  That, I think, is a fair statement of the Senator's case.  Since Messrs. Rank took over in Limerick the Senator says &ldquo;Forty men have been let go.  I do not know whether that number has been increased since the date that I am dealing with, namely, the 4th November.&rdquo; The Senator went on to say that: &ldquo;We all know, taking flour milling on a per capita production, that owing to the development of modern machinery forty men is a very substantial number of skilled operatives to be working in flour mills and that their productive capacity is very high.&rdquo;  Has the Senator given the Seanad any information as to where the forty men <Col N="77" /> disappeared from?  Did they disappear from productive milling?  Taking flour milling on a per capita production, the disappearance of forty men would mean a terrific decrease in the amount of flour manufactured in Limerick.  The Senator assumes that all these men disappeared from the productive side of milling.  That is not a fact.  Practically all the men who have disappeared have disappeared from the transport or the clerical side.</P>

He said: &ldquo;Before Messrs. Ranks took over control, 12,160 bags of bakers' flour were milled per month, and 53,312 bags of retail or household flour were milled per month. Since Messrs. Ranks took over, no bakers' flour has been manufactured.&rdquo; That is wrong.  Bakers' flour is still being manufactured.</P>

      <P>In very small quantity in the two mills owned by Ranks. The Senator went on to say: &ldquo;In other words, there has been the elimination of 12,160 bags of bakers' flour per month since Messrs. Ranks took over.&rdquo; I deny that.  And later he said: &ldquo;While in addition the 53,312 bags of retail or household flour have been reduced to 44,928 bags per month.  That means a total reduction in bags of flour per month of 20,544.&rdquo;  The reduction that is alleged there is about thirty per cent., while the fact is that the output of the mills in Limerick has increased in the months up to the 1st October, which are the latest for which I have got figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What are these founded upon?  Is it on a calculation as to the number of bags of flour that emerge from the mills?  When the Senator thinks fit to delve into the business of a company in this country he should give more precisely than he has done the method by which he arrives at that calculation.  I have before me figures which show a larger output in Rank's mills in Limerick in the months up to the 1st October than was the case in the corresponding period last year.  I have the additional check on it that a greater number of hours have been worked in these mills in that period than in the corresponding period last year.  I have calculations also with regard to the people who have been dismissed, and these show that practically nobody has been dismissed on the productive side. The Senator said that he got his figures from the public reports in Limerick. I take it we will hear from the Senator afterwards where he did get them. The real point in the argument is whether or not the output in Rank's mills in Limerick has increased or decreased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point that I wish to deal with is the calculation which the Senator made, based on a comparison between the import of wheat and flour this year and last year.  As Senator Johnson has pointed out, these things vary from year to year, and no calculation can be founded upon figures which show such a variation, as the Senator well knows.  The Senator asked what do we find when we turn to the report dealing with imports for the nine months, January to September? The report, he says, is available to all Senators.  &ldquo;It has been posted to all members of the Oireachtas, and Senators can examine the figures for themselves.&rdquo; Equally Senators have the reports for the years 1926, 1927, 1928, and 1929, from which they can make calculations, as well as for the year 1930.  The Senator just uses one figure which is suitable to his purpose&mdash;last year's figure.  In making an inquiry of this kind any scientific or observant man would have gone to the trouble to see if that was a unique year, or if <Col N="79" /> there was anything peculiar in the circumstances.  Nobody with an observant type of mind could have failed to realise that this was an exceptional year, with the price of wheat tumbling down.  The Senator was simply content to make a calculation on last year's figures as compared with this year's, instead of going back over a period of years.  Senator Johnson made his calculations in a more judicious way, and showed that there has been very little difference in the imports this year of wheat and flour as compared with the average over five years, including this year, or in the four years immediately preceding this year.  I think no argument demanding the control of wheat and flour imports as an immediate necessity could be based upon such figures.  There was one other point of which the Senator made a great deal.  That was with regard to &ldquo;Millocrat&rdquo; flour.  The statement made by the Senator was: &ldquo;Between the 4th April and the 18th October 96,000 bags of Limerick flour have been manufactured in Limerick and sold under the brand of &lsquo;Millocrat.&rsquo;  That is the subtle method that has been adopted of killing the popularity of the local brands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some other Senator said that the local brands were being withdrawn and that this was being substituted. Senator Connolly did not say that, but his words would lead one to believe that he meant that.  I wonder does he say it, because my information is that there has been no diminution in the supplies either of &ldquo;Sunrise&rdquo; or &ldquo;Eclipse&rdquo; flour.  The figures I have given show conclusively that there has been none.  With regard to &ldquo;Millocrat&rdquo; flour, as a Senator said, there can be very little objection taken to what Ranks does with regard to &ldquo;Millocrat,&rdquo; but I would take very serious objection if I thought that he was mixing brands and trying to pass them off on people who wanted either &ldquo;Sunrise&rdquo; or something else.  What is actually happening?  96,000 bags of what is called &ldquo;Millocrat&rdquo; flour, previously manufactured in Liverpool, are now being manufactured in Limerick.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am leaving that out for the present.  The position at the moment is that 96,000 bags of what is called &ldquo;Millocrat&rdquo; flour, which was previously manufactured in Liverpool, is now being manufactured in Limerick, and does the Senator want to prevent that?  If there is anything in the way of passing off certain brands fraudulently, that can be got after, but there is not even the allegation that that is being done.  As far as I can understand the situation it is this, that the same travellers are employed by Messrs. Ranks as were previously employed by Messrs Bannantyne, and these travellers are still pushing the sale of what used to be Bannatyne's flour, while Messrs. Ranks travellers are pushing the sale of Ranks own flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People say that when a person asks for &ldquo;Millocrat&rdquo; flour he should not be allowed to have it.  That is introducing a type of control that I cannot allow.  At present I am concerned to see the quantity of flour previously manufactured at Limerick does not fall below a certain datum line, and I have seen to that.  I do not think that on the Senator's statement, unsupported by any facts other than his own statement, one should ask for the control of wheat and flour imports on the basis of the argument that it is &ldquo;a sinister and subtle move,&rdquo; or, as I would call it, subtle and sinister nonsense.  It is a subtle and sinister move if the people have suspicious minds that Senator Barrington tried to argue against.  This man buys a mill here because of a business speculation into which he was brought.  It did not arise out of his survey of the Irish market, but it arose out of the fact that a family in Limerick went into the market with a certain property, and he bought it.  Why? Because in his opinion the differential <Col N="81" /> by way of freight charges enables a man to manufacture more cheaply in this country than he can manufacture in England.  That was the argument publicly used on which these people came into the country.  It is a useful argument to have used, because it means that immediately we find that they are not manufacturing as much flour in this country as previously there is something wrong and they can be brought to task for it.  Senator Barrington talked about the erection of another mill.  I know nothing about it, but a piece of land has been taken for a new silo.  There is a situation with regard to these people who come into this country.  They come here because they can manufacture flour here and sell it at the old price, and get at least as good a profit as they could if the flour was manufactured at Liverpool. All the circumstances around Limerick since they came in show that that argument must be still maintained by them, because they are still manufacturing as much flour as had been manufactured previously in Limerick, and at the present time no other mill in the country can say that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not have anything to do with that.  There is a certain social advantage possibly in scattering mills all over the country, but that should not be allowed to weigh in the efficient and cheap production of food. The Belfast mill was referred to.  I remember taking up this question before. The calculation that I have made shows that there was room in Belfast for a mill to supply the needs of Belfast and the adjoining country, and to leave a small export of the surplus. I know the area towards which it is intended to direct that exportable surplus.  It is not here.  At the moment it is not intended that it should come in here, but should it come we can deal with it.  The third point that requires to be dealt with is the one to which Senator Johnson referred, and which is rather aside from this motion.  That was the question of English millers and Irish millers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point over which Senator Connolly carefully passed, just making an allusion to it, was the question of further encroachment by the English ring, as he called it.  I spoke on this at great length in at least two debates. I said I hoped that the Irish flour-millers would not consider that the whole case with regard to the milling <Col N="83" /> industry was closed just because the Tariff Commission reported that in certain circumstances a tariff could not be put on.  I said that the Tariff Commission pointed out certain defects in the milling organisation of the country, and that if these people were serious about their business and wanted help I would give the promise of help, provided they proceeded to set their house in order, but that in such a thing as breadstuffs we were not going to allow people to exploit the people's necessities, that we were going to insist most rigidly and ruthlessly on as big a point of efficiency being reached in the mills here as could possibly be reached.  I said, once that point of view was understood, that if anything was required in the way of Government intervention, or the supply of credit, I would meet the millers and discuss these things with them.  In the early part of the summer I met two or three of the millers.  At one point, in answer to a remark of mine, my suspicions were aroused a little bit that I was not having the mind of the millers' organisation in the country put to me by the two or three representatives that came to me.  There were two or three alternative schemes discussed.  At that point I decided to interrupt my calculations and write to the organisation to know what was the view of the organisation with regard to these schemes: did they want Scheme A or B or not.  The answer I got was flat and decisive, that they preferred an amalgamation with the English Mutual Millers' Association. I said that when that was done I would have a survey made of it.  Since then I have written to them, and each time I got the reply that a rationalisation process is still being hammered out.  Recently I was told it would be through in a fortnight, and that full details would be sent to me.  When we get these details, then will be the time to get an investigation of them.  If we cannot get that information in the ordinary way, then we can have a sworn tribunal to extract the information, but I believe that we will get it in the ordinary way.  I do not believe that any information is being withheld. I think the negotiations that have <Col N="84" /> been conducted took more time than they thought.  When we see the scheme they propose we can take steps to guard against the quotas associated with Irish mills being sold to English manufacturers.  Then we will know whether these people are sheer downright business men or partly business men and partly patriots, and will be able to judge and take action accordingly.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir Walter Nugent referred to the question of dumping.  That question was before the Tariff Commission. The allegation was made that there was dumping, but the Commission reported that those who made the allegation had failed to sustain their point.  I have always said this, and the statement has been repeated by the Vice-President, and I think the President, that if dumping could be shown it would be dealt with on an entirely different plan to the ordinary control of imports by the imposition of a tariff. If people are now making a case with regard to dumping there is machinery available for dealing with that and they can avail of it.  As I said, I put myself at the disposal of certain millers to see if we could hammer out a scheme.  I pointed out the danger I saw in it, and went on to point out one danger which I think the Seanad should be alive to.  Would anybody like to see industry in this country taken over by speculators?  Would anybody like to see people in this country buying mills and holding on to them until a certain quota had been assigned to them, and then transferring them, at the enhanced value the quota gave, to English firms?  I must protect the public against that. I must see that no mercy is shown to the men who buy up mills in a bankrupt condition and hold on to them with the view to overloading them at an enhanced price, the enhanced price being due to any action the Government may take here to protect the people against increased exploitation. I have already dealt with Senator Johnson's point that we should retain milling capacity here.  I have always tried to make a distinction between the retention of milling capacity and inefficient milling.  If the present millers are not efficient I am not certain that <Col N="85" /> any great concession should be made to them.  If they show themselves willing to put their house in order, then the fact that there is a milling industry of sufficient importance would warrant us to give any assistance that any intelligent Government could give, but we should not be asked to protect a certain group of millers if they are not prepared to protect themselves by putting their house in order.</P>
    <P>If Senator Foran has any figures which show a steady strangulation of the Irish flour milling industry, it is his duty to give me those figures so that I can get them examined.  I hope that the milling employees in Limerick will be forewarned by Senator Foran's statement here, and that if Messrs. Ranks are trying to irritate them to strike, so that they could close down the mills, it will be for Senator Foran to advise the men that they must resist this irritation, and not allow themselves to be goaded into any strike so as to enable Messrs. Ranks to get rid of the mills.  The Senator said he would not be a party to the taxation of food in order to employ 3,000 or 4,000 men.  I do not know if he meant extra men, because, if he did, his calculations are very far wrong with regard to milling.  The Tariff Commission Report showed that if the mills of the country were run in an efficient way there would be, possibly, a decrease in the number employed in them.  Certainly no one ever suggested that there would be an increase of anything like 3,000 hands.</P>

      <P>The Senator meant that 3,000 or 4,000 would be kept in employment.  I should refer to certain matters mentioned in the debate that took place at the last meeting of the Seanad, about my not being here. I have never failed to put in an attendance here, as I think Senator O'Hanlon pointed out, when notice was given to me and when it was possible for me to be here.  I cannot understand why there should have been so much contention over my absence.  Senator O'Doherty was one of those who <Col N="86" /> alluded to it, and, as usual, he is not here himself now.  He is hardly ever here, and when he is here he generally does not take part in or intervene in any debate, so that I do not regret his presence or absence at the moment. Senator Moore was very angry with me for not being here.  He was afraid the whole idea was to burke discussion. The Senator, I notice, joined himself with a particular Party, by whom, on a recent occasion, he was repudiated in the Dáil; not so with Senator Connolly, who has not yet been repudiated by them.</P>

      <P>Surely.  I usually do. I think if I deal with the Minister's analysis of my statement of last week that that will be adequate to cover most of the points raised by other Senators. The Minister is satisfied, apparently that there is no danger whatever of the English concerns coming here to wipe out industry, and that there is no reason to think that Messrs. Ranks have intervened in the flour milling industry other than to develop the Irish flour milling industry on their own and to maintain it as such.  The Minister has gone to great pains to contradict some of the figures I presented. These figures were quoted at a public meeting called by the Mayor of Limerick, attended by representatives of the Trades Council, public representatives, and, I think, members of the Dáil, and to which the flour millers were invited.  The figures <Col N="89" /> appeared in the Limerick newspapers on November the 5th, and up to the present they were not contradicted, until the Minister came here now to contradict them.  Why have these figures been allowed to be broadcast over the country during the last twelve or fourteen days?  Why has there been no contradiction by the interests involved? Why has there been no contradiction from the Minister's own Department?  What figures has the Minister?  The Minister has not given us any figures.  Assuming that he does give figures, how does he come by them?  Does he send one of his inspectors down to examine the output books of Messrs. Ranks and the others in Limerick?  I prefer to accept the figures quoted publicly, and which have not been challenged, rather than to accept a statement like the Minister's.</P>

      <P>I am giving the statement. I say it has not been contradicted. Until the figures are contradicted by the Minister's Department with official figures I stand by my figures.  I believe honestly that the Minister has not the figures, and I believe that his Department has no figures as we know it has not figures for other things.  What figures has anyone to take to reconcile the position that has been charged as existing in Limerick?  The only figures one can get which will be any way symptomatic <Col N="90" /> of the real position are figures of the imports of flour and wheat.  I submit that the increase in the imports of flour by 8,500 tons, and the decrease by 40,000 tons in the imports of wheat, have not been fully explained away, even on the sophistical reasoning of the Minister.  The Minister has questioned at great length the whole question of the efficiency of the Irish mills. This question of efficiency has to be met some time.  I do not know when it is going to be met.  It is practically impossible in the Saorstát, with its three million of a population, to maintain what is known as efficient production for the population.  We are competing with England, where they are catering for 40 millions of people, and, as I stressed here before, with America, where they are catering for 120 millions, both countries having a huge export trade.  We are asked to compete with organisations like these. Let us see where this efficiency lies. The Minister has stated that he is not prepared to subsidise inefficient mills. What constitutes efficiency?  Is it the making of profit?  Then let me read you something from the official technical milling journal.  The actual amount lost in the last few years by flour-millers in England amounted to over £5,000,000.  Messrs. Spillers and Bakers lost in one year £350,000, and they have written down their capital. I wonder what the Minister would say if a firm in Ireland came to his Department and said: &ldquo;These are the circumstances: we are dead up against production at any cost.&rdquo;  Here is a firm prepared to lose £350,000.  Of course the rationalisation process has come to stop them losing that £350,000 and to stop the losing of the £5,000,000 by the others.  The Minister believes that other Senators ought to have more sense, and he stated that Messrs. Ranks did not come here to purchase the mills to close them down.  I will read a quotation from the &ldquo;Manchester Guardian Commercial&rdquo; which shows the position of the flour milling industry.  It is:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with many other trades, the flour-milling industry found itself at the end of the war burdened with a productive capacity <Col N="91" /> which it had no reasonable expectation of employing fully.  It has decided to tackle this problem in a way somewhat similar to that which has been adopted in the shipbuilding industry&mdash;by buying up and closing down redundant mills, and so concentrating production on a smaller number of units, which would thus be able to work at or near full capacity to reduce their costs.  The Millers' Mutual Association was formed last year, with the support of a very large part of the flour-milling industry, to buy up and close down surplus mills; it has been working for some fourteen months, and has already closed down a substantial number of units. Mills have been closed in Manchester, Wrexham, York, Grimsby, Cardiff, Sheffield, and Ellesmere Port.  Most of these have been closed permanently, and the buildings and equipment so far as possible disposed of, though one mill at Ellesmere Port, which was bought up by the Association, has been reopened temporarily, while another mill was closed for alterations.</P>
    <P>That is milling in England.  That is the flour ring.  We will come to the names now:</P>
    <P>It is unlikely that the Millers' Mutual Association will find it necessary to close many more mills, and though there are still a very large number of concerns in the industry, they are mostly small, and nearly the whole of the country's milling is in the hands of three concerns, Messrs. Spillers, Messrs. Ranks, and the Co-operative Wholesale Society.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will now argue that there is no ring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I never argued it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's conduct suggested that there was no such thing as a ring.  He has stated, and others have stated, that they could not conceive the millers buying mills here to close them down.  I say it definitely and positively here now that the situation is one which has reached the point when the Ministry or the Minister ought to intervene and see what is going to be done about it.  We <Col N="92" /> heard a good deal about the English millers in Ireland.  The Minister is very fond occasionally of accusing some people in our Party, myself included, of an inferiority complex.  The Minister has one inferiority complex, that in this country, owing to our position, we are quite incompetent and inefficient.  He is applying that to the whole industrial system of this country.  Let us look at this from another point of view. If the Minister is really serious about efficiency I want to tell him right now that there is only one thing to do, and that is to close every industry in the Saorstát, except Guinness's Brewery, Jacob's Biscuit Manufactory, a few distilleries, and the cattle and pig trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has brought in the inferiority complex now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the truth, and it is not a question of inefficiency; it is a question of being up against mass production methods and the Minister knows that as well as I do. If we are going to stand idle while we have any capital or any resources left that is all right, but the Minister must face up to the fact of the productive capacity of this country and where its production is going to go.  These industries that have not an export trade in this country cannot be run according to the standard of efficiency demanded by the Minister, and he might as well make up his mind to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister alleges that the production in Limerick has increased, but again the Minister does not say by how much or in what way.  We have only the Minister's word for that, and let me state quite frankly that the Minister is a past-master in such statements as that, and I for one am not prepared to accept anything unless I can get the actual figures and definite knowledge of how those figures were compiled.  He disputes the figures of 12,160 bags of bakers' flour per month.  A definite statement was made that no bakers' flour was now being made by Messrs. Ranks.  The Minister said that was not true.  When someone intervened and asked him what was the amount he said it was a very small amount.  I want to know <Col N="93" /> what was the amount of the reduction in the production of household flour. I still stand by my statement until the Minister can prove otherwise.</P>
    <P>Characteristically, the Minister dealt with this question of the subtlety of the word &ldquo;Millocrat.&rdquo;  The Minister, of course, does not apply the word subtlety to Messrs. Ranks.  He does not believe they know the game.  It is only the people of Ireland who have these queer twisted ways of doing things.  We know enough about Irish economic history, and so does the Minister, to know that such methods are very common.  The conviction that we have, that the people of Limerick have and the people who earn their living there have, is that by a gradual process of using Limerick flour under the brand &ldquo;Millocrat&rdquo; the demand for the other two brands will cease.  That is the natural deduction, and the people who control the milling at the present time will in a short time be in a position to say &ldquo;there is no demand for the two brands mentioned; everybody is now buying &lsquo;Millocrat.&rsquo;&rdquo;  Does the Minister think that we are children, that we do not realise that these things are done in commerce and that they are done by huge rings&mdash;that every ring that controls an industry will operate all these things?  They want to get the local support.  They are supplying them now with the flour milled in Limerick, but they are supplying it under the name of &ldquo;Millocrat,&rdquo; and in a couple of years there will be no need to mill flour in Limerick because they will use &ldquo;Millocrat&rdquo;; it is the flour that is wanted there.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister's Department has any statistics or figures with regard to the other smaller mills through the country. I do not know whether he has any information about the mills in Kilrush or Fermoy, or any of these other mills that we believe are being closed. Even for a moment, assuming that the Minister can argue and prove to us, which he has not done, that Limerick production has increased that would not go to prove anything if Ranks were forcing the smaller mills out of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> That brings us back to the question of efficiency again.  Whether humanity is going to be turned on the roadside for the Minister's efficiency I do not know, but I do say he has not answered the case that I made. He has denied, but he has not proven that my figures are wrong, and he has not given us any figures of his own to show any justification for the statements which he has made.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the buying of mills as a speculative investment. I presume he means by that that Rank's or some of these other people are buying mills as an investment in the hope of a tariff.  I venture to make a prophecy now: It is that there will be a tariff on imported flour but it will not come until Messrs. Ranks and the other millers are sufficiently dug in here to make it worth their while, and until the Irish millers are absorbed, assimilated or put out of existence.  That is the tendency.  Then it will be a good speculation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to dumping. I do not know what he calls dumping. I presume he means selling at prices lower here than they sell across the water, and prices perhaps below the cost of production.  The figures I have given you show that the millers' loss was over five millions, and that Messrs. Spillers lost £350,000 and afterwards wrote down their capital. These figures show that flour was produced and sold at a figure far below the cost of production, and that a percentage of it came in here.  That may not constitute dumping in the Minister's sense of dumping, but it does constitute an element in this efficiency that the Minister speaks of that we cannot achieve in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The sum total of the position is that the Limerick people, including the workers, and not only the workers but the majority of intelligent people in Limerick, are satisfied that the flour control is passing into the hands of the English millers' ring.  I have read for you a quotation from the &ldquo;Manchester Guardian Commercial&rdquo; of November 20th, which clearly outlines the policy of Messrs. Ranks, Spillers, and the Co-operative Wholesale.  That is a definite line of policy.  How much <Col N="95" /> longer do we need to wait until the situation is crystallised before we deal with it?  I am not suggesting tariffs. I am not suggesting anything.  I am suggesting that the Minister is the person who can deal with it, and that it only requires his energy and his analysis of the position.  He promised in April that he would watch the position. I bring this up now seven months afterwards when the position is such that it demands the attention and action of the Minister.  The position is worse than it was in April, and it is <Col N="96" /> worsening every day.  Nothing that the Minister has said makes me want to change one word of the analysis of the position of the flour milling that I made last week, and it now remains for the Seanad to say whether they are in favour of the continued shrinkage of the flour milling or whether they believe that in the interests of the people in this country the Minister should get a mandate from them that he should proceed to take control of the flour milling industry entirely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That in view of the desperate position of agriculture following the unfavourable harvest, in the opinion of the Seanad steps should be taken by the Executive for the immediate provision of employment or relief for those engaged in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this motion, my desire is to promote a discussion on a question of the greatest importance in this country at the moment.  I hope that it will be discussed in a national spirit, as it is certainly my desire that the facts should be brought out as fairly and impartially as possible, and that we may have the benefit of the wisdom of Senators from the various parts of this House upon a question of such immediate importance to the people of this country, especially the agricultural community.  What is the condition of agriculture at the moment?  I will allude only to three or four general heads.  I find that in the County of Kerry, where the farmers are more industrious than in any other county in Ireland&mdash;quite as industrious as those of any other county&mdash;where the people have climbed up the hills and cultivated to the hilltops, at the present time farms are derelict, and when the Commissioner who has been <Col N="97" /> sent down to take up the business of the County Council went to Tralee his first pressing duty was to call together his inspectors from the various districts and find out what is to be done with the derelict farms.  Anybody acquainted with the position of this country, with the love of the people for their lands, will at once conclude from that that there must be something very wrong and very bad in the conditions of the present time.</P>
    <P>Another matter which to those acquainted with agriculture is of serious portent is this: all over the country farmers are selling their milking cows.  They are doing that only under the pressure of dire necessity, and the Minister for Agriculture, who comes from the west of Ireland, will, I am sure, be familiar with an old Irish proverb which says &ldquo;When a man comes to sell the cow, famine is not far distant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another indication of the condition of the country is that civil bill decrees and civil bill processes are flying like snowflakes all over the country, and the only industry that is prosperous is the industry of the civil bill officer and of the solicitor for the Department of Lands and Fisheries.  These are the industries that are prosperous.  We had figures some time ago, and there are Senators here who will bear me out, showing that the costs in one county alone awarded to State solicitors for civil bills against unfortunate tenants for rents amounted in all to £3,500, and as I firmly believe in reality to £7,000.  These are three signs of the times.  I think you will admit that they are very serious signs.</P>
    <P>There is another thing which I would like to refer to, that the land of Ireland is going out of cultivation.  In the past ten years 350,000 acres of land have gone out of cultivation.  The rate at which the land is going out of cultivation is accelerating.  It is a geometrical progression, and my submission is this: in the last twelve months 104,000 acres went out of cultivation. That means serious diminution in the amount of the production of the soil. It means serious loss to the farmers, it must mean starvation to the farm labourers, because, of course, the farm <Col N="98" /> labourer only gets his employment by means of the tillage, and if the land goes out of cultivation there is no employment for the working man. These are four indications of the condition of the rural population at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made regulations, some of them very good regulations, and some of them perhaps more than doubtful, but I would prefer to see the Minister make a regulation that would keep the worker on the land.  I would rather see him do something to put a stop to the divorce between labour and the soil, because if depopulation goes on at its present rate we will have nothing in the country but deserted villages.  These are four or five of the main matters to which I would direct your attention, as indicating the condition of the agricultural population at the present time, both farmers and labourers.</P>
    <P>In order to enable you to suggest some solution I propose to indicate some of the causes which have brought about that result.  The causes so far as I can see are these: there has been a failure in some cases to produce the best quality of agricultural products. Our butter is 30/- a cwt. cheaper than the Danish butter. Bacon on the other hand is 20/- a cwt. dearer than the Danish bacon.  It is a curious commentary that our butter is under State control and our bacon is in the hands of private people, thoroughly efficient private firms. There is a fact for this Seanad to consider.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that the bacon industry is efficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I say Irish bacon is 20/- a cwt. dearer than Danish bacon.  I also submit to the House that Irish butter is 30/- a cwt. cheaper than Danish butter.  I ask the House to examine the reasons for that, and to draw their own conclusion.  There is another cause of the depopulation of the countryside, and I think it arises from the increase in the taxation of the rural people.  There has in the last four or five years been an increase in the incidence of taxation so far as it relates to farmers and farm <Col N="99" /> labourers.  I think I will not be contradicted when I say that they are paying an increase of more than a million a year.  That may be partly the result of tariffs that have been imposed.  I am in favour of tariffs, but I am in favour of so regulating tariffs that they will not press unduly on the farmer and farm labourer.  I think that that increase in the taxation of the farmer and the farm labourer, due partly to the existence of tariffs, is mainly due to the fact that the tariffs have been mismanaged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Another cause of the ruin of the farming classes is that there is in this country excessive, unproductive expenditure.  That expenditure which is unproductive is partly Ministerial. There are 53,000 people getting their way of living by salaries from this State.  They are, in a sense, doing unproductive work, and they cost the farmer and the farm labourer, who are the only producers, 10½ millions of money a year.  I say that is one of the causes of the bad condition of agriculture. But the unproductive expenditure is not merely Government expenditure. There is unproductive expenditure in other directions.  I think myself that the expenditure on bevelled roads was unproductive expenditure from the point of view of the greatest class in this country, the farming class and the farm labourers.  I think a lot of money has been spent without any direct productive result on those roads for motor cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> While I am on the subject I think that motor cars themselves have been to the farmer a great curse, for this reason&mdash;there are about three millions of money spent every year on motors and on petrol.  Not one shilling of that money is spent in Ireland. That is a direct loss; it is unproductive expenditure.  To pursue that for a moment, some 15 or 20 years ago we had the smith, the harness-maker, the breeder of horses, and the farmer supplying oats.  We had circulation of money in this country.  That circulation of money has been put an end to, while three millions a year go out. These matters have a deeper significance than many people imagine.  To a great extent, they are the cause of the depressed condition of agriculture at the present moment.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which affects the west of Ireland and has caused depression there.  Up to 1925 the west of Ireland received as compensation for the clearing of the people from the east of Ireland £250,000 a year under the Congested Districts Board.  I think that £250,000, minus £18,000, has been taken from those districts in the west, and you know that these things must cause a serious dislocation in the economic life of the west.</P>
    <P>These are, I think, four of the main causes for the present condition of agriculture.  I have mentioned them rather briefly, because my desire is rather that there should be discussion amongst the members of the Seanad than that I should be supposed as laying down any propositions in regard to agriculture for which I might not have sufficient authority.  But I think I have stated enough now to show that the condition of agriculture is very bad.  I have indicated three or four of the causes, so that the members of the Seanad and the Minister may consider how a remedy is to be provided, because once you diagnose the cause it is an easy step to find a remedy.  A remedy must be provided.  We have only one resource in this country, putting out the four manufacturing firms&mdash; Guinness's, the distilleries, the biscuit factory in Dublin, and Fords in Cork. These are the four exporting firms. They practically monopolise all the export <Col N="101" /> trade in manufactured articles. Our great export trade is livestock and farming products generally.  Therefore, I say that the resource of this country is the land.  The land must be made to produce more; it must be made more fertile; it must be cultivated or this nation will die.  Our population has been reduced, I think, in the last ten year by 350,000, taking into account now that there should be a natural increase in population.  There is a reduction in population of, I think, 350,000.  There has been an increase in the population of the towns.  So that this is a diminution in the rural population.  I confidently submit to this House that there must be a decrease of about 600,000 in the rural population.  There should be no decrease in the rural population.  There should be an increase.  The Minister for Agriculture, who has been praised in many quarters, who has done some things efficiently, is responsible to a great extent for that.  Probably he could not himself remedy it, but the Cabinet, of which he forms part, if they were determined to do what is right in this country, could have supported him in providing a remedy. The condition of this country requires immediate measures, and it requires measures which will have operation through a series of years.</P>
    <P>The remedy I propose for the immediate relief of agriculture is twofold. I propose to stop the issue of civil bills and the marking of decrees in respect of the instalments of the annuity which is now due.  Wipe out this instalment of the annuity that is falling due at the present time.  The Minister smiles as though this were a new idea.  I suppose he is old enough to remember&mdash; if he is not, those on whose knees he sat as a boy are&mdash;that whenever there was depression in Ireland, even in the days of landlordism, a year's rent or a half-year's rent was allowed to stand over. The farmer was not exactly smashed. In '79 the rents were not collected, not with the same vigour, not with the same determination, not with the same cost of civil bill officers and sheriffs officers as they are to-day.  I make this statement deliberately to the House, that for the relief of agriculture, and <Col N="102" /> in order to prevent the farmers from selling their milking cows, there ought to be a remission of this half-year's gale of the annuities.  That is an immediate measure which I would propose. The second measure I propose is this, that all impediments to the draining and reclamation of land should be removed at once.  I suggest that in order to relieve the labouring men in the country.  I wish to explain to the Seanad what I mean.  There have been a number of statutes dealing with the drainage and reclamation of land.</P>
    <P>They began in 1842.  They went on through 1847 and 1883, and finally came to the Act passed by the Oireachtas in 1925.  Under these earlier Acts when, of course, taxation was not high and when all that a man owned was his own, when the total revenue collected in the country was eight or nine millions instead of being forty or fifty millions, as it is now, the owners of the lands proposed to be drained were required to pay the cost.  The Board of Works carried out these maintenance schemes, but the owners were obliged to pay for them.  Under the Act of 1925, at present in operation, the Minister contributes as much as he desires.  The words of the statute are that the Minister contributes as much as he thinks proper, and the county council contributes as much as it thinks proper, while the local farmer has to bear the cost of the main drainage scheme, over which he has no control.  The result of that is that many useful drainage schemes throughout the country have been held up because the local farmers, situated as they are, cannot afford to incur the risk of the cost of these schemes.  I submit to the House that the cost of this work on rivers, canals and arterial drains ought to be a national charge exclusively.  The main roads have been made through this country in order to give access to the land.  I say that these arterial drains, canals and rivers ought to be cleared at the public expense in order to give access to the fertility of the soil.  If the Minister were to accept my suggestion it would have the direct effect of enabling a series of schemes in every <Col N="103" /> county to be taken in hand at once. In that way the Minister would be giving relief to the agricultural labourers. My friend, Senator O'Hanlon, who was at the birth of the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, with his forensic skill, is endeavouring to put me off my track, but I come on the rails again, and I insist that here we have one remedy for the hungry farmer in the present winter by remitting the half-year's annuities.  We have another remedy for the labouring man.  It is this: Wipe away all your restrictions in connection with the drainage and reclamation of the land and allow these drainage schemes to go forward.  We could send Senator O'Hanlon down in overalls to supervise the work.  It is very hard at this hour, and in an opening speech, to elaborate the suggestion I have made in reference to drainage legislation, but I think that up to the present I have made it clear enough that drainage schemes have been hung up because the farmers will not consent to be made responsible for the arterial drains and the big canals which are being constructed by the Board of Works, which are not under the control of the farmers and which may cost more than the farmer can afford to pay. The farmers are timid of that.  At the present time they are not able to do that.  Therefore, I say the State should take on that work altogether, bear the expense of it and allow the farmer to drain and reclaim his own land.  I would not allow any State officials to interfere unnecessarily with the small farmer's control of his own land.  I say that the drainage of a man's farm should be under his own control and that the money for the drainage of the land should be supplied cheap.  It should be cheap money, as it was in 1883 and in subsequent years.  My defence of that is that the improvement of land is a benefit to the State as well as to the individual farmer.  The State which derives a benefit from it ought to contribute part of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the two remedies which I suggest for the immediate amelioration of the condition of the farming classes. It is desirable that these immediate <Col N="105" /> measures should be of such a nature that they would fit in with a general scheme.  I think a measure allowing drainage to proceed would fit in with the general scheme for the drainage and reclamation of land.  It may be said to me: &ldquo;You are only going to benefit those farmers whose lands are waterlogged.&rdquo;  I would not put forward a proposition so absurd as that.</P>
    <P>I find in an Act of Parliament passed in 1847 that a number of ways are laid down in which land could be improved.  These include measures for dealing with rocky land, with light land and, in fact with every description of land.  The legislators of that time may have been hostile to us as they undoubtedly were.  They may have, by their measures, caused great suffering in this country, but they were good draftsmen.  Of the ways they laid down in which land could be improved drainage is only one.  Other ways they suggested were the trenching and deepening of land, fertilisers, fencing of land, the making of dams and the clearing of streams and watercourses, the reclamation of waste land, the making of farm roads and the clearing of land of rocks and stones. In that list, contained in a section of an Act of Parliament passed in 1847, I find there a means of ameliorating the condition of every farmer throughout the country.  I have spoken of drainage, but that is only one way in which land could be improved.  I have the best authority for saying that money expended on drainage in this country will yield a return of ten per cent.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane, who is the statistician of the Seanad, says no, and therefore I must yield to him, but if it is not ten per cent. perhaps it is nine.  In any case the drainage of land will yield a good economic return.  After that you have the fertilisation of the land.  If land is going out of tillage you must find some means of making it grow more grass.  These are matters to which I wish to direct the attention of the Seanad.  They are deserving of very great consideration, and if the Minister finds himself hampered in his own <Col N="106" /> Cabinet he ought to come out and stand for them.  There is another matter to which I would direct the Minister's attention.  It is perhaps more than what one man can do, and perhaps with his official machinery the Minister cannot do all that I have suggested to him, but I make this further suggestion: that instead of all these microscopic boards that are being established&mdash;we have a board for almost everything&mdash;we ought to have one great development board with the Ministers, if they choose, as members of it.  That board ought to have the best professional assistance.  It ought to consist of unpaid men and be something on the lines of the old Congested Districts Board.  It ought to be composed of experienced men, men of standing who found their experience in various walks in life.  It ought to be in close contact with the various Departments and accessible to persons throughout the country, no matter what avocation they follow, who have ideas to bring before it for development and exploitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the present Ministry has suffered too much, and I say this not in any disparaging sense, from the official mind.  I think the Government ought to bring into the business of this country more of the mind of the ordinary commercial man, trader and farmer. I suggest that a board, such as I have indicated, should be established, that it would be the best means of promoting and using the fertility of the soil and finding out what is under the soil. It is by developing what is in the soil of Ireland that we can hope to live and keep up the very expensive establishment which exists here to-day. If the measures which I have indicated were adopted, I suggest that greater prosperity would result to the country and that it would enable us to maintain the weight of our present establishment.  In moving this motion I will be quite content if I have caused more experienced members of the Seanad to think out this question for themselves.  I had wished for an adjournment of the motion because I desired to have a full House for its discussion.  I desired to have a full and free discussion in a really <Col N="107" /> national sense to meet a national calamity and a national danger.</P>
    <P>As long as I have been in the Seanad I have not been an alarmist. In describing the condition of the rural population, if I have used any language that may be thought to be extravagant, I desire to say that in my opinion these words are not extravagant, and that the condition of the rural population is worse than it was in 1879 and almost as bad as it was in the hungry &ldquo;'forties.&rdquo;  That is the problem which the Minister has to face, and if he chooses to face it he ought to have the assistance of the Seanad.  I am not despondent as to the future of this country.  I think we will get through our difficulties and that the country will ultimately prosper, but at present it is getting depopulated. The country must be going down when the rural districts are getting depopulated.  I hope that depopulation will stop and that an end will be put to it by any measures that are possible.  I hope whoever undertakes that work will receive the support which such measures deserve.</P>

      <P>As a practical farmer I suppose I ought to be greatly touched and moved by Senator Comyn's speech, but in fact it has had quite the opposite effect on me.  It has left me quite cold.  The Senator, when referring to the reasons that in his opinion have caused the great depression which everyone knows exists in the agricultural industry, did not mention the world-wide depression that is really responsible for it.  The Minister for Agriculture is here to speak for the Government, but speaking as a practical farmer, I desire to say that I consider this motion not only wholly unnecessary, but mischievous. I desire to make a protest against all the talk we have heard, not only here, but all over the country, about tariffs, land annuities, the hopeless condition of the farmer, unemployment, and all the rest of it.  All this kind of talk seems to me to have arisen in some people's minds very suddenly.  The depression from which <Col N="108" /> the country is suffering dates back to about the year 1922.  It has been coming on gradually since then.  Like other working farmers, I have had my difficulties in working my farm.  Every farmer has had them, and I may say that I know perfectly well the condition of our farmers.  What I want to protest against is all this talk we have had to listen to because, in my opinion, it is having a very bad effect on the farmers.  It is sapping their courage at a time when they most need courage.  It is causing discouragement amongst them, and even panic.</P>
      <P>Anybody who knows anything about the farmer's business is quite aware that if a farmer loses his self-confidence and a grip on his business, he is never going to recover.  He is finished, and that is all.  Now our memories are not quite so short as perhaps some people would wish.  I have a very vivid recollection of the time when there was not so much sympathy shown to the farmer as there appears to be now.  I remember the time, not so long ago, when roving bands of gunmen went through the country and quartered themselves on poor farmers for two and three years, eating them out of house and home, the time when farmers were boycotted, and were prevented from carrying on their business. That was the order of the day at that time.  The business of many farmers was ruined in that way, and they have never since been able to recover from it.  The farmers were prevented from going to their market towns to do their business.  They could not travel over the broken roads and bridges, for the destruction of which the country is still paying.</P>

      <P>Nothing could possibly be worse for the farmer than that he should lose confidence.  During the course of the debate to-day we heard of Mr. Macawber.  The suggestion seems to be that if a Macawber-like spirit is adopted, of waiting for something to turn up in the form of tariffs or something else, it will cure all the ills from which the farmer suffers. My own conviction is that in the long run the farmers of the country would be better off if there were no tariffs. One would imagine, listening to the last speaker, that the Minister for Agriculture and the members of the Executive Council had not yet begun to think of the situation in which the farmers of the country find themselves. I am not speaking for the Government, but everyone knows that the Executive Council have been giving the most anxious thought to this problem.  Why we should be called upon to pass a motion which seems to suggest that the Government are doing nothing is beyond me.  If those who are so interested in the farmers would preach a little courage to them to help them to keep up their spirits in these most difficult times, it would, in my opinion, be a very good thing.  It would be well if every farmer could say when he puts his hand to the plough or goes about his other work: &ldquo;My field may be stony or swampy, or my land poor and the weather bad, but if I keep right on and look not back, I am no failure.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The last Senator who spoke objects very much to any <Col N="110" /> criticism.  According to Senator Miss Browne everything is to be allowed to go on perfectly smoothly as it is, whether it is going over the precipice or not.  We must all hold our tongues and wait.  No criticism is to be allowed for fear it may frighten the poor farmer and put him out of his stride.  Of course, that is what is always said in this country: you must not criticise anyone, you must not criticise the Government, whether that Government is in England or here.  Let them alone and everything will get on splendidly. The last Senator said that if there were no tariffs of any kind our farmers would have got on much better than they have.  I would ask her, what has led to the depopulation of the country? It is only now about half what it was fifty or seventy years ago.  Was it free trade or tariffs that led to that depopulation, that ruined the country, lessened its agricultural production, and left it without factories?  I think if the Senator looks into the matter she will see that it was free trade brought about that situation.  Everyone in the country in the last fifty or sixty years has recognised that fact. Free trade has led to the depopulation of the country and to the fact that so many thousands of acres have gone out of cultivation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the official reports prepared by the Government the amount of land under corn last year decreased by 26,000 acres.  The amount of land under root and grain crops and flax decreased by 62,000 acres, while in the case of hay the reduction has been 38,000 acres.  Altogether, there has been a decrease in the case of land under cultivation of 101,000 acres. During the last seventy or eighty years the land of this country has been going continuously out of cultivation, and the position since the present Government came into office has been just as bad as it was before.  They have not done anything to stop that.  Everyone remembers that for years before the State was set up people everywhere urged that the whole system should be changed in this country from beginning to end, and that otherwise the country would be ruined.  The object of the rising here was due to the desire that that should be done.  It has not been <Col N="111" /> done, however, and the old system has been continued as much as possible. In fact in some respects the present system is worse than the old.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture said at Carlow some time ago that butter was the only export from Ireland that required protection, that protection in the case of our other exports would be impossible.  I do not know whether that is likely to prove to be correct. There is a great deal of reason for believing that a great many other things besides butter require protection. I know the Minister will not agree with me, but there is the question of bacon.  The situation with regard to these things changes every other day.  What is suitable and opportune at one time is not suitable or opportune at another.  If one is to believe what one reads, a serious crisis has arisen in connection with bacon.  Irish bacon has been quoted at a higher price than bacon from other places.</P>
    <P>Eight of the largest professional importers in Manchester made a statement that the whole situation with regard to the bacon trade has changed, and changed very rapidly and seriously, within the last few years, that all the Continental States have been increasing their pig and bacon exports year after year, and now it has come to such a point that in Poland they are killing 165,000 pigs per week.  It states that the price of bacon in England has nothing to do with Ireland, except so far as we are exporters to England and further, that bacon will be landed at the rate of 6d. or 7d. per lb. for Danish and Swedish, Dutch 5d. to 6½d., and Polish 5½d. to 6d.  The result of these reductions will be that bacon will be sold in the shops at 11d. or 1/- per lb.  That is a statement made by important people not connected with our politics but with the English bacon trade.  The statement goes on to say this is a matter of the utmost importance. What possible chance has the home producer whose best quality bacon is retailed at from 1/8 to 2/- in the lb.?  How could he possibly sell cheaper?  They go on to ask what hope is there for the home producer when the last week's figures of 80,000 bales <Col N="112" /> of bacon, equivalent to 65,000 carcases, to the value of £600,000 are imported? The bacon is not ordered by the trade. It is dumped on consignment and none goes back.  It is all sold and paid for in fourteen days.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I dare say, has more information than that as regards our bacon trade, and probably in due time he will do with regard to bacon what he has done as regards butter.  When in Carlow he was hesitating on the brink.  He was not sure was it right to impose a tax on butter.  Suddenly he took the dive into the cold water and he excluded butter.  I hope he will go on in that way and take a few more dives.  Apparently, however, the Minister, and other Ministers, are tied up with the old theories that suited England at a particular time.  England became very wealthy as a result of free trade, but the people who wrote on the subject at that time did not get any real general statement in favour of free trade.  They said it was suitable for the time, and so it was for England but it ruined us.  Great harm is bound to be done if people do not follow the times and act in accordance with what is necessary for the times.  Ministers are struggling hard against a tax on imports and against helping in any way they can.  Free trade killed agriculture in England, and they are regretting that now and are trying to get back the old conditions, and get the people back on the farms, but they will not succeed, for people do not go back from the pavement to the farm.  Once you get them out of the country they will never go back.  Once the Irish farm population move to the towns, as they are doing, it is not back to Connemara they will go.</P>
    <P>The Senator who proposed this motion suggested that there should be a remission of the annuities for this year, and when that suggestion was made the Minister asked: &ldquo;What would happen at the end of the year?&rdquo; I am not talking now of the old controversy.  This is merely a question of remission for one year. When the Minister says: &ldquo;What is going to happen,&rdquo; he means that nothing will be done, and that the English will insist on their money.  That is not so.  Even on the Minister's own <Col N="113" /> way of thinking, that the annuities are due to England, there is not the least reason why the annuities should not be reduced.  Annuities are the old rents imposed by the landlord on his tenants.  He raised the rents when he wished, and he lowered them at other times when things were bad.  There was no such thing as unchangeable rents.  When bad times came the landlord reduced the rents or he was forced to do so.  They were not considered by the State to be irremovable. The State came in and said, &ldquo;You cannot say that.  The people are starving and we will reduce the rents whether you like it or not.&rdquo; Rents were reduced three times at intervals of fifteen years.  What turned them into annuities?  The State bought out the landlords, and it bought out nothing except what the landlords had, and the landlords had not the power to charge rents that the tenants could not pay, and, therefore, the State cannot do so.  The annuities are only based on what rights the landlords had, and those rights were tempered by the power to reduce the rents when necessary.  Therefore, as the State only bought what the landlords had, it has the right to reduce the annuities when that becomes necessary and the people are starving.  Supposing, for instance, things were much worse than they are, and that no one could pay annuities as the land would not produce, what would happen is that the annuities would stop automatically for there would be no money to pay them.</P>
    <P>The Saorstát has as much power to reduce the annuities as the British Government had to reduce the rents. It is quite applicable to the position to say the annuities should be reduced for a year owing to the state of the country.  Quite apart from what other argument may be used, I think that is a matter that is not generally thought out by various people who consider the question.  We have got the best ecclesiastical authority on this&mdash;Dr. Walsh, Archbishop of Dublin, and Dr. Croke, Archbishop of Cashel, and also Joseph Chamberlain, and such people, who at the time did not regard the annuities or rents as above criticism or <Col N="114" /> reduction.  I consider that something ought to be done in a serious way for helping people over the bad times.  I remember the years 1878 and 1879 when there was a state of great hardship in the country, and when the Land League sprung up, and a Land League may spring up again to fight the new rents or annuities.  These are matters to be considered when the country is in a state of very great hardship, and something has to be done to relieve it.</P>

      <P>I support the motion. I would seriously ask practical farmers in the House, taking the last five years, did they make ends meet during that time in farming?  Surely they could not have done so unless they had other means.  For instance, there are members of this House who have a salary coming in to supplement what they are making on farming, but surely nobody working on a farm could possibly keep up with the prices that prevail for the articles they produce.  One week or month there will be abnormal prices, and the following week or month the prices will be coming down again, so that taking things in and out, it was almost impossible for practical farmers, no matter how conscientiously they worked or how saving they were, to make ends meet during the last six years.  Take the whole circumstances as they exist.  The position as regards farmers is that everything they have to sell is at pre-war prices, and everything they have to buy, and the cost of living generally, is almost 75 per cent. over pre-war.  Realising that fact, it is extraordinary how many farmers have succeeded in keeping out of the bankruptcy courts so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various reasons for the conditions under which they are working at present.  To give an instance, take the people who have tried to better themselves as regards housing conditions.  Take typical farmers in the West of Ireland with a valuation of from £10 to £20.  A good many of these people, eight or ten years ago, were living under vile housing conditions. They were anxious to get out of these houses, and they availed of the housing grant.  Immediately an <Col N="115" /> assessor came along and increased the valuation by a third, and in some cases doubled the valuation, although there had been no increased revenue. Doubling the valuation means that the grant of £45 given is paid back in rates in fourteen years or fifteen years, as a result of the increased valuation. Surely, that is a rotten system, and to call such a grant a free grant is dishonest, or certainly misleading.  That is undoubtedly a distinct hardship on the farming community, who can ill afford not alone better housing conditions, but are poorly able to meet the ordinary demands made on them. Senator Comyn stressed the point of drainage.  In the county I come from, that is one of the most serious questions the people are up against. Almost half the county suffers from flooding owing to failure to drain the Robe, the Alb and the Moy.  In Mayo there are thousands of farmers living beside these rivers, and no effort, or very little effort, has been made to see that the rivers are deepened to relieve the hardship and distress the people have suffered as a result of the flooding in these areas.</P>
    <P>It was a common sight to see turf and cocks of hay floating about in different parts of the county.  A question was asked in the other House by a Deputy on this matter.  The only thing that happened about the Robe is that an assessor went around to see by how much the holding would be improved, and consequently the valuation increased, so that the people would have to pay for any increased income they might derive as a result of the drainage, while at the same time there is a failure to realise the terrible loss they suffered when their farms were flooded with water.  I think this is following up the old system that is reminiscent of landlordism in the days gone by, when, if a man showed externally that he was getting prosperous by whitewashing his house, he would have to report to the landlord and give free labour for a week, and failing that he would be evicted.  That was a most degrading system, and the unfortunate people trying to bring themselves out of the dirty houses in which they are living are treated much the same way. <Col N="116" /> I think that is a policy which should be ended.  Another aspect of the situation is that as far as Mayo is concerned the trunk roads are a terrible burden on the farming community as a whole. Since the present Government forcibly took office, if I might say so, there has been practically nothing done in the case of by-roads or bog roads.  It is no exaggeration to say that the majority of the farmers of the county this year found it impossible to get into the bogs for turf, owing to the absolute neglect of the authorities in putting the bog roads into a passable condition. In the by-roads there has been nothing done.  These are things that are creating great hardship and misery to the farming community.</P>
    <P>The trunk roads and the mental hospitals of Mayo cost between £60,000 and £70,000 per annum, and I submit they have been of no direct benefit to the farming community.  I suppose what is typical in Mayo is also true of other counties.  The farming community should be relieved of rates for trunk roads.  In Mayo that would mean reducing the rates roughly by one-half, and it would give the opportunity of turning attention once more to the by-roads and bog roads.  By giving the relief I have suggested it would go a long way towards solving the problem in the West and the difficulties the people are up against at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate, for the simple reason that I am more at home in industrial than in agricultural matters, but I was very interested to hear all the arguments that have been put forward.  One must in facing this problem realistically appreciate the great difficulties that any Government has to face in attempting to solve the social conditions of the agricultural community throughout the country, especially in a year when the harvest prices have made it almost impossible for the people on the soil to exist at all.  But whilst having that sympathy with any Government that may be in power, we must realise that a great deal of the trouble is due to the fact that we in this country carrying on the traditional methods after the period we went through before the establishment of the Saorstát.  We <Col N="117" /> thought in the old days we were going to put an end to that bad period. Unfortunately we seem to be deeply embedded in the old grooves and methods of red tapeism and officialism. There are one or two points, as far as the agricultural labourers are concerned, that merit the attention not only of this House but of the Oireachtas generally, and particularly the Minister.  We have in operation an Insurance Act, which is nothing more or less than the carrying forward of the old British Insurance Act which was framed, launched and put into effect for an industrialised community but that in no way met the needs of an agricultural community such as Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest hardship, to my mind, that is imposed by legislation in this country is the position whereby the agricultural labourer is not insured and is not insurable.  Practically every other man if he is engaged in an industrial occupation is covered, to some limited extent at least, for a period by unemployment insurance, but this unfortunate man who needs it most, and who is living closer to the starvation line, and is unable to save when employed, is left derelict, or is dishonoured at having to apply for outdoor relief for himself and his family. I admit that the problem is a serious and difficult one, but if one person more than another ought to be insured in this country it is the agricultural labourer who has no possibility of being able to put up any reserves for a period when he would be out of work.  I have said on other occasions in this House, and I mean to repeat now, that until we have money available at an economic rate for development in this country we are not going to make progress.  What we know as an economic rent means paying the banker 5½ per cent. for loans and a certain amount for sinking fund.  That makes housing impossible, no matter how well intentioned the Minister may be and no matter how much the Government realise the need for decent housing conditions.  If they are going to build these houses at what they call an economic rent they will have to pay a ruinous rate of interest for the capital <Col N="118" /> necessary for the rehabilitation of the country.</P>
    <P>We know that a protective policy is necessary for agriculture more than for any other industry in this country. The Minister's attitude about that is also wrong.  I suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that the two things he has got to face arising out of this debate are, first, how he is going to deal with the unemployed agricultural labourers; what system of insurance or dole, if necessary, he will provide for the unfortunate employee when out of work.  The second point is, how he is going to launch or develop a housing scheme at an economic rate, and what steps he will take to secure capital for the building of houses and providing proper sanitary arrangements in houses and the proper drainage necessary. These are some of the lines on which the Executive ought to think if they are to solve the problem, particularly of the agricultural labourers in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been engaged in agriculture for a number of years, but I had been for many years, and I think I have a good idea of the mentality of the agricultural labourer.  He is wedded to the soil.  He has been brought up to the soil, and he knows no other craft or business but the production of food and crops from the soil.  We have rural depopulation, and the reason of that is that once the agricultural labourer is thrown out of employment he does not know what to do with himself.  He either has to migrate or gravitate to the nearest town or city that offers the prospect of work.  What is happening to-day is that these men hang on to their cabins or their agricultural holdings as long as they possibly can, and, through sheer want, when a housing scheme or a sanitary scheme is put into operation in the nearest township or city they gravitate towards that, and they are picked up by the contractors, for they are strong, stout, healthy fellows, able to dig foundations and that sort of thing.  After five or six weeks when the foundations are dug they are cast aside, and the carpenters, masons and others come along.  In the meantime the little holdings they had in the <Col N="119" /> country have possibly been taken over by some person, or they have disposed of their interest in it.</P>
      <P>They are fixed as citizens of the city or town to which they gravitate.  They are held there unable to get out, and they become a burden on the local rates of the community in which they found temporary employment.  When you are met with the fact that tillage is decreasing, and that in the past twelve months, according to figures quoted by Senator Comyn, land has gone out of cultivation to the extent of 200,000 acres, or whatever the number may be, that means a considerable displacement of agricultural labourers in the Irish Free State.  For the time being emigration is stopped, and a large number&mdash; possibly 90 per cent.&mdash;who might emigrate, are prevented from doing so through lack of means, or through other disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to get at is this: What is going to be the result when we get back to normality?  We hear a great deal about depression in the farming community.  I suppose it is pretty general in every country.  It is a passing thing; an aftermath of the Great War.  We will get back to normal conditions in time.  One Senator advised us to keep our hearts up, not to be depressed, and that we would get over the present set-back.  When we get back to normal where will the agricultural labourers be?  What will have become of them?  That class is decreasing from year to year, is gravitating towards the towns or cities, or emigrating. It will be very difficult to replace people brought up on the land, who have an affection for it, when there will be demands for further tillage. What I want to do, if possible, is to hold these people on the land.  They are a bold peasantry, a country's pride. Hold them on the land for the time being at any cost.  Do not let them get contaminated by an affection which will gradually grow for life in the cities and towns.  When that day comes they will not go back to the land.  How can they be held on the land?  If we are to have tillage, if the land is to be cultivated, and if the agricultural labourer is allowed to go away what will be the <Col N="120" /> position?  The labourer has his little house and family.  Possibly he has an acre more or less.  Many of the young people live with their people.  How are you going to hold them?  They are a class that do not follow any other craft beyond handling a spade or a shovel.  They can do good work with that.  They are walking on idle land every day that could produce great wealth, if only they were allowed to get at it with spade and shovel.  It is an anomaly that in this country, where there is a great desire to make the land produce all that it possibly could, that we have people who are the potential producers of wealth, walking over the land with their hands in their pockets looking for work.  If facilities were given to them to work the land they would do so.  I think that is a Government job.</P>
    <P>I will hark back to the time when there was an avid desire for the production of food, when a Minister for Agriculture, with great wisdom and great energy, introduced a Bill to give agricultural plots for the production of food.  I was associated with that movement, and gave three acres of my land for the purpose.  I was a member of a Food Production Committee that arranged to put agricultural labourers who were out of employment at work on the land, and I was amazed at the amount of wealth, in the shape of vegetables, that were grown on three acres.  If I could have displayed the same energy, and if I could have produced the same amount of produce, or 50 per cent. of it on my whole farm, I would have been a millionaire in the course of a few years.  That experience made a notable impression on my mind.  The Act that provided these plots is still in existence.  There are certain little flaws in it.  We found when we came to the end of the term that the people to whom one-sixth or one-eighth of an acre had been let were loth to yield it up.  We had some difficulty with some of them.  It is a very ticklish thing to let land in that way, or to give what might be a vested interest in it.  Some of those who got it consulted lawyers, and we had some difficulty in getting the land back into the possession of the Committee. That difficulty was overcome <Col N="121" /> afterwards, because, when making further lettings it was by way of conacre, which only permitted the holder to take one crop each year and established no vested interest.  That provision is in the Act, and I suppose there will be no difficulty in working it.</P>
    <P>In the position, as we find it, with the gradual depopulation of the rural districts, serious consequences will flow from that in the course of time, so that the sooner we get back to normality the better.  Meantime it is the duty of the Government to see that the rural population is held, and in order to do so I suggest that the Minister has in that Act the whole machinery at his disposal.  The Minister also has at his disposal the agricultural and technical instructors throughout the Saorstát.  Voluntary committees were at work in the past. Whether there is enough civic spirit abroad now to form these committees again and help to revive such work, I cannot say, but I believe, with a little activity on the part of the Department, that could be brought about.  I am sure that when people saw the gravity of the situation they would enter into the working of these committees.</P>
    <P>It may be said that there may be a difficulty about getting land.  The thing to aim at is to get it near large communities.  I do not think it would be any hardship if the Minister approached farmers who are now pleading very great distress, and who say that they cannot cultivate any crops with advantage, to give some of their land for such a purpose.  If committees approached farmers and agreed to take three or five acres of second-class land, and to pay a grazing rent, or a little more, for it for five years, and then to return it after it had been dug by spade labour, when it was very much improved in value with a Government guarantee, I do not think any farmer would have reason to grumble.  It will be found that some of them will put an extraordinary value on land when they are approached. We found that difficulty in Waterford.  In fact I was the only one who voluntarily gave three acres. Compulsory powers had to be applied <Col N="122" /> in order to get more land around Waterford.  It was wonderful how valuable the land was when the owners were approached for some of it!  This question can be settled at once.  There is an Act of Parliament in existence, and it only requires a little amendment in order to put it into working order again.  The time is ripe for doing so.  This is the time for digging in order to prepare for the spring crop. I throw out that suggestion to the Minister.  There may be something in it.  At least there are great potentialities in the provision of plots of two or three acres, similar to those provided in 1922 or 1923.</P>
