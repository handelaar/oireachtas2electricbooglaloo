      <P>Senators will observe that a great many Bills appear on the Order Paper to-day, and this is due, no doubt, to the fact that the Dáil is shortly about to adjourn for the Summer Recess.  I suggest to the House that we should proceed to-day with the business in order as printed until there is a general desire to adjourn.  To-morrow I propose to ask the House to commence at 3 o'clock with Senator Milroy's motion (which I do not think will take very long), followed by the Report of the Committee on Procedure. If there is any time available when these items have been finished, we can continue consideration of Bills.  If it becomes desirable for the House to meet on Friday I understand that a notice of motion has been handed in to suspend the Standing Orders to enable the House to meet at 11.30 a.m. on that day. Perhaps I should add that I have been requested by the Minister for Finance to postpone the consideration of the Finance Bill until to-morrow, as he will be unable to be present to-day.</P>

      <P>This is a short Bill. As the Seanad no doubt is aware, the control of houses under existing legislation will terminate on the 24th of this month.  This is a Bill which continues the existing legislation up to the 31st of December next.  The reason why I have chosen the 31st of December is that if it becomes necessary for me to carry on this legislation it would be more conveniently done by the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill than by coming before the Dáil and Seanad year after year.  However, I hope that before the 31st of December I will introduce a general Bill dealing with the whole problem in relation to the tenancy of houses in towns and cities.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief in what I have to say, but I feel compelled to make my usual protest against this hardy annual. As long as measures of this kind are being brought in here and remain on the Statute Book it is only futile to expect that enormous expenditure on the part of the State will settle this housing question.  The only rational way it can be done is through the agency of private enterprise, and private enterprise will not go on so long as measures of this kind remain in force.  The Minister let drop a qualification just now which offers one hope of comfort. He suggested that it might not be necessary to carry on this legislation beyond the end of the current year.  I do hope, if he has in contemplation a larger measure to deal with the matter of housing, he will allow rents to operate on the ordinary economic basis.  Why should rent be the only commodity that is now controlled? Clothing, food, and all other services are operating in a free market, and you have only to get a steady price level to see that these things are rapidly adjusting themselves to the law of supply and demand. Why alone should house-owners, <Col N="1527" /> who have taken a very great risk in providing capital for these important services, be penalised?  I say that they have taken a risk. They have fixed their money in houses instead of putting it into liquid securities, which they could realise at any time they wished. Why should they be penalised because they have invested their money in a national service?  Until rents are freely allowed to operate you can never settle the housing question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to find Senator Sir John Keane again trotting out these arguments against the Rent Restrictions Bill.  He is opposing the Bill on the ground that it is detrimental to the solution of the housing problem through the free play of private enterprise.  I could understand the force of that argument if there was any control whatever over the rents charged for any houses now being built, or any house that has been built since 1919. As the Seanad knows, since 1919 there is no control whatever over houses built.  On the contrary there are State subsidies, rates remissions and every encouragement that can be reasonably given to the extent that we can get the present Government to give to private enterprise to build houses.  In spite of that the speculative builders have not responded in a way that is calculated to settle the housing problem within the next ten or fifteen years.  What the Senator suggests is a further method of augmenting or aggravating the position that now exists, to allow the rent of every house be increased to what he calls the economic level which would, of course, involve an impossible burden on the tenants in view of the present housing shortage. I can understand the Senator's attitude from the viewpoint of a landowner, but all the same I should have imagined that he would have advanced an argument that would hold water, and not such an argument as the one he has advanced. I do hope that the Minister will introduce a comprehensive <Col N="1528" /> measure regulating the relations between landlords and tenants in towns and cities before this measure expires.  I say that because the whole position is far from satisfactory in view of the Report of the Town Tenants Commission which was presented long ago.  It is surprising that, since then, time has not been found for the introduction of a town tenants measure in view of the fact that time has been found for measures not at all as important as this.</P>

      <P>In one respect Senator Sir John Keane is right.  There is nothing so bad as uncertainty.  Temporary laws dealing with questions of this kind are bad because they are leading to uncertainty.  That is the only point in which I agree with Senator Sir John Keane.  I agree that the rents of houses in towns should be restricted permanently for an economic reason.</P>
      <P>The economic reason is this, that whereas goods and other things can be produced <i>ad lib</i>, lands in the neighbourhood of towns cannot be extended or increased.  The land available in the towns is limited.  The Minister must know that legislation of this kind, of a purely temporary nature, owing to its uncertainty, is very bad.  But I take it that now in introducing this Bill he has promised that this year he will introduce a permanent measure dealing with this question of housing in the towns and dealing with the rents of these houses.</P>

      <P>It was difficult to hear the Minister.  Was there a definite promise by the Minister that a Bill would be introduced?  Did the Minister say that it would not be necessary to extend this Bill beyond the 31st December next because other legislation for town tenants would be introduced, and is that why he is introducing this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I hope to introduce two measures before the end of December.  One will deal with the question of town tenants, which I look upon as a permanent question.  The other will deal with <Col N="1529" /> rent restrictions, and I regard it as a temporary expedient to meet a temporary difficulty in regard to housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad indeed to hear the last few words which the Minister has uttered because it has been evident to me since the report of the Town Tenants Commission was published and from resolutions passed impressing on the Government the importance of bringing in legislation, that there has been a good deal of misconception abroad on this matter, and I am very glad to find from what the Minister said that he is not going to be led away in this matter by the shopkeepers in the small towns.  I think that is the problem.  At least that is the explanation of the difficulties perhaps with which the Government has been faced.  I know that there is urgency in respect to established shops and the like in the small towns and also houses that are owned by the present occupants.  In cases where their leases are likely to fall in, every postponement in the bringing in of the Town Tenants Bill is making it more and more difficult for any repairs to be done to these houses or shops.  The position is in general very unsatisfactory, but in regard to the other aspect, in the matter of persons who are living in houses in towns and cities that are at present subject to the Rent Restriction Acts, if the Report of the Town Tenants Commission is to be put into operation, as has been demanded in respect of these houses, I very much suspect that the remedy is going to be much worse than the disease, because it is practically an invitation that any person who is aggrieved by the landlord charging any rent he likes will have to go and take his case into court.  I think that is quite impracticable and I think the trouble that is going to arise will be very great.  Therefore I am glad to be encouraged in the hope by the Minister's statement that the question of rent restrictions for houses in towns is going to be detached from that of the general question of town tenants, which in the main, I think, signifies shopkeeping tenancies and the larger <Col N="1530" /> type of tenancies, not the working class tenancies in the towns.  In regard to Senator Sir John Keane's statement it is very much like a statement made in the Dáil last week that the housing problem could be solved by allowing free play of the economic forces and of the ordinary agencies, financial inducement and so on.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand this mentality on the part of anyone who has lived in Ireland for the last forty or fifty years.  I cannot understand such a person advancing such a proposal. Was the labourers' cottages problem in the country solved by the ordinary play of economic forces?  It was not.  I do not know that anyone is prepared to say that it could have been.  It was said&mdash;presumably the statement was made by Deputy Good&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I qualify that by saying that if the State was not prepared to take up the liability for housing it could be solved in another way.  The labourers' cottages problem has been solved by a lavish expenditure from the resources of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of degree as to State assistance.  I do not know whether the Senator wants us to say that there are circumstances in which he would approve of the State coming to the aid of this housing problem.  However, if he admits that it is right that the State should come to the assistance of private enterprise, and if private enterprise has failed to solve this problem then it is simply a question of how far the State should intervene and how much assistance should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is alleged that even in urban districts private enterprise, if left to itself and the ordinary play of economic forces, would solve the problem. It was said that in 1906 private enterprise had built sufficient houses, that the demand and supply met, or rather, that the supply was greater than the demand.  That was supposed to be the position in 1906, but anybody who knows Dublin knows <Col N="1531" /> how utterly false that was.  I suppose the same is true of every other town in the country.  In 1911 and 1913 you had several reports on the state of housing.  That was absolute proof without any possibility of refutation that the housing problem had not been solved by the free play of private enterprise or of economic forces, so that the necessity for legislative intervention is proved up to the hilt.  The question of method is not one I am going to discuss now.  I think it is evident that there is a necessity for the passing of this Bill to extend the existing Act, which expires before the end of this month.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to impede the progress of the Bill, but I would be glad if the Minister would give us an approximate idea, either now or on the concluding Stages of the Bill, as to the amount of money for which the State has made itself responsible in connection with these trade loans.  It may not be fair to ask for that statement now but at a later stage the Minister might give us that information.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes I would like to know is there really any necessity for the Bill?  Are the facilities provided under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act being availed of to any extent? As far as one can make out from inquiries of a private nature, it would seem as if the Act has been more or less of a failure and that private enterprise does not avail of the facilities for getting advances under the Act, either because of unreasonable rates or for some other reason.  If the Act is not being availed of it seems unnecessary to have this Bill at all.  I would like to know from the Minister, apart from the actual amount allotted, whether there are many applications under consideration, or whether he thinks there is any likelihood of the facilities being availed of to any considerable extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand the question put by Senator Hooper, but I will endeavour to answer him in this way.  Loans to the extent of £320,000 or £330,000 have been guaranteed by the State.  If the information which the Senator is seeking is as to how much money the State will have to pay, in case those who are primarily responsible for the loans fail to discharge their liabilities, that I cannot answer at the moment.  If the Senator means that concerns helped through the agency of the Trade Loans Act may fail and that he wishes to know what the State will lose, I can only give him an approximate idea.  It would amount to this: that if no money be realised from the sale of the assets the State will have to meet a bill amounting to one-third of the entire money guaranteed. That is on the basis that no money will be received from the realisable assets of concerns guaranteed under the Act.  That is the only information I can give the Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much obliged to the Minister, but the information on which I based my question was obtained in this way. Last year the Minister told the Dáil, if I recollect aright, that advances had been made to an amount, I think, of £400,000.  Only a month or two before then a loan of one-quarter of a million was sought from the public and, I presume, secured from the public on a Government guarantee.  When the Minister made that statement he said that very little was being done under the Act, and, as far as I know, very little has been done under the Act.  Why was it necessary then to raise that quarter of a million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. Hooper Mr. Hooper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a quarter of a million raised by the Industrial Trust Company on Government security.  Am I right in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different thing altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. Hooper Mr. Hooper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the State not responsible for that money?</P>

      <P>But it is involved there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The State has lodged certain funds to the credit of the Industrial Trust Corporation&mdash; not one quarter of a million.  That is entirely distinct from the Trade Loans Guarantee Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHooper" hpid="Mr. Hooper Mr. Hooper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hooper</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely that money was in respect of trade loans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Investment Corporation is, in fact, intended to supply certain trade loans, but it is quite distinct from the question of the Trade Loans Act. The two things are entirely apart, and the directors are two different bodies.  There is no binding obligation on the Corporation to advance money upon a trade loans guarantee more than upon anything else.  I do not think I have committed myself <Col N="1534" /> to the statement that £400,000 had been advanced from the commencement of the Act.  The figure is round about £320,000 or £330,000. There has been very little received in the way of repayments since. There has been one successful case. Senator O'Farrell's question relates to a different matter.  It is very hard at any time of the year to say what the prospects are in regard to applications for loans for the ensuing twelve months.  Numerous inquiries come forward.  The number of inquiries that afterwards lead to anything is a very small percentage of the total inquiries received.  At the moment I can think of only about four cases which are likely to come forward.  One was brought forward a couple of years ago under very good auspices, but it disappeared for reasons entirely unconnected with the State.  I understand that this is to be brought forward again. It is undoubtedly a very good proposal, and will lead to a considerable amount of benefit to the State.</P>
      <P>There is one other application about which it is very hard to make any statement at the moment, because technically it should be ruled out as not being within the four corners of the Act.  If it were brought within the four corners of the Act it would involve a commitment of more than the remnant of the million I have at my disposal.  It is a proposal of a very big character, which it is quite likely will be dealt with in another way.  Outside these two applications there are two others which I can think of, but even for these four we think it is necessary to keep the Act still in being.  The applications received result in a considerable number of inquiries being instituted, but very often they come to nothing in the end.</P>

      <P>I think it would be <Col N="1536" /> necessary to have some explanation of this Bill and what it is about from the Minister.  I want to draw attention to the fact that though it may be customary for some of us to make ourselves acquainted with the case for and against Bills by reading the debates that took place in the Dáil, we only got the debates this morning for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday last, so that it was impossible to do so.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was the practice not to have any statement on the Second Reading in the Seanad.  This is a difficult Bill to this extent, that it is necessarily legislation by reference to start with, and secondly, because most of the clauses stand on their own.  There is very little connection between the different sections.  The first section is merely a defining section.  The second section calls for a small change.  It brings in under the definition of &ldquo;local authority&rdquo;&ldquo;any body of persons having power under an Act of Parliament of Ireland or any local or personal Act of the United Kingdom Parliament to assess and levy a rate on land or on persons in respect of their occupation of land.&rdquo;  That is specially brought in to bring within the definition of &ldquo;local authority,&rdquo; and consequently to bring into legislation dealing with the Electricity Supply Board, the Commissioners of Merrion Square, who have the right to levy for certain purposes on property adjoining the Square.  It may bring in other property as well.  We think it desirable that the phrase &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; should have that wider application.  The third section is to meet a difficulty which arose in the course of the construction work under the Act of 1925.  I got very extended powers, but in carrying out my duties I found I had to contract obligations with certain outsiders, and they were not as clear of my powers under the Act of 1925 as I <Col N="1537" /> was.  I want to remove any doubt that may exist in their minds.  Under Section 3 I was given certain power. Details of the powers given me are set out, but in order to avoid any defect and to close every hole this is to alter paragraph (m), which gives me power to do anything necessary or expedient to do.  That seems to be sufficiently wide to cover most things, but, nevertheless, at a certain period of the contract parties had doubts as to my powers not being wide enough.  What I want to do, instead of paying compensation to people for damage done, is to be able to repair the damage, and I believe, by having contractors under me bound by certain obligations, I can get the work done much more cheaply than they could if they had to go round and get their own contractors.</P>
      <P>A doubt arose as to whether I had power to do certain things in lieu of compensation.  The whole thing is governed by the words &ldquo;in lieu of compensation.&rdquo;  I take power here, and it is retrospective, that where a person is entitled to compensation in respect of anything lawfully done or intended to be done &ldquo;the Minister may execute for the benefit of such person such works as the Minister thinks proper, and such person agrees to accept in satisfaction or partial satisfaction of his claim for such compensation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On sub-section (5), if in carrying out any powers I have I find the works going to be done are works that would ordinarily be counted as part of the Shannon works, and be granted exemption under the old Act, then I want to make clear&mdash;and I have to have the consent of the Minister for Local Government in this&mdash;that the exemption applies to the minor type of work as well as the main Shannon work.  This sub-section is inserted in order to meet a situation that if I hand over works executed in lieu of compensation, and if those works <Col N="1538" /> had to be valued and pay rates&mdash; it is very hard to get the true valuation put on these works&mdash;certain subtractions would have to be made, and it would be very difficult to get parity.  It looks as if I were seeking wide power, but it is only to the minor works this sub-section has reference.  Sections 4, 5, and 6 are finance sections.  Section 4 is designed to meet one difficulty.  That difficulty arose in connection with the purchase of the Cork station. Under the old Act, we gave to the Board a maximum sum of £2,500,000. That maximum sum is not being interfered with, but under the old Act a prohibition was put on the Minister for Finance against granting more than £400,000 in a single half-year. It so happens that the bargain for the Cork station involves more than £400,000 and has to be paid in one sum.  Consequently, if the Board has made contractual obligations it must be enabled to receive from the Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Finance must be empowered to grant more than £400,000 in any half-year.  It is always within the discretion of the Minister for Finance to over-ride the maximum sum of £2,500,000.  The sum under the 1925 Act still remains. It is not an increase in the sum given to the Board but only a licence to the Minister for Finance to grant more than £400,000 in any particular half-year.  Sections 5 and 6 deal with the rates of interest.  As the original Act stood the rate of interest to be paid by the Board on the advance had to be fixed at the time of the advance.  Advances may be made and are being made from time to time out of State moneys which have been raised at different times on which the rates of interest may vary.  It is only fair that the Board should have to pay, at least, the same rate of interest as the State finds it necessary to pay when borrowing, plus whatever charges there are for the accommodation.  It is in order to enable the Minister for Finance to vary the rate of interest this section was put in.  Otherwise, he would be tied to a particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> Section 7 of the amending legislation contains a change in the finances of the Act, but on very minor points dealing not with a matter of interest, but rather with a matter of time. The change is definitely shown in the sub-section which is being inserted. It is contained in paragraph (b).</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All interest due on the said advances or any part thereof at the time when the Board becomes liable under this section for the repayment of the said advances or such part thereof shall be paid to the Minister for Finance within the period of six months or such longer period as the said Minister shall in any particular case direct.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under the old Act repayments fell due and had to be made within a period of six months.  Now it has become clear that there are certain questions with regard to compensation which will not be decided for some little time, and consequently it will not be possible even at the date when certain property of the Government is handed over to the Electricity Supply Board to determine the full liability, and consequently the sum upon which interest has to be paid.  That cannot be determined until the six months' period, or such longer period as the Minister for Finance may determine.  It is to meet that small point.  The other sections also make the same change with regard to time.  Section 8 carries forward the same definition of local authorities as in Sub-section 2 of Section 96 in the principal Act. Section 9 amends the first schedule of the principal Act by inserting the words, &ldquo;receive from such authorised undertaker or statutory undertaker.&rdquo; Senators will see that by the first schedule people were entitled to compensation, but it did not say who were to pay the compensation.</P>
    <P>Sections 10, 11 and 12 deal with rates, and although the three sections will have to be considered separately, the main effect of the sections could be described in this <Col N="1540" /> way: Section 96 of the original Act is maintained.  That is the section which exempts from liability to rates the Shannon works as defined in the Principal Act, and the other two sections go to make it clear that where the Electricity Supply Board takes over property, maintaining the exemption granted under Section 96.  Where the Board takes over any other property than one of these the section declares that the rates shall be payable.  We cannot stop simply at that point, for we have to prevent certain raisings of valuations in a penal way against the Board, say, in the case of undertakings to be acquired after the date of the Act the valuation is stereotyped at the rate it was at the date of the vesting order.  If the date of the vesting order is the date prior to the passing of this Act, then the valuation is as it was on the first day of the financial year of 1929. We stereotype those valuations against the Board for all time, and where the Board leaves property unused it will be valued as when it was taken over.  If the Board decides, having become possessed of the Dublin station, to abandon it and to build a new station, it will still continue to pay rates on the old station at the rate paid on the day of the vesting order.  That is a temporary expedient that may be re-adjusted afterwards.  Another section says that hereafter any premises which the Board builds and does not acquire for the purpose of generation or distribution fall within the exemption granted by Section 96, and they are relieved from liability to rates.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the three sections is that on premises which the Board acquires, and from which local authorities in the past have been in the habit of receiving money, the local authority is going to get that sum for the future.  It is going to get the rates, whatever they may be, fixed on the valuation which is stereotyped, if fixed after 1st April, 1929, or on the date of the vesting order if the vesting order bears a date prior to the introduction of the <Col N="1541" /> Act.  It will be noted that if the Board builds in any area where there are no premises at the moment, say, for a showroom or offices, that falls liable to valuation and to payment of the rates in the ordinary way.  Sections 13 and 14 deal with the compensation of employees. There are two small points about which doubts have arisen in the Principal Act.  It is quite possible that if these were to be decided by litigation they would be decided against the Board, and it has been decided, to save the expense of litigation, to settle the matter once and for all by legislation.  Section 13 meets a difficulty.  The terms of compensation were set out in the schedule of the 1927 Act.  That compensation began to flow when the Board closed down an undertaking by order, but on any occasion on which the Board, by order, closes down a generation station compensation under the old Act still continued to flow, and the scheme of the old Act would operate against the generation station either by an order closing down or by taking over. When it took over under the scheme of 1927 the Board became an authorised undertaking, and we intended compensation to apply.  That did not work out.  This is necessary to establish that compensation flows, whether there is a closing order issued by the Board or whether the Board closes down after taking over. It does away with the necessity for a closing order before compensation flows.  Section 14 deals with another small point.  Where an undertaking is closed down because it is taking a bulk supply, then again compensation flows to the employees of the generating station who are dispossessed.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the Bill had certain defects inasmuch as it was legislation by reference.  Of course, that is an inevitable defect, but there are certain principles in the Bill which are wrong.  The first principle which is wrong is this: there is a clause which provides that any new buildings to be erected by the Board <Col N="1542" /> shall be exempt from rates, while any buildings to be acquired by the Board are to be liable, but up to a certain fixed figure.</P>

      <P>There is another point which affects the principle of the Bill.  There are certain vested fishing rights which were injured, and which have been acquired by the Board, in respect of which compensation is payable.  There are also the cot fishermen about Killaloe who have no vested rights, but I think the Seanad should insist on their getting compensation.  The Minister said in the Dáil that in respect of lands which have been permanently flooded compensation is paid.  The result of the slowing down of the flow of the Shannon has been to render a considerable area of land liable to flooding, but there is no provision for compensation in that case.  I mention these matters in order that the Seanad may be in possession of some of the objections to the Bill.  The main objection is that there are Shannon works erected in County Clare that under the law were rateable and should be rateable, just the same as premises acquired <Col N="1543" /> are admitted to be rated.  I do not know whether these matters should be dealt with now or in Committee. I leave the decision to the Cathaoirleach. They are very serious matters for a certain part of the country.</P>

      <P>I have been reading the long discussion which took place in the Dáil on the question of flooding.  The Minister made certain lengthy statements which were rather confusing.  He defined flooding as what he calls permanent flooding&mdash;that is, flooding over the whole year&mdash;but when it comes to a question of flooding for short periods&mdash; for instance, an overflow of the lake on account of a temporary holding back of the water&mdash;he seemed to entirely exclude these from any right to compensation.  He suggested that that flooding to a certain extent was rather an advantage to the owners than otherwise.  Afterwards he seemed to wind a great deal around this matter, and was not clear as to whether people subjected to temporary flooding on account of the works would get any compensation or not.</P>

The Shannon Navigation is shut up and these people have lost their employment, and I want to ask the Minister if he would make provision for having them included amongst the people covered by Section 13.

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just one or two questions on general principle on which I would like information. The first is the implication of the words &ldquo;Shannon works.&rdquo; When the Oireachtas, in the 1927 Act, exempted the Shannon works, I do not think it ever contemplated that the County Clare should be prejudiced by that action.  All I think the House ever thought was that the County Clare would get no benefit inasmuch as the buildings erected there for the Shannon Scheme would not be rated.  But the actual facts have gone much further.  Certain lands have been acquired by the Electricity Supply Board, and these lands represent, of course, in the books of the County Council a certain rateable value, and that rateable value has now been destroyed. I understand the County Council is the loser, so far as the rates are concerned, on the Shannon works, to the extent of something between £400 <Col N="1545" /> and £600 a year.  I think in equity that should be restored in some way, because I do not believe it was ever the intention of the Oireachtas that the County Clare should be the loser if it was not its intention that it should benefit.  As to the general principle of this rating exemption, I think the Minister should make the case as to why he has departed from the old practice.  This is an entirely new practice with regard to rating under this Bill.</P>
      <P>One can understand exemptions, partial or total, but this stereotyping of valuations is very puzzling. Apparently the Minister is afraid of the raising of valuations in some penal way, but surely it is not suggested that the machinery of the Valuation Office would be disposed to act in a penal manner towards anybody, including the Electricity Supply Board.  Surely if it is likely to act in a penal manner towards the Electricity Supply Board, it is equally likely to act in a penal manner towards the ordinary citizen.  Besides the Electricity Supply Board will enjoy all the safeguards that the ordinary citizen enjoys.  It can appeal to the revising valuer, and bring the case to the courts.  I think the word &ldquo;penal&rdquo; is puzzling in that connection.  I am not clear how far this stereotyping extends.  Apparently if the Minister requires an undertaking that is no longer occupied, it still pays the stereotyped rate.  Then apparently if sold to the ordinary citizen, the Electricity Supply Board still continues to be liable for the stereotyped assessment.  In addition to that there is the new objection also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems all so puzzling, and it seems to me to be an unnecessary complication to introduce into a fairly straightforward, well established valuation law.  It strikes me, also, that it might become a somewhat dangerous precedent. Moreover, there appears to be a somewhat arbitrary distinction between works and other property. As regards the works themselves that will be quite clear, but surely there will be a lot on the border <Col N="1546" /> line cases, of assembly shops, or repair shops, dealing with smaller fittings that would come under the ordinary valuation law?  I raise all these points because it occurred to me that they are rather puzzling. No doubt the lawyers had gone into all this, but even this Bill shows that the lawyers cannot sometimes foresee things, and it is therefore necessary to call attention to these difficulties.  Would the Minister be prepared to make a statement now with regard to the position of permitted undertakers?  I wish to meet the Minister in a reasonable way in this, but it has been hanging up for a very long time.  I know the inner history of this possibly as well as he does, but these negotiations have been going on for nearly two years now and it is time that the matter should be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a particular case that I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  There is the case of the Electricity Supply Station in Cork, which is a permitted undertaking, and which was also responsible for the carrying on of the tramway system in that city. By the taking over of the power station of that company it is very likely that the tramway system will close down.  It is generally believed in Cork that the electricity end was the paying end, whereas the tramway company was uneconomic.  In this instance, if the tramway undertaking is closed down, the tramway men, it would appear to me, would have as good a claim for compensation as the men in the power house. I would like some information as to whether these men can be covered by an amendment or by some arrangement arrived at in Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another case of the men employed at the Pigeon House as coal fuellers that I would like to bring forward.  They were temporary employees of the Corporation. These men worked there for a number of years.  The taking over of the Pigeon House by the Electricity Supply Board, and the elimination of coal, will mean that these men's services will be dispensed <Col N="1547" /> with.  I should like to know what position these men will be in as regards compensation.  These men are as much affected by the taking over of the Pigeon House as are the men in the generating station, and the same applies to the tramway men in Cork.  I should like to have the Minister's views on these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

      <P>I want to ask one question which, strictly speaking, does not relate to any particular clause of this Bill, but, perhaps, as we are dealing with the Bill in connection with the Electricity Supply Board generally, the Minister could give me some information upon this point.  The services of the Grand Canal Company have been suspended for the last year.  I would like to know if there is any possibility, or likelihood, of this service being restored soon.  The hardship is an economic one on the traders and people in that area in so far as there is a very wide discrepancy in the rates to Limerick, Killaloe, and all places south as between the charges of the Grand Canal Company and the Railway Company.  In some cases the difference amounts to from 18/6 to 25/6 per ton.  I want to know if there is any possibility of getting the Grand Canal Company to operate that route again for traffic and if it would be possible to make any accommodation arrangement with the railway company or induce them to give adjusted rates to meet the emergency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of exemption from rates was raised by Senator Comyn and Senator Sir John Keane.  As I understand Senator Comyn is going to ask the <Col N="1548" /> Seanad to accept the principle of exempting all buildings, I will leave that over until the amendment comes on.  Senator Sir John Keane raised certain points which would not be met by a specific amendment.  He asked if this was a new practice in rating law that was being introduced. It is a new practice, and I do not defend it.  If I had any thought of its being followed, I should certainly not hold it up as a model.  It is a temporary expedient, to be used as such, and the only reason for it is this: here we have a big undertaking started with a board which has given to it the task of recovering, through payments made by electricity consumers, the moneys which the State has embarked on in this scheme to the extent of nearly nine million pounds, all told.  It was definitely recognised at the time that the Shannon scheme was embarked upon that there was going to be a period of between one and a half and three years during which one could not expect the electricity consumer to bear all the burdens that would afterwards fall upon him, and because of that we capitalised a certain amount of the arrears.  In these circumstances, I am met with this situation: that the Electricity Supply Board had legal opinion as to whether they were liable at all for rates and income tax.  I had always told them, when they were set up, that they were liable for income tax and for rates on property that they acquired.  I want to insist that they carry out the obligations which were before them when they entered on their duties, but I do not want to put any extra obligations upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain local authorities have been in the habit of looking to certain property that they had as a means of getting income.  I do not want to deprive them of that income at the moment.  The Electricity Supply Board entered on its task in the knowledge that the Shannon works, as such, were exempt from rates.  I do not want to throw back on the Board an obligation which the Oireachtas previously took from them, but in a few years' time, when <Col N="1549" /> they are able to make both ends meet and to pay their way&mdash;the indications at the moment are that before next year is out, that is to say, a year before the latest date that we gave them, they will be paying their way&mdash;will be the time to have the whole thing reconsidered.</P>
    <P>As between the electricity consumer and what he pays, and the taxpayer who might have to pay more if the Board had not to pay income tax, and the ratepayers in the different localities, we cannot take away an exemption that was previously granted to the Board by Section 96 of the Act, throw on them the full charges with respect to rates on the whole of the Shannon works, and then stereotype, as we do in this Bill, certain payments which certain local authorities have been getting during the past year or two. This is a temporary expedient.  But nobody, with the finances of the Electricity Supply Board as they are, could, in addition to the £60,000 now imposed on them as a first charge which they must meet for rates, put upon them a valuation of the whole of the Shannon property and then strike a rate on that.</P>
    <P>That would mean that you would be making them pay twice for certain things.  Two years, or one year, hence will be the time to deal with the question of putting the whole Shannon property under rates.  When that time comes I think there will have to be an adjustment of certain burdens which the Board have to bear at present.  That is the principle upon which I am working.  It would not be fair to make this Board operate with all the burdens of an ordinary commercial undertaking with regard to rates and income tax, and at the same time put upon them a burden which no commercial undertaking at the moment shoulders&mdash; that is to say, the repayment of its capital within a certain period.  If the Board is going to be made a commercial undertaking, suffering the penalty of rates and income tax, we certainly must say, &ldquo;Very well, as an ordinary commercial business operate as a commercial Board,&rdquo; but <Col N="1550" /> it would be unfair to say to them, &ldquo;We are putting upon you charges in relation to rates and income tax and, at the same time, simply because you are financed from the Central Fund, we are imposing on you all the obligations that flow from Central Fund financing, that is to say, liability for interest and sinking fund charges.&rdquo;  When that is equalised and spread out, then I think we will have a proper adjustment as between the electricity consumer, the taxpayer and the ratepayer, but I think it is a little bit too soon to do that yet.</P>
    <P>I put this before the Seanad: that as everyone now is very keen on this undertaking, and because it has now come to a better point of success than even the most optimistic of us dared to hope, is hardly the time to come and put upon the Board an obligation that was never thought of at the time the 1927 Act was going through.  So far from remitting any charges, we are putting upon the Board much heavier obligations than any commercial concern is asked to shoulder.  Senator Sir John Keane spoke of stereotyping penal rates.  I am not doing anything of the kind.  With regard to electricity undertakings, I think the rating system at present in operation is unjust to hydro-electric schemes.  If a station were run on fuel it would get certain allowances with regard to coal, the capital expended on the purchase of oil and certain other things.  A hydro-electric station gets none of these advantages.  When the Bills in connection with the hydro-electric scheme for the Liffey were before the Joint Committee of the Oireachtas this fact emerged, that the Dublin power-house, which was then run on fuel, had a certain valuation.  It was pointed out that if the Dublin power-house were supplied from the Liffey its valuation would be raised four times.  I think that is unfair, and that a change must be made in the law.</P>
    <P>So far as hydro-electric schemes are concerned, there is a penalty in the law as it stands.  There is this further fact to be considered, that <Col N="1551" /> some three years ago the amount derived in rates from the Dublin undertaking amounted to about £5,000 a year.  At the moment the sum is £30,000.  Why that should be so I do not know.  It is certainly not because there has been such an advance in the value of the property. In the past there may have been laxity in appealing against the valuation, but the rate payment to-day in regard to the Dublin station is £30,000, whereas three or four years ago it was £5,000.  Senators should know that the figure that I am stereotyping in this Bill is the £30,000 and not the £5,000.  I think that even when one considers these things there is a case for stereotyping these payments for a year or two.  The Electricity Supply Board knows what its obligations are.  One is that local authorities who have been in the habit of getting money from certain rateable property now taken over will know under this Bill what they are entitled to get for a year or two.  I admit that before the property is taken from them they ought to get notice.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane wanted information with regard to certain other matters&mdash;that we knew the position as regards the power-house and the show-rooms, but as to certain other things that might be betwixt and between I think Section 11 deals with the point raised by the Senator, and is rather precise on it.  It is, I think, met in paragraph (d) of sub-section (2).  It reads:</P>
    <P>(2) This section applies to every hereditament or tenement which, for the time being&mdash;</P>
    <P>(d) is used exclusively as a generating station or as a transmission system or part of a transmission system or as a distribution system or part of a distribution system.</P>
    <P>In other words, if there is any element of anything else the exemption does not apply.  As to the permitted undertakers, I do not know exactly what the situation is between their Association and the Board, but I do know where I stand <Col N="1552" /> in the matter.  I made very definite promises both here and in the Dáil with regard to the permitted undertakers. I put the matter this way: that the permitted undertakers could only be bought out by their own agreement.  In other words, that if there was a question of price the price had to be one to which they agreed.  It was put to me at the time that there was a loophole in the clause that I introduced, because it spoke of something like an alternative supply being at hand or available.  It was pointed out to me that when the Shannon supply came along there would be an alternative supply, and people might be ruled out.  I was glad the question was put to me by, I think, Deputy Thrift.  I answered that I thought the matter should be adjusted before two years had passed, and we were then two years off the supply from the Shannon current.  I certainly said my idea was that the right of these undertakers to fix their own terms remained: that if we did not get success under that system of agreement, there would then have to be legislation, and I am still standing by that.  If the permitted undertakers have a grievance, and if in fact any of them are being ousted from their occupations because an available supply is being put in on top of them, then that is a breach of the spirit of the 1927 Act, although it may not be a breach of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew they had made the offer but I had no information that they had withdrawn it.  I think that arbitration is the proper method.  If the permitted undertakers like to stand by what was undoubtedly the rights given to them, or at least intended to be given to them by the Oireachtas in 1927, it may mean new legislation, but that will have to be brought in.  I think <Col N="1553" /> I said at the time that as the permitted undertakers were a statutory body that we had no right to demand information from them, and therefore we could not know what their commitments were.  We were given power to call for certain returns.  I said that if on those returns no agreement was reached we could then come before the Oireachtas with the fuller information made available, and I still stand by that.</P>
      <P>Numerous questions were asked regarding compensation.  If there is any question of land being flooded, permanently or temporarily, as long as it flows from any portion of the Shannon and it can be proved, then compensation must be paid.  That was a definite right given by the 1925 Act and it cannot be defeated. But what can be defeated are spurious claims.  If everyone who has a bit of land that gets flooded says that flooding is due to the Shannon Scheme, well that is a matter that is susceptible of proof. The situation, at any rate, is that if people suffer they can claim.  If their claims are not met they can demand arbitration and force arbitration under a particular process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case of individual cot-men around Killaloe has been referred to, while Senator Foran referred to two sections of people: those employed in the tramway end of the Cork undertaking and certain coal fuellers at the Pigeon House.  I must draw the line somewhere about compensation. I cannot have the whole community getting compensation from the Shannon Scheme.  If I were to compensate the Killaloe fishermen, there is no reason why I should not compensate every one of the three million people in this State, because everyone in this State had the right to fish in the Shannon.  In the Dáil I used, by way of absurd analogy, such a case as Senator Foran has brought forward.  I said that if I were to compensate all the people who exercised a public right to fish in the Shannon, why should I not be asked to compensate the people who previously had got employment in the coal business and whose field of employment was likely to be limited in the future. <Col N="1554" /> That was not such a far-fetched analogy, because Senator Foran now brings in these very people as a special case to be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>While these men on whose behalf I have spoken were not permanent employees of the Corporation, they were at least indirectly employed by it to discharge the coal steamers.  That coal was used to generate the power distributed from the power-house.  In my opinion these men have as good a right to be regarded as employees of the Corporation as the men actually employed in the power-house.</P>

      <P>The case of the Shannon navigation employees was also mentioned.  I cannot compensate the employees of another undertaking. I cannot agree that the Shannon navigation employees have been completely thrown out of employment. Neither can I agree with Senator Connolly that the Shannon navigation has been closed.  My information is that it has been opened since the 24th February of this year. With regard to the Grand Canal Company, they wanted to put upon me a certain condition to render the passage down to Limerick even safer than it was previously.  I do not intend to be coerced into giving them a safer passage than was there previously. But, if they think they have a claim they can test that out as far as I am concerned.  I hold that the Shannon navigation has been opened since the 24th February. If there is any defect in it that is not due to me or to the Shannon scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan) John Marcus O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a pretty long Bill and I do not intend taking you through the whole of it.  I assume <Col N="1556" /> that the Senators have read the Dáil debates on this Bill.  The Bill is the result of the dissatisfaction of my Department with the system that exists at present and it is the result of the recommendations made by a Special Commission that devoted a great deal of time, energy and ability to an investigation of the whole problem of technical education. I may say that most of the provisions of the Bill follow the recommendations of that Commission. There are two exceptions in which the Bill is not following the recommendations of the Technical Commission. I have elsewhere called attention to these exceptions.  The most important is that we found it impossible to devise any working system of machinery that could enforce the whole-time attendance of boys and girls between the ages of fourteen and sixteen at technical classes.  It would be impossible to enforce the attendance of boys and girls between the ages of fourteen and sixteen.  Once you single out one particular class, namely, those not in employment or in suitable employment, we found it was impossible, when we examined the recommendations of the Commission and their implications, to carry out that recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter in which we have not attempted to carry out the recommendations of the Commission is on the question of apprenticeship legislation.  It was not because we felt that apprenticeship legislation was not desirable and necessary, but because to seven-eighths of its extent it fell within the sphere of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and that Department is preparing a Bill on the matter.  This present Bill only attempts to deal with the education of a large mass of the young people of the country from the age of fourteen onwards. It is true that a certain number of youngsters between the ages of fourteen and sixteen are already dealt with, both in the national schools and in the secondary schools, but far the larger number are practically untouched once they leave the national schools, except in so far as they are <Col N="1557" /> dealt with by the existing system of technical education.</P>
    <P>This is an important problem, and my remarks apply to the country as well as to the towns.  There is a tendency on the part of boys and girls when they leave school at the age of fourteen to forget a great deal of what they learned at school.  It is proposed to try to remedy that. There is the further problem, namely, the problem of the provision of technical education in the narrower sense to be tackled&mdash;namely, the intellectual side of the training for industry. That is what I call technical education in the narrower sense.  We have dealt with that problem as fully as we can from our present knowledge of the conditions and our present knowledge of the resources of the country.  There are two types of education dealt with in this Bill, one for want of a better term is called continuation education and the other technical education.  There is no new system introduced and no new principles practically to speak of except, to a limited extent, that of compulsion, which I will explain later on.  There are no new principles introduced either as regards control of technical education or continuation education.  The types of education that I have referred to, continuation and technical education in the narrower sense, are actually being provided under our existing system by the technical committees in different parts of the country.  So far as that is concerned there is no new condition.  What we really attempt in that respect is merely a better formulation of what is now in a chaotic condition.</P>
    <P>In the technical schools it has been objected that owing to the system &mdash;and not the schools, but the system is responsible&mdash;there is a great deal of confusion in mixing up altogether the wider vocational education and the narrower technical education.  This Bill tries, as far as legislation can do it, to prevent confusion of that kind.  It is a very big problem that we have before us in this country.  It is a problem that the country will have to face if it intends to keep its place <Col N="1558" /> in competition with other countries. This Bill is not a new departure.  It is a reform of the existing system. Control of vocational education and technical education will still, as heretofore, be in the hands of local committees.  There is no change introduced so far as the principle of control by committees is concerned &mdash;technically, that is.  At present local education authorities are the county councils and the borough or urban councils.  In future it will be the committees appointed by those bodies, that is the committees appointed by the county council and the borough council.  In practice there is no departure in principle there.  However, we have made the committees smaller.  Up to the present the committees have been absurdly large.  Of those often very few attended.  It was only on exceptional occasions that you had anything like a full muster, not when the ordinary routine committee work had to be performed.  The work had really to be carried on in practice by a small number of people who regularly attended.  In future we propose to limit the size of the committee, as Senators will see, if they refer to the second part of this Bill.  Furthermore, there is this provision in the Bill as it left the Dáil.  In the original Bill there was a provision that there should be fourteen members appointed by the county council, and that of these eight were to be members of the county council.  The whole fourteen could be members of the county council if the county council so desired.  That was my first attempt to deal with two conflicting interests.</P>
    <P>As the Senators are probably aware, however, from reading the debates of the Bill, and also, possibly, from some statements in the Press, it is proposed under this Bill to continue the system we have at present&mdash;namely, contribution by rates.  That being so, as the power of raising rates within a certain limit is vested in the committee, I was anxious that the county councils, the rating authority, and the borough councils should have a majority <Col N="1559" /> of their own members on the committees.  It is for that reason that the provision is inserted that there should be eight out of the fourteen members of the committee members of the county or borough council. In that way I hope to safeguard the rating authority of the county council.  But the Bill did not quite do that, because it is quite possible that even a majority of the county council present might be against the raising of the rate, and still it might be raised within the limits of the Schedule of the Bill.  Therefore, from that point of view the original system is not satisfactory, as the power of raising the rate was vested in the committee.  Representations were made to me from various parts of the country that that seemed to impose an obligation on the rate-striking authority.  But I have another objection, and it was this: that the incidence of eight out of fourteen of the committee being taken from the county council would unduly limit the liberty of the county council to choose what they thought would be the most suitable people to run a system of this kind.</P>
    <P>Consequently as a result of these considerations and the representations made to me from various bodies representing the agricultural community, I introduced a change. I induced the Dáil to accept a change in this part of the Bill&mdash;namely, there were these provisions put in: five of the members chosen by the county council must be members of that body, and that five will form the Estimates Committee, and that five alone, or whatever number up to eight is elected by the county council on this Vocational Committee will be the members of that committee who will have the power of raising the rate above the minimum rate within the scheduled limits in any year.  In that way I think we have, as far as it is possible to do it, provided for and safeguarded the rating interest&mdash;the interests of the county council on the one hand, and secured more liberty from the purely educational point of view, on the <Col N="1560" /> other hand.  These are some of the important changes in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The other important matter in the Bill is compulsion.  A certain amount of confusion seems to have arisen on the question of compulsion.  I have already dealt with one aspect of compulsion.  There is recommendation 18 of the Technical Commission Report that suggests that we should enforce a full-time attendance at school from those not in suitable employment between the ages of 14 and 16 years, but we found in practice that we could not really put a regulation of that kind into effect in the country.  We have power in the Bill under which the Minister may compel the attendance at a limited number of hours of instruction per year of those between the ages of 14 and 16, not necessarily for the whole country at the same time.  I take it this will be gradually extended&mdash;that is to say, there will be a gradual extension of this compulsory section.  There have been objections raised to the compulsory section&mdash;namely, that it will interfere with the work in the agricultural districts. So far as it is possible to do so by legislation we are trying to guard against that.  An amendment in the Dáil which I accepted provided that the actual hours of attendance in the country districts should be fixed by the committee and not by the Minister.  The Minister will decide whether in certain areas the compulsory section will be operative.  The actual hours of attendance will be decided by the technical committee after consultation with the agricultural committee of the county.  In that way the different interests ought to be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>The only other matter to which I think it is necessary to call attention is the question of the costs.  This Bill, following the example of other countries where the system of post-primary education has been carried through, proposes to introduce the system gradually.  There are a number of reasons for doing that.  If we were to attempt to introduce this system in one or two years we might very easily make many false starts <Col N="1561" /> and waste a lot of money.  We might have our resources depleted on schemes that were not the best.  For that reason we decided to go slowly. If this scheme were in full operation in the country within the next five or six years we estimate that the total additional cost to the country would be about £300,000.  I have indicated that that is the cost in addition to the present cost of technical education.  That would be borne partly by the State and partly by the rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>In what proportion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest about fifty-fifty.  There is power on the part of the Minister to make these grants.  I want to be quite clear that I am not suggesting that in any case where there is more than a fifty-fifty grant that that would be cut down to fifty-fifty.  There will be very little interference with existing grants.  Any additional cost will be met partly from the rates and partly from the State, and not in one definite year, but for a period of two or three years.  I take it for granted that the arrangement will be on a fifty-fifty basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill as originally introduced in the Dáil the minimum rate was 2d. and the Schedule allows for an increase of that rate every year by the committee of a farthing until it reaches 6d.  However, amendments were proposed by members of the Farmers' Party, and I accepted both of them reducing the minimum rate to 1¾d., except where a higher rate is struck at present.  The Schedule will cease to operate in 1940.  I am convinced that with the minimum rate of 1¾d. it will be possible to work the scheme satisfactorily at the start.  Let people be convinced, especially let the Estimates Committee be convinced, of the value they are getting under the Bill, and they will gradually advance and be quite ready to provide the necessary finance.  I find no difficulty in accepting a limit of 4d. up to 1940 for country districts.  If this Bill works well and satisfactorily, in ten <Col N="1562" /> years' time the future Minister for Education can then tackle the problem as it presents itself to him.</P>
    <P>There are a few schemes at present under which, owing to the small amount produced by a penny rate, and even the small amount that can be produced by the higher rate that could be struck under the Bill, it may be necessary to make a somewhat higher grant.  As I indicated already, that extra sum will not cost the State much; perhaps £3,000 in the first year and £10,000 when the scheme is in full operation.  I have tried to explain the purpose of the Bill.  It contains 121 sections and a few schedules.  It is possible that I may not have dealt with the details very precisely.  However, it is impossible to go through the Bill <i>seriatim</i>, for after making long introductory speeches I am often accused here and elsewhere, especially elsewhere, of not dealing with particular points that somebody wants specially dealt with.  Therefore, I shall leave any further points which Senators may wish to debate until they have first mentioned them. I suggest that the Seanad should give a Second Reading to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is to be congratulated in bringing forward the Bill.  I am certainly in favour of the proposals contained in the Bill.  My only regret is that the Minister has not gone further in the present Bill.  The Bill proposes to deal with a very serious problem indeed.  It proposes to deal with the period in children's lives starting at the age of 14 years, when they leave the primary schools.  Unfortunately, we have all to admit, more particularly as regards the towns and cities, that the time of boys and girls&mdash;I mean those of the poorer classes whose parents cannot afford to send them to secondary schools&mdash;is being wasted.  From the period between 14 and 16 years they are almost running wild in our streets.  I regret that the Minister has not accepted the recommendation of the Technical Commission in that respect, and that he would not insist on compulsory attendance for boys and girls <Col N="1563" /> between 14 and 16 years at the continuation schools.  I think it is a pity he did not accept that recommendation. There might be some difficulty in enforcing that provision in rural areas, but from my observation in the larger cities, I think it is a very great pity that he does not insist on full-time compulsory attendance at continuation schools of boys and girls who are not in employment between the ages of 14 and 16.</P>
      <P>I am not advocating that boys and girls ought to go to work before they reach the age of 16.  I am opposed to that.  Children, however, under present circumstances, are only dying for the day on which they are 14 years of age, so that they can get away from the primary schools.  The character, of the boys particularly, is being moulded between the age of 14 and 16.  As we see in the streets of Dublin&mdash;and this applies to the boys of several people whom I know&mdash;when they leave school at 14 they are not compelled to attend the continuation school, and their lives are destroyed. They have no occupation.  When boys have no occupation and are not made to go to school they get into bad company, and their whole future is jeopardised at this period, if they are not compelled to seek employment or go to school.  I have always been, and am still, in favour of compulsory attendance from the age of 14 onwards, whether by way of attendance at technical schools or at some other schools of that type where the boys and girls would get proper education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a lamentable thing that there is no employment, practically, for young people in this country.  It is almost impossible to get employment for boys and girls in this country up to the age of 18 years.  Even if we found employment for them I think we ought to endeavour to see that they finish their education.  Somebody said at one stage that it was necessary, because we were so poor, to spend more money on education. I believe that any money spent on <Col N="1564" /> education will be money well spent, because I think that we badly require it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined a number of sections in this Bill, and he has explained the proposals with regard to the setting-up of the committees. I have some experience of having served on a technical education committee and I am inclined to agree with the proposals the Minister has made.  With regard to raising finances for the scheme, I think the proposal is sound, because the Minister proposes in the Bill to maintain the <i>status quo.</i>  I read the Minister's statement in moving the Second Stage of the Bill in the other House, and I think he said that he proposed to maintain the <i>status quo</i>, and that then he was prepared to advance pound per pound&mdash;that for every pound raised by the local authority a pound would be granted by the State.  I think that was perfectly sound, because it is an inducement and an encouragement to local authorities to raise money on the rates for the purpose of carrying on technical education that is required in a particular locality.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that we are getting away from the old idea that it is not necessary to have technical education for the main and staple industry in this country, which is farming.  If there is one industry that requires technical education and requires that properly trained minds should be brought to bear on it it is our main industry&mdash;agriculture in all its branches.  We made a start some time ago which I hope will have very beneficial results, when we established a Chair in University College, Cork, for Dairy Science.  I think that was a step in the right direction, always bearing in mind that this is mainly an agricultural country and that it will continue so. It would be well if we bore in mind in all our educational schemes, whether they are for the primary schools, secondary schools, technical schools or universities that we should cater for the industry which is the main industry of the country. For that reason I am glad to have <Col N="1565" /> read the Minister's statement that as regards the rural areas it is proposed that these technical schools shall deal with the subjects that will be most beneficial to the inhabitants of the particular localities.  I think that is perfectly sound.</P>
    <P>Another matter about which I wanted to speak was the statement of the Minister that he did not propose to deal with apprenticeships. There may be good reason, as the Minister said, as to why the question of apprenticeship is not dealt with in this Bill.  If it had been dealt with in the Bill&mdash;it is a subject with which I am most conversant&mdash;I would be prepared to offer my opinion, but as the Minister, for reasons which he did not give, said that it was not thought advisable to have the questions of apprenticeships introduced in the Bill, I have nothing further to say, except that I am in agreement with the main provisions of the Bill.  I regret, however, that the Minister has not insisted on compulsory full-time attendance of boys and girls who are not in employment between the ages of 14 and 16 at these continuation schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephODoherty" hpid="Mr. O'Doherty Mr. O'Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say at the outset that I am in general agreement with the Bill.  There are one or two points which I would like to put before the Minister.  With some of them the Minister may already have been acquainted.  The Minister is no doubt aware that amongst a certain section of the teachers, teaching under technical committees, there is a big feeling of unrest in regard to this Bill.  I am referring to the itinerant teachers of Irish.  They feel that their position is being undermined by the Bill.  Their position is purely temporary; they have no pensionable rights, no security of tenure of office.  They feel that the Bill will make for less security in their tenure.  Some of them have gone so far as to formulate and to send to organisations interested in the development of the Irish language, resolutions calling on public representatives to use their influence with the Minister to make their position <Col N="1566" /> secure.  I see enormous difficulty in doing that, but, at the same time, there might be some way whereby the position might be improved. The resolution I am referring to was passed by the Coiste Gnotha of County Meath.  It reads:</P>
      <P>That this meeting of the Gacls of Meath request the Coiste Gnotha of the Gaelic League to draft amendments to the Vocational Education Bill, 1930.</P>
      <P>(a) Providing specifically for the stabilisation on an improved basis of the teaching of the Irish language in the rural districts, as at present conducted under existing Technical Education Acts.</P>
      <P>(b) Providing specifically for the transfer under the new conditions of existing part-time teachers of the Irish language in these rural night classes.</P>
      <P>(c) To stabilise the positions of the existing part-time teachers of Irish by providing specifically that the positions shall become whole-time, permanent and pensionable as in the case of other teachers under the present Technical Education Acts.</P>
      <P>(d) That all teachers of Irish to be appointed in future be appointed on a whole-time pensionable basis.</P>
      <P>(e) That amendments to such effect be properly drafted and inserted in the appropriate portions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the difficulties the Minister would be confronted with if he attempted to carry the resolution into effect.  At the same time, Section 6 provides for Vocational Education Committees throwing the responsibility for drafting a course of instruction on them subject to the sanction of the Minister.  If a sub-section were inserted making it compulsory on the Education Committees to set aside portion of the hours to be devoted to technical instruction, or in continuation classes, solely to Irish it would make, to some extent, for security of the itinerant Irish teachers.  I question whether it would not be advisable for the Minister to <Col N="1567" /> consider the necessity at this stage of our history of having compulsory sections in the Bill dealing with the utilisation of Irish as a medium of instruction in continuation or technical classes.  The Minister smiles. Those who have been associated with the development of the Irish language know that notwithstanding the fact that many pupils are brought to a state of perfection in the primary schools, when they reach the age of fourteen and go out in the world to roam the streets, or to go to work, they forget all the Irish they learned.  We have before us an Education Bill which more or less winks at that.  We have compulsory Irish in the primary schools, and it seems to me the logical sequence should be to have compulsory education in the continuation schools and the technical schools.  We have compulsory Irish in the universities and provision made for the teaching of technical subjects through the medium of the Irish language.  Surely we should not deprive children who are not in a position to get these benefits, owing to their inability to pay for secondary or university education, of an opportunity of continuing their Irish language course?</P>
    <P>On reading the official debates in the Dáil I noticed&mdash;though I may be wrong&mdash;that the Minister made a statement with regard to Section 27. Section 27 provides that the Minister retains the right of dismissing any individual officer or servant of any local committee without reference to them.  An amendment was introduced in the Dáil, and the Minister said an effort would be made at a later stage to bring that section into line with Section 105, which placed the Minister in the position of at least inquiring locally.  If the Minister is satisfied that he has done that I wish he would point out where it is.  I think the section remains as it was.</P>

      <P>That is so.  I am <Col N="1568" /> glad the Minister drew my attention to that.  The drafting is peculiar. One section gives the right and another section takes it away.  That seems extraordinary.  However, I feel with all the country who have an interest in educational development that it is high time such a Bill was introduced.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that its operation would be gradual, because in measures such as this I believe their operations should be slow.  It is only by such methods that the proper working and the proper understanding of educational requirements can be arrived at.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister one or two questions about the finances of the Bill.  There are two methods of getting money for the schemes.  One is dealt with in Section 43 affecting local contributions.  As far as I can see there is a flat rate for all counties of 1¾d., which is made up, I gather, by a fifty-fifty contribution. Section 53 deals with grants made by the State.  As far as I can see it may equalise out the sums given to each county.  Does the Minister take account of the population?  I will explain the matter in this way.  In Kerry the population is 150,000, and in Meath 60,000.  In Kerry 1¾d. would produce £2,100, while in Meath the same amount would produce £4,000.  Obviously, there will be three times as many persons in Kerry as in Meath to come under the educational scheme, both in vocational and continuation classes.  That being so, in order to provide for all, it will mean something like a difference of £6,000 to make the two sums equal which come from the State.  As far as I can gather the Minister said that only £3,000 would be required. What I want to be sure of is that whatever money is available will be apportioned according to the population of each county.</P>

      <P>I desire to refer to the financial part of the Bill.  It is proposed to make a departure from precedents whereby the provision of education is borne by the State and <Col N="1569" /> not by the ratepayers.  I am aware that representatives of the ratepayers have voluntarily struck a rate and made a contribution towards certain classes of education in the past but, under this Bill, there is a compulsory clause compelling them to pay rates representing fourpence in the pound.  I would like to know whether the Minister is satisfied that the ratepayers can bear a further burden of fourpence in the pound.  From what I know of the ratepayers they are grumbling at the rates they now have to pay, and they are living in the hope that the Government will, in a short time, bring in a Bill to wipe out rates altogether.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider that part of the Bill by providing the whole of the costs out of State funds.  If he does so the ratepayers will pay their share as ordinary citizens.  I have not seen any resolutions from any representatives of the ratepayers, that is, the county councils, in favour of the financial part of this Bill.  As a matter of fact, I have seen in the Press that some county councils passed resolutions protesting against the imposition of this extra 4d. in the pound on the rates. I hope that the Minister will accept an amendment to strike out part 4 of the Bill and to let the State finance the scheme in its entirety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome this Bill as an effort to put continuation education and technical instruction on a proper basis.  There are, however, one or two points in it with which I would like to deal.  First, I would ask the Minister to give some assurance that the continuation classes will be mostly non-technical and to ensure that the committees operating will not entirely devote their activities purely to technical instruction.  The Minister has embodied a direction in the Bill stipulating for technical classes which will be suitable according to the industrial and other developments in an area, but I have not heard or found anything in it of a directive nature as regards cultural possibilities or cultural activities.  I have <Col N="1570" /> the fear that they may be neglected. Of course, committees will have to submit their schemes to the Minister or to his Department.  We also presume that the organisers or inspectors from the Department will have a great deal to say in the outlining and preparation of schemes.  There is nothing in the Bill to indicate that alternative proposals or schemes of cultural activities for continuation classes will be laid down by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all due respect to the various county councils, I am not prepared to accept their schemes, or the view that they are competent to frame schemes, from the cultural viewpoint. I feel that that is something to which particular attention should be paid.  Strange to say, though I am an industrialist, and have been so all my life, I have always found that if cultural development could be got it meant far better technical development and a better type of citizen, which is what we want.  It is not so long ago since we were reminded in this House that most of the cultural activity as regards literature, drama and the arts was made by what was called the Anglo-Irish element and not the native element. As was then pointed out, there are historical reasons for that.  Great progress has been made in other countries as compared with this, and I hold we will have to give in the country districts as well as in the cities and towns an opportunity for cultural development through continuation classes.  I am doubtful if the Bill will do that unless particular attention is paid to that idea at the beginning.  If the Minister and his organisers and inspectors have control and have an opportunity of outlining the schemes there is a chance that that will be done.  If, on the other hand, it is left to the ordinary rank and file of county councils and urban district councils, I think the chances are very slight indeed.  Reference has been made to apprentices and that an Apprenticeship Bill will be introduced, but under Section 87 there is really what is tantamount to a provision for apprentices in employment. It is compulsory on employers <Col N="1571" /> to release workers in their factories or otherwise so that they will be free to attend classes.  Under Section 61, I think, there is a provision for time of 180 hours, which means 45 days of four hours or, alternatively, 90 days of two hours each, however it may be divided.</P>
    <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that it would be a good idea to divide &mdash;and I speak as a manufacturer who makes his apprentices attend classes&mdash;to divide the time at the classes equally between technical and cultural training.  A boy gets on an average 8 or 8½ hours a day mainly working.  He goes to a technical class afterwards, which, according to the spirit of the Bill, will be adapted to his particular industry. I hold from experience that that boy far more needs cultural education, education in what one might call the applied arts of his industry, rather than to go on monotonously following the instruction of a man who is not in many cases so competent in the particular craft as his own employer.  I prefer that boys between 16 and 17 who are going to attend these classes should get a general and cultural education rather than a training on the purely technical side.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Bill, taking the spirit of Section 87, will be interpreted as meaning simply that a boy who is working, say, at woodwork for 8½ hours in the day, will continue to devote his time when attending the classes to the same type of work.  In my opinion it is more essential for him to have his general education improved and to be trained in drawing, designing, or anything else, but above all that his general education and development of character should be continued.  A reference is made in Section 71 to the Act of 1925.  That deals with the form of attestation which was demanded by the Bill in 1925, and which is still in operation, and which, from this Bill, it is still intended to maintain.  This form was unsuccessfully resisted in the Seanad in 1925, I think largely on an amendment by Senator Douglas. <Col N="1572" /> That amendment, however, was defeated. I think this attestation ought to be eliminated, and I do not think that this Bill should contain that condition of employment.  Recently the Technical Congress protested against continuing that imposition, which amounts to a political test.  Whatever argument might have been used for it in 1925, and I do not admit there was any argument for it, has disappeared now.  At all events, as the Technical Congress pointed out, it did this, that men of real character who had any objection to the political test would not sign it, and that men of worse or weaker character would sign, and the result would be that technical instruction, and the continuation classes, would lose the services of the best type of teacher. I suggest we have reached a period in our history when such a section ought to be eliminated.  No man of any character is going to subscribe to a political test in which he does not believe.  Many of us think that particular section was put in at a time in our history with a view to penalising these people who had certain political ideas at the time.  The main point now for us to remember is that we may lose the services of the very sterling characters who will not sign this form, and the time has come for it to go.  We will probably put up an amendment proposing its elimination, and I hope that amendment will receive the support of the House and the favourable consideration of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is gratified with the cordial reception that has been accorded to this Bill in the Dáil, the Seanad and throughout the country.  I, too, join in that congratulation.  I am very much of the same mind as Senator Connolly with regard to one of the defects in the Bill which I think might have been remedied in the Dáil and perhaps could be remedied here.  There is very much overemphasis upon the training of youth and the possibility of confining the activities of the committees to the technical side rather than to the general education side that is allowable <Col N="1573" /> within the scope of the Bill.  I understand, of course, as the Minister pointed out, that there is nothing in the Bill to limit the present powers of the technical education bodies.  This Bill completes the trilogy&mdash;we had a general Education Bill, a Bill dealing with secondary education, and now we have a Vocational Education Bill.  One might say that the general scheme the Minister had promised as educational reform is completed, but there is another aspect that might have been dealt with in the Bill, but which I am afraid is rather clouded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is called a Vocational Education Bill, and vocational is defined to include technical and continuation education.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of the very wide educational need amongst the adults.  Youths are mainly catered for on the compulsory side of the Bill, and not altogether in connection with their actual occupation, but there is also a desire for knowledge by young men from eighteen upwards, and for grown men and women for some development of their knowledge, and getting a chance of general mind&mdash;and character-building. That is a side of education that has developed very much in recent years amongst the working classes in other countries&mdash;I suppose in the countries of the Continent of Europe, but certainly in Great Britain, and to some extent in Northern Ireland.  Efforts have been made in the Free State, but these efforts have not been very successful.  I did hope that some attention would have been paid in the Bill to this, in a direct fashion, and in such a way as to encourage and to invite educational continuation bodies themselves to make provision in their schemes for the poorer classes, and to provide university extension lectures not necessarily dealing with their occupations, but not necessarily excluding these, and which would be of a very beneficent character in the making of good men and women and citizens. I say that the term &ldquo;vocational education&rdquo; is apt to direct the minds of members of the committees to that <Col N="1574" /> particular side of their work, and in effect to confine their thoughts to the vocational side of the activities of the committees, and notwithstanding the fact that it is allowable, within the scope of the scheme, to continue and to extend elementary education, which would cover almost any subject whatever.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is very well aware of the activities of such bodies as the Workers' Educational Association, which has been definitely and financially recognised by the Departments of Education in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and which has the closest association with the universities.  I think it would be well to have that association with a university, and I would hope that the universities in this State would take an active part in the promotion of that side of adult education.  I would like to see in the Bill provision made for a scheme of such courses of classes, with the aid possibly of the university tutors. I do not know if that could be effected by way of amendment to the Bill, but if it could be dealt with by way of amendment at all it would be a rather considerable amendment. I hope the committees will be reminded that there is more than purely technical work before them, that there is the extension of elementary education, not in the narrower or primary subjects, but in the wider subjects, shall I say, by simple university lectures, and through classes that are capable of being understood by and participated in by the man who has had only the benefit of primary education, and yet has acquired a great deal of knowledge of the affairs of life and is practically enabled to give to university tutors very great assistance by the play of mind with mind and by putting experience against theory.  I think under schemes which the Minister's Department may have in mind, that when any question of this kind comes up they should include the possibility that, wherever a local committee has a desire to participate in this general working class educational movement&mdash;the adult educational <Col N="1575" /> movement&mdash;they should be encouraged to participate in it and provide for opportunities of that kind.</P>
    <P>There are one or two things in the Bill that I would like to have some light on.  I refer to them at this stage because the information the Minister may be able to give me may make it unnecessary to bring forward amendments.  The Minister drew attention to his desire that the money-providing authority, which is the local authority concerned, should have representation upon these educational committees.  It was really a question what the proportion should be of the persons elected to local authorities.  I am rather at sea in regard to that, because I suppose we have the right to assume that the Department of Education has collaborated somewhat with the Department of Local Government.  My reason for referring to this matter is that I find that Section 8 of this Bill provides &ldquo;that the Vocational Education Committee for a borough vocational education area shall consist of fourteen members elected by the council of the county borough which is such borough vocational education area, of whom not less than five nor more than eight shall be persons who are members of such council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very definite direction. The Minister has justified it and has quite approved of it, but the Minister for Local Government, in effect, abrogates and cancels that section beforehand in his Dublin Bill, which provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>So much of any statute or of any order made under any statute as requires that a person elected or nominated to be a member of a public body by the council of a county borough or by the council of an urban district or in particular by the council of the county borough of Dublin or by the council of either of the added urban areas shall be a member of the council by whom he is elected or nominated shall not apply in respect of any person elected or <Col N="1576" /> nominated by the city council of the new city.</P>
    <P>That is to say, that what the Minister for Education is asking the Dáil and the Seanad to enact, almost at the same time the Minister for Local Government is asking the same Houses to annul and to repeal.  I cannot understand it because there is such a glaring contradiction between the two principles.  No doubt, before this Bill passes the Minister for Local Government will be asked if he has consulted the Minister for Education. It is really such a glaring contradiction and so unsatisfactory that I hope very much some reconciliation of the two sections will be brought about before either Bill becomes law. There is another point on which I would like to have the Minister's assistance, that is in regard to his intentions touching the area of Dublin, Rathmines and Pembroke.  I leave out for the moment the proposed coastal borough.  As I gather from the Education Bill now before us it is intended that the present areas shall continue, and that Rathmines and Pembroke shall be separate vocational education areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not want to assume that the Seanad would pass the Dublin Bill unchanged. Therefore, I am waiting until I know what the intentions of the Seanad are with regard to the Dublin Bill.  When I know what the intentions of the Seanad are, then possibly they may amend this Bill for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I take it that we shall have to postpone the Committee Stage of this Bill until after the Dublin Bill is passed.  That helps me to get over a little obstacle. I am rather surprised it was not raised in the Dáil.  I agree with Senator Farren in expressing regret that some means has not been found for making attendance at classes from fourteen to sixteen years of age and onwards obligatory, unless a reason can be adduced that a youth is employed in an occupation of a wage-earning character.  While it is true that we cannot commend <Col N="1577" /> the idea of starting youths of that age in wage-earning occupations, nevertheless they seek, and are allowed to be relieved from school at that age on the plea that they are going into wage-earning occupations, and so long as they are in that position they might be exempted from attendance at classes of one kind or another.  I think it is a great pity that some means have not been found to meet that.  I cannot understand where the tremendous difficulty arises, but no doubt the Minister is justified in what he says, because I am sure his sympathies are with the intentions and desires expressed by Senator Farren and myself : that there should be no gap for these young people now leaving school at fourteen years of age.</P>
      <P>There is a point that I have been asked to draw the attention of the Minister to.  It is in respect to sub-section (6) of Section 51.  The point is whether the Minister would agree to insert such amendment as would be necessary in the sub-section to admit, for the purpose of reckoning the State contribution towards buildings, etc., any gifts which might be made by a private citizen or citizens to the local authority towards the cost of a site or building or the like on the same lines as if the gift were made by the rating authority : that is to say, if the local people decide through their council to raise money by loan or otherwise, to equip themselves for the purposes of the Bill, they will receive a certain grant from the Ministry ; but if, instead of the whole of the citizens accepting that responsibility, some small number of them, or even a single person, were to make a gift to the city for some purpose, I would like to know whether the value of that gift could not be taken into account as though it had been provided by the citizens as a whole. There are possibilities in this matter, and I hope the Minister will see his way to agree to the suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness2" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, on the whole, this Bill is to be welcomed. The Minister, in explaining the provisions <Col N="1578" /> of the Bill, did not tell us who is to control the education that is to be provided under this measure.  I can conceive a situation in which certain members of a committee would be very keen on some particular trade or other.  They would try to have education in regard to that trade given in the local schools. though possibly the trade itself was quite unsuited to the youth of the neighbourhood.  In a case of that sort I would like to know who is to exercise control.  Take, for instance, electrical engineering, butter-making, clock-making, and so on.  The teaching of these subjects may be quite unsuited to a particular neighbourhood, but yet, as far as I can see from the Bill, there is nothing to prevent the local committee from selecting one of them and making provision to have it taught. Under sections in the Bill, the youth in a district could be compelled to attend classes at which instruction was given in regard to any of these subjects, though not one of them might be suited to that locality. There may be sections in the Bill giving the Government control in that matter, but I have not been able to find them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I am not kindled to that high pitch of enthusiasm which the majority of the members of this House seem to feel with regard to this measure.  As the Minister himself has said, the Bill makes very little change in substance from the present system.  It provides, of course, for the giving of more money and for an elaboration of the present machinery.  It indicates elaboration in a direction that I always suspect: in the direction of control and check.  The whole thing is an attempt to slow down free movement&mdash;which is bad in principle&mdash; lest someone might do something wrong or lest the views of those in authority might not be accepted by those not so well instructed.  With regard to the definitions, I cannot quite see the dividing line between the terms vocational, technical and continuation.  I think continuation is <Col N="1579" /> the general term dealing with education. I would like to know if I am wrong in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  Vocational is the general term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Then continuation is non-technical because I do not think the thing is defined in the Bill.  It would be rather interesting to set an examination paper for certain members of this House on these points.  Apparently, then, vocational is a general term, and continuation deals with the non-technical side, the side that Senator Connolly wants.  He considered cultural and general.  Take the word &ldquo;technical.&rdquo;  We all realise what that means.  I suppose the Minister is satisfied that all these points are made clear in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the finances, I wish to lay certain rather important figures before the House.  Under the present method the poorer districts, which require the provisions of this Bill the most, are really less assisted in the matter of funds.  Let us take two extremes at random.  First let us take Kerry.  A penny rate in Kerry yields twopence per head of the population, and a penny rate in Meath yields ninepence.  Perhaps it might be said that both equally require this Bill Certainly Kerry needs it no less, and yet it receives from the rates one-quarter of the financial assistance that the richer county receives, and if, as the Minister says, the State is going to bear fifty-fifty, presumably then the State contribution will be equally weighted against poorer counties.  I should like the Minister to develop that point, because in equity and following the recommendations of the Poor Law Commission, regard should be had to the poverty and needs of a district and its financial resources. That is a very important point.  Now is the time for dealing with fundamentals.  After all, no <Col N="1580" /> claim should be made that this is merely a temporary arrangement and that matters of that kind can be dealt with later on.  I should have liked the Minister to have told us more as to his opinion of the results achieved hitherto through these technical committees.  I happened to be a member of one of them.  I think they are singularly ineffective in advancing the cause of technical education. The Minister himself knows that.  He said that there was a large number of amateurs on them, well inclined, but that few of them had much technical knowledge.  There are going to be fewer of them now, but that does not necessarily mean that these few will produce committees different to what we have at present.</P>
    <P>I was hoping there might be some provision for a director on the lines of a city manager, that there might be somebody who would have charge and general direction, an official from the county council or the Educational Committee, who would be entrusted with the whole of the administration of this Act.  The present method is for the committee to meet once a month or once a week. That committee does not come in touch with current day-to-day work. It has very little expert knowledge, and we know what very often influences the outlook of those county council committees.  This is not a novel proposal.  It is in effect what was recommended by the Poor Law Commission with regard to the poor law services, that there should be a poor law commissioner who should act as an executive officer through the county in all poor law matters. I think that principle might very well be embodied in this measure.  I do not know whether it is too late now to do it.  I understood from the Minister that this Bill is not going to be passed in the present session.</P>

      <P>I understood the Minister to say to Senator Johnson that this Bill could not be passed until after the Dublin Bill was <Col N="1581" /> passed.  Let me put it this way: I think it is singularly unfortunate that a very big and comprehensive measure of this kind should be thrown at our heads just a week before the House rises.  This matter does require very serious consideration. I see the Minister smile.  I do not see what the joke is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will. Heretofore, however, things have worked to prevent the Seanad acting in a fully independent manner. I hope in this case we will see fit to be independent, and hold up this measure.  I have always assumed that measures which were sent up at the last moment had to be passed, not, of course, by law, but by virtue of moral suasion.  Departing from that for the moment, I am rather interested not only in the Bill, but in the speeches and all the reactions in this matter of divided control.  I imagine there is no more democratic man in the Seanad than Senator Connolly.  He is terribly alarmed lest the county councils would not do enough.  He is not much of a believer in the cultural outlook of the county councils, and he would like to embody somewhere in this measure, at any rate, a penal law or instruction or statutory condition to ensure the correct attitude of the county councils which do not want progress in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way, Senator O'Doherty wishes, presumably, also, voicing the popular will, that the teaching of Irish should be made compulsory in those continuation classes.  Probably it will interest the Seanad to know that one county council, of which I happen to be a member, that popularly-elected body refused to pass a rate for Irish at all. I suppose, according to the Senator's view, this popular will should not be allowed to operate.  The elected representatives of the people must be progressive.  But is all progress necessary for the betterment of the people?  I very much doubt it.  Progress does not necessarily <Col N="1582" /> imply an improved outlook for the people.  It is dynamic; it may not be for betterment at all.  Perhaps I have not chosen the best expression, but progress may not be a change for the betterment of the people. Many people are inclined to hold that all change is necessarily progress. That is not the case.</P>
    <P>This conflict between the central and the local authorities is always very perplexing.  In this case if the central authority wishes to force a policy of this kind upon the local authorities they should pay the whole thing.  It is not right to impose upon a local authority the obligation to raise a rate.  Heretofore, that has been permissive.  The county raised the rate voluntarily, now it is obligatory on the local authority, and if that is the case, I think it is only reasonable that the local authority should have control.  If not, let the central authority take over the whole responsibility and let them finance the whole thing.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether if he had a clean slate and no commitments he would not think it the better course that the whole of this education should be put in the hands of one central authority as primary education is.  If he is not prepared to do that then let it be the other way.  Let the local authorities themselves strike a rate and have complete control.  Do not give them a sort of so-called veto on the one hand and manacle them on the other.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the latter portion of the statement made by Senator Sir John Keane.  Here is a subject which demands the highest directive qualities.  Yet it is left to the common laymen in the country. We know the alleged progress that goes on in the country in the name of technical education and what is going on at the present time in that direction.  Classes for shorthand and typewriting, and a few things of that kind are going on in the country, and that is supposed to be a great advantage to the State.  On the other hand the Minister will resolve all the inequalities of the finance that operate under the present system in <Col N="1583" /> Kerry as against Meath and in Donegal and Wicklow and Dublin by the central authority paying the piper per head of the population. People seem to think that because a thing is supposed to be done by the central authority the rural areas escape payment.  We know well enough that the revenue of the State, as regards 60 or 70 per cent. comes from the rural areas and, therefore, they will pay their share of the inequalities and injustices that will be done under this Bill.  If there is to be a charge then the Minister, as in primary education, and as in secondary education, more or less, ought to be the directing force.  Let him demand from the Minister for Finance the necessary revenue to bring about the advancement of education, so very badly needed in the rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let Senators picture to themselves what is going on in Wicklow at the present moment.  Into the little towns there may be half a dozen scholars coming in the evenings.  Five miles up in the hills nobody ever hears of a boy coming to a technical school.  The children from there never come to the continuation classes.  In the villages they will come to the classes, and this rate will be used for the development of a little portion of the population that exists in the neighbourhood of the villages.  What we want is to bring the continuation system of education to the children of the small farmers, isolated outside the towns and the villages.  The present system is not doing that.  Nor is it likely to do it, nor is it likely to be done for fourpence in the pound.  We know when compensation for damages done during the Civil War had to be paid the country areas paid 6d. in the £ for five years.  Money could be found for compensation in that case.  Why is not sufficient money being found now?  I am certain you will do nothing with a penny three farthings in the £, and I am certain that the penny three farthings should be wiped out, and that the real finance of the Bill <Col N="1584" /> should be a central contribution according to the necessity of the area in each case.  The poorer area should get more money.  The rich areas which would be getting 9d. as against 2d. in the valuation should receive in accordance with their necessities.  And the necessities, as we know, are greater where the people are poorer.</P>

      <P>I have listened very carefully to the many speeches made, and I am greatly surprised at the extraordinary technical knowledge that has been shown by the Senators in the course of the discussion of this Bill.  I hope that the Senators who have spoken so well on the various aspects of this Bill will introduce amendments, so that we may go more fully into the various questions connected with the Bill, and discuss them more closely.  As the Minister said, we have plenty of time.  We need not adjourn for another month or two, or three months if we like.  I am sure the Minister will be always ready to discuss the merits or demerits of the Bill with us, and to sanction a proposal when the proper time comes.  There is one point that I think has been omitted. Senator Farren said that the money spent on education is money well spent.  That may be true, but I think it is equally true that the value of education does not always depend upon its cost.  I do not wish to say that that should be taken as any indication of my opinion that proper educational facilities should not be supplied to the people.  At the same time there should be some regard to the expenses.</P>
      <P>If the Minister were here I would suggest to him that there is, perhaps, some duplication of offices in relation to this Bill.  I see that there is in Section 89 a provision which reads:</P>
      <P>Every vocational education committee which is an enforcing authority for the purposes of this Part of this Act shall by order appoint such officers as it thinks fit to be attendance officers for the purposes of this Part of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is just one little matter to which I wish to call attention.  There <Col N="1585" /> are to be new attendance officers.  I wonder whether it would be advisable that the attendance officers already employed under the Department of Education should do this work also?  I am afraid that there will be duplication of offices and multiplication of jobs under this Bill. Really the farmers cannot afford very much more expenditure.  I would like that an amendment would be put in so that we may know what the Minister's point of view is on that matter, and also his point of view in regard to the professors and teachers, so that there will not be duplication of offices.  These are matters which the Seanad ought to consider.  If they put in amendments they will have an opportunity of considering them.  I think that is a point well worthy of consideration.  As far as I can see the probable defect in the Bill is that there might be unnecessary expenses and duplication of offices.</P>

I regret as much as you that we are held up for a few minutes.  The suggestion, however, of adjourning at a particular stage of the Bill instead of waiting for a few minutes, is one that I do not think is likely to meet with the approval of this House.

      <P>On the motion made I would like to make my position clear.  I am not prepared to vote for the motion.  This is the first occasion on which it has occurred that a Minister has been compelled to leave the House to record his vote in the other House.  I do not think it would be seemly on the part of the House nor just and reasonable.  I think this is a matter that could be discussed between the Ministers and the Cathaoirleach.  If in the future it should happen that this would become a matter of frequent occurrence, then this House may feel inclined to take strong action.  I think if the House definitely passed a resolution now and adjourned this Bill it would be absurd.  We know that practically all the business we have here to-day will require the attendance of some Minister or another.  To assume that the Minister for Education is the only Minister whose vote will be required in the other House would not be reasonable.  Other Ministers would also have to vote. To adjourn simply as a protest would be most unwise.</P>

      <P>I must apologise to the Seanad for having been away for a few minutes.  I will deal <Col N="1589" /> now with a number of points raised in the debate.  One was raised by Senator Farren and the same point was referred to by Senator Johnson. There was a recommendation made by the Technical Commission.  I had better read it:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We recommend that attendance at a full-time school should be compulsory in urban areas at least for all young people between 14 and 16 years of age who are not in employment; and exemption from the obligation to attend national schools should be granted only in the case of those who are in employment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator Johnson is quite right in suggesting that it is with regret I dropped that particular recommendation. I realise the importance, if possible, of securing attendance not merely part-time and if necessary by means of compulsion, especially in the case of those in the large communities. But the moral aspect of the problem is not so very great perhaps in the country districts. The damage done by unemployment is not so great because unemployment does not exist in the same way or to the same extent in country districts. Unemployment in the country for young people is a different thing from what it is in the towns, and I realise very fully the desirability of putting in a section of this kind, and not merely putting it in but making it effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may tell the Seanad that in the first heads of this Bill and in the subsequent drafts of the Bill that left my hands there was a general section of that kind.  But it was when we went beyond the mere general recommendation and tried to see how far we could carry it out in practice, we found, no matter what our desires were, that to make it compulsory for those not in employment would be impossible.  We found that in practice that we could not carry it out.  We would be putting into the Bill a pious expression, in itself not harmful, but it is a different thing to put in the shape of law a penal provision which could <Col N="1590" /> not be enforced.  What might make the Bill look better from our point of view would be a section of that kind, but it would not produce any good results.  I thing the spectacle of a provision of this kind not very seriously made and not working out in practice would have a worse result than if we were to leave out the provision altogether.  So far as the general provisions of the Bill are concerned, and some expression of the general wish, I find that we had in the Compulsory School Attendance Act of 1926 one section which caused a general power of this kind to be enforced.  The difficulties are very large.  First of all there is the question of approved employment. That is not insisted upon here.  It would be a question of reading through a schedule of employment and to say what would be approved and what would not be approved.</P>
    <P>Supposing we took employment of any kind.  We are not discussing the question of whether or not people ought to enter employment at the age of 16.  Whether some people object to it or not it is practically inevitable that we should allow people at that age to enter employment. If it were a question of a person being in permanent employment or out of permanent employment, if these are the only two classes you have to deal with, the matter would be simple enough, but notoriously these are not the classes with which you have to deal.  The problem is not limited to these in permanent or out of permanent employment. There is a lot of casual employment.  A boy or girl may be in employment for one month and out of employment for another.  It is the difficulty of enforcing it in the case of persons casually in or out of employment, that is insuperable.</P>
    <P>The facilities will be there, I hope, especially in all the towns.  They will have an opportunity of attending a school that is more closely connected with their ordinary avocations than, say, the primary schools, a school that might make more appeal to a person over the age of 14. These facilities will be there in a <Col N="1591" /> larger measure than at present.  I would ask Senators to bear in mind the difficulties of enforcing even the ordinary Compulsory Attendance Act at 14.  I would ask them to put themselves in the position of the District Justice who would have to enforce the Act.  After all, it comes to that.  It has to be enforced, and the court will have to enforce it.  It would be practically impossible, especially down the country, dealing with people who may be in casual employment or casually out of employment, to make this particular portion of the Act legally enforceable. After all, that is what a compulsory clause means&mdash;not an expression of opinion on our part, but the legal enforceability of it.  Where there has been continuation courses for pupils over the age of 14 the authorities generally follow the example we have adopted in this Bill. I do not think that you can make an exception for those in employment.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that in the city there are some classes at which by direct trade-pressure we could secure a compulsion of that kind. not legal compulsion in the full sense, but compulsion of another kind.  Where you are dealing with children over 14 years of age, that has not been found to work satisfactorily, even from the purely educational point of view.  It was with regret that I dropped the suggestion and if anybody in the Seanad thinks that he can introduce, not merely a general clause but a clause that can be worked out in practice in all its details, I shall certainly be quite prepared to recommend it to the Seanad and, if the Seanad adopts it to recommend its acceptance in the Dáil.  I made the same offer in the Dáil, but so far, we ourselves have not been able to supply anything that would satisfactorily solve the problem.  Senator O'Doherty said on one occasion that I was smiling. Perhaps it was that I was delighted at the presence here of somebody who had experience of the Dáil, and I was glad to get an encouraging word in the Seanad.  The Senator <Col N="1592" /> talked of instruction through the medium of Irish.  I was glad to hear him on that subject.  He referred to the fact that we had compulsory Irish in the secondary schools and the primary schools.  I do not know, however, that we have it in these schools by virtue of any statute.  I do not know that Irish is likely to be neglected during the lifetime of the present Government and so far as the teachers of Irish are concerned I hope their tenure and their security will not be prejudiced by this Bill.  But I should not like to admit the argument that we should compel committees to set aside a certain portion of their revenues for Irish courses, and not educational courses, in order to secure the position of part-time teachers of Irish or a temporary teacher of Irish.  That is the argument.</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation.  I object very strongly to the Minister for Education or any other Minister twisting the arguments which I have put forward. I did not advance the proposition on the basis of the security of the temporary teachers of Irish. What I did say was that it was a natural and logical corollary to the fact that we had made the teaching of Irish compulsory in the schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry if I misunderstood the Senator. I accept his explanation.  May I point out that no statutory provision is necessary to safeguard the position of Irish?  I have adduced sufficient proof of that when I say that there is no such provision in regard to secondary education. Neither is there any such provision in regard to primary education, and still we have done a certain amount in regard to Irish in these schools.  I can assure the Senator that I did not mean to insult him or to misconstrue the context in which he used the words, but I could not accept the argument which he put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connolly spoke on the question of cultural education.  It is not intended to exclude cultural education by any means.  In fact a <Col N="1593" /> large portion of the continuation education between fourteen and sixteen will be of a general character, and though it will have a very practical bias, in many respects it will be cultural in character.  Even where technical education is concerned, that is a certain amount of compulsory courses in technical education, there will be a certain cultural element also in that.  The history of the trade, designs and drawings will form portion of the course.  It will not all be confined to the mere technicalities of the trade in question.  There will be a broad view taken of it.  So far as adult education is concerned, there is nothing in the Bill, as Senator Johnson correctly pointed out, to limit the instruction given at any particular age.  All that is limited in the Bill is the ages and the compulsory powers&mdash;fourteen to sixteen for continuation education, and sixteen to eighteen in the case of technical education.  In the case of technical education it may not be compulsory for any trade&mdash;that is between the ages of sixteen and eighteen&mdash;unless there is previous consultation by the Minister with the representatives of the trade in the district, both employers and employees. That, I think, to a certain extent will help to answer the point raised by Senator Johnson.  The Committee cannot start a trade and make it compulsory.  The trade must be there.  The Committee is expected to cater for the existing trades in the district.  If they provide a course in other matters with the desire to introduce a trade, they may try that experiment, but they certainly cannot make it compulsory. If they desire to make a trade compulsory between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, they can only do it after ascertaining the views of the representatives of the trade in the district as to whether it is desirable.</P>

      <P>At present I am not quite prepared in this Bill to do such a revolutionary thing. The man who objects to this Bill because it is not revolutionary enough is Senator Sir John Keane.  He condemned the Bill because there is very little change made by it.  There may be very little changes in it in some respects, and yet we expect important results from it.  I tried as well as I could to remedy what we found by experience and practice to be some of the important defects in the existing system.  I am acquainted with the particular clauses that Senator Johnson found contradictory.  So far as the Greater Dublin Bill is concerned, I think I pointed out that <Col N="1595" /> this Bill had to proceed on the state of the existing law, at least until we found where we were with regard to the boundaries of Dublin.  It will be necessary to introduce amendments if the Seanad passes the Greater Dublin Bill.

We would have had highly constitutional arguments brought forward for such extraordinary conduct on the part of Ministers and that Senators were not going to be allowed to exercise their rights.</P>
      <P>So far as the actual rates are concerned I have toned them down as far as I could, so that any amendment in that respect would jeopardise the whole basis of the Bill. Those who were interested in the matter approached me, and I did make certain important concessions to them which to a large extent went to meet their views.  I consented to a reduction of the twopenny rate to 1¾d., and also, in order to meet their views, practically made the imposition of the larger rate no longer compulsory but really voluntary.  So far as members of the county council on the Vocational Educational Committee are concerned, I tried to safeguard the interests of the county council in that way, and I thought they were fairly pleased.</P>

I see by Section 99 (5)</P>

    <P>A vocational education committee <Col N="1596" /> may, with the sanction of the Minister, and shall, when so directed by the Minister, abolish the office of any officer transferred to it by this section, and every such officer whose office is so abolished shall for the purpose of the enactments relating to superannuation and compensation for loss of office, be deemed to have been removed from office by such committee for cause other than misconduct or incapacity,</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  I could answer the last part of the Senator's question by saying &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  There may be one or two cases, but very few in practice. The enforcing authority, as far as the greater part of the country is concerned, will be the Gárda Síochána, just as in the case of the School Attendance Act.  In the case of Dublin, if we asked the present officers to undertake work under the Bill it would be more than they could do.  They have as much work as they can do at present.  So many officers are appointed according to the districts in which they work.  Some portions of the city are more thickly populated than others.  In Kilmainham an attendance officer has to go farther distances than he would have to go in the middle of the city.  In every case the attendance officers are fully occupied.  If I threw all this work on to the existing officers I would have to get additional officers. I do not think there will be any duplication.  New officers may have to be appointed.  Even if I asked the committee to undertake the work of enforcing the Bill they would have to appoint some new officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purposes of this Bill are simple. Senator Comyn thought there was something complicated in it.  The position is this, that the Bill is introduced to enable rural sanitary authorities to go ahead with certain public health works that they are prevented from proceeding with because of the statutory limitations placed on their borrowing.  Under Section 238 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, it was provided that the sum granted by the sanitary authority, whether urban or rural, for the purpose of carrying out public health works would be limited to twice the rateable valuation of the area concerned. That put a salutary restriction on unlimited borrowing, and it was necessary.  It is proposed to retain that.  While in the urban districts moneys borrowed for building houses under the Working Classes <Col N="1599" /> Acts were not included in the amount, it put a limitation on their borrowing powers under the Public Health Act, and where, in a rural sanitary area, money was borrowed for building labourers' cottages, that was taken into consideration.  The position exists in such places as Balbriggan and Mullingar, towns that are not sanitary authorities, that if they desire to carry out water or sewerage schemes they are actually prohibited by the amount they can borrow by reason of the fact that they have built a large number of cottages.  It is considered that the time is gone when that limitation should be included in respect of rural sanitary authorities, and this Bill is to remove that restriction, so that rural sanitary authorities will be in the same position as urban sanitary authorities in respect of borrowing for building purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to continue the operation of the 1929 Act in respect of houses begun before the 1st April, 1931, and completed before the 31st October, 1931.  It proposes to provide an additional £200,000 to cover the building of an additional 4,000 houses.  The only change is that it includes the Irish Soldiers and Sailors' Land Trust as a person that may receive a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators may remember that the exclusion of the Trust from participation in the grants under the 1924 and 1925 Acts was considered by the Committee on the claims of ex-servicemen, and it was held to be reasonable that the Trust, under the circumstances, would not be given the advantage of these grants.  Therefore, there was a limitation to the extent of 2,626 houses.  There was a limitation on the number of houses the Trust was to build.  That restriction has been raised for some time, and the Trust expects to build 2,690 houses, and has an ambition to build more.  In view of the desire to encourage the speedy carrying out of house building schemes, and in view of the fact that this Bill deals with houses begun before 1st April, 1931, we feel we have come to the time when we can treat the Trust as a person within the meaning of the <Col N="1601" /> Act, and give it the grant that would be ordinarily given to private persons under these Acts.</P>
    <P>Under the 1929 Act a sum of £200,000 was voted for housing. About £16,000 of that was taken up to meet commitments in respect of houses in regard to which allocation had been made under previous Acts, but in respect of which no money was available under previous Acts. On 31st May, 1930, £18,391 was unallotted in respect of 360 houses. Under the 1929 Acts grants were allotted in respect of 989 houses to be built by local authorities, 2,097 houses to be built by private persons, and 188 to be built by public utility societies, bringing the total number provided under the 1924 and 1929 Acts to 4,975 houses by local authorities and 12,906 by private persons, 991 in respect of public utility societies, making a total of 18,872. We have added 360 houses in respect of £18,381 unallotted, making a total of 19,430.  The present Act will provide for 4,000 houses more.  I drew attention in the Dáil on the Estimates and in dealing with this Bill to the fact that subsequent to the passing of the 1929 Act we had opened the Local Loans Fund for urban authorities building houses. We provided money under certain approved arrangements for urban authorities who were building at 5¾ per cent. for 35 years.  Up to the present I think that out of the Local Loans Fund £130,000 has been earmarked.</P>
    <P>After the passing of the 1929 Act we caused a survey to be made by urban authorities, that is by urban districts and town commissioners, of their housing requirements, and a return has been made by the different local authorities showing that 42,880 houses are required.  A survey made by the same local authorities in 1919 showed that the number of houses required was 43,963, but with a view to a closer examination of the situation and to seeing what extent the figures submitted by local authorities were to be interpreted as fairly expressing the requirements, in 34 districts out <Col N="1602" /> of 92 we were able to cause an examination to be made by one of our medical officers, together with one of our engineering officers.  In the 34 districts the requirements were stated by the local authorities to be 8,532 houses.  The inspectors of the Department who made the examination reported that they considered 6,147 houses were required&mdash;that is, they estimated that 72 per cent. of the requirements as stated by the local authorities were sufficient to meet their immediate demands.  If we take the same percentage of the 42,880 houses it would give a total of 31,000 required by the local authorities on the census we have caused to be made.  Generally speaking, however, this Bill simply continues the grants made available under the 1929 Act.</P>

      <P>The Minister has kindly given us the figures dealing with the Soldiers and Sailors' Land Trust, which is to be considered as a person within the meaning of the Act.  He told us that 2,626 houses have already been built under the Trust, and he proposes to help the Trust in the erection of more houses that are required.  I am told that for every house that becomes vacant there are fifteen or sixteen applicants, so there is a pressing necessity for more houses.  I suggest to the Minister, if he is going to facilitate the Trust, that perhaps this is the occasion upon which he could have the terms of the Trust clarified. Under the Trust it is contended that although the soldier gets the house his widow and children have no right to continue in the house after his death.  There is the point also that when the soldiers for whom the houses have been built in the course of nature disappear the corpus of the Trust in the shape of the houses will remain.  I think these are two matters the Minister should clarify, as he has the opportunity of doing so under this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it will ever come about that we shall have from the Minister a statement of housing policy which is <Col N="1603" /> not a replica of previous years' Bills. We have had a succession of Bills treating this very terrible problem piece by piece without any consistency or consecutiveness, and not as part of a big scheme, the necessity of which seems to be imperative.  It has been apparent to everybody for many years that there was a necessity for dealing with the problem of housing on a big scale, and during the last two years it has been pressed upon the Government how important it is from many points of view, and not least from the point of view of the economic production of houses, that there should be a period scheme and not a year by year scheme proposed, and that organisation should be so adjusted to the requirements as to make possible the production of a larger number of houses on a more satisfactorily organised scale.  The Ministers have taken another view, and are satisfied to go along bit by bit producing houses, and we have now to subsidise another 4,000 houses to the extent contained in a previous Bill.  It is very difficult to understand the Ministerial attitude in this matter.  The best that one can arrive at is that the Minister says subsidies are bad, wages are too low, the building industry cannot organise itself in such a way as to provide houses at the prices which the wages of the average normal worker can afford to pay.  But the Minister says he can do nothing; we must trust to the building industry so to organise itself and to adjust its economy as some day to be able to produce houses and let them at an economic rent, as it is called; that is to say, to let them at a rent which will cover the cost of production, sinking fund, interest on loan.  I do not think that the Minister, after examining all the circumstances, can really believe that it is possible for the building industry to produce houses within any appreciable period of time to meet the present problem and let them at an economic rent.  When I speak of an economic rent I mean an economic rent without a subsidy.  That appears <Col N="1604" /> to be his expectation and his hope, and his policy is based on that expectation. I read in the Dáil reports two or three statements by the Minister to that effect.  This is one:</P>
      <P>How long the building industry is going to remain as it is and be unable to face the task that lies before it in the country I do not know, but that situation is being and will be kept very closely under review.</P>
      <P>The Minister also made the following statement in the Dáil:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Generally I would seek to base the housing policy, for the purpose of recommending it to the Dáil and the country on the condition, first, that the building industry must build the houses, and not the State.  Secondly, that the houses that will be built must be houses for which our normal worker, in a normal industry, can afford to pay an economic rent.</P>
      <P>I assume that when the Minister speaks of an economic rent he means what I understand the term to mean: that there will be a sum paid by the occupant of the house sufficient to cover all charges without a subsidy.  I wonder whether, with that definition, the Minister really expects that it is likely to come about within any reasonable period, say within the next ten, fifteen or twenty years; whether it is to come about by a general increase of wages or by a general reduction in the costs of building.  I hope the Minister will give us, in as precise terms as he can, his mind on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am opening this question because I think we are without a real explanation of the Minister's policy.  I do not want to pursue it in any controversial manner, because I think it would be very desirable if we could get the Ministerial mind openly shown to us, and if we could find out where conflict actually occurs, and what the possibilities are of overcoming the difficulties.  An economic price?  I do not know what the Minister hopes for, but so far nothing has been done to suggest the <Col N="1605" /> likelihood that houses will be built in Dublin within the next few years at less than £400 per house.  When I give £400 as the price, it includes all charges, and putting the figure at £400 is going fairly low, I think. I mention £400 because I have in my hand a statement of a tenant purchaser's account under the sales scheme of the Dublin Corporation. This house was purchased at £400.  I find that the liabilities of that tenant purchaser in respect of that house were, in the second year, £40 6s. per annum.  That is £40 6s. a year on a £400 house.  That total of £40 6s. includes the following: Charge for book-keeping, collection, etc., £2 8s.; fire insurance premium, 9/-; rates, £8 16s.; ground rent, £4; interest at 5 per cent. per annum, £20; repayment of capital, £4 13s.  There might be a reduction of a few pounds a year for the items repayment of capital and rates within, say, five or ten years.  But even allowing for these reductions, one is not going to get much below the figure of £35 a year.</P>
    <P>Therefore, you have to take £35 a year as the amount which the normal workman, in reasonable employment, is required to pay either under a purchase scheme or under a rental scheme, because I do not think that a rental scheme is going to be much easier, if it is to be an economic rental, than the terms under a purchase scheme.</P>
    <P>What is the expectation regarding the ability of the person to pay that rent?  I am trying to get down to bedrock.  I take as my example a workman with a wife and three children. I am going to assume that the workman is going to provide himself and his family with food, and I want to arrive at the prices which are required to be taken out of that workman's wages even before the rent is met.  In any case, I want to arrive at some relationship between the rent that the Minister counts upon as being possible to pay and the wages and cost of upkeep of that family. Let us take, as the basis of our calculation for the requirements of that family, a soldier's ration.  The retail <Col N="1606" /> cost of that ration was carefully worked out in Dublin in January of this year at 13/-.  Taking what is recognised by the medical profession as justifiable, 20 per cent. off that for the wife's ration, it leaves us with 23/5 for the father and mother. Take it that there are three children: one child between the age of one and three, another between three and eight, and a third between eight and sixteen.  To provide them with the food which is set out in the union workhouse for healthy children, the ration required, taken at retail cost, would be 15/5. Therefore you have 38/10 for the food costs of that family.  I am not going to assume that the family is going to feed itself as well as a soldier is fed.  I take the union ration for a healthy man, which is a deterrent ration and a very low one.  That costs 3/9 for a healthy man and 3/4 for a healthy woman. Taking the average to be between the cost of the ration for the soldier and the cost of the ration for the healthy man in the workhouse, and reckoning that to be the normal ration of a healthy family, we have the price of the food ration at 30/8, for food alone.</P>
    <P>There was a certain standard which was fixed upon&mdash;it corresponds fairly well with the English returns&mdash;by the Irish Free State Cost-of-Living Inquiry Committee of 1922.  It gives certain proportions for fuel and light, clothing and sundries. If we take these proportions the food costs would amount to 30/8, fuel and light would come to 4/4, clothing to 7/10, and for sundries to 4/7.  That is to say, that without reference to anything in the way of luxuries the ordinary household requirements for which the housewife is responsible would amount to that sum.  There is nothing in the way of an allowance for drink, and very little in the way of an allowance for tobacco, so that it is quite a low allowance.  At any rate, we find that the sum of 47/5 is called for before any provision is made for the payment of rent.</P>
    <P>We have the Minister's suggestion <Col N="1607" /> of an economic rent which cannot be much less than 14/- per week on a £400 house in Dublin, so that if we add the details I have given to the rent charged, you have a weekly wage requirement for these minimum needs that I have outlined of £3 1s. 5d.  I wonder has the Minister taken that into account when he expects that he can solve the housing problem for the normal workman in this country on the basis of an economic rent?  There must necessarily be some deductions from that when you come to the smaller towns and the country parts.  The average wage paid in the small towns to labourers is very often under 30/- per week and seldom above 30/-. Compare that with the earning of workmen in the City of Dublin. Year in and year out, unless he was a skilled workman in regular employment, he would be earning say 50/- per week.  The rate of wages is one thing and the earnings are another. The Minister, in the course of his examination of this question in the Dáil, referred to what he considered the anomaly of the building industry not paying a rate of wages to employees in the industry which would enable these employees to occupy a house and to pay for it at an economic rent.  It is one of the anomalies of industry generally that workmen engaged in producing goods are seldom able to purchase the goods they produce.  There is something always lacking in that respect.</P>
    <P>But it is worth noting that, from the census returns, we find that of the people employed in the building trade, 34 per cent. of the people, including employers, in the building trade, skilled and unskilled, occupy one and two-roomed dwellings.  The fact that they are in intermittent employment goes a very long way to explain the difficulty and the impossibility of those workmen occupying houses which will cost anything from 15/- to 20/- per week out of their earnings.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken pride both this year, and on previous years, in respect of the policy of the Government in their housing operations. <Col N="1608" /> He has told us to-day that there are still 31,000 houses required in the urban area.  He has told us the number of houses that were built under the schemes since 1922.  After all, considering the requirements of the country, both urban and rural, I think it is admitted that the real urgency is an urban one.  Bad as the housing conditions are in the country and in some of the small towns&mdash;and they are very bad indeed&mdash;the problem is more intensive and more terrible in the larger urban areas because of the generally accepted fact that the poor in lump is bad.  Now as to the solution of the urban problem, what do we find?  That during these seven years there have been 8,679 houses built.  So, taking into account 2,090 houses built under the million grant. the total number of houses built in the towns of the Free State since 1922 up to date is 10,769</P>
    <P>I find the report of the census of the production of houses, post-war to the 30th September, for Birmingham, shows that the corporation houses built, or in course of erection, numbered 32,980 in that city, plus private enterprise houses, with subsidy, 9,311, and without subsidy, 3,202.  That is, over 45,000 houses have been built in the City of Birmingham during the period since the war up to September, 1929.  In a similar period&mdash;that is, from 1922 onwards&mdash;we have produced in the urban areas of this State 10,769 houses.  I do not think that is satisfactory in view of the enormity of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted in the Dáil certain figures, without giving any enlightenment about them.  I would invite the Minister to give the House a good deal more information upon this particular subject.  There had been quoted in the Dáil for the Minister's edification and enlightenment an article which appeared in the &ldquo;Star,&rdquo; copied from the &ldquo;Manchester Guardian,&rdquo; showing the way the problem had been dealt with in the City of Vienna.  They might have referred to a much more informative article in &ldquo;Studies,&rdquo; which shows how the municipality <Col N="1609" /> of Vienna had provided a very large number of houses at a rental of about 2/- per week.  But the Minister said he would prefer that people would look at Holland rather than Vienna, and he gave certain figures showing that there had been built between 1922 and 1927 the following:&mdash;In 1922, with public grants, 41,000 houses; without grants, 4,500 houses; in 1923 there had been built 34,500 with grants and 8,500 without grants: in 1924 there had been built 24,500 with grants and 22,000 without grants; in 1925, 20,000 with grants and 27,000 without grants; in 1926, there were built 3,000 with grants and 46,000 without grants; in 1927, there were built 2,000 with grants and 48,000 without grants. That is to say, a total of 398,000 dwellings&mdash;and presumably these are equivalent to houses; although they are apartment houses they contain nevertheless separate dwellings. and were built in six years in a country with seven and a half million of people.  The Minister asked the attention of the Dáil and the country to that fact.  Presumably his desire is to show that without grants as many houses can be built as with grants.  I think the Minister ought to have given a little more information and I hope he will do so, whether by way of a speech or by laying on the Table of the House certain figures or information as to how this is being accomplished, because it is an enormous undertaking to produce 398,000 houses in a country of seven and a half millions of people, whether with grants or without grants.  We should have some more information and then we might get some assistance as to how it could be done and whether anything like similar methods could be applied to this country.</P>
    <P>There has been in the course of the discussion a good deal of reference to the proposal that had been made from time to time for long-term schemes, and not merely for long-term schemes but for what might be called rationalisation of the building industry.  I want again to direct attention to a very important fact affecting this whole question, and <Col N="1610" /> that is that when we speak of the building industry we are not speaking of the house-building industry only.  We will find from the census of production returns&mdash;I think I quoted these figures before, but it is important that they should be emphasised&mdash;that under the heading, &ldquo;Building and Construction,&rdquo; certain information is given which shows that not more than 20 per cent. of the constructional work for the year 1926 was for working-class houses.  It is true to say that in the matter of the employment of men in the building industry, in any selected time normally, not more than 25 per cent. are engaged in the construction of dwellings. Now, when one is considering this problem, one has to have that fact in mind, and the proposals that have been made for long-term schemes, and large-scale schemes have been confined to the organisation of the house-building industry, that is to say to building working-class houses, leaving for the ordinary operations of the building industry the construction of every other class of house and every other class of building.  I claim that experience has shown, both in the building industry and outside the building industry, that there is great economy to be obtained by the organisation of the industry and the standardisation of parts within the industry.</P>
    <P>The Ministers appear to think that nothing can be gained by way of organisation, or if anything can be gained by way of organisation, then it must be left, as Senator Sir John Keane would put it, to the free play of economic forces to bring the building industry, or the house-building industry into such a state of mind as to organise itself for the purpose of producing houses most economically.  I think the Minister can disabuse his mind of any expectation that the building industry will ever organise itself in that way for the purpose of producing, efficiently and cheaply, working-class houses, and the chances of that organisation taking place on the building industry's own initiative&mdash;<Col N="1611" /> and when I speak of the building industry one must, in this particular category, speak of the employer's side of the building industry, because they are the only people who can organise the industry for this work&mdash;are very small, indeed.</P>
    <P>Now it is well, in view of all that has been said, that there should be placed on record the proposals that have been made in respect of this question from the side of the trade unionists.  They have put on record this &ldquo;of the men engaged in the building industry&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>From the report that was submitted to the Conference called by the President of which Deputy Vincent Rice was Chairman. This is merely a report of the Trade Union Congress.  I think the material in it is probably in the Minister's hands, in the reports presented by the Committee of which Deputy Vincent Rice was Chairman.  In the text of the memorandum submitted to the Chairman of the Conference there was the following statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Of the men engaged in the building industry not more than 25 to 30 per cent. at any time in recent years have been employed in building houses for the working classes.  This is an important consideration in view of the demands made by the employers for concessions from the Building Trade Unions.  It would appear that, under cover of the urgent need for houses for the workers and a lowering of their cost, they aim at lower wages and longer hours on building work in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comparisons have been made as to quality of work and output between the building trade workers in Ireland and those in Great Britain to the disparagement of the Irish workers.  On that subject the Trade Unions can point to the fact that when their members go to England they find that <Col N="1612" /> they are required to work less strenuously there than in Ireland, and that when they return to Ireland to take up work here, the energy strain is decidedly greater.  If it is true, as alleged, that the labour cost of house building is higher here than in England, it is probably attributable to defects in organisation and management, or the smaller scale of operations on this side of the water.</P>
    <P>The building trade unions will guarantee that labour in this country will give at least as good a return in house-building as is obtained from Labour in England, if the jobs are organised in a similar manner, and if the general facilities for efficient production are equal.</P>
    <P>It is the view of the building trade unions that considerable saving in the cost of house building can be made if the task of building 35/40,000 houses for the workers were approached as though it were a national responsibility to be carried out on a large scale plan, by a single organisation, to be completed at the rate of three to four thousand a year.</P>
    <P>The memorandum goes on further to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Our experience as practical builders has been that appreciable waste occurs on house-building jobs owing to inefficient organisation of the supply of materials. This results from the conduct of building operations by numerous firms acting independently one of another, each on a comparatively small scale, and each dependent upon competing builders' providers and suppliers of material&mdash; all these various units being unrelated and lacking the co-ordination essential for the efficient accomplishment of their purpose, that is, the building of houses.</P>
    <P>Then they put forward certain proposals regarding a scheme of organisation, that is to say, the policy may be determined by the <Col N="1613" /> Department and the actual execution of the work should be entrusted to a building trade organisation working on a national scale, purchasing materials in a most efficient and economical way and distributing those materials efficiently and most economically, and organising the jobs in a most efficient and economic way.  I intended to read the proposals put forward but I think I can leave them out, indicating in a summary way what the proposals of the building trade workers were.  They were that a national housing trust be formed on a non-profit-making basis as a public corporation.  This will be confined to the building of working-class houses.  That should be its work, not building in general &mdash;not to attempt to enter into the building of other structures&mdash; theatres, banks, luxury premises, and so on.</P>
    <P>The building trade unions on their part will undertake to give every facility to the Trust in respect of the introduction of new machinery and methods without prejudice to the question of their introduction into the building industry generally.  The unions will also undertake that questions of demarcation which may arise will be settled without stoppage of work by reference to a trade union tribunal, and that no stoppage of work on other questions will take place until every effort has been made to secure a settlement by methods of negotiation and conciliation.</P>
    <P>It was said that these proposals were not worth a penny stamp, though they came from the operative trade unions who are able to speak on behalf of the workers in the industry.  They have been treated in that slighting way, and naturally there is not going to be the same amount of confidence in the directing authorities as there would have been had there been some consideration given to the proposals of that kind, which were.  I claim, of a definitely constructive character, and went a considerable distance towards meeting some of <Col N="1614" /> the difficulties.  The alternative proposal which is said to have been put forward by the employers was that they were prepared to open their books to the workers.  To my mind, that is not the question.  The question of economy does not arise from any charge or allegation of inordinate profits in the building of working-class houses on the part of the building industry.  There may be.  But I am not speaking now about that.  It is not in the reduction of profits that economy on a large scale is to be found.  It is by organisation, a much more efficient and better organisation of the employers' side, and, as will inevitably follow, of the workers' side of the productive process.  If the Minister is not prepared to back that proposal, as he is not, then I take it that we simply must wait until there is an authority in this country which will be prepared to look on this question as every other industry has found it necessary to look upon such questions.  Perhaps by that time the chance of speeding up building and solving the problem within a reasonable time will have arrived.</P>
    <P>From the figures that the Minister has given we can see that no less than fourteen years must elapse for the supply of the present needs of housing, without any question of further depreciation, even though the rate of building during the last seven years was doubled.  If we were able to build houses at double the pace that they have been built during the last six or seven years, it would take twelve years to build the 18,000 houses that are required in Dublin.  I do not think the House should be satisfied to contemplate another twelve years passing, even though we are able to double the pace of building, and allow this problem to remain in existence. I think the method the Minister is working on will not secure that double the number of houses will be built within the next few years as has been built during the last few years.  Therefore, while I think it is necessary that the Bill should get a second reading and be passed, I think it is a very unsatisfactory <Col N="1615" /> method of dealing with a very urgent problem.  I hope some day we shall have a Minister in office who will be able to approach the problem with the kind of vision that I had at one time hoped the present Minister would have shown.  One of the astonishing things is that a man who has had the kind of experience he has had would have dealt with this problem as though he never had such experience.  That is to say he is approaching the problem in a <i>laissez faire</i> manner, leaving the industry to carry on in a lackadaisical careless fashion, not caring whether the houses are built or not, entirely oblivious to the necessity for organisation and without that initiative and pressure which at one time he thought so necessary in another walk of life.</P>
