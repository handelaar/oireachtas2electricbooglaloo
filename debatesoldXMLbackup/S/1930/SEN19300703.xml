    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Recommendation No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New Section.  Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Bank interest paid in any year shall be allowed, in assessing income tax, as a deduction from the income received in the same year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put down this Recommendation in order to obtain from the Minister for Finance some statement as to the present position.  I understand that the procedure or rules with regard to bank interest is somewhat obscure.  In practice, I believe it is rather different to the actual strict law in the matter.  I understand that legally bank interest can only be set-off by way of repayment, but in practice I believe it is taken as a set-off in sending in returns.  There are two points which I wish to bring to the notice of the House and of the Minister: one is that bank interest is not allowed as a set-off to the previous year.  In fact, the method with regard to the return of income does not apply to bank interest.  The taxpayer in making out his return, say, for this year, sets out the total of his previous year's income, but he cannot set-off against that, even by concession, the bank interest of the previous year.  He has to make an estimate of what the bank interest for the current year will be.  If that estimate is not correct, he has to send in an amending return when the actual amount can be ascertained.  I ask the Minister, if possible by legislation in next year's Finance Bill, to ensure that the set-off of bank interest shall follow the same procedure as that of income: that is to say, that it should be made on the basis of the previous year's actual paid interest.  If that were done, it would seem to me to simplify the matter very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the present arrangement considerable injustice can be done.  I can give an actual case without mentioning names.  A certain individual <Col N="2007" /> had, say, last year some investments and paid a considerable sum in bank interest.  This year those investments were sold, but on this year's income tax assessment the charge would remain on last year's income, though the income has now gone.  While no bank interest is payable this year the taxpayer is liable for tax on the whole of last year's interest, although he did not get any interest at all. That is an example of how the present method is liable to work.  It can, I believe, to a certain extent be alleviated by concessions, but that method is not really satisfactory, and it would be far better if the whole thing were taken into account when considering the simplification of the income tax law which, I believe, is being done at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if what Senator Sir John Keane wishes to have done is the actual practice at the present time.  My experience is that bank interest is deducted from the estimate of the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a distinction made, and it is not merely a matter of practice but a matter of law between bank interest which is due on an overdraft obtained, for instance, to enable a man to purchase shares and bank interest on an overdraft obtained by a man to enable him to carry on his ordinary business.  In connection with the business overdraft, the bank interest is a business expense, but with regard to the interest on an overdraft obtained, say, for the purchase of shares, interest is allowable on that only by way of repayment.  It may be that it will be necessary to legislate for certain classes of cases, or it may be that it is possible within the existing law, in suitable cases, to treat interest on an overdraft obtained for the purchase of shares in the same way as interest on an overdraft that is obtained to enable a person to run his business.  There are certain classes of cases in which that could not be satisfactorily done, and it would not be possible to devise any simple amendment that would meet all classes of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the particular case <Col N="2008" /> mentioned by Senator Sir John Keane to-day, so far as the present year is concerned, that is fully met by Section 4 of the Finance Bill.  As a matter of fact, it is not a case where there is no income at all.  It is a case, as far as I know, where the income is very substantially reduced, in fact, reduced to a mere fraction of the income that was available last year.  The hardship that Senator Sir John Keane fears could not arise this year because the case is provided for by Section 4 of the Bill.  As regards future years, such cases will either be met by legislation or, if they are cases in which it can be done without loss to the revenue and taking one year with another, they will be met by an administrative concession. However, no difficulty can arise in the present year, and before next year we will consider it, even apart from the proposals that we have before us for simplification, as a particular difficulty that might be created as a result of the change in the basis of assessment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Committee Stage of the Bill the Minister promised to make a statement with reference to the simplification of farmers' assessments under Schedule B.  He also promised to consider the advisability of not having income tax demand notes sent out to farmers under a certain valuation and with no other source of income.  I would be glad if the Minister, when making <Col N="2009" /> his statement, would say whether he would consider favourably when preparing next year's Budget the suggestion that he should revert to the old system of assessing farmers on half their valuation.  Farmers are the only people at the present time who are assessed on three times their income.  They are supposed to have three times the income they had in pre-war days.  At that time they were assessed on half their valuation. The assessment is now on the full valuation.  In justice to the farmers I think the Minister should consider giving them a concession in next year's Budget by agreeing to revert to the old system of assessment. I would also ask the Minister to consider favourably the suggestion that was made by Senator Kennedy on the Second Reading of this Bill&mdash;that is, that in the matter of income tax arrears the Revenue Commissioners should not be going back as far as 1914.  I think the time has now arrived when the Minister should wipe out, once and for all, all income tax due prior to 1922.  In those days people may have put forward some excuse for not paying their income tax, and even though honestly due, I think that if the Minister were to insist on payment now it would put many of these people in a very precarious financial position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make an explanation with regard to a statement I made on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  Like Senator Counihan I, too, would press the Minister to say whether he could see his way not to have farmers under some particular valuation assessed for income tax at all, so that they would not be bothered with the filling up of the forms they get.  I have had personal experience of cases of that kind.  Farmers in the County Kerry came to me with these forms.  I then saw why they were assessed.  It only occurs in cases in which a farmer has a mortgage on his farm.  The Department discovers that quite easily by making a search of his file.  A farmer with a mortgage on his farm stops the income tax on the interest that he is paying. As he does not pay the interest in <Col N="2010" /> full, the only way the Department has of getting back the interest is to go to the farmer for it.  As I understand it, these are the only small farmers who are now assessed for income tax.  I made the statement that they were being troubled with these forms without knowing what was the real cause of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see that the farmers have so many able protagonists speaking on their behalf in connection with this question of income tax.  Last year when I asked that assessment on farmers be put back to the British system I had not one in the House to back me. Now I am satisfied that, with the backing of Senator Brown, we are going to have something done for us in the near future.  I want to make this quite clear.  Income tax does not touch 75 per cent. of the farmers. It was implicit in the statements made on the last occasion by those who would help that if they could see a means of helping the farmers large and small they were anxious to do so.  We do not wish any concession upon income tax at the present moment.  What we wish is de-rating and, therefore, those who wish to help the small farmers will have an opportunity when the Report of the De-rating Commission comes before the House to help the small farmers, as well as the large farmers, and thus they will be able to give advantage to everybody, so that it cannot be said it is only the farmers who pay income tax that will receive benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another interesting point was made in connection with the amount of money paid in taxation by farmers.  Senator Johnson has shown to his own satisfaction, but certainly not to mine, that the farmer pays only 20 or 30 per cent. of the taxation of the country.  I have read through his speech, and it is certainly not conclusive.  As regards half the revenue from beer and tobacco, he says that man for man and woman for woman, the farmer pays as much as the urban dweller. Therefore, in proportion to the farmers' numbers, they are paying at least half of the income of the <Col N="2011" /> country, and perhaps 60 or 70 per cent.  Is that right?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>Fifty per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards half, but the Senator leaves out of account altogether the taxation on clothes and on boots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Referring to half the income, the Senator says half is derived from tobacco and beer, and he says that man for man and woman for woman, taking it on that basis, the farmer in proportion to numbers, pays his proportionate share.  Therefore, he is paying 60 per cent. of the half.  But how does the Senator make out that they are only paying 20 per cent. of the whole, when he does not take into account anything about the purchase of boots, jams, clothing, sugar, duties on the transfer of property, and all other taxes in regard to which the farmer pays the same as anybody else?  Therefore, the Senator's figures are absolutely wrong.  I have read the Senator's statement twice, and I cannot see where he gets his figures from.</P>
      <P>Let us take the case of a gold mine.  The farmers are supposed to have the gold mines in this country. The owner of a gold mine may pay £1,000 in income tax.  He may have 1,000 employees who pay £10 a year each, so that they pay £10,000.  But who in reality pays all that tax?  Is it not the gold mine?  Similarly, all the taxes in the country come from agriculture.  Therefore, we claim that whatever our proportionate share is, we pay in proportion to our production, income tax or taxes generally, of a large amount.  I am sure Senator Johnson will agree that is so.  We do not want any concession in income tax.  What we really want is de-rating.  We have advocated an increase even in income tax, so that the benefits of de-rating may be applied to the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We claim that the proper assessment of every citizen in the State should be assessment based upon the rateable value of his house.  In that way you would bring about equality. The £1,000 a year a man pays rates <Col N="2012" /> only upon his house.  We want to bring about a position in this country where the rateable assessment shall be based on the house of the individual citizen and not based on anything else.  That is the only way you can get equality.  The £3,000 a year judge pays rates on his house, and he gets off with the rest.  The farmer with a rateable value of £50 a year will pay probably as much as the £3,000 a year judge.  That is iniquitous. The owner of the farm must live in a house and the rateable assessment ought to be on the house of each individual citizen and, in that way, you would get equality and you will not get equality any other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of rates.  The rates should be based on the house the citizen lives in in order to bring about equality.  The case was cited here yesterday of a schoolmaster living in a house of £5 valuation and paying rates only on the £5 valuation, as compared with a farmer, and that only goes to show that the farmer is placed in a very bad position under the present law. I do not press this point any further, but I hope that when recommendations from the De-rating Commission come up here for the relief of the rates on farmers those who are so friendly towards me now will meet our claims with the same encouragement that they have met me to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to call attention to a particular matter in connection with farmers' income tax and the returns they have to make, and I would ask the Minister to make a note of it.  I do not suppose that he can answer just now.  I have here a certain form, 138 L, that I have received for the first time; I thought I was familiar with all these forms. This is a demand put to the farmers and it applies to Schedule B only, for some obscure reason.  In this form the occupier is put through the most terrible inquisition as to all the details of his holding and his outgoings. He is asked a number of questions as to his cattle dealing and selling and milk, whether he lets <Col N="2013" /> machinery out for hire.  He is asked for a return of his total income and charges thereon.  And all these are duplicated in other forms which he has to fill in when making claims for repayments.  Again, all this is approached from another angle in form 79 B, but covering very much the same ground.</P>
      <P>I get perfectly bewildered with all these forms.  There really seems to be no reason for this new one which has come out this year for the first time.  It appears to be a sort of originating form and does not appear to have any regard to any specific tax.  It appears to be a form irrespective of any return.  Will the Minister tell us something about this or will he inquire into it?  I want to ask him also to consider whether he would not have any inquiry made into the whole question of grants-in-aid of local taxation.  I must admit the whole matter is very complicated. The Poor Law Commission had it before them and I think the Minister will find that they made a recommendation to the effect that the matter was in a very confused condition.  Yesterday we had the question again on the Vocational Education Bill.  I think the Minister will admit there are great inequalities in the way the grant is now administered in the different districts served.  It was shown that a rich county gets a far larger percentage of grants than a poor county.  I do not want to prejudice any inquiry but there should be an inquiry in this matter to see whether the grants are distributed on an equitable basis.  It is complicated and it could only be done in the form of a comprehensive inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is great wisdom in what Senator Sir John Keane has just said.  These grants-in-aid of rates should be more equittably distributed in regard to the poorer counties.  We had the admission from another Minister, some days ago, that no matter what public buildings may be erected in a certain county the Government could not increase the grants-in-aid because it had already reached its <Col N="2014" /> quota, apparently, in respect of Gárda barracks.  That is very unfair and I urge the Minister to pay particular attention to what Senator Sir John Keane has said in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Wilson I would ask him to answer the question he himself put, whether, whenever there have been remissions of taxation, or whenever there will be remissions of taxation, he agrees that those remissions all go to the farmers?  If he does not, then it is obvious that his contention that the farmers pay all the taxes has no foundation.  I am not doubting his word that my statement, on a former occasion, was not very illuminating or very clear.  I shall try to make it clearer.  For the year ending 1928-29 the total sum yielded by taxation was £20,930,000.  Of that, £10,576,000 came from beer, spirits, wine and tobacco.  My analysis of the census returns shows that the persons living in farmhouses and in the houses of agricultural labourers&mdash;taking these as the agricultural population&mdash; would be almost exactly half the total population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rural population&mdash;that is persons living outside the cities, towns and villages&mdash;comprise 61 per cent. of the total population, and we take 61 per cent. as the basis of calculation.  I think Senators would be slow to admit that, man for man and woman for woman, the agricultural population drinks as much whiskey, beer, spirits and wine, or uses as much tobacco as the townspeople. But assuming that it is so, then the revenue derivable from beer, spirits and tobacco consumed by them amounts to £6,500,000, out of £10,500,000.  I give an estimate which is quite arbitrary that the agricultural population pay 25 per cent. of the estate duty and ten per cent. of the income tax.  I think in both cases that is probably an excess, but if it is anyway accurate, it means that the total revenue derived from taxes from the rural population amounts to £7,728,000.  That would be about one-third of the total revenue from <Col N="2015" /> taxation.  If my figures regarding the agricultural population proper are to be taken as the basis of calculation, then there is a deduction which would make the total revenue derivable from the agricultural population 31.4 per cent.  I think the assumption is against the farmers in respect of their consumption of intoxicants and tobacco, and that in fact the revenue yielded from the agricultural population is considerably lower than 31 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator Counihan mentioned a simplified form of accounts, I presume he really meant a simplification of the forms to be filled up by those who do not present accounts.  I am prepared to have that question examined very carefully.  As a matter of fact, it has been the subject of some examination already, with a view to seeing whether it is possible to devise a form which would meet the reasonable requirements of the revenue authorities, and still be easier for the ordinary farmer to fill up.  I would be prepared to arrange that officers of the Revenue Department should discuss the matter with the Senator or with any group of farmers interested in the matter, in order that the point of view which Senator Counihan holds, and which others may hold, can be put before them in detail, and be the subject of frank discussion.  In any case, whether Senator Counihan avails of that suggestion or not, an effort will be made to simplify the form as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the sending of demand notes to farmers who have no other source of income, I got a return for one area since the matter was raised and I find that out of 20,000 farmers in the area only 185 of those who were not known to have other sources of revenue received forms, so that as far as the sending of forms to farmers who have no other source of income is concerned, very few of them are sent out.  I admit that farmers without other sources of revenue received forms, and that a certain number are not <Col N="2016" /> liable to tax, and it may be possible to reduce in some areas the number of forms actually sent out.  A certain number will have to go out.  In certain places the valuation would obviously make them liable, and in that case the forms would be sent in order that they may pay tax if they cannot show that they are not liable. In other cases, it may incorrectly be believed that farmers have other sources of revenue, and a certain number of forms are bound to go to farmers who are believed to have other sources of revenue although they may still prove not to be liable to the tax.  The policy, at any rate, is clearly one of not sending out forms unless there is some good ground for believing that the persons who receive them will be liable to tax.  The Senator will see that to send out forms otherwise would mean not merely causing annoyance but a great increase in the work of the office.</P>
    <P>So far as the question of reducing the basis to one-third of the valuation is concerned, I do not see any ground for that, and I would like to say again that the question of income tax on the profits of agricultural land, broadly speaking, does not affect farmers.  It affects those who are farmers plus something else, such as farmers and shop-keepers. The real question of income tax on agricultural land is, one might say, of no interest to the farmer.  The form which was referred to by Senator Sir John Keane is an old form, issued to enable a man to claim reliefs in certain cases.  I believe it is a form that is not very frequently issued, but it has been in existence for a long time.</P>
    <P>With regard to recasting the system of grants-in-aid of local taxation, the objection that I see to initiating an enquiry into that is this, that I think such an enquiry would inevitably result in a very large increase in the total amount of grants that would have to be paid, because if it was found that the distribution of the grants was inequitable, I think we would be unable to take away any grants from places where they were held to be too large, while we <Col N="2017" /> would have to give a large increase to poorer areas to bring them up relatively to the level of areas well endowed at present.  For that reason, I would be inclined to hesitate very much about going into the question that the Senator put forward.  I admit that there is no logical basis for the present distribution of, say, the agricultural grant, but I am certain we could not re-distribute that grant.  We could not take a grant from some counties that have it if we wanted to balance up matters.  We would simply have to double the grants at present paid.  I believe that the matter of grants-in-aid of local taxation can only be examined perhaps in connection with the Report of the Commission on De-rating. If some big reform of local government and local taxation is going to be undertaken, naturally the question of grants-in-aid would have to be considered as part of that change. But to consider grants-in-aid by themselves as a separate matter of enquiry would, I think, only lead, as I have said, to a very considerable increase in the amounts to be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to the activities of a body calling itself the Irish Free State Textile Association.  This body consists of a number of firms in the general drapery trade, some doing a purely wholesale business, and some large retail firms who also do a wholesale trade.  These firms act and work together, and so far as I can learn, their object is to prevent manufacturers doing business with other firms who do not belong to the Association, or who they do not consider should be able to buy direct from manufacturers. The method adopted is as follows: The manufacturing firm is informed that none of the members of the so-called Textile Association will do any business with it if it continues to deal with any non-member of the Association that they disapprove of.  In one case the manufacturers, an Irish firm, were asked to submit a complete list of their customers to the Association, and when they very properly declined to do so, their representative was informed by members of the Textile Association that he need not call upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another case of which I have knowledge, a Dublin firm was informed by the representative of an English manufacturer with whom the firm had been doing business for about 50 years, that the Textile Association was trying to get the manufacturer to discontinue trading with them.  To my own knowledge efforts have been made by the Association to get English manufacturers to cease business with a well-known Dublin wholesale and retail house, <Col N="2019" /> who are not members, and, I understand, similar attacks have been made on a purely wholesale house who applied for membership of the Association, but was refused.</P>
    <P>The principal object of this Association, no doubt, is to prevent retail shops dealing direct with manufacturers and so being in a position to sell cheaply to the public.  One may sympathise with the wholesale middleman whose day is fast disappearing, and it is not perhaps surprising that he should try to force retail firms to buy from him, but when you have large retailers, who also have a wholesale department, using methods like these to injure their own retail competitors, it is little short of a scandal.</P>
    <P>However, if the Association had confined its activities to English manufacturers, I would not have thought it necessary to draw the attention of the Minister to it.  Most goods made in England can also be obtained from the Continent, and foreign firms are always ready to serve any house that can pay for their goods.  If English manufacturers are foolish enough to confine their trade to one association it will only injure English trade but will not seriously affect this country. Firms who are not members of the Association can easily buy their goods from Germany or France, and there is no fear that manufacturers from these countries will refuse to serve them.</P>
    <P>Now that this attempt at boycott is being applied to Irish manufacturers I suggest that it is time the Minister for Industry and Commerce looked into the matter.</P>
    <P>One large Free State factory I know has been placed in the position that if it does not confine its trade to members of the Association or other firms approved by it, thereby losing all its other trade in Ireland, it will be boycotted by the Association, who will no doubt buy goods outside the Saorstát which were previously supplied by this firm.  I presume the same treatment will be meted out to all other large Irish <Col N="2020" /> manufacturers and, if so, I submit it will be most injurious to Irish trade.</P>
    <P>Irish retail and smaller wholesale and retail houses must buy as cheaply as they can, and they will not buy Irish goods if they have to pay a middleman's profit, when they can buy the same goods outside the country direct from the manufacturer. Even where there is a protective duty, the value of the duty in assisting Irish manufacturers to compete will be destroyed if it has to be set off against a middleman's profit, and, generally speaking, the larger Irish retail firms will prefer to pay duty than to be forced to pay a middleman's profit.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that the Minister should interfere as between retail and wholesale houses.  They must fight their own battles.  But I suggest that the Department of Industry and Commerce should keep in touch with the position and see that it is not allowed to develop on lines which will injure Irish manufacturers. I understand there is a body in England called the Wholesale Textile Association, which is endeavouring to operate on similar lines in England, and I gather from an article in the &ldquo;Hosiery Times,&rdquo; an English trade journal, that it is realised in England that trade is going to the Continent as a result. The whole question has, I believe, been referred to the &ldquo;Restraint of Trade&rdquo; Committee which was set up by the British Government.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might consider the setting up of some such departmental committee here to enquire into the position.  It would not be desirable to interfere with the right of any firm to deal with whomever they chose, but it ought not to be legally permissible for individuals or firms to conspire together to boycott manufacturers because they exercise their rights to choose their own customers.</P>
    <P>I have just seen a letter from the Irish Free State Textile Association to an Irish manufacturing firm in which they state that they are affiliated with the English Association and demanding that the Irish <Col N="2021" /> firm should submit for their approval a list of the English retail firms they do business with.  To my mind, it is outrageous that a body of distributing firms in Ireland should actually try to dictate what customers in England an Irish manufacturer should deal with, and I hope the Minister will agree that the matter is one which should be looked into without delay.</P>

      <P>It is much to be regretted that Senator Douglas had not the opportunity of circulating that very important statement to members of the Seanad.  We have only to judge it now hurriedly from hearing what he has said.  No doubt his statements are well founded and can be substantiated.  If they can be substantiated, it is a case for prosecution for criminal conspiracy as well as for a civil action for conspiracy. I am sorry to say that this canker seems to have penetrated into other trades as well as the textile trade.  At present I would like to confine my remarks to such aspects of the question as bear on the tariffs which have been imposed in this country upon imported textile goods.  I think it is a serious question if the tariffs which have been imposed for the purpose of developing the manufacture of textile goods in Ireland are to be availed of for the private gain of individuals, whether middlemen or manufacturers. I think the Minister should at once take measures to see that this practice is put a stop to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise an entirely different question.  I thought perhaps it might have been convenient for the Minister to deal with the subject raised by Senator Douglas before I raised the question I am interested in.  I want to ask for some information regarding the <Col N="2022" /> proposed Imperial Conference to be held in the autumn of this year.  The Oireachtas will not be sitting, as I take it that the conference will be well under way, if not over, by the time the Dáil and Seanad meet again, and I think it is opportune and right that some indication should be given as to Ministerial policy on certain large questions, and that the House might be given whatever information is available regarding the agenda for that conference. Previous conferences dealt with a very great variety of subjects.  It is not quite clear, to me at any rate, what the responsibilities are of the Free State Ministry in respect to some of these subjects.  For instance, in 1923 the question was discussed as to Britain's relations with Egypt, the Anglo-Japanese alliance, and matters connected with the British foreign relations generally, and defence questions. In 1926 a variety of questions of a similar kind were raised and discussed, including, for instance, the way the League of Nations mandates were availed of by various members of the British Commonwealth. Certain decisions were arrived at, or recommendations were made, by the Conference in regard to matters like that.  I am not clear what the position of the Free State is in regard to the way New Zealand or South Africa carries out the mandate in regard to the territories which they govern in trust for the League of Nations.  We know that there is to be a discussion on another matter that will be the subject of the motion by Senator Gogarty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question that probably is uppermost in the mind of the Minister is the Report of the Conference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation and Merchant Shipping Legislation, which is to be dealt with at the Imperial Conference.  One of the subjects which I think it would be well we had some light thrown upon, and perhaps an indication of the line of policy to be adopted, is a question which we have been informed by the Press will be raised by General Hertzog, Premier of South Africa.  It will be known to Senators that that report dealt <Col N="2023" /> with the question of any future legislation affecting the Throne and the Royal Style and Title.  A certain agreement was arrived at by the Conference regarding a proposal that the British Parliament should legislate in a certain definite form, that is to say, that no change shall in future be made touching the law regarding succession without the assent of the Parliaments of the Dominions, as well as the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  That subject caused a discussion in the South African Parliament, and the leader of the Opposition, General Smuts, declared that it settled the question which had affected South African politics very seriously; that is the right of secession if they so desired.  The response to that assertion of General Smuts by General Hertzog and others of his Ministers was, that they did not recognise that the agreements of the Dominion experts' conference affected the claim of General Hertzog and the Government of South Africa as to the right of South Africa to secede from the British Empire if they desired at any time.</P>
    <P>General Hertzog said he would raise this question at the Imperial Conference, and the Assembly approved of the document subject to the proviso that the recommendation referring to the succession to the Crown should not be regarded as encroaching upon the right of South Africa or any other of the Dominions to secede from the Commonwealth.  That question will be raised, and I think it is only right and proper to have some expression of the policy of the Free State in regard to so important a matter as that.  I hope that on the broad basic principle our Minister will join in the claim that freedom of association within the British Commonwealth inevitably implies freedom to dissociate if and when the Dominions so desire and when they are prepared to consider all the consequences.  I think it would be a very good thing indeed for the future of this country, as well as others, if it would be possible <Col N="2024" /> to arrive at a declaration that whatever decisions were come to on such questions on the part of any member of the British Commonwealth that no force would be applied to limit its freedom of action.  I believe that is a statement of what would be a fact.  I do not believe that it is at all likely that any armed force would be used to bind with hooks of  any freely associated member of the Commonwealth of Nations to the Commonwealth of Nations if that particular State desired to secede.  If a declaration were made by responsible Ministers of the various Parliaments that in such circumstances no armed force would be used to compel any such free association, a great advance would be made towards settling many very knotty problems in this country and probably in South Africa, too.  Another question which gives some concern is regarding what is called Empire Defence. We know that in the reports of the previous Conferences a considerable amount of discussion appears to have taken place regarding Empire Defence. I am anxious to know what the position of the Free State is touching that particular subject.</P>
    <P>The question has been forced upon my notice owing to something that I read in the recently issued Report of the Simon Commission.  That is a very serious State document, and when we learn from very prominent statesmen, what I am going to read to you, the point of what I am saying will be better understood.  The quotation is:&mdash;&ldquo;It seems to us that the only possible method would be to recognise that the protection of the frontiers of India, at any rate for a long time to come, should not be regarded as a function of an Indian Government in relation with an Indian Legislature, but as a matter of supreme concern to the whole Empire, which can only be effectively organised and controlled by an Imperial agency.  A solution based on this principle would probably have to be brought about by a definite agreement between India and Great <Col N="2025" /> Britain acting on behalf of the Empire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is that last phrase that I am concerned about.  When very important publicists, notwithstanding that four years have passed since the 1926 Conference, prefer to speak in terms of &ldquo;Great Britain acting on behalf of the Empire,&rdquo; in regard to armed forces acting in India, I am anxious that the Free State position should be made clear, and that we ought not to allow it to go forth without objection that any armed action in the east, west or south, or in any other part of the world, taken by Great Britain, is on behalf of the Empire of which the Free State forms part and to which the Free State is a party.  I think we ought to make it clear that we have no responsibility for the use of the British Army either in the frontiers of India, in China or any other part of the world, and that it is not acting on behalf of the Empire in the sense that the &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; has been used to defeat the Association of which the British Commonwealth, including the Dominions, forms a part.  If that is not made clear, if it is to be assumed that when Great Britain undertakes warlike operations or sends an army into India or China, or builds a naval base at Singapore, it is on behalf of the Empire, and that it is to some degree on behalf of the Irish Free State, then I think it is time that there should be a protest made and some dissociation on the part of the Irish Free State from responsibility for any such action.  I raise these points now because I think that they will inevitably arise in the course of the discussion during the Conference that is coming forward in the autumn, and as neither House will then be sitting I think it well to raise at least one voice now to call attention to these very serious problems.</P>

      <P>I would like to press upon the Minister, in view of what Senator Sir John Keane has said, the urgent necessity of getting a report from the Ports and Harbours Tribunal or Commission.  The Bill has been delayed for two years. <Col N="2026" /> At least, the Tribunal has been sitting for two years.  There are other things, too, that we may get along with when we have the report, such as, for example, control of our shipping or at least to find out what we should do with regard to our shipping. It is necessary to have that report also in order to get control, or to see what control we can get, over the Port and Docks Board.  It seems extraordinary that it should take such a long time to deal with such an important matter.  I would urge the Minister to see that this report is speeded up as quickly as possible. I would like if the Minister would now say what progress has been made in that matter or what has caused the delay.</P>

      <P>A point has been raised by Senator Douglas as regards the activities of the body which calls itself the Dublin Textile Association.  In regard to that, I can only say that the activities of the Association will have to be watched.  At the moment, it is impossible for me to say how far they have authority to enforce the claims that they are making.  In that absence of information, it is impossible for me to say how far their claims and activities are considered a restraint on trade or something that can be dealt with in that way.  I can give a promise that that particular Association will be definitely inquired into, and that its activities will be watched.  I cannot say more than that at present.</P>

      <P>In that connection, Senator Comyn has the view that this Association had some adverse effect on the tariffed industries in the State.  He could not tell us how that has been brought about.  I want to call attention to one phrase which Senator Comyn used when he said that these tariffs should not be allowed to be used for the private gain of anybody.  Every tariff is <Col N="2027" /> used for the private gain of somebody.</P>
      <P>As to the query in regard to the report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal, I answered a question in the Dáil to the effect that the Ports and Harbours Tribunal had reported, that the report was in the hands of the printers, and would be issued almost immediately.  It is a lengthy document, and it has been in the hands of the printers pretty definitely for a month.  It is a very big book.  I do not at all consider that two years is an extravagantly long period to spend on the work of this Commission.  As a matter of fact they have been sitting for some time longer than two years.  It was an extraordinarily difficult survey which had to be made over 18 ports. Each of these had to be visited and evidence taken.  Notice had to be given of these visits, and evidence had to be taken of the way in which the applicants intended to give their version of the facts.  It must be also borne in mind in connection with the report that some of the members were acting in an honorary capacity, and had outside duties to perform. One cannot impose on people who are outside the State service, the obligation of attending day after day unceasingly to work of this kind. One must fit in the work with their convenience.  In addition, one of the officials who was concerned in the work was an official of such a type that promotion came to him during the course of the inquiry, and he was transferred from my own Department to the Department of Defence, and afterwards to another Department. That, in addition to other things, imposed certain delays in the drawing up of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnson raised two matters with regard to the Imperial Conference, in fact, three matters&mdash; the question of foreign relations generally as affecting what is wrongly described as the British Empire, a question arising out of paragraph 60 of the 1929 Report, and certain peculiar comments which individuals have made on the Simon <Col N="2028" /> Commission Report.  On the whole matter of foreign relations, I would like to point out that the 1926 Report in dealing with them, said:&mdash;&ldquo;Subsequent sections of this Report give an account of particular questions affecting foreign affairs which were studied during the Conference by the representatives of the Governments particularly concerned.&rdquo; The Report said especially on the matter of mandated territory:&mdash;&ldquo;Questions of common interest in relation to mandated territories were referred to a special committee which included representatives of Great Britain, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa.&rdquo;  It is only in a foreign relations matter, which is of most general interest, that we would have any say, or would hope to have any say, whatever.  We noticed that on the question of foreign relations the one really important phrase that is used is that &ldquo;the Governments were firmly attached to a policy of peace and to support of the League of Nations as the great instrument of peace.&rdquo;  It is in such a matter as that that we would have a serious interest.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the Simon Commission Report.  Senator Johnson introduced his observations under this head with the remarks that the Simon Commission Report was a State document.  It is a State document of considerable importance, but it is not a State document of this State and has nothing whatever to do with us.  There are certain remarks which the Senator quoted. These remarks are obiter dicta.  If these remarks are translated into formal proposals in a dispatch way the Senator suggests they will get the definite repudiation that the Senator wants.  My activities would extend beyond any sphere of usefulness if I had to attend to the remarks of representatives from the various parts of the Commonwealth.  If we were to act on the basis that such Reports bind every constituent State of the Commonwealth, we would be acting under a misapprehension.  The phrase &ldquo;Imperial defence&rdquo; is clearly <Col N="2029" /> a phrase used in a sense that might have full and proper meaning and application ten years ago, but it is quite irrelevant in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Imperial defence&rdquo; in the Report means the defence that would be undertaken by Great Britain, her Colonies, Protectorates and mandated territories, but it has no relation whatever to the British Commonwealth of Nations.  There has never been, to my knowledge, a Dominion regiment in India.  There has been certainly never a Dominion regiment for the purpose of preserving internal peace or even for the purpose of preserving the Indian frontiers against attack.  The phrases that are used there have to be all considered from the angle that I speak about.  That is, if the thing is raised at the Conference as a question of Imperial defence it is a defence matter affecting Great Britain, the Colonies and the Protectorates, but certainly not a British Commonwealth of Nations matter.</P>
    <P>On the further matter of the 1929 reports and what is said in paragraph 60 with regard to the alterations of the laws affecting the succession to the Throne and the Royal Style and Title, I would like to go a little bit more into the history of what occurred in South Africa after the report was presented.  It is true, as Senator Johnson says, that exception was taken to that paragraph by General Smuts, the leader of the Opposition in the South African Assembly, on this ground, that it definitely marked the end of the secession question.  Afterwards, when challenged.  General Smuts admitted that if paragraph 60 is read altogether, that the force of his argument is considerably mitigated, but if one portion of that paragraph, which is set out in italics, were taken away from the context of the rest of the paragraph, and were put in the forefront, it might then affect the power of secession.  Most of the authorities in South Africa seem to be of opinion that that should not occur.  When General Smuts was challenged he said he had <Col N="2030" /> been misquoted and that an addition to the phrase he had used had been put in.  He denied that he had used these words.  He said that whatever was done with regard to the succession to the Throne should be without any repercussion adversely on the right to secede.  Apparently they were all agreed on that point, but there was a peculiar division afterwards on the resolution.</P>
    <P>With all deference to the judgment of those who spoke in the South African Parliament, I still hold that the two questions of succession and secession are to be taken apart.  One has no relation to the other.  There is no relation between these two things.  Certainly, so far as the 1929 Report is concerned, there is no relation. If any one of the present members of the British Commonwealth of Nations desires to secede, the only thing in my mind that is blocked by Article 60, is secession by way of alteration in the succession.  If a Dominion does not want to bother about succession, but simply wants to leave the Commonwealth, Article 60 presents no difficulty.  Succession and secession are entirely different questions. If the Dominion wanted to become a Republic and to remain inside the Commonwealth, and wished to do so by changing the order of the succession to the Throne, then, undoubtedly, Article 60 would be a definite bar, but if some one member of the Commonwealth tried to get outside the Commonwealth, Article 60 would have no operative effect whatever in relation to that Dominion. A State which seeks to get outside an organisation which has certain rules and regulations, is careless as to what the rules and regulations are, in so far as they affect those who remain inside afterwards.  What happens afterwards has no concern for such a State.  Whatever happens concerns only those who remain within the partnership. I cannot understand that there should be any confusion of thought on these two questions of secession and succession.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2031" /> Apart from Article 60 of the report altogether, Senator Johnson raised a point as to the right of dissociation. He thought that the people had the right of dissociation, and that that should be laid down.  I think that is the situation at the moment&mdash;I heard it laid down by various British statesmen in control and power in the British Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot say.  As far as our country is concerned, our touch with the Commonwealth of Nations is through the Treaty.  If the Treaty is broken or if the Treaty is by agreement amended, we can get outside that association.  To get outside that association without the process of negotiation would to my mind involve a breach of the Treaty and what follows thereafter is a matter for speculation.  People can make up their own minds for themselves. I would much prefer not to have paragraph 60 of this report dealt with from the point of view of the right to secede.  Apparently before General Smuts made his declaration they were all agreed that there had been an article of faith for many years that the right of secession was inherent and that paragraph 60 of the report had no repercussion on that good, bad or indifferent. When the point was raised General Hertzog said he would take the challenge and would go with a particular proposal to the Imperial Conference &mdash;I think this was in order to meet objections put up by the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;that the two things were bound together, the 1926 report and paragraph 60 of the report.  The 1926 report gave them an equal position and they were not going to have that position clouded in any way by what happened in 1929.  With that general point of view we agreed.  As to what General Hertzog said, that is a matter that must be left for consideration when the Conference meets.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Senator or the Minister tell us what the position with respect to the first register will be, supposing a large number of claims have to be dealt with by the registration-officer.  If the registration officer, for instance, <Col N="2036" /> has between now and the date of the first register to decide on the valuation of the part of the premises occupied for business, or professional purposes, and the part occupied for residential purposes and has to rule on the portion of the valuation of such premises purely attributable to the parts so occupied, that may prevent the preparation of the register in time for the election.  One can see the possibility of such a position arising if a large number of applications of that kind are made and have to be decided before the October elections take place.</P>

      <P>Well, in any event this is a most important motion. Senator Johnson referred to the difficulty that the registration officer will have in making that apportionment in the time allowed.  There will indeed be very great difficulties. It is very doubtful if that work can be thoroughly done in the time allowed.  So far as I can see the only thing that can be done is to take the valuation lists, look up the valuation of a house, and if it is occupied divide it by two.  Some rule of thumb method of that sort will have to be adopted, and it is just as well that the Seanad should understand what they are being asked to do.</P>

      <P>We must all be quite clear that we are throwing on the registration officer a rather big task; that of preparing between this and, say, the early part of September a register that, in normal circumstances would be compiled between <Col N="2037" /> the 15th of November in one year and the 1st of June in the next. Normally that is the period allowed for the preparation of a register, but with regard to the preparation of this first register, there is no other way out than the way that has been indicated.  We want this register for the next election.  We are making provision in the Dublin Bill that the Council must be elected not later than the 31st October next, so that we are giving the registration officer a difficult task apart from any difficulty he may find on this particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the Seanad that the proposed registration officer himself does not see the very great difficulties in this matter that individual Senators who have spoken on it seem to see.  There may have to be a certain amount of rule of thumb introduced into the matter, but the Town Clerk has a fair idea of what is involved. So far as it comes within the province of my Department, we will see that such assistance as may be necessary will be provided to enable him to overcome the difficulties referred to as well as any other difficulty that may arise.  This amendment is really consequential on what was decided on in the Dublin Bill, namely, to make business premises, whether wholly or partly occupied for business purposes, the basis of the franchise.  As I pointed out on an earlier stage, the registration officer would be called on, in respect of this franchise, to perform duties similar to those which he already performs in the case of persons claiming a Dáil vote not in respect of residence but in respect of business premises.  So that the position is that this is not a new type of duty that is being thrown on him.  It is <Col N="2038" /> a duty that he already has had experience of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been put forward as a contribution of the Government's policy towards the solution of the housing problem.  We have had a certain amount of information, gradually unfolded, as to the policy the Government is trying to develop regarding this very serious problem.  We have learned, for instance, that they desire, at the earliest possible moment, to abolish rent restrictions, that they intend at the earliest possible moment to abolish subsidies on buildings, that they are proposing to leave to the building industry to find means within itself, without Government intervention, of building houses at a lower cost than has been done up to date.  I believe I am right in saying that the Minister believes that some separate treatment will have to be given to what is called the problem of the slums, or the problem of the slum dwellers.  I would like, if possible, to get from the Minister some idea of what he is thinking of in regard to the slums.</P>
      <P>I find, taking Dublin as the great illustration, that it is difficult to say what is meant by slums unless one is thinking only of third-class tenement houses.  In looking over the census returns, and the Registrar-General's returns, one can take from the City of Dublin certain registration districts comprising just half of the total population of Dublin&mdash;that is to say, 142,000 persons out of 284,000 persons.  And taking that half of the city into account we have this very awful fact: that fifty per cent. of that half of the population live, three-and-more persons per room, and that 34 per cent. of those persons live four-and-more persons per room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not right to think of that very great number of over-crowded dwellings as being occupied by spendthrifts and wasters and the very poor, because one finds that 39 per cent. of the total number of carpenters in the City of Dublin are living in dwellings two-and-more per room; and of other woodworkers 50.5 of the total number are occupying dwellings two-and-more persons per room, and 28 per cent. three-and-more persons per room.  Of metal workers, which is mainly a skilled occupation, 46.6 per cent. of the people occupied in that industry are living in dwellings two-and-more persons per room, so that when speaking of the slum problem as something distinct from the general housing problem we have to take into account certainly a full half of the population in those registration <Col N="2041" /> areas which comprise 50 per cent. of the total population.  Therefore the problem of Dublin housing is not merely a problem of slum dwellers. When the Minister has stated as his policy the removal of the restrictions of rent, the abolishing of subsidies on house building, and leaving the industry to find a means of building houses which can be let at a rent which this half of the population of working people in the city can pay, then, I think, he is not dealing satisfactorily with the problem, and that the outline of policy he has given us from time to time is entirely unsatisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy) Richard (General) Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnson has asked for some statement from me as to what is going to be our line of treatment dealing with the slum problem in Dublin.  There is no use in the Senator asking me to do that at a time when there is no general acceptance of some of the other points he has mentioned.  He says our policy appears to lie in no restriction of rents, no subsidies, and letting the building trade develop upon its own.  I want to know in return for what reason should we, in our general outlook on the housing policy, stand for any restriction of rent, for what reason should we stand for any subsidy to the building of houses, and for what reason should we stand for any interference in the organisation of the building trade.  These are things that more than all others might be faced frankly by everybody.  You have so many thousands of people living under the conditions that prevail in the City of Dublin and you must look after them.  What is called the slum problem in Dublin is not a simple matter, and more is required than to build decent houses for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree with Senator Johnson, but I do not think that anybody suggested that the people occupying places in Dublin called slums, are entirely thriftless people, or very poor people.  I know there are many families living under appalling conditions <Col N="2042" /> that have, for a long time, £3, or £4, or £5 a week coming into them.  I know there are families living like that who, of themselves, have no desire to shift from their surroundings.  We have also, in what are called slum dwellings in the city of Dublin, some very valuable property that requires to be conserved with the greatest possible care.  A lot of that property is not controlled, at present, or not controlled in a proper way, so as to keep the houses in repair and in proper condition, and unless something is done to conserve that property we will be faced with a much worse housing problem in the city of Dublin in ten years more than we have now, so that when we come to consider the City of Dublin itself, we are faced with devising measures for the conserving of very valuable property in the slums; and for seeing that such re-modelling as is required is carried out by some one.  We are faced with the problem of providing suitable accommodation for the working classes convenient to their work. We are now in the position that it has been admitted that in the matter of apartment houses in Mercer Street the building costs are £190 a room.  We know that if that particular type of housing accommodation is to be provided in the city at a reasonable rent, seeing that most families desire to live close to their work, we will also have to provide other houses outside at reasonable rents.  We have to consider the number of people involved and the circumstances under which they are living, and at the same time we are asked to provide money to assist the ordinary type of person to build houses, to provide money to enable labourers in the rural districts to get houses; and to provide money by way of subsidy to enable workers in towns to get houses at rents that they are able to pay.  On the last Housing Bill we said that we were going to concentrate on the four-roomed house rather than the five-roomed house. We were criticised by Senator Johnson's <Col N="2043" /> party without any consideration of the housing conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are faced with the situation that if we go to a country like our own, Sweden, we find that fifty per cent. of the inhabited houses there consist of a kitchen and two rooms, or with even less accommodation.  Here, with a housing problem that has been left us by governmental and industrial conditions that existed in Dublin, we are criticised because we proposed to concentrate on four-roomed houses.  Personally, I believe that if we are going to make any impression on certain aspects of the housing problem, we will have to get a cheaper type of house than the standard four-roomed house we are building.  I think the Senator will understand me when I say that I am not prepared at the present time to discuss what is to be done with regard to the slums in Dublin until we have cleared the public mind more in respect of what I call the economic side of house building.  As I said before, in a country where agriculture is the main industry, it is argued that as workers in non-rural industries comprise more than half of the whole population, they must be assisted in respect to housing.  To do that means that the country cannot provide houses for the very poor and that it will take a long time to clear away the legacy of bad housing conditions that a certain number of decades here left us.  The present Housing Bill is offered as a continuance of the Government's policy of providing houses, to stimulate the building industry so that it may get on its feet and organise itself and by giving subsidies to assist private capital to build until the price of houses reaches a normal level.  The policy has helped the building industry and has helped to induce private capital to invest in house building by giving subsidies to local authorities and public utility societies.  This Bill is a continuation of that policy.  The Seanad need not <Col N="2044" /> expect that Bills of this kind will come before it annually.  We are leading up to the position in which we will have to deal with the general housing question and deal with the whole housing requirements in a comprehensive way.  We are looking forward to the time when there will be no restrictions, no subsidy for housing except so far as the very poor are concerned, or for the clearing away of insanitary areas, and leading up to the time when the building industry will stand on its own feet like any other industry.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 61, sub-section (4).  To insert before the sub-section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Every compulsory course of technical instruction provided under this section shall provide for not more than ninety hours of manual instruction and not less than ninety hours of non-manual instruction.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is provided under this section that not less than 180 hours a year will be devoted to compulsory technical education, and the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that a portion of the time of the compulsory attendance shall be devoted to non-manual work.  On the Second <Col N="2046" /> Reading I emphasised the desirability of having cultural education as part of the education of those attending the compulsory classes for technical works.  I would like that the Seanad would give this matter full consideration and, if convinced by the arguments, pass the amendment. We all know that we have a very considerable number of people in Ireland who are able to read and write, and yet who, in the real sense, must be termed illiterate.  My idea is that at these compulsory technical classes there should be a measure of education given in a general sense, and that facilities should be afforded to students to develop cultural tendencies, if they have any.</P>
    <P>I feel that we have a very considerable amount of native talent, in some cases amounting to genius. that is potential in the country, undeveloped, and it is with a view to giving such cultural development and general education that I suggest this amendment is necessary.  The scheme will probably be interpreted throughout the country, and particularly outside the cities as purely vocational, and I am afraid that what will happen will be that those who are attending these classes will be expected to continue the manual end of work at which they have been engaged all day.  I do not think that is desirable.  As I stated on the Second Reading I have considerable experience in the handling of apprentices and those attending technical classes.  I have the feeling that in the real sense, education only commences when one leaves school, and that the years between 16 and 20 or 22 are really the formative years when character is developed, tendencies are self-discovered or otherwise, and that a certain amount of lead or direction is then essential to open up the minds of the youth of the country as to what their potential faculties, tastes or tendencies may be. I hold that you will not get that in the ordinary technical class, provided it is only going to devote itself exclusively to the purely vocational side.  Even on the technical side I feel that the applied arts and science <Col N="2047" /> of the particular industry in which youth are interested, or are already working at, like wood-work, should form the basis of instruction at the technical classes.  Drawing, mathematics and geometry, scaling in other industries, scientific analysis and estimating costs might be included in the course.  Take agriculture, at the classes, mathematics would be far more important than most other subjects.  We should have it laid down in a statutory way, that these are really important factors in the vocational education that we want to impart.  I do not want to labour the matter unduly.  I referred to it fully on the Second Reading, and I think Senators understand what I have in mind.  The idea is to divide the hours so that not less than half the time will be devoted to compulsory technical education on the manual side, and the other half to the cultural side of the work. I do not like the word non-manual but I was at a loss to know what word to put in.  To insert the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; sounds almost priggish or pedantic, but, at the same time, it is with a view to giving an opportunity for cultural development throughout the country that I put down the amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have some suggestion to make on the matter, and he may even go to the extent of accepting the word &ldquo;cultural,&rdquo; but if that is done we may have to change the whole title and designation of the Bill.  The object is to give throughout rural Ireland the opportunity for cultural training, for giving the right angle or slant at the right time to any potential development as regards the students, and that may result in poetry, drama, or other literature, or applied arts.  I am interested to get them directed into a channel whereby they may seek learning for themselves, and understand the value of cultural training.  In other words, if we get them to read for themselves we will have achieved something.  As I have already said, our education really only starts when we leave school, and that <Col N="2048" /> applies even to university students. If the Minister is agreeable to accept the amendment we will in some way ensure that the classes established throughout the country will do something towards that end.  For that reason I commend the amendment to the consideration of the House.</P>

      <P>It rather puzzles me that anyone should wish to make any process of education so rigid as the Senator suggests.  He presupposes that humanity is a sort of common stereotyped form, and that you have only to say to them &ldquo;draw&rdquo; and they will draw, and so on through the other subjects.  I do not know if the Senator is a family man.  In the case of children, one might be specially adapted for music, and another for domestic work, and so on.  As you approach humanity in the common you have to look at it from a different angle.  You have to take the disposition of the individual if you are going to do any service by education, public or private, and you have to work on a system that has elasticity.  There are many types, especially in rural Ireland.  It would be an absolute waste of money to put a certain class studying mathematics, drawing and music, but where there is a talent for music or drawing, then instruction should be given in such cases in those subjects, and similarly if they have any manual dexterity they should be given a training in manual work.  But you cannot take people as if they were solid, inanimate things, and carve them out in a particular way like a lump of butter.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not embark on anything so rigid or stereotyped as the amendment suggests, and that he will leave the local bodies a considerable amount of discretion, leaving them the opportunity of grouping those who show a cultural inclination into cultural classes and those who have an aptitude for manual work into manual classes.  Generally speaking, the aim should be to act in matters of this kind as one would in ordinary human affairs.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Connolly is looking forward a long way when he says that all over the country they are going to have compulsory technical education, because, according to the Bill, the Minister may designate certain areas to a committee where he will insist on compulsory education.  The compulsory side of the Bill does not apply all over rural Ireland, and for that reason I think Senator Connolly is advancing too fast.  We ought to see how this measure will work before we insist on rigidity of the kind that Senator Connolly suggests.  Let the teachers, clergy and educated people who will be on the committees see from experience what is the best course to adopt and then, if they think it necessary, let them formulate regulations which they consider satisfactory and submit them to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I have sympathy with the desire of Senator Connolly. I am afraid the amendment is not well drafted, and I am doubtful whether it is practicable.  I do not think it applies to the right section, to begin with.  I think the section deals with continuation education almost entirely and not with technical education; but apart from that, which is rather a point of drafting, I call attention to the fact that there is implicit in the amendment that there shall be some hours devoted to manual instruction where compulsory education is enforced.  I do not know whether the Senator proposes a manual course for persons attending a commerce class, for instance. Many of the subjects that come under the head of technical education are not manual at all in the generally accepted sense.  The amendment would seem to impose the obligation on the persons attending such classes to undergo certain manual training.  That may be desirable, but whether it is desirable under this Bill or not I am very doubtful.  I think that we all desire to meet the hopes and expectations of the Senator in regard to limiting the number of manual working hours.  That one who had been <Col N="2050" /> working eight or nine hours at, say woodwork, should go to manual work for another four hours a week is not helping him in education; whereas to give him a certain amount of theoretical training in the same industry, or other mental training, would be of greater advantage than to put him at purely manual operations.  The definition of technical education is so much wider than manual operations that I think the working out of the amendment would be quite unsatisfactory, and would not be what is desired.</P>

      <P>I take it that the putting in of the word &ldquo;technical&rdquo; by the Senator in the amendment was a slip.  What Senator Johnson has pointed out is quite correct.  So far as the actual wording is concerned the amendment could not be inserted in the place proposed, but I take it for granted that the use of the word &ldquo;technical&rdquo; was a mistake.  However, we will get over that.  It is pleasant to be in agreement with Senator Sir John Keane, and I must say that I agree with a great deal of what he said in answer to the case made by Senator Connolly.  So far as actual practice is concerned, I should say that in the great bulk of the cases in the 14 to 16 period very rarely will the 90 hours be exceeded I do not think it will ever be exceeded for manual instruction.  However, I am rather slow to advise the Seanad to tie the hands of the committee in this particular matter.  It is a matter for the Seanad, but I suggest a little more latitude should be given as regards the hours.  I am not favourable to a fifty-fifty division in this particular matter.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Senator would not object to 110 and 70 hours, or something like that?  It is for the Seanad to say whether they accept the principle or not.  In addition to the difficulties mentioned by Senator Johnson in connection with <Col N="2051" /> the amendment, and the objection by Senator Sir John Keane, there is the further objection that as regards compulsory technical instruction it will not be enforced anywhere unless we have the consent of the particular trades concerned.  That is inherent; it is portion of the Bill. The number of hours is fixed within certain limits after consultation with the committees. There is no explicit reference to consultation on courses, but undoubtedly there must be consultation, and there must be consultation with regard to the type of instruction with the trades, with the employees and the employers so far as the actual amount of instruction is concerned.  I wonder are we tying them down too rigidly in this way and whether we would get the good will of employers and employees in regard to compulsory powers so far as technical education is concerned. As to this amendment, if the Seanad wishes to accept the principle.  I do not care to advise them one way or another.  I do not see many cases in which there would be more than 90 hours devoted to manual instruction. If in any place there is a class of person who would be satisfied with an alternative course it would be rather hard that he should be prevented from taking it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised to hear Senator Sir John Keane's remarks, because this proposal of mine was deliberately aimed at eliminating the rigidity that undoubtedly I know does exist in technical classes throughout the country, and, particularly where these are formed as trade classes dealing with an industry in a particular area, where the tendency is to devote their time entirely to some type of work that has been going on in the factory. It seems to me that if we allowed, at least, half the time that is compulsorily laid down, we should have another half which would be available in a flexible way to be devoted to any subject that the responsible people or the students there might wish to have taught.  I am satisfied <Col N="2052" /> that when the employers are considering a matter like this they will only think in terms of the manufacturing industry in that particular area and they will not think in terms of allowing any development in the way of ordinary education, not to speak of cultural education.  I said development.  But the students will be attending the classes and so far from being rigid it does supply a flexible method of allowing the different types of ordinary education and cultural education which will not be applied in many areas in this country.  That, at all events, is my point of view.  The Minister apparently agrees with Senator Sir John Keane in that.  I want to stress the point that my information is, that it will work out very differently there. I have the feeling that committees throughout this country will want to be watched, especially for the reason that the tendency towards cultural things is not highly developed.  In view of this statement by the Minister that he thinks it would be better to leave the committees for a period to carry on, and in view of the attitude generally of the Seanad, I do not think it advisable to go on.</P>

      <P>I should like to mention to the Seanad an experience of my own when I was working on a committee in London. We were catering for girls who took up vocational trades to pursue their vocation under more sanitary conditions. There was one very intelligent girl of seventeen whom we apprenticed to the waistcoat trade. At first she said she enjoyed the work very much, but one day she electrified us by telling us she wanted to give up the whole thing. We summoned her before the committee and asked her why she wanted to give it up when we knew she liked the work so much at first.  She said it was quite true that she liked the work at the start but what she could net understand was the cultural education.  &ldquo;They teach me over again the things that I have learned at school and which I had long ago forgotten,&rdquo; she said.</P>

      <P>I should like further information about this.  I have a recollection of being on a technical committee going back to the days when it used to be said that the Irish were hewers of wood and drawers of water, and we wished to provide them with other means of livelihood, for instance, officers of the mercantile marine.  We engaged a captain of a vessel, who used to go to Cardiff, to teach them to box the compass.  A committee might get a local man, such as a carpenter or a slater or mason, to teach a trade. How are you going to bring the <Col N="2057" /> heavy machinery of the Minister to fix a salary in such a case?  Surely the local committee is responsible enough to fix the salaries in such cases.  They would, perhaps, like to make it a voluntary arrangement in the case of fixing the salaries of numbers of teachers.</P>

      <P>There is another point in this&mdash;the Minister is only providing 50 per cent. of the salary. The local authorities are providing the other 50 per cent.  To that extent the local authorities have as much right as the Minister to a say as to what the salary is to be.  To allow the Minister to fix it with the consent of the local authority would perhaps be the logical way.  The local authority is paying only half the salary and the Minister has to pay the other half.  Why should the salary be fixed without reference to the local committee?</P>

      <P>I am afraid the amendment would make the administration of the Act very difficult, if it were accepted.  At present there are permissive rates in regard to a number of classes of teachers.  The Bill as it stands goes beyond that as it gives the Minister power, notwithstanding what Senator Wilson said, to make certain rates compulsory and undoubtedly that power will be exercised in relation to a certain very big class such as domestic economy instructresses, instructors in woodwork, etc.  There are, however, a number of other teachers such as those to whom Senator Sir John Keane referred, in regard to whom it would be impracticable and undesirable that the Minister should be compelled to fix scales of salaries.  There may be only one or two of that particular type, for instance, in a Marine School.  As I say for the larger classes undoubtedly scales of salary will be drawn up, but I am not in favour of the amendment which Senator Johnson proposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">

      <P>Of course it is true as the Minister states, and it would answer the objection raised by Senator Keane, that the clause even as <Col N="2058" /> amended, applies to classes of teachers and that it is not beyond the power of the Departmental secretary, say, to draw up a schedule or a scale of salaries which would make provision for exceptional classes such as those to which Senator Sir John Keane referred.  However it is clear enough that the regulations would require to deal with classes of teachers.  Individual cases obviously could not be dealt with as a class.  I draw attention to the fact that in Northern Ireland this proposal is already in operation.  I realise at once that there is a certain difficulty in its administration, but I do not think that this is a difficulty that might not be overcome or that it would impede the working of the Bill.  However, I am not pressing the amendment if the Minister is adamant.</P>

It states: &ldquo;A vocational education committee shall not pay to any teacher employed by it a salary which is not in accordance with the scale prescribed by the said regulations in respect of the class of teachers to which such teacher belongs.&rdquo;  That would make it impossible for any committee to attract specially qualified men or women for a special work and pay them something for their special qualifications.  The words &ldquo;not in accordance with&rdquo; seem to preclude the possibility of any higher salary being paid to a teacher with special qualifications, and the amendment seeks to make a certain salary the minimum.</P>

      <P>New section.  Before Section 112 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>112.  The Minister shall by regulations made under this Act prescribe the minimum rates of travelling and maintenance expenses payable to teachers and officers of vocational education committees who have to travel in the performance of their duties.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that the Minister should make regulations regarding the rates of travelling expenses etc.  There is a scale I understand touching teachers in general who travel outside their own areas for official work, but it is thought desirable that there should be a scale whereby teachers who are doing official work up and down the country should have a minimum scale of rates of travelling expenses, that is, first class fare, second class fare, or so many pence per mile, just as in the case of civil servants and other officials from the Departments. I think that there should be some uniformity at least in the allowances made for travelling and maintenance expenses under these educational schemes.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 112.</P>
      <P>(1) The Minister may make Regulations in relation to the training and certification of teachers for schools and courses provided by a vocational education committee under this Act.</P>
      <P>(2) Where a student accepted by the Minister for training as a teacher enters, in pursuance of regulations made under this section, into an undertaking with the Minister that he will, in consideration of any grant made by the Minister in respect of his maintenance and training, complete the course of training specified in the undertaking and will subsequently follow the profession of teacher in the manner and for the period specified in the undertaking and in the event of failure so to do will repay to the Minister such proportion of the grant made by the Minister as is specified in the undertaking, the undertaking shall be binding on him notwithstanding that he was an infant at the time when the undertaking was given and any sums repayable in accordance with the undertaking shall be recoverable by the Minister as a civil debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>Section 112, sub-section (1).  To delete in line 30 the words &ldquo;by a vocational education committee.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 62 provision is made, for the approving of courses.  That is to say, the Minister may approve of certain courses in schools as complying with the requirements regarding continuation education and technical education.  It is thought that this required training and certification, or rather the quality of the training and certification, is only in case of schools provided by the vocational education committee.  You may have other schools and other <Col N="2062" /> courses supplied by other people which do not qualify for the standard set up by the Minister.  The amendment if it were accepted, would simply mean that the Minister may make regulations in relation to the training and certification of teachers in other schools and courses than those provided under the Act. Some may be approved by the Minister as satisfying the requirements and yet may not be provided by a vocational education committee.  I therefore move to delete these words which limit the powers of the Minister in respect to the training and certification of teachers.</P>

      <P>I have an objection to the principle of this amendment.  It may be that there are a number of unprovided schools, and that attendance at these schools would be a proper method of fulfilling the obligation imposed by the Act between the ages of fourteen and sixteen.  I should take power by this amendment to make internal regulations for a purely private institution of that kind.  I feel that would be wrong in principle, and would create a great deal of trouble.  It raises a very fundamental principle as far as I am concerned. Furthermore, supposing a person satisfies this Act by attending a secondary school, I would have power given by this Act&mdash;purely a vocational Act&mdash;mainly directed, to schools set up for purely vocational purposes&mdash;to upset the whole established system so far as these other schools are concerned.  I quite admit that from some points of view a case has been put forward for the amendment, but the little to be gained in that respect would, to my mind, be entirely counteracted by the very great question of principle that arises.</P>

      <P>116.&mdash;(1) In this section</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;the Dublin Act&rdquo; means the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930 (No. of 1930);</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;the City Corporation&rdquo; means the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of Dublin;</P>

      <P>the expression &ldquo;the City vocational education committee&rdquo; means the vocational education committee for the City vocational educational area;</P>
      <P>the expression &ldquo;the Borough vocational education area&rdquo; means the vocational education area which is coterminous with the Borough of Dun Laoghaire;</P>

      <P>the expression &ldquo;the added rural area&rdquo; has the meaning given to it by Section 1 of the Dublin Act.</P>
      <P>(2) The following provisions shall have effect in relation to the application of this Act in the county borough of Dublin, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) the areas which, at the passing of this Act, are respectively <Col N="2064" /> the urban district of Pembroke and the urban district of Rathmines and Rathgar shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be included in and to form part of the county borough of Dublin as from the passing of this Act;</P>
    <P>(b) the added rural area shall, in accordance with the Dublin Act, become included in and form part of the county borough of Dublin on and from the 1st day of April, 1931;</P>
    <P>(c) in the construction of references in this Act (including this section) to the county borough of Dublin, whether specifically or as included in a reference to county boroughs generally, regard shall be had to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this sub-section and also to the provisions of the Dublin Act whereby the added rural area becomes included in and forms part of the county borough of Dublin on and from the 1st day of April, 1931;</P>
    <P>(d) in the preparation, consideration and approval of the annual scheme for the City vocational education area for the local financial year commencing on the 1st day of April, 1931, regard shall be had to the fact that the added rural area will be included in the county borough of Dublin in that year;</P>
    <P>(e) Section 24 of the Dublin Act shall not apply to any officer of the council of the urban district of Pembroke or of the council of the urban district of Rathmines and Rathgar or of a committee of either of those councils who is transferred by that Act to the service of the City Corporation and is subsequently transferred by this Act to the service of the City vocational education committee and in lieu thereof it is hereby enacted that every such officer shall, while he is in the service of the City Corporation by virtue of his said transfer thereto, perform the <Col N="2065" /> same duties and be entitled to the same salary and emoluments and the same conditions of service as he performed and was entitled to in the service of the said council or committee immediately before his said transfer therefrom;</P>
    <P>(f)  during the period between the day which is the appointed day for the purposes of the Dublin Act and the day which is the appointed day for the purposes of Part VII of this Act, the City Corporation shall itself administer without the intervention of any committee the services which will become transferred on the last-mentioned appointed day to the City vocational education committee by virtue of this Act;</P>
    <P>(g) sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 40 of the Dublin Act shall not apply in relation to the election of the members of the City vocational education committee;</P>
    <P>(h) at the first meeting of the City vocational education committee the Dublin City Manager and Town Clerk shall act as secretary to such committee.</P>
    <P>(3) The following provisions shall have effect in relation to the application of this Act in the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) for the purposes of this Act the Borough of Dun Laoghaire shall be deemed to come into existence on the passing of this Act;</P>
    <P>(b) Section 24 of the Dublin Act shall not apply to any officer of the council of the urban district of Blackrock, the council of the urban district of Dun Laoghaire or the council of the urban district of Dalkey or of any committee of any of those councils who is transferred by that Act to the services of the Borough Corporation and is subsequently transferred by this Act to the service of the borough vocational education committee <Col N="2066" /> and in lieu thereof it is hereby enacted that every such officer shall, while he is in the service of the Borough Corporation by virtue of this said transfer thereto, perform the same duties and be entitled to the same salary and emoluments and the same conditions of service as he performed and was entitled to in the service of the said council or committee immediately before his said transfer therefrom;</P>
    <P>(c) during the period between the day which is the appointed day for the purposes of the Dublin Act and the day which is the appointed day for the purposes of Part VII. of this Act, the Borough Corporation shall itself administer without the intervention of any committee the services in the Borough of Dun Laoghaire (other than the area which is at the passing of this Act the urban district of Killiney and Ballybrack) which will become transferred on the last-mentioned appointed day to the Borough vocational education committee by virtue of this Act.</P>
    <P>(d) Section 48 of the Dublin Act shall not apply in relation to the election of the members of the Borough vocational education committee;</P>
    <P>(e) at the first meeting of the Borough vocational education committee the Dun Laoghaire Borough Manager and Town Clerk shall act as secretary to such committee.</P>
    <P>(4) The following provisions shall have effect in relation to the application of this Act in the county of Dublin, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) Section 20 of the Dublin Act shall not apply in respect of any officer of the council of the county of Dublin or of any joint committee of such council and the council of an urban district who is transferred by this Act to the services of the County vocational education committee;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2067" /> (b) in the construction of references in this Act (including this section) to the county of Dublin whether specifically or as included in a reference to counties generally, regard shall be had to the provisions of the Dublin Act whereby the added rural area is transferred from the county of Dublin to the county borough of Dublin on and from the 1st day of April, 1931;</P>
    <P>(c) in the preparation, consideration and approval of the annual scheme for the County vocational education area for the local financial year commencing on the 1st day of April, 1931, regard shall be had to the fact that the added rural area will not be included in the county of Dublin in that year.</P>
    <P>(5) Sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 18 of the Cork City Management Act, 1929 (No. 1 of 1929) shall not apply in relation to the election of the members of the vocational education committee for the vocational education area which is coterminous with the county borough of Cork.</P>
    <P>I also propose to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>To insert before sub-section (5) of the proposed new section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(5) The City vocational education committee shall have the same powers of granting compensation in respect of loss of employment to such of its employees (other than officers) as were, immediately before the day which is the appointed day for the purposes of Part VII of this Act, employees of the City Corporation as the City Corporation would have had if such employees had remained in its employment, and for that purpose the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) every such employee shall be entitled to reckon his employment by the City Corporation and also his employment (if any) by the council of the urban <Col N="2068" /> district of Pembroke or the council of the urban district of Rathmines and Rathgar as employment by the City vocational education committee, and</P>
    <P>(b) Section 53 of the Act of 1925 shall, in relation to such employees only, apply to the City vocational, education committee as if that committee was a local body, such as is mentioned in that section but with the modification that references in that section to Section 50 of that Act shall be construed as references to the provisions of this Act which are enacted in substitution for the said Section 50.</P>
    <P>This is a fairly long amendment but I think an examination of it will indicate that it is necessary for the working of the scheme in the areas referred to.  Sub-section (1) of the proposed new section is a series of definitions to explain subsequent references. Sub-section (2) deals with the County Borough of Dublin, sub-section (3) with the Borough of Dun-Laoghaire, and sub-section (4) with the County Dublin.  I trust the House will allow me to move after sub-section (4) the new sub-section, (5) which I have referred to.  It purposes to secure pension rights which are possessed at present by certain employees who will be transferred under the Bill.  If that is agreed to the new sub-section (6) will have reference to the county borough of Cork.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) paragraph (a) is necessary in order to have the whole country divided on the passing of this Bill into the vocational education areas in which the Bill will become operative on the appointed day. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of sub-section (2) are in accordance with Section 17 of the Local Government (Dublin) Bill, which defers until 1st April, 1931, the inclusion of the added rural areas in the county borough of Dublin.  Paragraph (d) is consequential upon (b) in that sub-section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2069" /> The meaning of paragraph (e) is that this Bill legislates specifically for the transfer of officers of the technical instruction committees on the appointed day to the new vocational education committees.  The Local Government (Dublin) Bill also legislates specifically for the transfer of officers of the Urban District Councils of Pembroke and Rathmines and Rathgar, and of committees thereof, to the City of Dublin.  The amendment is designed to ensure that the officers of the technical instruction committees of these councils shall be transferred to the County Borough Vocational Education Committee in accordance with the provisions of this Bill. Paragraph (f) is designed to ensure that some authority shall be legally entitled to take control of technical education in the new City of Dublin during the period between the appointed day under the Greater Dublin Bill and the appointed day under this Bill.</P>
    <P>With reference to paragraph (g), as Section 40 of the Local Government (Dublin) Bill does not require members of the City Council to be elected on committees, and Sections 8 and 45 of this Bill require the representation of such councillors on vocational education committees, this amendment is necessary to bring Dublin into line with the rest of the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (h) is also designed to assist in that purpose.  Sub-section (3) deals with the application of the measure to the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, and paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) make provision for the Borough of Dun Laoghaire similar to the provisions made in paragraphs (a), (e) and (f) of sub-section (2) for the County Borough of Dublin. Senators will notice that in paragraph (c) of this sub-section there is special reference to the urban district of Killiney and Ballybrack.  The paragraph reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;during the period between the day which is the appointed day for the purposes of the Dublin Act and the day which is the appointed day for the purposes of Part VII. <Col N="2070" /> of this Act, the Borough Corporation shall itself administer without the intervention of any committee the services in the Borough of Dun Laoghaire (other than the area which is at the passing of this Act the urban district of Killiney and Ballybrack)....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reason for that is that there are no services to be transferred from this urban district.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs (d) and (e) make similar provision for the Borough of Dun Laoghaire as paragraphs (g) and (h) of sub-section (2) make for the County Borough of Dublin.  The reason for sub-section (4) is that Section 20 of the Dublin Act provides for the apportionment of officers and servants whose duties relate wholly or in part to the added rural areas between the County Council and the City Corporation. The application of this provision to the City and County of Dublin is not considered necessary in connection with this Vocational Education Bill, as the duties of the staff of the County Dublin Joint Committee for Technical Instruction are not confined wholly or in part to the added rural areas.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) and (c) of sub-section (4), taken together, are necessary in order to make clear the position that the added rural areas&mdash; areas to be added to the Borough of Dun Laoghaire&mdash;will not be included in the County Borough of Dublin until the 1st April next.  There has been circulated the amendment to be inserted before sub-section (5) of this proposed new section.  The purpose of that amendment is to reserve certain pension rights to certain employees who are to be transferred. I take it that the House will agree to my moving that amendment in that order.</P>
    <P>I now come to sub-section (6), which reads:</P>
    <P>Sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 18 of the Cork City Management Act, 1929 (No. 1 of 1929) shall not apply in relation to the election of the members of the vocational education committee for the vocational education area <Col N="2071" /> which is coterminous with the County Borough of Cork.</P>
    <P>That is similar to paragraph (g) of sub-section (2) in reference to Dublin; that is to say, this sub-section will not require the election of members of the City Council on these vocational education committees. I move the amendment.</P>

Similarly, no special name for the urban districts of Pembroke, Rathmines and Rathgar is required in view of their inclusion in the Borough of Dublin.  It is thought desirable to refer to Drogheda, Sligo and Wexford as boroughs in order to preserve the continuity of the title guaranteed by the Local Government Act.</P>

      <P>In discussing the question yesterday of Tipperary and district and Bray and district the Minister pointed out the difficulty surrounding the proposal being made but he intimated that he was prepared to agree if the Seanad was of that intention or desire that the present urban district of Bray might be scheduled as an urban district for the purposes of this Act.  The effect would be that the present technical education activities being carried on very successfully in Bray, but at present covering a wider area than Bray Urban District, might be continued in so far as Bray itself is concerned. The local technical committee desires that that should be accepted and there is a very strong argument for some such provision. As the Minister has indicated his willingness to agree to this proposal with such consequential amendments as may be necessary in the other parts of the Bill I do not think it is necessary to enlarge on the case in favour of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no such committee if this is accepted in existence in North Wicklow, because that is practically Bray, with a very small rural addition. So far as Tipperary is concerned, I indicated yesterday that I would be quite agreeable if Senator Hooper would move a general amendment on report giving the Minister power to require a vocational education committee to appoint a sub-committee for a certain district.  That will not meet the Tipperary case at all to the extent that the Bray case is met.  That is not due to any unwillingness on my part; it is inherent in the difficulties of the situation owing to the fact that the rural district in Bray counts for very little as far as the present scheme is concerned.  I think there are more people in the rural district than in the town of Tipperary.  It is not possible to solve the Tipperary question on the same lines, though I indicated to Senator Hooper yesterday that I was prepared to accept a general amendment.  The Minister may then require the Tipperary Education Committee to set up a specific sub-committee for rural and urban Tipperary.</P>

      <P>I beg to move &ldquo;that the Report of the Committee on Procedure relative to Standing Orders be now considered.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.  At the meeting of the Seanad held on the 19th June, 1930, certain of the proposed new Standing. Orders contained in the Schedule to the Committee's Report dated 21st May, 1930, were referred back to the Committee for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>2.  The Standing Orders so referred back are Nos. 3, 30, 34, 44, 51, 57, 69, 89 and 104.</P>
      <P>3.  The Committee reconsidered those Standing Orders at its meeting on 26th June, 1930, and decided to recommend no change in Standing Orders 3 and 34.  In regard to the remainder, they recommend the amendments set out in the Schedule hereto.&mdash;T. Westropp Bennett, Chairman of the Committee.</P>

      <P>The Report has been circulated.  Various suggestions were made and amendments were made by the Committee in the manner suggested by the House.  I would be glad if the House would agree to the Standing Orders as now suggested.  I think substantially they embody all that was suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 1: &ldquo;S.O. 30.  To add at the end of the Standing Order the words &ldquo;authorised by him; provided that such authorisation shall not be necessary in Committee.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 2: S.O. 44. &ldquo;To add at the end of the Standing Order a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) When a question has been decided in accordance with this Standing Order any further <Col N="2076" /> motion may at once be moved which is requisite to bring to a decision any question already proposed from the Chair and, subject to the discretion of the Cathaoirleach as provided in this Standing Order, such motion shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little doubtful as to the effect of this amendment. A motion is proposed from the Chair that a certain section be accepted.  An amendment is put forward and is discussed.  It is thought desirable that there should be a closure motion in respect of that amendment.  Am I to understand that before the first motion&mdash;that the section be embodied in the Bill&mdash;is brought to a decision another motion of closure shall be moved and carried without discussion, or is it to be automatic, that once the original closure motion has been passed, the main question is to be discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was discussed at the Committee.  A great deal will have to be left to the common sense and discretion of the Chair.  But I think there was one very clear idea in the minds of the Committee and that idea, they believe, is embodied in the Standing Order.  I think the Committee were unanimously of opinion that if there was an amendment to a section and that amendment were closured and if there were a further amendment to that section which did not deal with the same subject matter as the amendment which was closured, it would not be automatically closured but would be discussed.  If, on the other hand, you had an amendment to delete the section&mdash;as we frequently have here&mdash;and it was closured, the Chairman would say that that was similar to the putting of the section and he would proceed to put the question, on the ground that it was necessary to bring the matter to a conclusion.  I give you <Col N="2077" /> those two cases as illustrating what was in the minds of the Committee. I think I am correct in saying that the Committee were influenced a good deal not only in respect of this Standing Order, but in respect of others by the desire to have uniformity with the other House. Where there was no clear case of difference in the case of the Seanad, the Committee aimed at uniformity with the Standing Orders of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Supposing there are a number of amendments to the same section which are more or less of the same character, like the two amendments we had yesterday, where Senator The McGillycuddy sought to make provision for a per caput allowance and where I, in a subsequent amendment, sought to make provision for the State to provide the difference between the rate collected in the county and the total cost of the particular kind of education under discussion.  Those would be two amendments of more or less the same character.  Suppose one of these amendments was closured, would it be in the power of the Chair to say that the amendment which was closured was the same in substance as the succeeding amendments and thereby subject to the rule of closure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFarren" hpid="Mr. Farren Mr. Farren">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farren</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment will be to leave the position the same as it is at the moment. If an amendment is put and defeated and there are other amendments <Col N="2078" /> consequential on that and similar to it they are ruled out under our present Standing Orders.  This amendment will not affect the position in the least.  It will leave it exactly as it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment really maintains the practice which has obtained up to the present, and which the new Standing Orders proposed to alter.  The Committee has gone back very largely to the suggestion of Senator Colonel Moore. The question was raised by him at the last meeting of the Seanad.  The position is: if an amendment has been rejected in Committee, after full debate, and if the Chairman is satisfied that it has been properly debated in a full House, it cannot be raised again on Report.  If, on the other hand, the Chairman is of opinion that it was not properly debated, or that sufficient time was not given to it, he can permit it to be raised again on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;S.O. 104.  To delete the Standing Order, and to substitute therefor a new Standing Order as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;104.  When in the case of a Bill which has been received from the Dáil and amended in the Seanad a Message has been received from the Dáil disagreeing with or amending all or any of the amendments inserted in the Bill by the Seanad, such Message shall be placed on the Order Paper next thereafter prepared.  Each such amendment shall be considered, and any Senator may move without notice &lsquo;That the Seanad do insist on the amendment&rsquo; (with or without further amendment), or <Col N="2080" />&lsquo;That the Seanad do not insist on the amendment&rsquo; or &lsquo;That the Seanad do agree to the amendment made by the Dáil to the Seanad amendment.&rsquo;  When all such amendments have been considered, the Clerk shall return the Bill to the Clerk of the Dáil, together with a Message certifying the determination of the Seanad accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
