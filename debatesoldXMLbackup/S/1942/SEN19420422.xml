      <P>In page 4, in Section 8, sub-section (1) to delete all words from and including the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 41 to and including the word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; in line 44, and substitute instead the words &ldquo;it shall be lawful for the Minister to&rdquo;; and in line 46 to delete the words &ldquo;such referendum&rdquo; and substitute instead the words &ldquo;the referendum on such proposal&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The amendments on the Order Paper are all to be taken together, and of them the amendment now under discussion is the principal one, Nos. 2, 3 and 4 being consequential on it.  This amendment is intended to meet points which were raised in Committee on Section 8 of the Bill.  It will be within the recollection of the House that, in the discussion on that section, it was suggested that the portion of it which referred to a determination to be made by the Government that a proposal for an amendment of the Constitution should be submitted to a referendum by the people appeared to give to the Government power not given by the Constitution.  The amendment now submitted proposes to delete from Sections 8 and 9 all reference to a determination by the Government.  It is, therefore, I presume, not necessary to discuss further the constitutional points which were raised here, because the main purpose of the Bill is to enact the law necessary for the regulation of a referendum, in so far as the law has <Col N="982" /> not already been prescribed, or has not already been inscribed in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The present Bill, among other things, provides and must provide&mdash;if the taking of the referendum is to be regulated&mdash;for the appointment of dates for the various stages of the procedure, and in the Bill, the Minister for Local Government is taken as the appropriate Minister to appoint these dates.  The Minister for Local Government is, as the House is already aware, charged with various duties under the existing electoral law, under Article 12 of the Constitution, and the Presidential Election Act of 1937, therefore, the proposal in the Bill is consistent with the powers, duties and responsibilities which the Minister already has.  I think the amendments which we are now proposing will meet, as I said, the constitutional points which were raised in the discussion on the Bill and that the House may accept them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has conceded the points several of us made here on previous stages of the Bill, and that he has, apparently, agreed that the section of the Bill as it stood, did run counter to the provision of the Constitution. The only thing that troubles me now about it is the phrase: &ldquo;It shall be lawful for the Minister....&rdquo; That seems to imply, even yet, that some liberty is being left to the Minister to decide himself whether or not a referendum shall be held, and if the Minister has such liberty, then, presumably, under the principle of collective responsibility, the Government has the liberty all the time, and we are back to where we were at the beginning.  I am not clear whether the phrase as it stands in the amendment gives that liberty to the Minister, or whether he can proceed to postpone a referendum on a constitutional question though the Constitution itself makes it mandatory that the referendum shall be held in the appropriate time after the passing of the Bill.  That is the only question I am still in doubt about, but, if the Minister has had the question examined, and if he has agreed that the constitutional <Col N="983" /> points made here on previous stages were valid, I take it that he has satisfied himself that the Bill, as amended, will not leave such power in the hands of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister has not gone quite as far as Senator Tierney thinks, although there is no doubt that he has made substantial changes, because, in the section as originally drafted, the Government had power to determine whether or not a referendum should be taken.  He has deleted that, and substituted a clause saying that it shall be lawful for the Minister to appoint by Order the day upon which the polling for the referendum shall take place.  I entirely agree that the Minister should have power to fix the day.  It is quite clear that there must be power in some Minister to fix a day and do all appropriate things for the taking of a referendum.  It is also quite clear that the Constitution, with which I do not agree, does appear to prescribe on the face of it that a referendum must be taken.  The Minister has been convinced by the arguments, and his law advisers, having taken second thoughts, have decided that they could not put into this Bill a statement that the Government shall determine whether or not a referendum shall be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you say in the Bill that it shall be lawful for the Minister to appoint a day, there is no machinery for compelling the Minister to appoint a day, and I am prepared to make the Minister a present of that.  I do not know how you could put it.  We had a rather similar case about the Initiative in Article 47 of the other Constitution. That Article contained the provision that the Oireachtas shall do certain things, but when I was confronted with the problem of dealing with the Petition, it seemed to me that there was no machinery for compelling Parliament to take action, and I doubt very much whether there is any machinery for compelling a Minister who has made up his mind that he does not want a particular referendum, or whether any machinery could be devised which would work satisfactorily <Col N="984" /> to compel him to appoint a day.  Perhaps the difficulty is not in the Minster, but in the nature of the problem itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Minister will explain why he did not appoint a day.  It does not seem to me that when you say that it shall be lawful to do a certain thing that it necessarily means it shall be lawful not to do it.  Perhaps the Minister can explain that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It does seem to me that the Minister could argue that the Constitution is part of the ordinary positive law.  Section 2 of Article 46 of the Constitution provides that when an Act is passed or is deemed to have been passed, it shall be submitted to a referendum &ldquo;in accordance with the law for the time being in force relating to the referendum&rdquo;.  Therefore, it seems to me that if the Minister allows undue time to go by, it would be open to a citizen to take action in the courts calling on the courts to order a Minister to do so.  In other words, I do not see what machinery you have to force a Minister to do something he does not want to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This question is not at all without difficulties.  I suppose I may begin by saying that my first construction of Article 46 (2) was that it was mandatory upon some unnamed person to take a referendum upon a proposal to amend the Constitution, once that proposal had been passed in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the course of the discussion with the law officers and the Parliamentary draftsman, a very cogent case was put up to show it was not mandatory, and the Bill as finally drafted was on the assumption that it was not mandatory. Having listened to the discussion here, I again sought advice, and the position I am in is this: I think that Article 46 is to some extent incomplete. It should have prescribed some time limit within which a proposal to amend the Constitution must be disposed of one way or the other, either by rejection by both Houses, or having been passed by both Houses, approved of or rejected at a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> At present there does not seem to rest in any organ of the State the power of final determination in regard to proposals which have not been submitted to the people.  In order that that power of determination might be written into the Constitution, it would be necessary to amend the Constitution and to take a referendum on the amendment.  The only thing we can do now is to enact machinery which will not be repugnant to any provision of the Constitution, and that is what we are doing here in the form in which the amendment is submitted to the House. That will, at least, set up machinery for taking a referendum.  Undoubtedly, it does not make it compulsory on the Minister or the Government to take a referendum, but I suggest in that connection that we must wait on events, and if a proposal to amend the Constitution should at any time be passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses, and if there is any undue delay in taking the referendum on it, then I think the proper remedy is as suggested by Senator Fitzgerald, that is, that the courts ought to be approached and asked to determine whether Section 2 of Article 46 is, in fact, mandatory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be.  In the meantime, there is no way out of the dilemma except to provide machinery for taking a referendum under the Constitution as it stands at present. It may be that this problem will be solved by convention, that if a series of proposals to amend the Constitution emerge and are of sufficient importance to warrant a referenda being taken, a referendum will be duly taken upon each of them and that, after referenda have been taken upon a number of proposals, it will become a constitutional convention that once such proposals have passed both Houses they must, inevitably, be submitted to the people.  The amendments before the House are, therefore, I think, the best way out of the present difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidRobinson" hpid="Mr. Robinson Mr. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped, on Report Stage, to have proposed an amendment dealing with postal voting, but that amendment was not acceptable. In fact, it was pointed out to me that it was so drastic that it, probably, could not have been accepted on any other Stage and that I should have had to try to have the Bill negatived on the Second Reading, which I had no wish to do.  I do not think that the amendment was so drastic as was pointed out because my suggestion would have been that postal voting should be used only on those occasions when a vote was not taken at a general election and, if subsequent Governments adopted the view expressed by <Col N="987" /> the Minister on Second Reading, that, inevitably, amendments of the Constitution must be a matter for Party politics, the probability is that the occasions on which postal voting would be used would be very few and far between.</P>
      <P>I did not care to propose the amendment without consulting my colleagues and other Senators.  I live in a very isolated district and travel daily becomes more precarious and, in the late winter, is more of an alarm than an excursion.  So I lost whatever chance I had.  It was suggested to me, quite unofficially, that the probability was that the Department would regard the whole scheme as entirely impracticable. I do not think that a people who have mastered the mathematical mysteries of proportional representation would have any greater difficulty in marking their card in the bosom of their family than in a polling booth.  Notwithstanding precedents, I do not think that anyone would have the temerity to suggest that the Department would fail to devise an excellent scheme.  Therefore, &ldquo;totally impracticable&rdquo; has a more sinister meaning, presumably.  I do think that, unless the question of prestige or patronage or personality of the candidate was involved, there would be little likelihood of corruption.  As we advance in government, the tendency is to become more conservative, but I think it would be a pity if we adopted as our slogan the good, old conservative motto: &ldquo;Never do anything for the first time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been a good thing if, in this House, which has so often been accused of being reactionary, we could have discussed, on this Bill, a matter which, if not new, would have been a novelty in this country.  If we had adopted postal voting, even to a limited degree, and had got over our troubles, we would not now, possibly, have so many vacancies in the Dáil and we would not be living in dread of a general election.  It seems to me that the time to make experiments and try expedients is a time of emergency. We see the Dáil disintegrating, more or less, from week to week, without any effort being made to cope <Col N="988" /> with that situation, and I really think the Government ought to consider whether it would not be feasible to fill vacancies in the Dáil by postal voting and take a chance on the question of trying to use corruption in elections. I do not believe that anything of that kind would take place.  At any rate, it would take place only to a very limited degree.</P>

    <Title>Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Bill, 1939&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to establish a system of insuring workers in the building trade against loss of employment due to inclement weather.  The problem of loss of employment, due to inclement weather, has exercised the minds of people interested in the building trade for a considerable time and, in other countries, individual employers and groups of employers have attempted to devise ways and means of minimising the effect upon workers in the industry. In this country, we have decided to endeavour to deal with that problem by way of a national insurance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The origin of this attempt is to be found in the building strike which took place in 1937 and which lasted for a long time, as Senators will remember. One of the demands made by the workers' side in that dispute was for payment in respect of time lost due to bad weather.  That demand was resisted by the employers and, during the course of the negotiations which led to the settlement of the dispute, the proposal emerged that a scheme of insurance should be devised along the lines of the State insurance scheme against unemployment for the purpose of creating a fund, from contributions to be paid by workers and employers, from which benefits would be payable to workers during loss of employment <Col N="989" /> due to bad weather.  This Bill was prepared in consultation with the representatives of the associations of employers and the associations of workers connected with the building industry.  It is very largely their Bill. It took a long time to prepare and to get the statistical information upon which the provisions of the Bill could be based but, eventually, an agreed measure resulted from these discussions.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as some Senators may remember, was introduced in the Dáil in July, 1939, but during the period of the adjournment of the Dáil the present war began and, owing to the circumstances then existing, the Second Reading of the Bill was not proceeded with.  Some time ago I again called into consultation the representatives of the organisations which had been responsible for framing the Bill and discussed with them the desirability of proceeding with the measure.  They were of opinion that the measure should be proceeded with and, consequently, the Second Reading of the Bill was taken in the Dáil and the Bill passed by that House with some minor amendments.  It is not usual, I think, to have a Bill of this kind which can be presented to the Oireachtas as an agreed measure.  This is in every sense an agreed measure.  As I have already stated, it is very largely the product of the industry itself, of both parties involved in the industry, and the State came in only for the purpose of ensuring that the administrative scheme of the Bill would be workable.  In fact, we decided to model the Bill upon the Unemployment Insurance Acts and to use for the purpose of this insurance scheme the machinery already in existence for the purpose of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that a fund will be established.  Into that fund will be paid contributions in respect of each worker employed in the building industry for each week in which he is so employed. The contributions will be paid equally by employers and by workers. The State does not propose to make a contribution to this intermittent unemployment fund in the same way as it makes contribution to the Unemployment <Col N="990" /> Insurance Fund.  Instead, it is proposed that the entire amount of the fund will be available for the payment of benefits and that the State will undertake the cost of administering the scheme.  It is estimated that the cost of administering the scheme will be about £10,000 per year.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a worker who loses his employment solely because of the fact that it is not possible to carry it on owing to weather conditions&mdash; rain, snow, frost or other inclement weather conditions&mdash;which make outdoor work impracticable, will receive benefits at the rates set out in the Schedule of the Bill from his employer. His employer will be entitled to recover the amount so paid from the fund.  Apart from that variation, the general scheme of the Bill is in all respects similar to the scheme in the Unemployment Insurance Acts.</P>
    <P>It is recognised, of course, that difficulty will be experienced, at any rate, during the period in which the scheme is being brought into operation, in defining precisely workers in the building trade.  It is obvious that the building trade covers a variety of subsidiary industries and there will be many border-line cases in which it will be a matter of some difficulty to say whether the individual worker should or should not be within the scheme.  It is proposed that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have power to decide questions of demarcation, subject to an appeal to the High Court or, alternatively, that he may submit the question for decision to the High Court.  I expect that in the course of time there will be a number of decisions made which will gradually clarify the whole position and ensure that there will be amongst those interested a clear understanding of the classes of workers that are entitled to insure under this measure and entitled to receive benefit under this measure and those who are not.  I think, in fact, that the provisions of the Bill dealing with that most difficult problem of demarcation are as effective as they can be made.  No doubt. some Senators have received representations on behalf of individual sections of workers affected by the circumstances of the building industry but <Col N="991" /> who are not as liable to lose employment during inclement weather as other workers are.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, desirable that a scheme of this kind should be spread over as many classes of workers as possible.  Clearly, the larger the number of workers that are within the scheme the sounder it will be.  While it is true that some classes of building trade workers are more liable to be affected by inclement weather and, consequently, will benefit more by the Bill than others, it is proposed that all workers should pay the contributions. The justification for that is, of course, that all workers are affected in equal degree by the prosperity of the industry and affected by anything that may give rise to disputes in the industry and, consequently, stoppages of work.  Every class of worker employed in building was affected by the six months' strike in 1937 and it is in the interests of all of them that anything that tends to promote peace in the industry and to eliminate this most fertile cause of disputes should be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I am in the position of bringing the Bill to the House with the information that the representatives of all classes of workers affected in the building industry and of all classes of employers engaged in that industry have agreed to the measure, and I think that agreement should weigh considerably in the minds of members of the Oireachtas in considering any representations that might be made by small interests against the provisions of the measure.  It is proposed, of course, that workers who are in permanent employment, who are paid their full week's wages irrespective of the possibility that they may not be able to work, due to bad weather, can be exempted from the provisions of the Bill by a certificate from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, just as workers similarly circumstanced can at present be and are exempted from the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.</P>
    <P>One other provision of the Bill I should mention and that is the section which gives power to extend this <Col N="992" /> scheme of insurance against loss of employment due to inclement weather to other classes of workers.  We propose to limit the scheme for the present to the building trade but, clearly, there are many other classes of workers who are affected by inclement weather and liable to lose employment during inclement weather to the same degree or almost to the same degree as workers in the building trade, and it is contemplated that at some stage this scheme will be extended to include such workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think the task of extending a scheme of this kind to farm labourers or turf workers or persons of that kind would be almost impossible, but there are certain classes of occupations, which are very analogous to those in the building trade, to which the Bill might eventually be extended.  I think, however, we should see how it works in relation to the building trade before considering any such extension, and if we find that it does work well, that the financial basis of it is sound, then we can consider such extension and, possibly, we may be able eventually to get to the stage where many classes of workers now liable to loss of wages and loss of employment during inclement weather can be protected in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say also that the rates of contribution and the rates of benefit proposed in the Schedules to the Bill are necessarily experimental.  We arranged to collect all the information available prior to 1939 as to the actual experience of individual employers on building jobs undertaken by them in the matter of the interruption of work due to inclement weather, and, in the year 1939, we arranged for fairly precise records to be taken.  In respect of the years 1940 and 1941 these records are almost complete.  Unfortunately, however, they are not very conclusive <Col N="993" /> as to what the permanent result of the operations of the Bill will be on the financial side.</P>
    <P>In the year 1940 the fund would have accumulated a surplus; in 1941 it would have realised a deficit.  So that it is obvious the experience of two years is not sufficient to enable a firm conclusion to be arrived at.  It is necessary, therefore, that power be taken to vary the rates of benefit or the rates of contribution, but in practice if any variation has to be made at all, it will necessarily be in the rates of benefit; because contributions will be paid by stamps affixed to cards, and the change in the value of the stamps or the printing of new stamps could not be done very quickly, whereas the rates of benefit can be changed almost at once if the circumstances require it.  If the fund acquires a surplus which looks permanent, the rates will be increased, or alternatively, if it realises a deficit which looks like being permanent, the rates of benefit will be decreased.  I have undertaken that before any such change is made the parties responsible for framing the Bill will be consulted, and given an opportunity of expressing their views.  The responsibility for protecting the solvency of the fund is on the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I think I have outlined the general principles of the Bill in sufficient detail to enable Senators to express their opinion on it.  The details of the Bill deal very largely with the machinery of operation and can be more conveniently discussed in Committee.  I should explain, of course, that any proposal to change the provisions of the Bill in a substantial way would involve me in the obligation to consult with the parties that were responsible for the framing of the Bill before expressing an opinion on that proposal. The committees appointed by the Association of Master Builders and the Federation of Building Trades Unions put a great deal of work into this measure.  They spent a long time elaborating this machinery, endeavouring to perfect it in every part, and should be consulted before any substantial change would be made. <Col N="994" /> I am not referring to drafting points or proposals which might make the working of the machine more efficient than it might otherwise be.</P>
    <P>It is only necessary to remember that the provisions of the Bill are framed so closely on the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Acts, and there is so much experience available in relation to the operation of these Acts, that it is unlikely that any modification of that machinery could be proposed which would show a substantial improvement.  The Unemployment Insurance Acts have been amended on a number of occasions, and they now represent a code of laws working efficiently. It is intended that the intermittent unemployment fund will be administered by the same officers as the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  It is obvious that the points of similarity between the two codes should be maintained.  The local officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce, the courts of referees, and the umpire established under the Unemployment Insurance Act, will act in a similar manner, and for similar purposes, under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in recommending this Bill to the House.  I think it will effect a considerable improvement in the conditions of employment in the building trade after the war.  At the moment conditions are depressed and they are likely to remain depressed so long as the war lasts.  That is not altogether a disadvantage from the point of view of the officers responsible for bringing this Bill into operation; because they should be able to have the whole system working smoothly when normal conditions are restored and employment in the trade begins to rise again, which I hope will not be long.  But our hopes do not matter in that case.  The State's part in this scheme is to ensure that it is administered efficiently, to pay the cost of administration, and protect the solvency of the fund established under the Bill.  At some later stage, whoever constitutes the Government then, will have to consider in the light of experience, whether the principle should be extended to other classes of workers.</P>

      <P>This Bill is in the nature of an agreed measure between the trades unions and the employers' associations in the building industry, and more particularly in the Dublin building industry.  I do not think there is very much one could say on it except to congratulate the Minister on introducing this very necessary and praiseworthy piece of legislation.  As the Minister said, it will effect a considerable improvement in the conditions under which building trade workers operate, more particularly in this city.  The fact that building trade workers could be laid off without notice or compensation has been a long-standing grievance among workers engaged in that industry. The Minister referred to the possibility of an extension of this scheme to other classes of workers, and I hope he will lose no time in extending it. As the Minister has indicated, there have been some complaints in regard to the scheme.  Some particular classes of workers object to being brought within the ambit of the scheme.  I think the electrical trade workers assert that they are not employed in the building trade industry at all&mdash;that electrical work is done by way of special contract between the person employed and the union itself. They feel a sense of grievance because they have not been consulted in regard to this Bill, and they took no action in the conferences dealing with it, because they did not imagine that they would be brought within the ambit of the Bill.  Efforts that were made in the Dáil to have their exclusion effected, by way of amendment by Deputy Keyes, were not successful, but even if it were accepted, I think the Minister would have power to include them in the Bill under Clause 15. However, I do not think that the electricians have any real grievance, and I just mentioned it because they did object.  It is an admirable piece of legislation, and I hope that the Minister will carry out his promise to have it applied to other classes of workers.</P>

      <P>Substantially, I agree with what has been said by Senator Campbell, and I should like to congratulate the Minister on the fact of <Col N="996" /> introducing legislation which has been achieved in the manner in which legislation of this kind ought to be achieved.  It is a good thing that it is possible to introduce legislation of this kind and have it admitted all round that it is substantially an agreed measure.  There is only one thing in the Bill which causes me a certain amount of misgiving, and that is the power to extend it by simple order to any other trade whatsoever.  I can quite see, if it were confined to trades analogous to the building trade, that probably the same conditions as will operate under this Bill would be applicable; but it seems to me that as far as any other trade is concerned, it would be much more desirable that a similar procedure should be adopted, and to my mind the Minister should not have power to extend it to other trades until he is in a position to state whether or not he has consulted representatives of employers and employed in connection with particular trades.  I gathered from the Minister's speech that if he is the Minister concerned, it would be his intention so to consult, but already we have had the case of certain workers who think they have a grievance because they were not consulted.  It is quite likely that if they had been, their sense of grievance would not have been so strong, as they would have a better opportunity of realising the position.  I do not at all disagree with what Senator Campbell has said in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will, however, observe from the Bill that the Minister has power to extend its provisions to any other trade and that that can be done by a simple order laid on the Table of the House.  I quite see that, as far as most of the orders are concerned, it is quite sufficient to provide that they should be laid on the Table of the House with the power of annulment by motion, but I think that if this Bill is extended to any other trade, it should be done by specific resolution so that the matter will come before the Oireachtas for discussion.  If there is any strong feeling against it, an opportunity will then be provided of ventilating that feeling without placing the onus on an individual member of <Col N="997" /> either House to move that the Order should be rejected.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will appreciate that there is quite a distinction between the two modes of procedure. For instance, for my part I have no objection to placing before this House grievances which are put to me on behalf of industries without necessarily sponsoring or accepting full responsibility for them myself.  I put them forward for what they are worth, so that the Minister concerned may become aware of them.  I would at the same time hesitate a good deal before I would put down a motion which would have the effect actually of rescinding an order.  Therefore I should like to see the Bill amended to provide that if power is to be given to extend to other trades, that power can only be operated by means of a resolution passed by both Houses.  As far as I can see, that is the one part of the Bill which could hardly be said to be an agreed provision, because the workers and the employers in the building trade have no right to agree that it should be extended to another trade.  Generally, I am in favour of the Bill, and the power to which I refer is the only feature of it that causes me any misgiving.</P>

      <P>As this is an agreed Bill, which has met with the approval of all interested parties, I have very little to say in regard to it.  The only anomaly that presents itself in the Bill is concerned with compensation for loss of time.  There is no provision made for a married man with a dependent family more than for a single man. The single man apparently is entitled to the same compensation as the married man with a family.  I am sure that has been considered by those who drafted the Bill, and I only mention it now in the hope that the Minister might again consider that aspect before amendments are put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague. Senator Campbell, I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of the measure.  I have not very much to say in regard to it at this stage.  The Bill is an agreed measure, as far as both sides of the industry are concerned, <Col N="998" /> and it is desirable that when both parties come together, in the manner in which they have come together on this measure, the State should intervene and lend its aid wherever it possibly can.  Workers generally are subject to many handicaps and difficulties, and it is not competent for them in many cases to provide for themselves. Consequently, the decision of the State to intervene and help them out is to be welcomed.  The extension of the principle to other industries as experience may show, may not best be done by order because of the very great variation one finds between one industry and another.  I doubt whether it will be possible to apply <i>in extenso</i> the principle and the structure of a Bill to other trades.  However, that is a matter that can be ascertained in the future administration of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to border-line difficulties of demarcation.  He will probably find that somewhat of a hedgehog, but the manner in which he proposes to meet these difficulties will probably prove suitable.  The matter is to be referred to the Minister for decision in the first instance and, if the parties are dissatisfied, they can have recourse to the High Court.  As the Minister says, in the course of time a body of case law will be set up which will adjudicate many of the cases that may arise.  As the Bill is an agreed measure, there is little that can be said on it at this stage.  We welcome the principle embodied in it and congratulate the Government on what they have done.  We hope that this social activity of the Government will extend to other industries where the circumstances of such industries warrant the application of similar legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the various points in the order in which they were raised.  Reference was made to the position of electricians under the Bill.  The complaint that may have been advanced by the electricians' trade union that they were not consulted in reference to the Bill is one with which I have difficulty in dealing. All classes of trades concerned with the building industry were affected by <Col N="999" /> the trade dispute out of which this Bill emerged and, following that dispute, bodies of people came together who were stated to be, and claimed to be, representative of all the interests concerned.  Now these bodies, of course, did not include representatives of all the interests concerned. There is a very large number of trades in the building industry and representatives of all the employers and the workers were not on the committee which prepared the Bill, but I was entitled to assume that any comsultations which were necessary within the respective groups had taken place and that the people who came as representatives could speak for all.  In the case of the electricians, however, their main objection to the Bill has been largely met by the amendment which was introduced in Committee in the Dáil and which provides that contributions are only payable on behalf of a worker if he is employed in connection with building for the greater part of the week.  I think the electricians' main fear was that one of their members sent to do a job of work lasting an hour or two in the wiring of a house that was being built might have to pay a contribution for the whole week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that such contributions will not now be paid has lessened the objection to the Bill.  There was, of course, an effort made to exempt from the provisions of the Bill workers employed by sub-contractors.  That proposal did not relate merely to electricians.  It related to terrazzo workers, those concerned with the installation of heating equipment, and so on.  I thought it undesirable that we should exempt workers employed by sub-contractors, if workers doing similar work and employed by the main contractors were liable, as the tendency would be to employ the sub-contractors rather than the main contractors.  In any event, all these classes of workers are affected seriously by a stoppage in the industry, and even though it is true that some classes may benefit more from the Bill than others, it is not unreasonable to say that the whole lot should contribute <Col N="1000" /> to this plan to reduce causes of dispute in the industry.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Douglas that any proposal to extend this Bill to classes of workers other than those in the building trade would involve a major decision of policy and could not be lightly embarked upon.  Consultation with interests involved would certainly be necessary, and I think Senator Lynch is right in saying the adoption of such a proposal might involve some modification of the provisions of the Bill itself, in which case new legislation would be necessary.  The section is in there for two purposes&mdash;first to ensure that machinery will be available to deal with any minor difficulty that may arise, where there is no clear line of demarcation between workers employed in building and those employed in some analogous occupation; and secondly, to give an indication that, if it is ultimately decided to extend this scheme of insurance to other classes of workers, it will be based on the one fund, and the one fund will be the source of benefits payable to such workers.</P>
    <P>I have no strong objection to Senator Douglas's suggestion that an Order under Section 15 should be positively approved of by the Oireachtas rather than that the Oireachtas should have power merely to rescind it.  I do not think that is a matter upon which any question of principle arises, and if it is the view of this House that it is desirable to make that change I will not oppose it.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan inquired about the possibility of making benefits available according to the domestic needs of the employee.  That is not intended.  Wages in the building trade are not variable according to the domestic needs of the employee, and what we are going to give is a substitute for wages, though something less, but designed to ensure that he will not get nothing.  As the Senator knows, there is a standard rate of wages for each class of worker, which does not take into account that worker's circumstances, and, consequently, a proposal to pay benefit in lieu of wages does not take into account the worker's circumstances either.  It would complicate the <Col N="1001" /> measure very considerably if we had to keep records of the number of dependents of each worker and his family circumstances which might justify an upward or a downward change in the benefit payable.</P>
    <P>I think these are the main points that were raised in regard to this Bill. If there are some minor points of detail, I think we can discuss them on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the House&mdash;and particularly the Labour Party, who look with suspicion on anything moved by a farmer's representative with regard to agricultural workers&mdash;that this proposal has nothing whatever to do with the lowering or raising of the basic wages of agricultural workers.  I contend that, no matter how high you raise the wages of agricultural workers, even a good deal beyond its present level, the family allowance for the agricultural worker with young children would still be necessary.  The wages paid to a man doing certain work, and which would be considered as a living wage for a single man, would be grossly inadequate for a married man with young children.  If we consider that 34 per cent. of agricultural workers are boarded and lodged by the farmers, we must realise that the cost of living does not affect that principle to any great extent.</P>
      <P>Family allowances were paid in Australia and New Zealand and in many European countries before the war.  Many of us feel that it is a disgrace to our country, with all our boasted Christianity, that something has not been done to remedy this social injustice.  Of course, it is the duty of the Government to devise the means by which family allowances can be paid.  It can be done in many ways, without very great hardship or strain on the general taxpayer, and I am sure farmers would be willing to contribute to create a fund to pay such allowances to their agricultural workers with young children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The simplest and quickest plan would be on the lines of the national health insurance scheme.  The farmer or employer could pay 6d. per week for each agricultural worker he employs, and every worker could pay 6d. a week. <Col N="1003" /> For every 1/- subscribed in this way the Government would add another 6d.  These contributions would create a fund of nearly £500,000 a year, which would give an allowance of 2/- or 2/6 a week for children under 15 years of an agricultural worker.  I cannot say that these figures are absolutely correct, but I tested the plan as applied to my own workmen and found it satisfactory.  I employ 18 permanent agricultural labourers, and only four of these are married, with ten children under 15 years of age.  The contribution, I suggest, would give an allowance for each of these ten children of more than 2/6 per week per child.  I took another survey within a one-mile radius of my own home. In that area there are 30 farmers employing 86 permanent agricultural labourers who have 58 children under 15, and the allowance in this case would work out at about 2/3 per week per child.  There are two families in this area with seven to nine children under 15 years of age, and they would receive between 16/- and 20/- per week allowance.  This survey revealed that it is only the big farmers who employ paid labour.  All the 86 labourers employed in this area were distributed as follows: One farmer had 40 permanent labourers, one farmer 18, one farmer 8, two farmers 3, four farmers 2, six farmers 1, and 15, or 50 per cent. of the farmers in the area, employed no paid labour.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend that to the serious consideration of the Labour Party and others who believe that the dividing up of the land would create an E1 Dorado in this country for agricultural workers.  In 1935, the blackest year of the economic war, there were 573,531 male workers employed on the land, and with all the division of land that has taken place since, and the intense tillage campaign, we had only 530.899 male workers on the land in 1939.  Furthermore, the latest census returns show that the number of children under 15 decreased in the rural areas by 78,000 during the past 15 years, so that it is time some encouragement and hope should be given to workers with young families.  This proposal is made mainly for the <Col N="1004" /> children of agricultural workers, but there is a bigger and more important problem, the preservation of the farming community, a subject which I am not going into now, although the Chair is very lenient in all discussions.  All I will say on that subject is that there are less marriages and more old bachelors and old maids among the farming community than in any class, and it looks as if the best of the race is dying out owing to economic causes. If it takes three generations on the land to produce a good farmer, is it not a pity that something could not be done to preserve this class with its farming instincts and traditions?</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Labour Party not to cloud the issue on this motion.  If the proposal, as I suggest, could be put into operation on the lines of the National Health Insurance, something that is urgent could be done very quickly for the children of agricultural workers in rural areas.  But, I am afraid that the Labour Party, like all politicians without consideration for the agricultural worker, will try to hold up the scheme unless it is applied immediately to town workers.  I think that would be a mistake and I appeal to them to let it go for the agricultural workers and the farming representatives will create no opposition when they try to bring it into force for the towns as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I wish to point out that I am not in entire agreement with the wording of the motion: &ldquo;As a measure of social justice.&rdquo;  Social justice is defined by the Pope in his Encyclicals as a living wage.  I would rather say that it should be in the interests of economic justice, and the case on economic grounds can be very well made for the farm labourer, while a case for social justice can be made in regard to town workers.  In regard to town workers as well as country workers, let it be clearly understood that if the suggestion is put into practice, it will not deprive the head of the family of a living wage, but will rather encourage the growth of the rural population, encourage marriages, and encourage the growth of large families.  Now, it is not a new problem. <Col N="1005" /> This matter of family allowances was originally a war problem.  With the stress of war, and the increase in the prices of materials that were necessary for life, workers were from time to time entitled to bonuses on their wages, but, in some European countries, family allowances were given as a more equitable way of dealing with the problem.  It was an emergency problem, growing as I said from the war, but, so successful did it prove in the countries which adopted it in war-time&mdash;France, Belgium and Holland&mdash; that it was preserved when the war had ceased.  Germany also had a system of family allowances.  In France it was adopted particularly for the encouragement of very large families. It was stated that the poverty line of lowly-paid workers was reached when the third or fourth member of the family brought an additional burden, and every child after that number made a further intrusion on the salary or wage earned by the head of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no quarrel, I think, between trade unionism and this movement, as suggested by the previous speaker.  In some European countries it was opposed by trade unionism in the earlier stages, but as a result of its successful working in those countries, trade unionists became most enthusiastic supporters of family allowances.  It was not, as I say, opposed&mdash;it was rather ignored, it was not dealt with&mdash; the dread on the part of trade unionists being that it would be an excuse for lowering the wages of the head of the family, and that it would be an encouragement to employers to employ bachelors or single persons rather than others, because, in some countries, the family allowances were largely by arrangement with the employers. In fact, legislation was introduced in France to compel certain classes of employers to pay family allowances.  It was dread, then, on the part of trade unionists which caused them to be against the proposal at first.  I do not think that that dread exists in Ireland.  So far as I know, it does not exist, but in this case I speak for a class of workers, the rural tenants and agricultural workers, who are for the most part <Col N="1006" /> an unorganised body and are not catered for by any of the unions.  I fully recognise that there is danger in family allowances for an unorganised body such as these workers.</P>
    <P>Unscrupulous employers might take advantage of the family allowances to keep the wages of the head of the family down.  At this stage of history, where the farmer is in a position to pay, he must recognise that it is to his advantage to pay such a wage as will induce not only the head of the family to remain on the land and become attached to it but also to induce other members of the family to follow suit.  The mother and the children would seem to be a sort of parasitic growth on the wage earner.  The mother and the children have the building of the future of the nation in their hands and it is about time, as has been done in many continental countries and in the Dominions, to consider the mother as an active worker in the nation's economic life and the family as potential workers in the sphere to which they may be called.</P>
    <P>Nobody who values the future of a nation can look with satisfaction and complacency on a condition in which the wife and children are regarded as parasites, dependent oftentimes upon the whims of the wage earner.  Ninety per cent., or more, of wage earners keep good homes and devote their earnings entirely to the upkeep of their families, but we know that there are cases in which that is not so.  We know also that the mother can almost always be depended upon to invest usefully the moneys which come into her hands.  As a matter of fact, it is at present the common practice to hand over earnings to the mother.  The same thing would happen if the moneys were paid directly to the mother on behalf of herself and her children.  She is a hard worker.  The children are spare parts of the nation's human machinery and the preservation, growth and well-being of these spare parts should be in the economic interest of employers and should make appeal to every businessman.  The productivity, the greatness, the prestige and the welfare of a nation depend upon this, and we have given very <Col N="1007" /> little consideration to it up to the present.</P>
    <P>We have established schools and done many things for them in the education sphere, but one thing we have forgotten is their physical condition. Reports of county medical officers of health point to a rather distressing condition of affairs in many parts of our country.  It may be said that the present financial stringency would prevent any large-scale adoption of family allowances.  In the case suggested by the motion, the scale would not be very large.  The allowances would be confined to a comparatively small section of the community. If we were to take in the whole community, we should find that mothers, and children under 14, form more than half that community.  I have seen it stated in Press reports that the Government had this matter under consideration for some years and that inquiries and investigations were being made.  I cannot verify that.  If it is so, I hope they have not allowed the matter to drop, but are pursuing those investigations.  It may be said again that the time is not opportune for such a scheme.  I think that the contrary is the case.  The time is more than opportune.  Family allowances grew up as a war measure and were continued after the war.</P>
    <P>Although we are not actually involved in war, we are suffering the backwash of the war and perhaps our sufferings will be intensified as the war progresses and comes nearer to our shores.  Increases of wages are being given to meet the higher cost of living.  Accompanying these and side by side with them should march family allowances.  I heard a distressing tale to-day about the number of cases of malnutrition amongst youths in the City of Cork.  That equally applies to some of the richest parts of our country.  The absence of milk and butter in some of the richest parts of Ireland is an extraordinary thing to happen in any country which claims to have a well-regulated economic life. Milk and butter are almost unknown to the children in some of the most fertile districts of Ireland.  That is not as it should be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> The savings that would result from a well-planned system of family allowances would soon more than reimburse the money cost.  That is very obvious because, instead of having growing up a puny and weakly race, we would have a strong and virile race and the savings in doctors' fees, hospital costs, home assistance and sickness benefit would soon more than compensate for any expenditure in this respect. Family allowances have not been dropped in New Zealand, Australia or any of the other countries where they have been tried.  They have all adhered to them and they have all found them a benefit.  The scheme is, of course, enthusiastically supported by the mothers.  In drawing up the budget of wages of our people, it is hardly right that the bachelor, with no encumbrance, or the man with only two or three of a family should be on a par with persons with large families. I emphasise that a living wage should be given to the bachelor in the hope that he will abandon his bachelordom.</P>

      <P>The man with a family of from seven to ten should get consideration.  There are many other points to which I should like to refer but Ministers do not appear to take a great deal of interest in the matter. We have none of them present to-day. Perhaps there are very good reasons for that.  I need not go over the ways and means of raising money for this purpose.  We have the machinery already, on lines indicated by another speaker.  We have the machinery of home assistance and home help and it is a matter simply of drawing up the scale of allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be regarded as a public health problem, and a very serious public health problem.  The British Medical Association have investigated it.  Treating it from the viewpoint of a public health problem, the case for family allowances is unanswerable.  It is an insurance against emergency. That insurance is already in practice, even in our own country.  For instance, we have family allowances for <Col N="1009" /> income-tax purposes for the better paid wage earners of the country.  We have unemployment benefit&mdash;an insurance against emergency.  In some countries&mdash;I do not know that we have it here&mdash;there are rent rebates as the family increases.  That is another method of dealing with the family question.  It is also dealt with in the case of soldiers' children.  There is nothing new or revolutionary in the proposal.  It lends itself very well to this form of insurance because the machinery is there and the cost of administering home help would be only a small fraction of the moneys involved. Where it has been in vogue an equalisation fund has been set up, that is, a fund to regulate the amount paid and to prevent any discrimination in regard to the employment of bachelors rather than married men, and this fund, together with the moneys paid in home assistance, amounts to only about 2 per cent. of the wages bill paid by employers, where employers and the State contribute.  The highest it has been in any country was 3½ per cent. of the wages bill.  I would appeal to the Government to consider the question, to make the necessary investigations and to bring a Bill before the Oireachtas for the purpose of putting a scheme of family allowances into force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Put briefly, this motion is a request that we should adopt a policy of subsidising the production of healthy, happy, well-nourished children, and especially in the rural parts of this country.  We have many policies already in force of subsidising various objects which commend themselves to our human sympathy or our economic instinct. We make public provision for the needs of old age pensioners, widows, orphans and, if they care to avail themselves of public institutions, of lunatics and imbeciles.  A cynical observer from another planet, looking casually at our whole scheme of social services, might say: &ldquo;Behold, here is a community which subsidises the production of imbeciles and lunatics but makes no systematic provision for the production of healthy, happy, well-nourished children.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> I am not saying that we should cease these subsidies or these social services, the nature of which is that they are an effort on the part of the community as a whole to come to the rescue of those among us who have fallen by the wayside, because it is an elementary part of our national tradition and our Christian tradition that we should have sympathy with the unfortunates and those who have fallen on evil days, especially in cases where the fault is not theirs.  These are the very type of people who, in the new order now being established in Europe, are automatically knocked on the head, but I hope the day is far distant' when we will consider it part of our duty to knock imbeciles and lunatics on the head rather than support them to the end of their days.</P>
    <P>But I do say that we should supplement that policy by positively subsidising the production of healthy, happy, well-nourished children.  That is necessary for a number of reasons. First of all, for this reason, already mentioned by Senator Counihan, that in the last ten or 15 years the number of children under 15 years of age in rural districts has diminished by some 70,000 souls.  It is true that the number of children under 15 years of age in urban districts has increased by some 40,000, but I think the first fact is of far more significance and importance and far more ominous in its portent for the future than the second is significant and hopeful, for the real life of this nation has always had its roots in the countryside and if the human population in the countryside diminishes, decays, and disappears, that is the end of the Irish nation. This question might be looked at from many points of view.  In the first place, there is the relationship between this motion and the ordinary wage system.  From that point of view, I would say that one of the principal defects of the ordinary wage or salary system, if you like, is that there is no necessary relationship between the wage or the salary that people earn at different stages in their working life and their family circumstances at different stages in their human life. What is more, there can be, from the <Col N="1011" /> purely economic point of view, no systematic co-ordination between those two different things.</P>
    <P>A man's wage or his salary is governed by what his work is worth to his employer and to the community, or what he could command if he chose to change his position and seek better-paid work elsewhere.  Those facts have nothing to do with whether he has one child, five children or ten children, and so there is no possible reconciliation between the working of the somewhat cast-iron wage system and the circumstances of the average human being as he works his way through the course of a normal human life.  It is, I think, true and is true not only among the so-called working class and wage-earning class but also among the working class who call their wages salaries, that in many cases until about the age of 25 a person's salary or wage goes up fairly steeply and, after that age, very very gradually, if at all.  In fact, it probably remains more or less uniform from the age of 25 until the end of his working life.  While the worker is already drawing what will probably be his full annual income and before he has acquired a wife and various dependents of his own, it is true, I think, in most cases that a worker has more income than is enough for his own personal needs and, possibly, more even than is enough for the needs of that worker if he were married and had one child but, as time goes on, as he marries and as he acquires children, then there comes a time, in nearly every walk of life, except the most highly-paid ones, when his human needs bulge and become greater than his salary is likely to be.</P>
    <P>So that, one might put it this way, before a worker has acquired a wife and family responsibilities, he has got the &ldquo;bulge&rdquo; on circumstances, but after he has acquired a wife and family responsibilities, especially if he has three or more children, then for the best part of his working life and all through his middle life, circumstances have got the &ldquo;bulge&rdquo; on that worker, if I may use that American slang term. It is only when, after much effort, sacrifices and privation, his youngest <Col N="1012" /> child has become, in turn, an earning element and able to contribute to the family budget that that worker, finally, and towards the end of his days, begins to experience financial ease again.</P>
    <P>That is roughly the history of the typical working man in many ranks of society who does his elementary social duty of contributing to the production of the people on whom we must depend if the nation's life is to be continued. In other words, he helps to produce the next generation.  In an ordinary business systematic provision is made for depreciation and maintenance of plant and equipment, and this cost is regarded as a cost which must be met by the business before it may set aside anything for net profit.  Human society depends for its functioning on the existence and continuous replacement of the machinery of which that society is composed.  The replacement of that human machinery involves an economic cost, but no systematic provision is made by the community to provide for the economic cost of producing a future generation.  In fact, at any given moment, it is true to say, the whole burden of maintaining and replenishing the nation's future life is borne by some 25 per cent. of the existing working population.  Roughly speaking, at any given moment, three-fourths of the people earning salaries are not, themselves, in a position of having and bringing up and rearing children.</P>
    <P>The wage system, then, has no possible relationship to the human circumstances of the people who are its victims or its beneficiaries, according to the point of view.  It reminds me of a fable of a giant called Procrustes who, according to the old legend, used to frequent the roads in ancient Greece.  This giant had a bed, and it was of a certain size, and he had the pleasant habit when he met a wayfarer, of stretching him on the bed, and if the wayfarer were too short for the bed Procrustes hammered out his limbs until he became an exact fit. On the other hand, if he were too long he knocked off surplus limbs or the head until he became the exact fit.</P>
    <P>The wage system in relation to family responsibilities at different times of life <Col N="1013" /> behaves exactly as Procrustes behaved with reference to his victims.  At the earlier stages of the worker's life, when his income is greater than his family needs, it is comparatively easy to stretch one's tastes and desires to an income that is really superfluous, but it is a painful business when it comes to lopping off actual necessities, as has to occur in many cases in the course of family life when a family begins to grow numerous and the income is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>That is the way in which the wage system works with reference to the human circumstances of the people who are its victims.  If anyone wants to know the case for family allowances I should like to recommend Dr. Eleanor Rathbone's book, priced at 6d., <i>The Case for Family Allowances.</i>  This English lady made the study and advocacy of this case her own, and anything I say from this on will owe a great deal to her inspiration and to the facts that she so admirably sets out.  It appears from this book that even in Great Britain, which we are accustomed to regard as a very wealthy country, and even in times of peace, 25 per cent. of the children under 14 years of age were getting, in the inter-war period, a diet insufficient in every constituent of health (page 35 of her book), and she suggests that the only real remedy for that regrettable state of affairs was universal family allowances for everyone under 14 years. Further, on page 42 she points out&mdash; this is with reference to the contention that the wage should be based on the normal family, a man, his wife and three children&mdash;that the normal family is in fact an abstraction and exists only in about 5 per cent. of the total number of possible cases, and that a wage which is adequate for the normal family in that interpretation would be just right for 5 per cent., more than enough for about 90 per cent., and not by any means enough for the other 5 per cent.  She refers to an investigation by a Mr. Rowntree of the circumstances of children in York.  &ldquo;The results of a recent survey of York by Mr. Rowntree indicate that a wage based on the needs of a family of three dependent children would result in only <Col N="1014" /> 5 per cent. receiving just what is necessary, while 91 per cent. would get more and 3.9 per cent. very much less than enough to cover their basic needs.  But this last group would include at any one time 23 per cent. of children and a much larger percentage for part of their childhood.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In Australia a commission investigated the problem of how to provide a wage system in which the typical family of a man, wife and three children would get enough for human requirements, and they came to the conclusion over 20 years ago that to make such provision in the case of every employed worker would absorb not only the existing amount that was being paid to labour, but also more than the amounts that went to the profit-receiving interests associated with industry.  Further, it was pointed out on page 81 of Dr. Rathbone's book that a wage system which was based on paying enough for a man, his wife and three children in the case of every single worker employed, would actually make provision, in the case of Australia, for 2,100,000 phantom children and 450,000 phantom wives, while still leaving a surplus of children in the larger families quite inadequately provided for.  In other words, a wage system &ldquo;boosted up&rdquo; to correspond to that abstract type of normal family, would have the effect of providing for millions of phantom people and still fail to provide for thousands of real people who would remain in want.  Further, if it were applied in the circumstances of Australia at the time it would so increase costs in all industries that it would ruin all export trades and so inflate internal prices that the basic wage fixed would have to be continually revised to correspond to rising internal prices, and there would be the interminable vicious circle of wages and prices chasing each other upwards.</P>
    <P>Another argument in favour of supplementing the wage system by frankly admitting an obligation on the part of the community to pay family allowances is this.  As many people know, in the case of low wage paid employment, unskilled labour of various kinds, it frequently happens that a man who <Col N="1015" /> is unemployed is able, if he has three or four children, to command a greater rate of unemployment assistance than a single man would get as wage, because unemployment assistance does contain the principle of family allowances. It does supplement what a man receives by an additional allowance for each of his dependent children.  Consequently, it follows that the lower paid unskilled workers find themselves in a serious temptation to remain unemployed and to command the greater remuneration to which the fact of being a father of a large family entitles one from the unemployment fund, rather than go back to low wage paid labour.  On the other hand, if that low wage, however low, were supplemented by a system of family allowances, there would be in every case an incentive to go on working rather than to go on the &ldquo;dole&rdquo;, and the nation as a whole, as well as the self-respect of the individual worker concerned, would profit.  In other words a system of family allowances would prevent that demoralising overlap that now exists between low wages of certain types of labour and the unemployment assistance rates of the same class of labour where the recipients have numerous dependents.</P>
    <P>In general the argument is all in favour of applying a system of family allowances to every family, without distinction of class or economic circumstances, in the State, but in particular, I put this motion down originally with reference to agricultural labourers because I thought that the experiment could very well begin in their case, and also because I was not anxious at that time to suggest any policy which would be directly or seriously burdensome on the national treasury.  There was also the consideration that the agricultural labouring classes were sufficiently numerous, and a sufficiently important body of men to make it worth while to give them the &ldquo;boost&rdquo;, so to speak, that they would get by being the first to profit by a system of this kind.</P>
    <P>When I first thought of this, it was with reference to the question of raising agricultural wages.  I knew that agricultural wages were due for <Col N="1016" /> some increase, and I thought it desirable that that increase should come about in the way that would do the greatest possible human service to the class of people to whom agricultural workers belong, their families as well as themselves.  I did not think that the best way in which that increase ought to come about was by giving a flat-rate increase of 2/- or 3/- all round. There are about 130,000 workers working for wages on the land and about 35,000 of them are married&mdash;a very small proportion.  But there is nothing unusual about that in rural Ireland. I do not know how many children agricultural workers actually have, but according to official statistics there is an average of 1.5 children to every family in the country.  That is to say, to every married parent, widow or widower, there is an average of 1.5 dependent children under 16 years of age.  Taking that average then, for the 35,000 married agricultural workers, there are some 50,000 or 55,000 children of agricultural workers.  Originally, I was going to suggest that employers generally ought to pay an additional 2/6 per week, not to, but in respect of, everyone of their 130,000 workers; that that 2/6 per head per week ought to go into a common fund, and that out of that common fund should be paid an allowance of 5/- a week in respect of every child of every agricultural worker in the country&mdash;preferably paid to the mother on behalf of the family.</P>
    <P>Now, I think if you will look into the figures you will find that an additional payment of 2/6 per worker per week would give enough money to provide 55,000 children with 5/- per week per child.  That would make a terrific difference in the financial circumstances of the homes of those few thousand agricultural workers who have five, six, seven or more dependent children.  The other agricultural workers might have been asked to co-operate in that solution of the problem as a gracious gesture of solidarity.  However, they got instead a flat increase of 3/- per week.  I am not saying that they did not deserve it.</P>
    <P>From a strictly economic point of view, there were very definite reasons why agricultural wages should go up, <Col N="1017" /> but that does leave the problem of what to do now so far as family allowances are concerned.  My suggestion now is that employers, having already had to contribute an extra 3/- per head per week in increased wages, could not well be asked to pay more than an extra 1/- per week towards family allowances; that the workers should sacrifice 1/- of the 3/- they got recently, as a contribution to the family allowances fund, and that the State should pay up the other 6d.  In that way the fund would be built up by a contribution of 1/- per week per head from the employers, 1/- per head per week from the workers, and 6d. per head per week from the State.  The total money thus provided would be enough to provide 5/- per week for the children of those agricultural labourers having children, while the additional burden on the National Exchequer would be, I imagine, not more than a matter of some £200,000.</P>
    <P>I talked this scheme over with various farmers of my acquaintance, especially large farmers who happened to be particularly interested, because they felt the hardship of having to pay all their men more or less the same wage, not being able to take adequate account of the family circumstances of these workers who obviously should get far more than the current wage. I might say they gave the scheme a very enthusiastic support.  As far as I know, the larger farmers would welcome the supplementing of agricultural wages by means of some system of family allowances like this.  But the case for family allowances is not confined to circumstances of agricultural labourers.  I am not sure that we should not, even now, in spite of the national emergency or, rather, because of the national emergency, face up to the problems of making provision for all dependent children as an elementary and essential part of our national social economy.</P>
    <P>The cost of family allowances on the 5/- a week basis in England has been estimated at about £100,000,000, or a figure in that region.  In our own case, I understand the cost of providing 5/- a week for all dependent children under 14 or 16 would come to somewhere <Col N="1018" /> around £6,000,000 or £8,000,000. The figures are well known to the Minister and his officials and I believe some inquiry has been made recently into the whole matter, so it is possible to arrive at accuracy on this point.  At any rate, it is a figure of the order of £6,000,000 or £8,000,0000, and there are various set-offs.  Already we pension widows and orphans&mdash;very inadequately, indeed&mdash;and if every child under 16 were entitled to a pension, as a matter of elementary civic right, you could eliminate at one fell swoop, so to speak, all these other arrangements under which orphans and so on are entitled to pensions.</P>
    <P>The question arises: where would the money come from?  Certainly not from borrowing, either from private lenders or the banking system, for this is not the kind of object for which borrowing would be justified. Certainly not through taxing commodities which are downright necessaries of life, and I hope also not from any form of taxation which would impair private credit, or make more difficult the transition to the new economy rendered necessary by the present national emergency, or impair productive effort once that new economy has been accomplished successfully. I think taxation should, for purposes such as this, be aimed at superfluous consumption.  I do not say luxury consumption, as, in times of national emergency like this, lots of things which are not luxuries in the ordinary way become superfluous and, therefore, suitable objects of taxation.</P>
    <P>In framing our taxation system so as to get the £4,000,000, £6,000,000 or £8,000,000 we need for family allowances we might consider at the same time the desirability of &ldquo;whitening the black market&rdquo;.  The fact that people smuggled white flour into Éire and sold it at £1 per stone is very deplorable and we rightly abhor such profiteers who are using the situation to line their own pockets.  That to me, as a student of finance, has a most tremendous significance, and I personally&mdash;if I had anything to say in the matter&mdash; would proceed to mill, under strict excise <Col N="1019" /> control, about 10 per cent. of our total wheat production&mdash;in other words, about 40,000 tons of wheat&mdash;into white flour and extract from it an excise duty of £100 a ton and allow it to be sold&mdash;rationed, of course&mdash;at about £160 a ton, which is about £1 per stone, to people who are foolish enough to pay that price for white flour.  If you collect the excise duty of £100 per ton from 40,000 tons of white flour, it would amount to about £4,000,000 for the public treasury, and you might as well have that money for the public treasury as let the racketeers around the country make it for their own private treasuries.  I would make use of it to lessen the hardship suffered especially by children who are members of large families.</P>
    <P>There are other things like tobacco, and even beer and spirits, which, though very desirable in themselves, are not really elementary necessaries in a time of national crisis.  If the Minister had nerve enough to put an additional tax of 8/- a lb. on tobacco, he would, according to my calculation, raise an additional income of £4,000,000.  Incidentally, by raising the cost of cigarettes and tobacco, he would bring back the demand into relationship with the supply in such a way that people could freely buy cigarettes and there would no longer be this &ldquo;under-the-counter&rdquo; business, which is profoundly demoralising for both shopkeeper and customer.</P>
    <P>Again, if it is true&mdash;and I believe it is&mdash;that fantastic prices are being paid for black market tea, 16/- per lb. and so on, then there is a strong case for putting a pretty stiff excise duty on whatever tea we do manage to import, and letting it be sold freely within the ration limits.  At all events, that would capture for the public revenue some of the scarcity value of tea, which the racketeer now gathers for himself.  A tax of 2/- a lb. on 5,000,000 lbs.&mdash; assuming that to represent our annual consumption&mdash;would add to the public revenue some £500,000 and take nothing extra from the people who at present are prepared to pay a price for it which is actually more than they would be paying if they paid this extra 2/- a lb. tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> These are suggestions as to where the money is to come from.  I daresay they will reach the Minister in his own good time, even though he personally is conspicuous by his absence at the moment.  The main thing is that we should agree that the principle is sound, that the policy of family allowances is right, that those who bring up healthy, well-nourished children are rendering a social service to the nation, and that it is only just and proper that the nation should bear some part of the economic cost of that social service.  If we agree to that, and if we consider that the nation has any future at all, we must accept the principle that family allowances are a desirable institution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>With pleasure I support this motion, and I hope this House will pass it unanimously.  After all, I take it that it is one of the most important motions discussed in this House.  I am disappointed that the Minister is not here, but I suppose that he has to attend to something he considers more pressing.  I feel that no more pressing question has ever been discussed. Whatever wages a man receives in a job&mdash;whether you take the single man, the man who has a father and mother to support, or the man who has a wife and one child&mdash;he gets what is termed a living wage.  Do we not all know that ten people cannot live on what it would take to maintain three people? If the Government would rise to the occasion and bring forward a scheme of family allowances, it would be a great achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Government came into office, they have promoted many schemes to benefit workers, some of them new schemes and others improvements on existing ones, but I cannot understand why this matter of family allowances has been overlooked.  Take the case of the farm labourer with three or four children.  What is the attitude of the family when another member arrives?  Is it not a fact that an event which should bring joy to the parents and to the home usually deprives other children of the nourishment to which they are entitled? Have the parents not to consider what <Col N="1021" /> they can deprive themselves and their family of in order to rear the new member?  In these circumstances, is it any wonder that the rural population is decreasing, seeing that they have not sufficient to live on?  I feel that for every child above two in any family there should be some allowance given where the income of the family is not sufficient.  Where a family is already on the verge of starvation, is not the extra child going to bring them much nearer to want?  That is where the nation should help to support the family in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>I feel very keenly on this matter, although I do not quite agree with Senator Counihan's point that there should be any additional burdens put on farmers or farm labourers.  It is a national duty to support the children, and some of the farmers, although their condition has improved quite recently, would not be in a position to undertake the responsibility of contributing to such a scheme.  I am not an advocate of the &ldquo;black market&rdquo;, but I agree more or less with Senator Johnston's suggestion that people who are extracting high profits from the present situation should be the first on whom this burden should be placed. Looking into this question, however, I do not feel that the scheme would be so expensive as Senator Johnston seems to suggest.  People who are unemployed&mdash;of course, a farm labourer is not working all the time&mdash;get some sort of allowance.  I feel that there would be a saving there, and that the amount that would have to be paid out would not be so high as it is at present.</P>
    <P>In my opinion this House should pass the motion unanimously.  If it does, it will have done something of which it can always be proud.  We hear that year after year the population of the rural areas is declining, and the sooner the Government takes notice of that position the better.  The fact that there is a commission considering it gives some ground for hope that action will be taken soon.  Otherwise, there is not much prospect of the farm labourers being in a position to get married, even with the recent increase they secured in their miserable wages. <Col N="1022" /> As a matter of fact, the highest wage of 33/- a week would not maintain two people in decency, not to mention a family of seven.  I wonder if members of this House recall a tragedy that occurred a couple of months ago when two children were smothered.  It was stated at the inquest that one of the children was in a bed in which five people slept, and in the other case there were seven people in the one bed.  The explanation given was that these people could not provide other beds.  Is it not an awful state of affairs in a Christian country that the lives of two children should be lost in that way?  I suppose it is because they were poor children that there was no public outcry.  I hope it will be impossible for such a tragedy to happen again.  It would be a great relief to parents to know that, as the family increases, children would be entitled to some allowance until they reached the age of 14 years.</P>
    <P>I urge that all workers should be included in the scheme, that is, all workers in receipt of wages under a certain amount.  The troubles of the family in the rural areas apply equally to families in towns and cities.  This is a big national question, and I hope that the Government will succeed in finding the money for doing it, no matter where it comes from.  Expenditure of money on such a scheme would be wise and would enable the present generation to rear children under healthy conditions, as well as stopping the decline of our population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure that everyone agrees with the principle of this motion, I think it well to stress the fact that it would be wise to begin with agricultural labourers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country as in other countries, there is a flight from the land.  Men are unwilling to work on the land, and will put up with almost any conditions, and subject themselves to any hardship in order to get employment in any urban district in preference to land work.  If this motion did nothing else but check that tendency, it would be a very desirable result indeed.  The importance of endeavouring to keep <Col N="1023" /> our people on the land could not be over-stated.  If our rural population declines then, inevitably, the nation goes down.  I think that the Government would be well-advised to adopt the terms of this motion and to make some effort to put it into effect.  The question of finance is certainly a very important one, and a very difficult one to handle.  Senator Johnston put forward certain novel and ingenious suggestions. Undoubtedly, it would be a good idea, if the money now being made by private profiteers could be diverted to the National Exchequer&mdash; it would be a consummation very much to be desired.  I do not know if the putting of an extra heavy tax on tea would be welcome.  Tea is an important item in the budgets of the poorer people.  The well-to-do people have discovered ways and means of finding substitute beverages, but it is extremely difficult for poorer people to do that.  Perhaps this appeal coming from one who does not belong to the Benedict class may have some effect. Married labourers require more consideration than the unmarried labourers, and the one snag I see in the scheme is that if it were adopted there would be an incentive to employ unmarried men in preference to married men.  As the suggestion made by the proposer of the motion, that a certain sum should be paid by the labourer, another by the employer, and another by the State, would in no way meet the cost involved we must only make an appeal to the Government to find some way of bridging the gap.  At the moment, taxation in this country is very high and inevitably must be higher, but even so, as some speakers have said, it would be a good investment for the State to bring the scheme into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>When this House was considering a motion recently advocating the raising of agricultural wages and the betterment of the conditions of agricultural workers, two facts seemed to me to emerge from the discussion.  One was that the wages paid to agricultural workers were not sufficient to support a family.  I think <Col N="1024" /> that was generally agreed.  At the same time it was proved, I think, that agriculture as it is organised and circumstanced at present could not bear any additional cost.</P>
      <P>How are these two apparently irreconcilable positions to be reconciled? That seems to be an insoluble problem and yet the future of this country largely depends on finding a solution of it.  It is because it seems to me that a solution would be found on the lines suggested by this motion that I am in favour of it.  At first sight, it might seem that it would not be desirable to single out one class for consideration in the way of family allowances. But that has been done already. We have had milk and butter and bread allowances for certain people in the cities and towns, which allowances were not extended to the country.  It would, therefore, effect a balance if certain things were done for the country which would not be done for the towns. The agricultural worker, as was pointed out in a very powerful speech by Senator Hayes, is not only badly circumstanced economically but he is deprived of a great many advantages which his fellow workers in the towns have, in the way of educational facilities for his children and opportunities for their advancement.  For all these reasons, there is a good case to be made for singling out the agricultural workers for our first experiment in family allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Goulding made the important point that, if we are to continue to exist as a nation, we must do something to check the flight from the land. This is one way of checking that flight. Most of the speakers on this motion have adverted to that fact.  It has also been pointed out, with justice, that no more important work is done for the State than is done by the woman who bears and rears healthy children.  The wife of the agricultural worker who trains up her children to be future agricultural workers is doing for the State a service which it is incumbent on the State to recognise.  The State should help her, too, by making her burden easier.  Up to this, she has had an impossible burden.  The conditions <Col N="1025" /> under which she rears her family, as was pointed out by Senator O'Dwyer, are appalling.  It is a disgrace that a woman should have to rear her children in the conditions that are all too common in this country.</P>
    <P>On the general subject of family allowances, I think that we, in this country, should have a special interest in them because such provision is implicit in our Constitution.  When the Constitution was going through the other House, some of my sisters, feminist in outlook, were afraid that the position of women would be adversely affected by Article 41.  I did not share their fears.  I thought that the Constitution was going to help women to do their work for the State. I think that that was in the mind of the farmers of the Constitution but, so far, they have made no movement to implement the promises in Article 41. For this reason, I think that family allowances, which have been given in most other countries, are long overdue here.  There is a long list in the April number of the <i>Irish Rosary</i> of the countries where State schemes of family allowances were in operation before the war.  These countries include Belgium, France, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Chile and Japan, as well as New Zealand and Australia. When we all start from scratch after the war, the countries which will have the best future will be those with the most virile population.  If we have our agricultural wage earners in such a position that they cannot rear or feed or educate their families, we shall start with a tremendous handicap.  The best things we have are the quality of our population and the education which we give our children.  Those are the greatest riches we can have.  For that reason, I am strongly in favour of family allowances, and I am strongly in favour of this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in great difficulty with regard to this motion inasmuch as I am not quite clear whether I am for it or against it.  I am, as a measure of social justice, for the principle that family allowances should be paid, but I am in favour of paying family allowances not to the <Col N="1026" /> family of agricultural workers only, but to all families in the State where the family wage is below the level which will enable the family to live up to a decent standard of comfort.  I am against the proposition that, because of the present difficult economic conditions, the basic wages of agricultural workers should be supplemented in this way.  I am against any plan in any State at any time, except under very exceptional circumstances which I cannot anticipate at the moment, which makes it imperative on the State to permit the continuance of conditions in any industry in which the workers cannot get sufficient by selling their labour to enable them to live to a decent standard.  I do not mind whether the man in question works in a factory or a farm or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>It should be possible to sell commodities on the market at such a figure as would enable the men who gave their services in their production to enjoy a decent standard of life.  The other proposition is not one for which I, as a farmer, would stand, and is not one which we should attempt to defend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am all for creating conditions in agriculture whereby farmers will be able to pay their workers as much as they are paid in any other industry. I do not think that we shall ever have a self-respecting agricultural industry until we bring it up to that status.  I would not stand for supplementing agricultural wages in this way because of the present difficult economic conditions, but I would stand for the payment of family allowances as a measure of social justice because I believe that children are essential to the life of any progressive nation or State. The greater the number of children, the more powerful and virile the State will grow.  We have all these fine doctrines enunciated in our Constitution, but we have not implemented any of them.  It is time we set about doing so if we really meant what we said when we inserted these clauses in the Constitution.  In the book referred to by Senator Johnston, Mr. Rowntree discovered that about 43/3 or 43/6 was the minimum figure on which a husband, wife and five children could be <Col N="1027" /> maintained.  That is a number of years ago.  The cost of living in all these countries has risen considerably since then.  I am not quite clear that Senator Mrs. Concannon's argument, that this motion would be one way of stopping the flight from the land, would be justified by experience&mdash;if we simply pinned our faith to a scheme of family allowances favourable to families of agricultural workers.  We want to do much more than that. Anybody who lives in the country knows that it is not the agricultural workers, but the sons and daughters of the smaller farmers and of some of the bigger farmers, who are not getting married.  They are the people who ought to be getting married and raising new families.  They are not doing it.  There is not a mile of the country-side where you cannot count in fives, tens and twenties, the homes of people who, as far as one can judge, are the last of stock that has been there for 150 years or more.</P>
    <P>I do not think we would be going any distance at all towards stemming the flight from the land by this scheme of family allowances.  I feel the rot is far deeper, that there is something more fundamental than the fact that the agricultural workers are not getting married because the standard of living is too low.  The only way to stop people flying from any conditions is to improve the conditions.  People do not fly from comfort, nice incomes and a fair measure of enjoyment and ease. They are inclined to congregate and assemble around places where such conditions exist.  I do not think people have such a distaste for work in rural Ireland.  It is true that some members of a family will stay on the land and work on it until all hours of the night, while other members cannot be got to do anything on it, but the real truth is that people are flying from the land because the standard of living is too low and the standard of income is too low.  You are not going to stop that flight except by raising the level of the incomes of all the people in rural districts.  I have often heard it argued by all sorts of people that it would be much better that those on <Col N="1028" /> the dole should be paid a certain amount by way of dole and that they should make up the balance by working for the farmer.  I think that would be a better plan than this.  It seems to me that, if you want to tackle the rural problem, you must do more than merely point out the methods by which a scheme for family allowances for agricultural workers can be made possible. I think that would be only scratching the surface, leaving the great problem unsolved.</P>
    <P>I am not enthusiastic about the motion in its particular form.  I said at the beginning that, as a measure of social justice, we ought to harness our brains and energies to the task of providing a scheme of family allowances for all families whose minimum income falls below a certain level, whether they live in the city, the town or the country.  It seems to me that before you can do that, you have to measure and exploit the possibility of putting a great many more people into employment than are at present employed.  If you were to attempt such a scheme you would be paralysed by the magnitude of the problem.  There are so many thousands of families in the State whose incomes are below a reasonable level that it would appal those who have reasonable incomes to be faced with the task of raising their incomes to a level that would represent a bare existence.  What we have to do is to organise a scheme of life under which many of our unemployed people will be put to work.  I am not at all satisfied that we have attempted to measure that problem or that there are anything like as many people employed here as there might be, if we were not so fearful of shadows.  If we were able to put more people into employment, the number of people whose incomes would be below the minimum level, for whom a scheme of family allowances was requisite as a measure of social justice, would be very much smaller than it is to-day and the scheme would not then frighten a Minister for Finance, however sensitive.  That is the kind of mood I find myself in in considering this motion.</P>
    <P>I think we ought not to haggle at all <Col N="1029" /> about the general principle underlying a scheme of family allowances.  I think it is a Christian idea.  I am convinced, and have been convinced for a very long time, that we are less than Christian when we see all around us crowds of families and little children who are not properly clad and not more than half fed.  They are to be found in the country, in our towns and especially in our cities.  That is not a scheme of life which we can accept as the best product of Irish genius, patriotism and constructive effort.  It seems to me, therefore, that this motion is only scratching the surface, and only one corner of the surface.</P>
    <P>While it might appear to be favourable to the farmers, I see all the difficulties entailed in asking a Minister for Finance to operate a scheme that is partial to a certain number of citizens, leaving out other people who are equally necessitous.  If burdens have to be borne, they ought to be borne on an equitable basis by all members of the community in proportion to their capacity to bear, whether they are burdens of taxation or of having to do without and to go short. I am not at all satisfied that we are making any effort to face up to the real problems that confront the State, problems which must be solved before we lay even the basis of a Christian, progressive, social order here.  I am prepared to support the motion in a general way because it is making a demand for a scheme of family allowances, but I think the motion is too narrow.  I think it would be quite impossible for a Minister for Finance to operate it because it would be partial. As a farmer, I think it would be a wrong thing to put the agricultural industry in a position in this country where it must be the industry of paupers, where the farmers' labourers have to be paid by the State because the farmers are not able to get as much out of the land as would pay the workers a decent wage.  We would never keep workers under such conditions in our industry.  We must face the possibilities and discover how our industry can be made more profitable so that the people employed <Col N="1030" /> in it will earn enough to give them a decent standard of life.  I do not want to be a member of a pauper industry. I speak for people that I know have a great deal of pride and are anxious to pay the men who work for them. They work in the fields with them day after day and they do not grudge them what they earn or what they eat. These men must get a price for what they sell that will enable them equitably to requite the labour of their servants that has enabled them to produce the goods.  While I say that, in general, I give support to the motion, I think all sorts of considerations are raised by the motion, that cannot be easily solved or lightly dismissed.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I did not speak before Senator Baxter, because I am&mdash;to use his words&mdash;&ldquo;shocked and paralysed&rdquo; by the speech he made.  I have heard many conglomerations of contradictions from Senator Baxter, and I have listened to long speeches from him, wondering what he had been speaking about.  On this occasion, I heard the most extraordinary statement I have yet heard, and as the Senator sat down I was wondering what he wanted.  I am wholeheartedly in favour of partial treatment in this matter of family allowances, as definitely mentioned in the motion.  Speakers in favour of the motion have rambled widely from it. I noticed that Senator Johnston, Senator Tunney and Senator Baxter took the same line, discussing the implications of it as far as it relates to family allowances for all citizens of the State. I am in favour of it on a narrow basis, for the simple reason that I want to see the initiation of a back-to-the-land movement, and this would be a first and important step in that direction. The agricultural labourer, living on the land with a wife and family, is a far better technician, a far better tradesman, than many tradesmen in the cities who are paid high trade union rates of wages, and for that reason any increase of wages or allowances that can be given should be given him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to plead specially for the unmarried man, but for the married man who is established on the <Col N="1031" /> land and working with a farmer, who can use the plough, milk the cows, and do the hundred and one duties that work on the land involves.  He is far more highly skilled than many town tradesmen who are paid high wages.  I am in favour of any benefits that can be afforded that type of man for the reason that we have been speaking about so long, the flight from the land, and the facilities afforded to leave the land and go to live in urban and city areas.  Senator Johnston said that we had not provided subsidies to ensure the health of children.  I think he is very forgetful of the legislation that has been passed dealing with the health and welfare of all children in the State.  As Senator Mrs. Concannon pointed out, greater facilities have been provided for children in the cities than for those in the rural areas.  The recent grants in kind that are available for poorer people in the cities do not apply to the rural populations and, therefore, there is preferential treatment.</P>
    <P>In this case we want partial treatment to be afforded to the agricultural workers as distinct from the people living in the cities.  Senator Johnston did mention one very important point that was brought forcibly to my notice some years ago, that the agricultural labourer with his cottage and acre of land and family of, say, four or five children, received unemployment benefits, and worked his acre of land.  He said there was no incentive to that man to seek employment at a slightly increased wage, while he could work his land to his satisfaction and for the benefit of his family, while getting the unemployment allowance.  The fact of affording an agricultural labourer a family allowance while working would give him a far better incentive to go and work with a farmer than to be idle, apart from working his own acre, and receiving unemployment benefit.  I am not clear how the motion would affect a man who is, or has been, working with a farmer, and who has become unemployed through no fault of his own.  Would unemployment benefit or allowance continue as well as a family allowance?  I do not think that could work.  I think the motion would really <Col N="1032" /> apply to an agricultural worker, with a family, while he was working.  He would revert to the unemployment allowance when he would become idle.</P>
    <P>Some Senators referred to differential treatment.  It would be differential treatment for an agricultural worker as distinct from a worker in the city, but in other kinds of employment family allowances have been allowed.  They are allowed to persons who pay income-tax.  The man with a family receives preferential treatment. In the Civil Service special provision is made for a married man with a family.  These are points which I wish to stress in favour of my argument that this motion should apply to agricultural workers only.  It would be the first step, and an important step, towards the amelioration of conditions in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston gave some figures concerning the number of agricultural workers.  He gave one figure of 130,000. I do not know whether that includes female workers as well as male workers. Probably it includes both sexes.  If that is the case, the figures that he quoted afterwards would be relatively smaller&mdash;35,000 families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that there are not more than 1,000 or 2,000 female agricultural workers in the country altogether.  I mean, technically, working for wages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be an amazingly small figure, whatever statistics may reveal.  I am not going to touch on the question as to how the money could be raised.  I am in favour of the principle of the motion, because it is a wise step to hold the people on the land.  If possible, we should reverse engines now and have an exodus from the cities rather than from country districts to the cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this is an important step in that direction, and that family allowances for agricultural workers would be a great help towards making the countryside happy and in establishing an increased number of homes <Col N="1033" /> in the rural districts.  I think it was Senator Johnston who said that the money required could be raised if employers paid 1/- per head per week, the employees 1/- and the State 6d.  In my opinion, that basis of contribution is all wrong, because the State does not pay enough.  I think the State should contribute at least an amount equal to that contributed by the other parties, as it has equal responsibility for helping to maintain and keep the people on the land.  If any alterations were to be made in the suggested contributions, I think that the 6d. should be paid by the agricultural worker.  There may be some objections to the scheme on the grounds that the employer, the farmer, would be unable to pay a contribution of 1/- a week.  Senator Baxter just now referred to the farmers as paupers.  I object to that term.  I objected here before to the farmers being called paupers.  It is not proper or justifiable to say that the agricultural industry is pauperised.  It is not pauperised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I want to say how strongly I dissent from a certain presupposition that I so often hear expressed in this House.  I instance the statements of Senator Mrs. Concannon and Senator Baxter this evening.  There is nothing to me more loathsome than to hear it so constantly assumed that we should do something or other to induce men to produce families in the country because it will enhance the State or add to the power of the State.  That seems to me a complete distortion and reversion of values.  The value of the State consists only in so far as it serves the human person.  In certain totalitarian States they take the most <Col N="1034" /> elaborate steps to enhance the fecundity of the people and to encourage the growth of the population because the people there are regarded as mere chattels of the State. That is a point of view which is innate in many of the speeches here to-day&mdash;the whole assumption that there must be this enormous aggrandisement of the State itself and that everything must derive from it.</P>
      <P>The last Senator who spoke objected to any reference to a pauperisation of the people and then went on to suggest that the State should contribute more towards the fund which Senator Johnston suggests should be created for this purpose.  That is pauperisation. Why should the State contribute? The implication of that suggestion is that production from the land is not able to provide a Christian standard&mdash;to drag in a word that is very often used in this House&mdash;a standard which it is agreed everybody should have.  There is some arbitrary fixed point decided by sentimentalists which is regarded as a Christian standard, and it is assumed that if certain lines of labour do not provide that standard, there is something wrong. Implicit in what the last Senator said is that, according to social justice, there is a minimum which the agricultural worker should receive, that that minimum is something which we, as Christians, think the human person requires, and as the farmer is unable to provide that standard for his workers you must get the money from somewhere, and the all-powerful State is invited by the Senator to give an increased contribution.  Yet the Senator denounced the use of the word &ldquo;pauperisation.&rdquo;  But if the fruits of our labour are not such as to enable ourselves and our children to live in Christian comfort, we must become paupers and we must live on the charity of that abstraction which we call the State.  I object to this lack of clarity in speaking.</P>
      <P>The motion itself begins:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Eireann is of opinion&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; means that it is <Col N="1035" /> doubtful.  The resolution then goes on to say that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;as a measure of social justice in the present difficult economic conditions, the basic wages of agricultural workers should be supplemented by a scheme of family allowances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I was in charge of a Department of State, time and again I gave orders that nobody sending me a report was to use the passive voice.  When, for instance, I got a report commencing with the statement &ldquo;it was said&rdquo; I always wanted to know by whom it was said.  Here we have a suggestion that the basic wages of agricultural workers should be supplemented, but there is no mention of who is going to supplement them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not mentioned in the motion.  I entirely approve of the suggestion that agricultural workers should get the highest possible rate of wages and that we should aim at a condition in which the labour of the land should provide out of its own fruits the standards which the workers require.  When, however, you drag in the State you are pauperising agriculture, and implicit in that is the assumption that the totality of land and the totality of the fruits of the land are not going to be sufficient to provide a living for those people. Personally I do not think that is so.  I would rather support this motion for the reason that there is no reference at all to the State.  What I would like to say is that it is agreed that the farmers and the labourers should contribute towards this fund.  That would require that the farmers must make a certain profit.  I like that word &ldquo;profit&rdquo;.  Many people talk about producing for consumption without reference to profit, but I think that the farmers should have sufficient profits to enable them to provide themselves and their workers with a reasonable standard of living.  I should like that to be the basic consideration because agriculture is the main industry in this country.  Once you have <Col N="1036" /> that established, then the workers in general, people engaged in other employment and buying the farmers' produce must pay a price for it that will enable the farmer to do what is proposed here.</P>
      <P>I should like that to be the norm and the basis by which everything would be regulated.  We could then say that a farm labourer working x hours a day for so many days a week would get a certain wage, while the men working behind the counter or working in a factory, would have their work assessed in relation to the value of the work of the man on the land.  What we are doing here, however, is suggesting that although we have all got to live on what the country produces, and although everybody seems to agree that the farmers have practically all the means of production in their hands, they are not able to support the labourers who are engaged in that production unless their efforts are supplemented from some other source.  There is no other source except in what is produced in the country.  We get to the position in which everybody works and the Government takes the maximum from them and then distributes it. The whole mind of the Dáil and Seanad, and practically of the whole modern world, is that people and their labour will count very little more than tools in the hands of the all-powerful State, which will hand out the doles, and not only agriculture but every other productive employment is going to be pauperised&mdash;a word most properly used by Senator Baxter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of food allowances, there is always a possibility, taking it all round, that you are going to say: &ldquo;If you employ a married man, he must receive more than an unmarried man&rdquo;&mdash;I know that Senator Counihan has anticipated all this&mdash;and in that way you make it desirable for employers to employ only unmarried people.  Normally, I would say that, while it is right that a married man with a family should receive more on account of his commitments, yet inasmuch as the married man has taken on responsibility, as a decision of his own will, the provision for that family is <Col N="1037" /> eminently forced upon himself.  In the case of family allowances, if it were like trade union or city employment, a married man should really be expected to work longer and produce more than the unmarried man.  We had this arbitrary business about the 48 or the 44-hour week.  An unmarried man requires a certain amount, which it is his duty to himself to produce, in order to provide his own living.  A married man has a wife, and possibly some children, to support, and there is a greater duty on him to work more.  I do not see how that could apply in agriculture, where there is no time limit and men are working more or less for the hours that nature permits.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a good idea to try this, although I will not commit myself to the opinion that the State should come into it.  This motion really says nothing, as it does not propose that anything should be done.  We are a legislative body, and our business is the enacting of laws.  The motion merely says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the basic wage of agricultural workers should be supplemented by a scheme of family allowances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I quite agree to that, but that does not mean I agree that the State should provide any of the money.  In a way, I do not want the State to do it.  I want the country to be forced to the fact that its one great industry is agriculture. The agriculturists are being robbed.  That was quite obvious when we had the tariff ramp, and when we had protection under it so that some people could collect tariff taxes instead of the Government&mdash;taxation which put up prices to the farmers.  No Government can really give protection in the same manner as the consumer can to the more easily rationalisable industries.</P>
    <P>I would like to see this experiment tried in regard to agriculture.  I do not think it is as simple as Senator Counihan and those associated with him think.  If we are assuming that family allowances are to be provided, it should be out of agriculture itself, and not out of the purse of that hideous abstract monster we call the State. <Col N="1038" /> You would then have farmer-employer and farm labourer-employee working in co-operation, and after a time one would be able to say what roughly was required to be produced out of a given amount of labour, and that could then be expressed in terms of cash.  One would be able to say what was the reasonable wage for the unmarried men, and what the product of one year's labour on a certain amount of land should be.  Then one might be able to force the non-agricultural people in this country to put up such a price for agricultural production as would enable the scheme to be carried out.</P>
    <P>That might easily require the elimination of a great number of middlemen, and those who serve over the counters may have to work longer and harder or accept lower wages.  It might easily mean that those particularly favoured people&mdash;not so evident now as a couple of years ago&mdash;operating tariff industries would find that the money they took from the public had not the same value now, as the price of potatoes, bacon and beef would be higher. I would support this, although I do not mean to commit myself to anything. I am merely saying that, as far as the wage-earners on the land are concerned, those who are married should have their basic wage supported from a source not revealed, by a sort of family allowance.  In doing so, I wish to insist that we must live on what this country produces, and that will be seen more clearly on the next motion on the Order Paper.</P>

I understand that the full enactment of the Bill is a matter of urgency as the Bill must be law by the end of the month.  Normally, under Standing <Col N="1039" /> Orders a Money Bill must be entered on the Order Paper next prepared after its receipt from the Dáil, but if that Order were adhered to in this instance the Bill could not be taken until to-morrow at the earliest, and if not taken then would have to be considered at a sitting convened for the purpose next week.

      <P>I desire to thank the Seanad for agreeing to take this Bill now.  This is a Bill of the ordinary kind, introduced periodically to confirm Orders made under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act.  As Senators are aware, Orders made under that Act have to be confirmed by legislation within a period of time, and the first of these Orders must be confirmed before the 1st May.  None of these is of very great importance, but certain legal complications will arise if the Orders were not confirmed, either by the refusal of the Oireachtas to confirm them, or because of failure to enact the necessary confirming measure within a specified period.  The Orders scheduled to this Bill are three in number.  The first makes an amendment to the definition of medicated cotton wool in the duty applicable to cotton wool.  That duty was imposed by the Finance Act of 1940 and exemption from the duty was given in respect of medicated cotton wool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It became necessary to define more clearly what was medicated cotton wool, and the purpose of this Order was clarification of the definition.  The new definition is rather technical. Cotton wool is exempt from duty if it contains at least 15 per cent. of boric acid, or has been treated with oleoresin <Col N="1040" /> of capsicum in accordance with the British Pharmaceutical Codex, or either of these classes of goods when not exceeding 14 lbs. in weight and consigned to one person only.  The amendment of the Order does not affect the supply position in the least. Supply of cotton wool to this country is controlled by the Board of Trade, and a definite quota per period has been allocated to this country up to the present.</P>
    <P>The second Order reduces the duty upon assembled chassis for electrically-driven vehicles.  In fact, they cannot be obtained, and in order to encourage people who might be able to get them, the duty was reduced to the nominal one of 15 per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i> The third Order, made some time ago, gives power to grant licences for the free importation of a very large number of goods which were subject to duty, where the original Act or Order imposing the duty did not give that power.  The Order is only of academic interest, because most of the duties specified in the Schedule have since been suspended by Orders under the Emergency Powers Act, but difficulties would arise if those Orders were not confirmed, because under the terms of the Emergency Powers Act, if an Order is made but not confirmed, a similar Order cannot be provided and fresh financial legislation would be required to effect the same results. Circumstances may arise in which the Emergency Powers Order will not be applicable, and it may still be desired to have power to grant free importation of the articles in question.</P>
    <P>There is a long list of the articles, none of which is of great importance. Where they are of importance, the duty is not in operation.</P>

As regards the third Order, I agree with the Minister <Col N="1041" /> that this power should exist during the emergency.  I have no objection to the Bill going through all its stages now.  At the same time, I hope this will not occur again, because a few Orders have been made which ought to be discussed.  I do not think that that applies to any of these three Orders.

      <P>I am in favour of this motion because I regard it as a back-to-the-land motion.  It will create a balance between rural and urban life.  People are flocking from the country to the town and there seems to be an accepted theory that, when people flock to the towns, they deteriorate.  For that reason, it is desirable that we plant as many people on the soil as possible.  This motion, if given effect, will tend to plant the people on the soil and create a contented and happy countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some suggestion was made that there was a taint of pauperisation about this proposal.  Income-tax payers are given family allowances and no income-tax payer ever thought, or suggested, that that allowance was in the nature of pauperisation.  Nor will the agricultural worker's wife regard a family allowance of this kind as tainted in any way.  She will certainly not regard it as pauperisation.  We have 400,000 farmers and 100,000 of these are no better off than agricultural workers.  I should like to see this motion amended so as to bring in these people.  I commend the motion generally to the <Col N="1042" /> House and to the Government and I hope it will come to fruition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any motion having for its purpose the amelioration of the needs of the poorer classes will have the entire sympathy of this House or any other House but, to my mind, this is only trifling with the state of affairs which now exists.  The agricultural industry is recognised as the basic industry of this State.  Why then should we be trifling with allowances and subsidies, which is only taking from Peter to pay Paul or taking from Paul to pay Peter?  Why not suggest that the agricultural industry be overhauled so that it be converted into a self-supporting industry?  It is the principal industry in the country and it should be reorganised in the right way by people who know more about it than I do.  Production should be reorganised and the prices to be obtained should pay as well as those in any other industry.</P>
      <P>Subsidisation of the agricultural industry may benefit a certain number of the agricultural community on the better lands and the better counties. The benefit goes to the people with the best farms and, in the poorer western counties, the people pay more than their share of the subsidies because their lands are not suitable for the production of such crops as benefit by these subsidies.  We all agree that agriculture should be encouraged in every way but people are not sometimes agreed as to the best way of encouraging it.  Everybody agrees that the prices which are at present guaranteed by the State for crops should give a reasonable return to the farmer. Still, it is only by the greatest pressure that some of the farmers are induced to do their simple duty by producing crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether or not they think that the work does not pay, I do not know, but it seems incredible that, with the present prices, more land is not tilled. During the depression, when cattle were at a poor price, if agriculturists were offered the same prices for cereals, root crops and other produce as they are guaranteed now, we should <Col N="1043" /> have half the land of Ireland tilled. The trouble is that money is not required to the extent it was then. Money is plentiful and it is difficult to get these people to till the soil.  The theme of my argument is that, instead of these charities, the agricultural industry should be reorganised and put on a paying basis, one way or another, so that the owner of the soil and the labourer he employs will be able to get a reasonable living out of the industry.</P>
    <P>The most successful farmer I know in my part of the country is the man who treats his workers best.  He keeps only three or four workers, but he supplies them with meals with which he is not bound to supply them at all.  He knows that they work hard and he insists on their having meals at his place which they are supposed to take at home.  In return for that, he gets good work and they never look at the clock.  He estimates that, at the end of the year, the money he invests in the extra food and allowances he gives his men is returned threefold.  The farmers themselves could do a lot in respect of these family allowances. There is general plentifulness on a good farm, and a little generosity of that kind&mdash;it is not necessary to recommend this to the good farmers we have in this House&mdash;will always pay for itself.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about the flight from the land and the low marriage rate.  Paradoxical as it may seem, in the West of Ireland the reason the marriage rate is so low is that sufficient cannot flee from the land.  That is the difficulty in the western counties where there are big families.  They usually melted away until there were only one boy and girl left in the house.</P>
    <P>Formerly, the boy got married in the house and the girl got married outside. If you go to any house now in the western counties, my own county in particular, around Clare, you will have five or six adults in the home, with the father and mother, with the result that nobody can get married. They used to emigrate&mdash;not that I commend that.  That is the condition of affairs.  There is not a flight from <Col N="1044" /> the land.  There are really too many adults in each small farm in the West of Ireland.  I do not know how the position can be remedied, except that those who have big estates might till more of the land and thereby give more employment.  The workers could also migrate to the Midlands and to other parts of the country.  Of course, I am not in any way opposing any suggestion that may be made for helping those who work on the land when they need help, but they should not need it.  The land is capable of producing goods that should command a price that would give everyone working on the land at least a reasonable living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this motion.  It may be argued that there should be no differentiation between different classes of workers, but a very special case can be made for family allowances in the case of agricultural workers.  In the first place, we know that in nearly all countries, at all times, the price of agricultural produce has been low in comparison with that of manufactured articles.  As a result, those engaged in agriculture have, in general, been poorer than those engaged in manufacture or in any other walk of life, and the workers engaged in agriculture have had at all times to accept a lower standard of living than that enjoyed by workers in any other walk of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that that condition of things, that has existed almost at all times, exists to a greater degree to-day.  Though we all desire to see a change in that respect, we must admit it may take some time to bring it about.  In the meantime, an urgent matter is the fast disappearance of the agricultural workers as a class from the land.  Senator Baxter, speaking from the farmers' point of view, and Senator Honan, speaking from the urban people's point of view, both spoke of a reorganisation of agriculture.  Senator Baxter, undoubtedly, was thinking of an increased price for agricultural produce. He suggested that if there were an increased price for agricultural produce, agriculture would be able to pay <Col N="1045" /> a greater wage to its workers.  I agree, but I am afraid that it would be a very big undertaking to increase the price of agricultural produce.  It cannot be done in a short time.  What this motion proposes, that is, to give a family allowance to the agricultural worker, would be a comparatively small matter, which would cost very little, whereas an increase in the price of agricultural produce generally, would naturally cost a very large sum. While waiting to do the larger thing, we should not neglect the smaller and more immediately practicable object.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan spoke of a reorganisation of agriculture so as to enable a better wage to be paid to the agricultural workers.  I often wonder, when people speak of reorganisation of agriculture, if they know what it would mean.  The trouble with agriculture and with the agricultural worker is this: Agriculture in Ireland is mainly conducted on small or medium-sized farms.  We know that, on large farms, machinery can be employed which enables a man to do many times the work that it is possible for a man without machinery to do.  On large farms, with scientific machinery and scientific methods, it is possible to manage with a small number of men and to pay them a large wage.</P>
    <P>That occurs in New Zealand and other countries, to a large extent, also, in England.  On medium sized farms it is not possible to employ machinery to the same extent, and a man's labour cannot be as valuable as it would be on larger farms.  Therefore, when we speak of the reorganisation of agriculture, the only reorganisation which could provide a wage in comparison with that earned in the factories at the present time would be a reorganisation which would do away with the small farms and establish some sort of communal farms.  That would be the only way of providing a factory type of wage for agricultural workers.  The immediately practicable alternative to that would be to provide family allowances so as to supplement the wages of the agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why this allowance should be given in the case <Col N="1046" /> of agricultural workers.  While there are many badly paid workers in the cities and many industries where the rates of wages would, possibly, be lower than a living wage, we must remember that these are not essential industries.  They could disappear to-morrow and perhaps no great injury to the nation would result.  But the nation cannot afford to allow agricultural workers as a class to die out because it would mean a reduction of agricultural production, which would mean, in the long run, the destruction of the nation.  The agricultural industry is absolutely essential, and the agricultural worker as a class is also absolutely essential.  Therefore, I think there is a very clear case why the House should consider recommending a scheme of family allowances in the case of agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that people in the city do not realise the conditions under which agricultural workers live.  In County Limerick and County Tipperary there is probably a larger population of agricultural workers than in any other part of Ireland because, in former days, the dairying industry employed a large number and the public bodies built cottages for the workers to replace their old houses.  There are more cottages in Limerick than in any other county in Ireland but, unfortunately, work on the land has declined in recent years.</P>
    <P>It is not that the workers' wages are low but that there is no regular employment on the land.  The agricultural workers get a few months' work on the land; then they get the dole; they get unemployment assistance; then they work for a few weeks on bogs, on roads or any other public work.  Their employment is sporadic and their income very uncertain.  In some cases they have been provided with houses and with acres of good land, but we find that 90 per cent. of those cottages are badly kept, falling into disrepair. Occasionally one may see one well-kept house, one carefully tilled plot and on inquiry we find that the owner of that house is not an agricultural labourer but a man who has some position distinct from work on the land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> The position of the majority of agricultural labourers is pitiable in the extreme.  They generally marry young and rear large families.  The agricultural labourer and his family, even on the rich land of County Limerick, rarely eat meat.  The war has rendered their condition even worse.  Even milk is a rare commodity in these families.  I have seen young children &mdash;it is quite a common thing&mdash;reared on black tea and bread from their earliest infancy.  At 15 or 16 years of age they are taken into service with the farmers.  Up to that period they are reared on an insufficient diet. Their father may possibly have an income of 16/- a week on which to rear his family.  They grow up under-fed, under-nourished and badly clad.  In after life they are subject to disease. In the matter of education they also suffer.  Badly fed and badly clad as they are, they are unable to attend regularly at school.  The very moment they reach school-leaving age they are taken away and put into employment so that they may help to rear the remaining members of the family.</P>
    <P>The result is that the agricultural labourer has regarded himself as a parasite, and as the lowest of classes of employees.  His great ambition has been to get away from the land.  No one can wonder at that, for there has been no hope for him of advancement in any walk of life.  We might find the sons of other workers in the professions, in the Church, or in business, but not the sons of agricultural labourers.  Owing to their meagre incomes, it has been impossible for labourers to educate their children. That, perhaps, obtains in other occupations also; but the point I wish to bring out is that, for very little expenditure, considerable help could be given to these children.  Where men have been employed in the country, even at small wages, by the local authorities, such as gangers, etc., they are well provided for, and the wage goes further in the country than in the towns.  Because of that I suggest that a small family allowance would make all the difference between hunger and <Col N="1048" /> plenty in the country, and a small expenditure by the State would repay itself a hundredfold.  I think that not only married workers, but all agricultural workers should contribute their share.  That that would be the fairest way to work the scheme, and the State should at least contribute as much as the others.  The idea is immediately practicable and can be worked, and it would not cost much, while it would mean a great deal to agricultural workers and would keep the people on the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I started off to listen to this debate with a rather vague general sympathy with the idea of family allowances, but I must confess that with the exception of the last two speeches, most of the arguments I have heard have tended rather to convert that vague general sympathy into a vague antipathy.  I feel that there is a great deal to be said in favour of these allowances in principle, and in dealing with the question, it is very important to get down to the general principle that governs it.  A point that no one has referred to at all in the discussion is the idea that lies behind the movement for family allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely that idea is to get away from the individualistic basis of our modern economy, the notion that the labourer represents nothing but the worth of his industry, that he is not a person at all, but a sort of chattel, to be paid on the strictest and most rigorous economic basis for the amount he produces.  The idea is to get away from that, and to take the principle that the labourer is a person who has personal rights and a personal status in society.  That principle applies, to my mind, not merely to the agricultural labourer, but to all kinds of labour no matter how little or how much it is paid, and it is a principle that if it could be applied all round, would probably go a long way towards curing the economic ills from which the world is suffering.  At the same time, the subject is one of vast importance and one that needs very special study <Col N="1049" /> before any valuable action can be taken upon it.  If the debate here to-day does nothing else but ventilate the subject, and give an opportunity for an exchange of views on one aspect of it, it will have done very good service.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the argument that I heard here to-day sounded to me rather unconvincing.  The suggestion, for instance, that you could produce any particular effect upon the flight from the land by means of family allowances to agricultural labour seems very doubtful.  I thought that Senator Honan's contribution in that respect was particularly valuable, because he pointed out that the flight from the land has very little to do with the question of wages or even the question of earnings on the land at all.  It depends more on the system of land-holding that we have.  The ordinary small farm is not capable of giving continuous support to a large family.  It can maintain the family up to a certain point, but everybody who has been on a small farm knows that, inevitably, every child on the farm, except one, must go, or else must stay behind and wither.  As long as you have that system I do not think that measures like family allowances are going to have very much effect on it.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible problem, and a most important and far-reaching one.  It seems to me that that is the essence of it.  The system of small holdings that we have been given, and have given ourselves, directly produces that tendency to shed off the family and drive them all away except one. That one then may get married and produce another family and the same problem arises again in the next generation. The suggestion that by increasing wealth and raising the standard of living you increase the population, seems to me to be begging a great many questions. Whether by raising the standard of living you do not lessen the population, is very doubtful indeed, as an historical fact.  Whether it is not true that the higher the standard of living is universally the more population tends to decrease, and whether all <Col N="1050" /> these measures that we talk about so hopefully have not actually the opposite effect to what we think, is worthy of pondering over.  It is not a matter that we can dogmatise on with success, but it is worth pondering on how far we can raise the population&mdash;assuming that our object of raising the population is a sound object&mdash; by raising the standard of living of the community.</P>
    <P>Again the suggestion that part of the cost of this scheme should be borne by the State seems to me to be very questionable, and one that might lead to all sorts of bad effects.  I quite agree with Senator Fitzgerald that there is a danger of pauperisation.  That is an ugly word, and I know that Senator O'Donovan objects to it, but it is a fact.  The whole movement of society for the last 40 or 50 years has been steadily towards State pauperisation&mdash; turning more and more citizens into dependents on the State in one way or another; and that process of making workers into dependents on the State is one of the factors that has produced the difficulty about agricultural labour. I have been told, for instance, that here in County Dublin, it is possible for an unemployed man with a wife and family to get more money for doing nothing than the agricultural labourer, who is his next door neighbour, gets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that.  He gets more than the agricultural labourer, his next-door neighbour, can get for a full week's work. That is, as Senator Johnston has stated, a strong argument for family allowances.  It has arisen because of the fact that the provision for unemployment assistance, and other social services of that kind, has run away from the provision for those who are engaged in productive work.  In other words, we have already gone too far on that march towards pauperisation, and we have got to correct it now by another type of pauperisation.  At <Col N="1051" /> least, that is what we shall be doing if we provide for a State contribution in this matter.  The most telling argument against a State contribution was put forward by Senator Honan.  I was brought up in a county where there are no agricultural labourers, at least as a class; where the agricultural labourer is the son of a small farmer who is sometimes hired out to a neighbouring farmer.  He lives exactly as a member of the family, gets the same food, and often gets more for his work than the members of the family themselves ever get.  That is the condition we have pretty well all over Connaught, and if you make the State contribute towards schemes of this kind, the effect will be to make the small farmer and the agricultural labourer in Connaught contribute towards the solution of a problem which is a Munster or Leinster problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to argue that small farmers in Connaught who are not very much, if at all, above the level of the agricultural labourer in Munster and Leinster, should not be asked out of their meagre, perhaps non-existent, profit, to contribute to a scheme which will be entirely for the benefit of people in distant parts of the country in whom, fundamentally, they have very little interest and for whose problems they are not responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentally, I should like to suggest to Senator O'Dwyer that if there are labourers' children, whose parents are <Col N="1052" /> employed by well-to-do farmers in a rich county like Limerick and who are compelled to live on black tea, it is an eternal disgrace to the people who employ them, and certainly the attention of the whole country should be drawn to that disgraceful condition of affairs.  This is not a matter in which the State should interfere.  It is a thing for the employers themselves to stand up to.  If they are not able to employ men, except on starvation conditions, then they should not employ men at all.  If a man purports, especially in a rich milk producing county like Limerick, to employ a labourer in the production of milk, and does not see to it that that labourer gets sufficient milk to prevent his children having to drink black tea, he should not be a producer at all.  The solution for that is a proper conscience on the part of employers rather than State contributions. Even if the employers are not very well off, even if there are ups and downs in their economic conditions, even if their profits are not as high as they should be, that does not excuse them for ill-treating their labourers, and that is what the statement made by Senator O'Dwyer amounts to.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise as strongly as I can the point in reference to the injustice of calling on the small farmer west of the Shannon to contribute as taxpayer to a scheme of this kind.  The agricultural labour problem is not his problem; he has not created it; he is not particularly well off himself; he does not live very much above the level of the agricultural labourer in Munster.  That is the great difficulty about State contribution.  Not only does it tend to create State dependence at one end but it tends to put an unfair burden upon all sorts of people who should not be called upon to bear such a burden at the other end.  I would suggest that if there are to be contributions, apart from what the labourer and the employer himself pay, they should be rather on a county basis, and if the county basis is found to be impracticable, they should be on a parish basis.  That is one of the directions <Col N="1053" /> in which parish councils, about which we hear so much, might well give valuable service.  The parish council might be called upon to organise schemes for family allowances within its own area, where the neighbours understand one another's problems and where they can help to overcome them in a spirit of Christian charity.  You would get the thing done much more satisfactorily on that basis than by the process of exacting a State contribution, putting the liability on the general taxpayer, and adding still more to the problem of a universal dependency that has gone too far already.  I believe myself, in any case, that nothing has done more harm in the West of Ireland than the extension of unemployment benefits to the sons of small farmers.  A statement of that kind may seem very unpopular and very reactionary but the effect of giving these grants and doles to sons of small farmers, instead of helping to consolidate or strengthen the family, has been to drag these young men away from the family, to break up their cohesion with their parents, to break up the control of the heads of the family over its members, and to form them into independent units.  The process of the flight from the land is exaggerated rather than obviated by that sort of machinery.  I am fully in sympathy with the idea of regulating wages, not in accordance with individualist economics but with the principle of the rights of the human person, but I want to insist that when a problem like this is taken up, it is not good enough to approach it with facile generalities and a vague spirit of general optimism.  You have to study it very carefully.  The greatest danger in dealing with a problem of this kind is that the measures you adopt to cure the evil may ultimately intensify that evil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that there will be general agreement that the putting down of this motion and the debate this evening have served a very useful purpose.  There are one or two points <Col N="1054" /> to which I should like to make reference. Senator Fitzgerald's cure for the difficulties of the married man was to work longer hours.  He thinks that when a man undertakes the obligation of rearing a family he should be prepared to work longer hours.  He objects to any State subsidy or grant towards the proposed family allowances but if he objects to a State subsidy in this case, he must also object to the allowance which is made by the State in the case of the income-tax payer.  The income-tax payer is given a certain allowance in respect of his wife and family.  If Senator Fitzgerald disagrees with the State subsidy in one case, I think he must disagree with it in the other.  Whether it is a rebate or an allowance it is a loss of money to the State.  As we know, we have already in existence, in the Defence Forces and in unemployment assistance, schemes of family allowances. Then we have the income-tax payer, who receives a rebate in relation to his family.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald also said the farmer should be paid sufficient for his produce, in order to enable him to pay sufficient wages to his farm labourers, and he went on to state that, in that sense, the Government has done nothing for the farmer.  He said, in regard to industries established and built up inside the tariff wall, that they got all the privileges; but he forgot that the Government guaranteed the home market to the farmer and that the people in the towns and cities were compelled to pay a higher price for farm produce &mdash;butter, eggs and so on.  We were often told by certain leading men that we could import wheat far more cheaply than we could produce it, but it was the Government's duty to help the farmer in regard to butter, eggs and bacon.  The home market was guaranteed, yet Senator Fitzgerald stated that the Government did nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also heard a lot about the flight from the land.  Someone has suggested that, if this motion were adopted, the flight from the land <Col N="1055" /> would cease, as every farm labourer would receive a family allowance.  I agree with a good deal of what Senator Tierney said in that regard. Some of those who have referred to this flight from the land have forgotten to consider a very serious aspect of rural life&mdash;that the greatest curse in the country is the number of old bachelors who remain on the land. I know a country village where there are eight or ten people residing and in not one of those houses has there been a marriage for the last 40 or 50 years.  In another 20 years the people who now own that land will have ceased to exist.  It sometimes happens that three or four members of a family stay on and on, one watching the other, to see who will get married first and get the fortune.  That is the serious aspect of it, and it is that that is causing people to go into the towns and cities for employment. It has been pointed out already that a small farmer who owns 20 or 30 acres of land finds that only one member of the family can reside on that farm, and when he gets married and rears a family their time will come. All this talk about the flight from the land is entirely wrong.  It would be well if we could adopt some system of encouragement for those people who are inclined to remain too long in their homes, to come out and allow room to one member of the family, who will get married eventually if he gets a chance.</P>
    <P>One way in which the Government can assist agricultural workers is by a speedy division of the land, by dividing up the large ranches and giving these people something to exist on.  When we take up the newspapers, we find a man with three or four hundred acres has not tilled his quota, because he has not the way.  He never did any of that kind of work and has not the way. If the Land Commission had, for the last 20 or 30 years, adopted a more vigorous attitude in land division, we would have no Compulsory Tillage Order to-day and no appeals to the farmers.  The absence of that policy for many years past and the holdups <Col N="1056" /> there have been in the different Land Acts, are chiefly responsible for our lack of wheat and other foodstuffs to-day.  In the division of land, these agricultural workers should get consideration. They are people who work on the land and whose fathers before them worked on the land, but when it comes to dividing the land they are not considered. That is because, first of all, the congests of the area must get consideration. However, there are some cases where those congests get consideration, and it does not always happen that the man who is a congest is the best man to work the land.  A man should get consideration in land division on his ability to work the land, rather than on his living in or near an estate to be divided.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald also said that the agricultural worker was differently situated from the town worker.  He had to work longer hours.  He suggested that, if he is a married man, he should work longer hours to support his family.  As I am sure the farmers know, the Agricultural Wages Board has fixed the hours for agricultural workers, just as trade organisations have done for town workers.  I am prepared to support this motion, although I think it should have gone still further, and I would be in favour of extending it to all workers under a certain income.</P>
    <P>If we look at this from the town and city workers' point of view we must admit that, while the agricultural worker may not be sufficiently paid for the hardships under which he has to labour, the town worker is more in need of assistance to bring up his family, because, as some Senators rightly put forward, in very many cases the agricultural worker is not really dependent on the remuneration he receives.  He usually has free milk and vegetables, while the town worker has to pay highly for everything. Therefore, I think this might have been extended to all workers under a certain income&mdash;up to £3 or £4 a week&mdash;and who have children over 14 years of age attending school.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> In that way, it would keep these young people from rambling about the roads, doing mischief in our towns and cities.  There should be some scheme whereby their parents would receive assistance, to keep them at a continuation school until they reach the age of 16.  That would be something very beneficial from the national point of view, as it would keep them out of mischief and help them to better their education, and also it would relieve the employment market.  We know why all those young lads are kept at home from school.  Their parents are looking forward to the few shillings, five or six, or maybe ten, which they earn by running messages and doing odd jobs. There is no use in saying that when they leave the national schools at 14 they have the vocational schools to go to, because the young boys I refer to have an idea that those schools were not built for them, and they have no boots or clothes to attend them and neither have they the food they should have to eat.</P>
    <P>There was an investigation carried out recently in Galway by the Bishop of Galway among the poorer families of the city and it was found that over 300 families had meat only on one day in the week.  In such a situation, we cannot expect to have a healthy population. We may spend money on hospitals, and all the money we like on social services, but if we do not build up the young people when they are young, if we do not give them the food necessary to make men and women out of them, then the greatest portion of the money spent on social services is wasted.  On that account, I would like to see this scheme of family allowances extended to town workers, or to all workers up to a certain wage, and, particularly, I believe there should be some scheme of catering for those people in our towns and cities who have attained the age of 14.  We have in our country at the present moment a number of mansions or big houses with sufficient land attached to them, and if they were taken over by the State on a voluntary basis as a kind of continuation school, they would be a great help in the handling of this <Col N="1058" /> problem.  So many hours a day could be allotted for education, for recreation, and for physical exercise, and I believe that by cultivating the land attached these places could become almost self-supporting, while the parents might get an allowance for their absence.</P>
    <P>The cause of their being kept at home from school lies in the fact that their parents are looking forward to the few shillings a week they will bring into the house after they are 14 years of age.  If we do not do that, we may have certain consequences.  Anyone who lives in the cities knows the petty pilfering and the mischief that are carried on by young boys who have left school.  They are not anxious to take part in the vocational schools or other facilities open to them, because they feel that they are not part of the country at all, that they are nobody's children, and they have got out of their parents' control because their parents have allowed them to get out, in order to coax them along to earn a few shillings.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this motion goes far enough.  Senator Tierney said that he objected to Connacht bearing the burden of the expense of this scheme. The amount of labour employed by farmers in Connacht may be very small, but it is a national question, and we should not look on it from the provincial point of view.  It is not practicable to base it on cities and towns.  If there is going to be a scheme at all, the farmer must pay his contribution, the worker his, and the State must make its contribution, and it eventually boils down to the fact that it does not matter whether you burden the farmer with the full responsibility or not, because he, in his turn, will have to get compensated from the produce of his land, and whether it is the State or the farmer does not seem to make any difference in the end.</P>
    <P>We would get very much further on these motions if small committees of the House were set up, seeing that there are representatives of labour and farmers' interests here.  If the House appointed a small committee, before the discussion of a motion, to <Col N="1059" /> draft suggestions for the consideration of the House, I think you would get along much better, instead of putting down a motion, having a few days' discussion on it, and then hearing nothing more about it.  If this is a vocational body, and there are representatives of all interests concerned, I think that that suggestion, or something along similar lines, should be adopted. Useful work could be done by a small committee drafting suggestions as to what the House should recommend the Government to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Senators who submitted this motion for consideration.  I believe that we have had a helpful discussion, and that some good is bound to come from it.  I would be inclined, indeed, to give the proposal a good deal of my support.  Any little doubts I might have as to supporting it would arise from the fact that I see on the agenda another motion seeking a subsidy to prevent the decline of the dairying industry, and I suppose that if we all examined our books, we would find different branches of farming that will also require a subsidy to keep them alive.  For my part, I disagree with Senator Tierney and Senator Honan when they say that all poverty is in the west.  But I am inclined to agree with Senator O'Dwyer, when he states that there are ill-fed children in the homes of our neighbours.  It is common knowledge that there are ill-fed children, and sometimes in the homes of 100-acre farmers.  That prompts me to return to a suggestion I mentioned the first year I was here.  It is that we should go back to a system in each county, or in each parish, or in each province, which would be something on the lines of the old Land Commission court, where judicial rents would be fixed, and where the farmer was compelled to attend before three Land Commissioners to exhibit his income and his outgoings, and where the rent was fixed almost to 3d. in the £, having calculated the difficulties that confronted him in his transport, in his <Col N="1060" /> proximity to good markets, in his difficulties in regard to drainage and every thing else.</P>
      <P>If you examine the homes of the labourers in most of the counties I know, and if you examine the farms in the same counties, you will find on all of them very glaring evidence of the necessity of taking less money out of of the land, and, indeed, of the necessity of putting more into it.  I often wonder who it was made all our ditches, our drains and our rivers. Very few of them have been made in the past 50 years.  If it was not for the necessity of fire, some people would allow their ditches to meet across eight or ten-acre fields, and if you ask them why they will tell you that they have not the means to pay anybody to deal with them.  That is largely the case in many instances.</P>
      <P>It is impossible for many farmers to pay wages which would maintain a labourer's family properly.  Senator Tierney said that was a disgraceful situation and so it is.  It is a disgrace to us that about 20 years after the introduction of native government, we should find a situation as bad even as the discussion here to-night exhibits it. Where some of us are in a position to employ a good deal of machinery we can, and do, pay a better wage and it pays us to do so.  Where some of us can procure only essential manures or go down to Senator Honan's or Senator Hawkins' country for cattle with which to make manure, I am sure it will be agreed that Galway contributes a little to the welfare of Meath, Louth, Dublin, and the other counties around here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Broadly speaking, it is, in my opinion, correct, as Senator O'Dwyer said, that the motion, such as it is, will give a little fillip and a little hope to the labourer.  It will bring some measure of happiness to his door.  A bigger measure of happiness would be brought him if some committee of either House, or both Houses, could evolve a scheme to convert compulsory tillage from being a compulsory loss into something that the owner of the <Col N="1061" /> land, would not lose money on and might, indeed, make his living out of. One way our poor wages might be remedied, our ill-cleaned drains be attended to and in which rural Ireland might benefit materially would be by derating.  If all medical charities must come out of the rates and if millions must be collected from rural Ireland, to be spent in the hospitals chiefly in our towns, it is not too much to ask that the modest hope contained in this motion should be given the rural community, since the State has, so far, refused derating.  In the absence of derating, this proposal gives some little relief.  It may be a mendicant way of going about the business instead of making our rural life independent, such as other existences, many of which have been created by the State, commencing with all the branches of the Civil Service and not forgetting our fairly well paid university representatives.</P>
    <P>I think that the old remedies which, 40 years ago, gave some little measure of relief to the farmers in the Land Courts are often better than some of the modern remedies.  The first charge on the farm should be the farmer's own home and the home of his labourer, and he should not be compelled to pay his annuities or his rates if the maintenance of his own home and the maintenance of his labourer's home are not safe and secure.  Every penny that goes from the farmer in rates, annuities and taxes is earned on his farm by himself and his labourers.  The livelihood of these people should be the first charge.  It is the duty of the State to find out how much is to spare over and above that.  Then, let the farmers pay their rates and taxes, but not till then.  I support the motion. It is a palliative just as the other motion about a subsidy for dairying. It is a small matter and I am not inclined to haggle about it because, in my opinion, it is a case of urgent necessity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>Interesting as this debate has been, I think it has suffered a great deal because of the fact that most of the speakers have not <Col N="1062" /> been clear as to what case they were arguing.  Some of them were arguing that these allowances should be given to the families of agricultural labourers.  That is what is proposed in the motion.  However, many Senators argued in favour of family allowances in general.  I think the two cases should be kept entirely separate if we are to have any clear ideas on them.  I do not say that all the speakers erred in this respect. Some of them did not.  Some of them have attempted to distinguish the two cases.  It seems to me that the case for family allowances should be argued on its own claims.</P>
      <P>I can quite conceive that there is a strong case for family allowances. Senator Cummins, in seconding the motion, mentioned that systems of family allowances have been adopted in many highly intelligent Continental countries and in New Zealand.  Such a proposal would form a very useful subject of study for the members of this House.  I am in the position in which I think many other Senators are&mdash;that I have not given the general question very deep or wide consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a question that might very well be studied and discussed on some future occasion.  We must not think that, by the various fleeting references to it to-day, we have discussed the subject, nor should we think that we have properly come to the conclusion to which Senator Cummins wished to direct us&mdash;that family allowances should apply to all classes under a certain income.  Most of the discussion has centred around the proposal to confine the scheme to particular classes in the country.  Having listened to the different arguments and having had my sympathy excited by many of the statements made by Senators, I am not satisfied in my own mind that the case has been proved.  Senator O'Dwyer, who gave us a very interesting and clear speech, as he always does&mdash;if he will permit me to say so&mdash;was, I think, finally forced to the admission that the proposal to extend family allowances to one class of the community was contrary to general principles.  He <Col N="1063" /> excused that on the ground that this was but a very small instance.  Small instances are particularly dangerous in establishing new precedents.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House dreams for a moment that, if family allowances were granted to agricultural labourers, they could ever be withdrawn.  The thing is impossible.  It would create a riot, a very natural riot, throughout the country if we were to deprive these people of what they had come to regard as their natural right.  You might as well talk of shutting down national health insurance to-morrow as to talk of such a thing, once it is established. It is a matter of principle that wants very serious consideration, and it is a principle, if once accepted in the case of agricultural workers, that would have to be extended to other classes. There may be a good case for the whole thing.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to admit that, without going the whole hog.  But, once admitted in the case of one class, there would be no withstanding it in the case of any class who would be able to put up a case or to demand the establishment of family allowances in respect of them also.  Therefore, I think the House, before coming to a decision in favour of a resolution dealing with one class only, should satisfy its mind that the case for family allowances as a whole is a good case, and should be accepted.  Whether it might be, as a practical measure, advisable to adopt it in the case of one class or another class in the first instance would be a second step.  I cannot, as I say, see that the case for family allowances to this particular class has been established to what I consider a satisfactory degree.</P>
    <P>Those who spoke in favour of the resolution have, naturally, focussed their attention and their arguments on the particular needs of the agricultural labourers but, with the exception, perhaps, of Senator Cummins, they have not paid much attention to the needs of other classes of workers.  We have heard a great deal of truth&mdash;and a great deal of truth which was good <Col N="1064" /> for us to hear, very largely because much of it is unpleasant&mdash;with regard to the condition of agricultural labourers but nobody in the House has thought it proper to tell us much about the condition of the town labourers or town workers generally.  If one were to take the trouble to develop a case for town workers in general, as Senator O'Dwyer developed a case for the labourers of his county, I think one could put up just as strong a case, with very little research or very little consideration.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this question of family allowances must be decided in principle in the first instance and then the question of the classes to whom the allowances should go can be considered. Whether it should be simply decided by an income limit or by other considerations of a particular employment, I would not be prepared to suggest at the moment.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of criticism of some remarks that Senator Baxter made earlier in the evening when he used the term &ldquo;pauperisation&rdquo; of the agricultural labourers.  The term is crude, but I think it was a mistake to suggest that he was speaking disrespectfully of the agricultural labourers.  On the other hand, he was showing his respect for them by objecting to any system being adopted which would place them in a lower position as men of independence in the world. But, dropping &ldquo;pauperisation&rdquo; as it may be irritating, it seems to me the effect of such a system of endowment of any class of workers, agricultural labourers or otherwise, would tend to prevent any future rise of wages. Senator Counihan pointed out that it would have no effect on wages in the sense of lowering them.  I think that was the argument used.  I would agree that it is unlikely that the establishment of such a system would cause any immediate lowering of the rate of agricultural wages; but we must expect that, with the changing times, wages would rise, and I have not any doubt that the establishment of a system of partial support, of endowment, from this on, would certainly tend to make it much more difficult for agricultural <Col N="1065" /> labourers to get an increase in their wages, even if such an increase was badly needed in the near future.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  That, of course, is interesting and informative. I am obliged to my colleague for drawing my attention to it, but I do not know that, with our knowledge of what has happened in this country, we can be sure that what happens in New South Wales will be a ruling here.  I am rather surprised that, as far as I noticed&mdash;I may have missed it&mdash;none of the representatives of labour have adverted to that side of the question. It appears to me, at any rate, that you are likely to make wages rigid. That may be desirable, of course, but if it is desirable, it should be done candidly and knowingly, without being brought about more or less by accident. I am not suggesting that it is the design of Senator Counihan or his colleagues that that may take place.</P>
      <P>To sum up in two sentences my view on the whole matter of the general question as to the propriety or otherwise of family allowances: There is a great deal to be said in favour of it. I am not declaring myself opposed to family allowances.  I have not had an opportunity of studying the question. Few have.  Some Senators have, no doubt.  I think the general question should be decided first and, secondly, the question of what particular class or classes should be dealt with in that way.  For my own part, I would be sorry to see any distinction of class other than simply the distinction that would necessarily be brought about by the establishment of an income limit for the application of family allowances.</P>

      <P>I wish to say that, like most of the other speakers, I support the motion and I accept the principle of family allowances.  Having listened to the debate, I am inclined to think that some very extravagant statements were made.  I am afraid that some people will be disappointed if they <Col N="1066" /> expect some of the results that were suggested here.  I am by no means an optimist in this matter.  I do not believe that such a scheme would solve all our agricultural problems.  I believe that it would go a certain way towards the solution of those problems and that this motion, if put into force, would play a rather important part.</P>
      <P>On the question of the flight from the land, I do not believe the so called flight from the land can be prevented by legislation such as is suggested in this motion.  Rather am I inclined to think that this so called flight from the land is over stressed.  I do not believe that in recent years there has been, strictly speaking, any abnormal flight from the land.  As Senator Tierney and Senator Hawkins pointed out, over the centuries, members of the families of the small holders have had to leave the land.  They have had to leave home and seek employment elsewhere, with a neighbouring farmer or in an industry in a neighbouring town. That has always gone on and, I believe, will always go on.  I believe that, given a chance, the people would fly to the land.  I hold that people have been flying not from the land, but from the bogs and mountains.  They have been flying from the districts where they were unable to support themselves. As Senator Hawkins pointed out, anywhere that land was available, the people have flocked back to the land and availed themselves of any opportunity to reinstate themselves on what they considered economic holdings. Senator Tierney is usually pretty sound when he comes to discuss a motion of this kind, and I am sorry to say that I am afraid he departed from his usual form to-night.</P>

      <P>Even if Senator Tierney was not where he is now, it is not his usual custom to interrupt.  I am sorry the same cannot be said for other members of his Party.  I do not <Col N="1067" /> agree with Senator Tierney in his theory that the people of Connacht should not be asked to contribute their share to any such scheme as this. According to Senator Tierney, there is no such thing as an agricultural worker there, strictly speaking; it is an area of small farmers and the agricultural worker there is the small farmer's son.  He suggests that if the scheme were to be implemented, it should be done on a county basis.  I think it is a reasonable suggestion that if you were to take the Counties of Limerick, Tipperary, or other counties referred to by Senator Tierney, you could also say that there is a certain portion of these counties in which there is no such problem as the problem of the agricultural labourer. Therefore, you would have to divide the counties, and if anybody was to give the thing serious thought at all, it must be done on a national basis and not on a county basis.  I would like to refer to a statement made by Senator O'Dwyer.  I do not think that Senator O'Dwyer ever intended that it should go out from this House that the farmers of the country would actually allow their workers to bring up the children on dry bread and black tea up to the age of 14.  We are well aware that there are black sheep in every flock, and that there, possibly, are isolated cases where farmers will stand over that sort of policy; but to say that it is done on anything like general lines, I do not believe for a moment.  I do not believe it is done in any county in Ireland and, I think, as a representative of the agricultural community, that I should voice my complete disagreement with Senator O'Dwyer on that statement.  I believe that if such were the case, the man who would tolerate any such treatment of his workers should be denounced publicly.  With regard to Senator McGee's contribution, and his suggestion that an alternative would be derating, that thing has been discussed high up and low down, and most people are convinced that any policy of flat derating would merely benefit 8 per cent. of the people at the expense of 92 per cent. of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Like every other Senator who spoke I am in sympathy with the idea of the movers of this very beneficial proposal and I hope that it will accomplish something. The subject should be judged entirely on its merits, and no irrelevant issues should be brought in.  On the merits it deserves the fullest cooperation of everyone in this House. When I say that it should be judged on the merits alone, I mean that irrelevant issues like the flight from the land should not be brought into it. That is a thing that will continue irrespective of and altogether apart from our economic ills.  When we talk of the flight from the land, whether it be the flight of the labourer, farmer or industrial labourer, we must remember that there is in the heart of every Irishman a sort of lure for adventure&mdash;the idea of over the hills and far away.  Big wages in other countries may have something to do with it, but even after that, the Irishman and the young man of every country will emigrate to other places, not necessarily for a better living, but in the spirit of adventure.  I do not think, therefore, that any amount of family allowances, no matter on what scale they are given, will help to stem the flight from the land.  It was always there, and it always will be there, and the sooner we recognise it the better it will be for us in our debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was stirred by what Senator Hawkins said about the people remaining at home.  It is an evil&mdash;if you may call it an evil&mdash;that there seems to be no means of combating.  These things have their ebb and flow, and we must look on them as inevitable. That is not a gospel of pessimism, but we must look at it from the point of view of reality.  I was told on unimpeachable authority of a case on which a drama might be made, of three brothers and two sisters living at home on a farm exceedingly well off, and living on perfect terms with each other.  They were three old bachelors and two old aunts, and when the daughter of another brother became an orphan they brought this girl home and she was looked upon <Col N="1069" /> as the sole legatee, which indeed she turned out to be.  They lived so long, however, that by the time she had them buried and waked she was completely broken out of house and home &mdash;a rather ironic situation, but one that could easily happen.</P>
    <P>While this system of family allowances is eminently suitable, and should be adopted, the question is where are the funds to come from?  I dislike the idea of State help, yet eventually it must be furnished by the State, and while we are talking generalities, when we get down to brass tacks it will take the best intellects of this or any other House to cope with this situation. Wages, while getting better, no doubt, are still unable to cope with the position of the agricultural labourer&mdash; certainly not where married labourers are concerned.  The unmarried labourer is to a certain extent able to support himself but the married labourer is a problem to be reckoned with.  Unquestionably, married labourers are entitled to family allowances and entitled to them on a higher concept than that of their means.  As has been pointed out several times by distinguished educationists, if the principles of the late Pope Pius in his great encyclical, as adumbrated by him, were carried out to the full&mdash;that in other words we practised Christianity in the proper sense of the word&mdash;these problems would resolve themselves.</P>
    <P>State subsidies may be necessary but they are terrible evils.  All these grants of late years tend to pauperise our people, and the old spirit of independence is gone.  The question now is, whether is there a grant going and how one can take advantage of it?  You have the old example of a minor relief scheme.  Take a lane on which seven or eight families lived 50 years ago when these families each contributed a cart load of stones in the year, and made the lane passable.  Now a grant for a minor relief scheme is invoked, and most people do not seem to realise that it is a system of feeding a dog with his own tail.  I think somewhere, someone, as Fintan Lalor said, will have to make a beginning.  While the town worker must be considered as <Col N="1070" /> equally deserving of remuneration, the fact remains that he has compensations that his country brother has not got, such as unemployment money, the Saint Vincent de Paul Society, and other things.</P>
    <P>I do not say that they are at all adequate to his needs, but they are a solatium to which the rural labourer has no recourse.  On the other hand, the rural labourer has his cottage plot and formerly had many other perquisites. It is rather ironical to think that trade unionism, a very desirable thing and a thing that was bound to come, is partly responsible for the difficulties from which the agricultural labourer suffers at present.  In the olden days when there were no unions &mdash;and I say again they had to come and they were a necessity&mdash;the labourer and his employer got on pretty well together.  There may have been slave drivers here and there but, after all, they were the product of their times and in the old days the agricultural labourer enjoyed what were popularly known as perquisites.  Wages were not high but the labourer was allowed a few drills of potatoes, he had free milk, sometimes the grass of a cow and the grass of an ass.  One can visualise the state of things which existed when the trade unions began to operate. One can imagine the farmer saying to himself when the Agricultural Wages Act was passing&mdash;incidentally it ameliorated the labourer's lot although some Senators on the opposite benches might not think so&mdash;one can imagine the average farmer saying: &ldquo;Well I shall give him the money to which he is entitled but I shall reduce his perquisites.&rdquo; Labourers themselves have complained to me rather ironically if sadly: &ldquo;What good are the wages that I am enjoying now?  I would rather have less money with my old conditions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a moot point whether the Agricultural Wages Board did as much good as is sometimes suggested.  I have heard farmers say that they would rather go back to the old state of barter which prevailed 20 years ago.  I can understand their outlook.</P>
    <P>Very often, married labourers especially, <Col N="1071" /> got a greater return from their labours in the old days but after all that is no reason why these amelioractive measures should not be brought forward.  Incidentally, I want to object to the term &ldquo;labourer&rdquo; in connection with the land.  I think that fine old phrase &ldquo;Muintir na Tíre&rdquo; should be applied to all people who live on the land.  In Ireland there should be no such class distinction as farmers and farm labourers.  These divisions have become more accentuated of late years.  This question of standing for one's rights, as adumbrated in our laws and the introduction of trade unionism is responsible for it.  What, after all, is an agricultural labourer but the son of a small farmer; some of them the sons of the 40/- freeholders who were dispossessed years ago.  If there were some system by which the wages of married labourers could be supplemented, a system of marriage allowances, it would be very helpful, but it will take some thinking out before it can be put into operation.  We are all in agreement as to the principle and I hope that something will come out of this discussion and that some scheme will be put into operation that will give effect to the theories <Col N="1072" /> which have been so ably propounded here to-day.</P>
