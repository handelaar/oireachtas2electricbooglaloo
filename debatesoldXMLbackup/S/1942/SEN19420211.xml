    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>The definition of the expression &ldquo;member of the staff&rdquo; contained in sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Principal Act is hereby repealed and in lieu thereof it is hereby enacted that the said expression, where it occurs in the Principal Act or this Act, shall mean&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b)  when used in relation to a shop, which is a refreshment house, any person who (whether he does or does not receive wages for his services) works for the proprietor of such shop and whose work for such proprietor is in connection with the business carried on in such shop and is wholly or mainly performed within or in the precincts of such shop, and is not industrial work or wholly or mainly clerical work or work connected with the management of such shop.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In paragraph (b), page 2, line 39, <Col N="462" /> to delete the words &ldquo;or wholly or mainly clerical work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an effort to bring clerical workers within the scope of the Bill. I do not know if there is any real justification for not doing so, but I should like to hear the Minister on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to include clerical workers in the scope of the Bill. When the original Act was framed, it was decided that clerical workers should not be subjected to the same regulations concerning hours of work and other conditions of employment as shop assistants in the ordinary sense.  Similarly, when the Conditions of Employment Act, relating to industry, was framed, clerical workers employed in connection with industries were not included within the scope of the Act.  It was contemplated at the time that the conditions of employment of clerical workers would be considered separately, and, if it appeared that legislation in relation to them was required, that a separate Act should be passed in order to give them whatever protection was necessary.</P>
      <P>I could not agree to accept the amendment.  I do not say that there is not a case for consideration in connection with clerical workers, whether employed in shops or industry, but I cannot accept the amendment, because I have not examined whether the circumstances are such that clerical workers employed in shops should be subjected to the same conditions as other shop workers.  It may be that the conditions of employment, in the case of many classes of them, at any rate, are such that they could not fairly be subjected to the same conditions as shop assistants, and I think we should maintain the original intention of confining the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act to shop workers proper, leaving the question of the regulation of hours of work and conditions of employment of clerical workers to be considered separately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to press the amendment, but I take it that the <Col N="463" /> Bill lays down the conditions under which workers may be employed, and the inclusion of clerical workers would in no way worsen those conditions. There are a number of clerical workers who are partly shop assistants, and it is in order to ensure that these people will get the benefit of the Bill that the amendment is put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that there is no worsening of the conditions of employment of these workers.  They were not covered by the original Act, nor will they be covered by this amending Bill.  In any case the Senator's amendment would, if passed, merely affect one class of clerical workers&mdash;those employed in connection with restaurants&mdash;and not clerical workers generally.  If there is a case for legislation of this kind in regard to clerical workers, it should, I think, apply to them generally, and not merely to one section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What I said on the other amendment applies also to this one.  This represents an effort to secure reasonable hours for breadvan drivers.  They are not similar to any other class of van-drivers <Col N="464" /> in the State.  They are very closely associated with shop-work.  We are all aware that a case relating to their conditions of employment was before the courts recently.  The associations catering for them went to very considerable expense to try to establish their rights under the original Act.  Now, that that Act is being amended by this Bill, there is a case for bringing these breadvan drivers in under it.  I do not think there is any real argument for excluding them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to put them out.  This Bill was originally introduced when a decision of the Circuit Court appeared to imply that breadvan drivers were, in fact, covered by the original Act. The situation which arose then, in relation to that particular trade, was such that it was decided forthwith to introduce amending legislation to make clear the intention of the original Act, which was to exclude breadvan drivers from its scope.  Subsequently, there was a decision, on appeal, by the Supreme Court which altered the circumstances somewhat in so far as it made it clear that breadvan drivers, in ordinary circumstances, would not be covered by the terms of the original Act, but might be covered in certain circumstances.  The purpose of the amending Bill is to make it clear that breadvan drivers will not be covered, because I think it is evident that you cannot regulate the hours of work of breadvan drivers in the same way that you can regulate the hours of work of shop assistants employed in an ordinary shop.  The circumstances that had arisen, following the decision of the Circuit Court, were such that not merely would all the breadvan drivers in the country be entitled to recover very substantial sums in the way of overtime payments, sums amounting to well over £30,000, if the terms of the original Act were rigidly applied, but it seemed likely that breadvan drivers would not, in fact, be employed at all. I doubt very much if it is in the interests of breadvan drivers that this measure should apply to them. Because of the nature of their business it is, I think, true to say that it would <Col N="465" /> be impossible to organise it on the basis of an 8-hour day or a 48-hour week, and if any attempt were made to organise it on that basis then, I think, the practice of selling bread from vans by breadvan drivers would disappear throughout a very large part of the country because of the increased cost. If the cost of bread deliveries were to be substantially increased, the effect would be bad both for the bakery trade generally and for the public.</P>
      <P>So far as breadvan drivers are concerned, they are in much the same position as other transport workers. They are away from their base with vehicles and have to bring their vehicles back to their base whether limited to the 8-hour day or the 48 hours a week in the original Act or not.  Consequently, whatever arrangements may subsequently have to be considered to regulate the conditions of employment and the hours of work of persons engaged in connection with vehicles and transport operations, you clearly cannot apply the same rigid principles in their case as are possible in the case of persons employed in factories or shops.  I could not agree to accept the amendment, nor do I think it is in the interests of breadvan drivers themselves that the amendment should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would, but the Minister thinks otherwise.  Breadvan drivers are very anxious that their conditions of employment should be brought into conformity with the ordinary run of things.  I would like to know from the Minister if all travelling shops are excluded from the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The difficulty that arose was due to the fact that, in order to make it clear that the original Act applied to travelling shops, an amendment was inserted during the progress of the Bill through the Oireachtas.  That amendment was intended to ensure that travelling shops would be covered, but not breadvan drivers.  It was that particular section of the Act which was subsequently <Col N="466" /> interpreted by the court to mean that breadvan drivers were covered.  The drafting difficulty that arose in connection with the Bill arose out of the fact that it was intended to catch the travelling shops while excluding certain types of vehicles used in connection with trade, such as breadvans, ice-cream vans and the like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's statement, I am of the opinion that breadvan drivers are being very harshly treated under the Bill since we are now told that travelling shops generally come within its terms. Because of the nature of his business, I would think that a breadvan driver, going through the country with his van, is undoubtedly a travelling shop.  Yet the breadvan driver is excluded from the terms of the Bill. Surely there is very little difference between the travelling shop and the ordinary breadvan from which bread is sold from door to door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator misunderstands the position.  The reason why it was decided to apply the Act to travelling shops was to ensure that the conditions of employment of persons engaged in connection with these travelling shops would be the same as for shop assistants, and thus prevent unfair competition on the part of the travelling shops against the normal type of shopkeeper.  In the case of breadvan drivers the circumstances are different.  The breadvan, as a rule, operates from a shop, partly on a cash on delivery basis.  Quite clearly, if we were to apply the same principles to persons employed in connection with breadvans as are applied in the case of persons employed in shops, then the work of the distribution of bread by means of vans must be organised upon the basis of a 48-hour week or an 8-hour day.  If the van is not back in the stables before the expiration of the 8-hour day what happens? Is the breadvan driver to leave it on the side of the road and go home, or is he to do what, in fact, was done, to carry on on the same basis as previously, and then claim overtime for the excess hours worked?  That would <Col N="467" /> increase the cost of delivering bread by breadvans.  The claim which the breadvan drivers could have made against the bakers of this country, if the original decision of the courts had been upheld, would have amounted to well over £30,000 in respect of overtime payments.</P>
      <P>It seems to me obvious that if the cost of selling bread by means of breadvans is going to be increased by that amount, then either the process itself will have to be reorganised or stopped, or else the cost of delivering bread by breadvans will have so increased that people will not avail of the service.  It seems to me that we must deal with breadvan drivers, if we are to deal with them at all, under some principles that subsequently may be considered practicable to apply to other persons employed in transport work&mdash;delivery vans engaged in connection with shops, transport workers in connection with factories or transport workers generally.  While it may be possible to devise rules which will regulate their hours and conditions of employment, they obviously cannot be as rigid as those which are practicable in the case of shops or factories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I still think there is a definite discrimination here against the breadvan drivers.  Other travelling shops come within the terms of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>These breadvan drivers have to work abnormal hours.  They are out late at night.  Would the Minister say if there is any hope that, under this or some other Bill, it is intended to give them some relief?  At present they appear to be nobody's child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated at the time that it was intended that this series of legislation would be continued to cover transport workers, although I saw a difficulty in devising the principles <Col N="468" /> in relation to which legislation applying to transport workers would be framed.  If it is found possible to extend this type of legislation to cover persons engaged on transport operations, whether transport for hire or of the ordinary kind or concerned with the delivery of goods from shops, then clearly the position of breadvan drivers could be reconsidered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  The provisions of the Principal Act shall be deemed never to have extended to any vehicle from which there was carried on the retail trade of selling ice-cream, if and so long as the retail trade of selling ice-cream was the only or main trade carried on from such vehicle, and Section 3 of the Principal Act shall be deemed always to have had effect accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with the position of ice-cream vendors. The judgment of the Supreme Court, to which I have referred, held that if a retail trade is carried from a vehicle or from the immediate vicinity of a vehicle, the employee must be deemed to be a member of the staff of the vehicle, which itself is deemed to be a shop.  He must, accordingly, be regarded as coming within the scope of the Act.  Ice-cream vendors carry on their trade from the vehicle or its vicinity and they are, therefore, brought within the scope of the Act.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of this Bill excludes ice-cream vendors as from the date upon which it becomes law.  The amendment will exclude them retrospectively from the provisions of the Principal Act, which was passed in May, 1938. It was not intended that ice-cream vendors should come within the scope of the Principal Act, but the judgment of the Supreme Court seems to suggest that, unless we adopt this provision, most ice-cream vendors, if not all, will have to be held as being within the scope of the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Breadvan drivers get a commission on all the loaves they sell.  Do ice-cream vendors get any commission from, let us say, a certain proportion of ice-cream?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say.  The point was whether a person employed in connection with a travelling shop of that kind came within the scope of the Act and, as between an ice-cream van and a breadvan, the difference is that the ice-cream vendor sells the ice-cream at, or in the vicinity of, the van whereas the breadvan driver knocks at the doors of the houses.  The judgment of the court was that, because the breadvan driver went to the door, he was not selling bread in the vicinity of the van, whereas the ice-cream vendor was.  It was not a clear judgment that these people were within or without the scope of the Act; the judgment was that, if the sale was in the van or in the vicinity of the van, then the person came within the scope of the Act.  If the sale took place some distance away, then the person was outside the scope of the Act.  We have excluded ice-cream vendors from the scope of the Bill and the purpose of the amendment is to exclude them retrospectively from the date of the Principal Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how you can call a breadvan a travelling shop except by reason of the fact that the driver would be getting a commission on everything he sold.  I remember some years ago, when your Department was arranging the price of bread, there was a definite price for sale over the counter and a definite price for bread delivered.  Was it a halfpenny or a farthing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A farthing per loaf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That would mean that many poor people taking, let us say, half a dozen loaves at the door would pay 1½d. for delivery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No. There were three prices, one for sale at the bakers, one for the retail shop, and one for bread delivered, which represented an increase <Col N="470" /> of a halfpenny on the 4lb. loaf. It is not true that the breadvan driver gets 1½d. for delivering six loaves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We never intended that the Principal Act should apply to this class of workers.  It was really impracticable to apply it.  It now appears from the judgment of the court that the Principal Act should be held to apply and, consequently, every worker on a van might have a claim in respect of overtime for hours in excess of 48 in the week.  As it was never intended that the Act should apply to them, we think it desirable to amend it in that respect and to make clear that that type of claim should not arise.</P>

    <P>We think that the areas covered in the amendment should come within the terms of the Bill.  We see no reason <Col N="471" /> why the amendment should exclude the workers in those areas.  We should like to hear the Minister's view on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was introducing this Bill on Second Reading in the Dáil and the Seanad, I expressed the opinion that it was a mistake ever to have attempted to deal with the conditions of employment of hotel workers in a Shops Act.  I came to that conclusion before the original Shops Act had passed through the Oireachtas. In the course of the discussions, on the Committee Stage in the Dáil and here, it became obvious that so many difficulties were going to arise out of an attempt to apply the same conditions of employment to hotel workers as were proposed to be applied to shop workers, that we should never have begun the process.  I intended, when introducing this Bill, to repair that mistake by taking hotel workers altogether out of the Act.</P>
      <P>The experience of the years during which the Act has been in operation has shown that the great majority of hotel employers could not obey the Act, that it was literally impossible for them to do so, and inspectors of the Department reported frequently that the Act could not be enforced because the circumstances of employment in many classes of hotels were such that the conditions required by the Act could not be met by hotel proprietors. That general argument is still true, but it was pointed out to me by representatives of workers and in the Dáil that the general argument did not apply with all its force in the City of Dublin and, on that account, I agreed to amend the legislation in the Dáil by retaining the hotel workers in the City of Dublin within the scope of the Principal Act, but only the hotel workers in the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin City there are special circumstances. Most of the trade done by hotels in the city is steady, all the year round trade.  The conditions of employment in Dublin City have been arranged by agreement with the unions catering for the hotel workers <Col N="472" /> on much the same lines as were contemplated in the original Act.  The difficulty that has arisen in most parts of the country arose mainly out of the fact that there was not available a pool of workers on which hotel proprietors could draw when they required additional staffs in order to conform to the terms of the Act, giving the hours of work and the periods of rest which the original Act contemplated.  These conditions do exist in the City of Dublin.  It is possible in Dublin for the employers to conform to the Act.</P>
    <P>The same conditions that apply in Dublin do not apply elsewhere and, while I would have preferred that we would have tackled this problem of hotels&mdash;and I agree that there is need to tackle it&mdash;in a separate measure, I was willing to accept a proposal that, for the time being, at any rate, the position in respect to Dublin should be left unchanged.</P>
    <P>I do not think, however, it can be argued that the conditions that exist in Dublin are reproduced in Cork, Limerick or Waterford.  The mere fact that these are county boroughs does not mean that the conditions are the same as in Dublin, and, in fact, in these centres not merely have difficulties been experienced in enforcing the Act, but I think the trade union organisers, who had secured similar conditions to those contemplated by the Act for Dublin, had failed entirely to get them observed in these centres, because of the comparative scarcity of trained hotel workers and other difficulties. In Dublin, as everybody knows, there is a sort of floating staff of trained waiters and other hotel workers who are more or less in constant employment in connection with public dinners and social functions of one kind or another, who are given employment in hotels as required, particularly because the provisions of the Act require the enforcement of terms of leave for their employees and so on, and because of the existence of that pool of skilled workers, on which the proprietors can draw, it has been possible for them to conform to the Act in Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> Similar circumstances do not exist in other centres and, consequently, the difficulties in enforcing the Act there were considerable.  I would ask the Senator not to press this amendment because I think it would be impossible to apply the principles of the original Act in these other centres.  I do not think they have been applied and, in fact, I think there has been evasion of the terms of the Act in these other centres.  In my opinion, it is altogether undesirable that we should have a situation of having an Act upon the Statute Book requiring certain conditions of employment and hours of work which everybody knows cannot be obeyed and which, in fact, are not obeyed.  Everybody will agree that there are circumstances associated with hotel employment in this country which require to be rectified by legislation, and I think that at some stage we should tackle the job of trying to devise legislation which will fit the varying conditions of hotels catering for different types of clients and in different parts of the country.  I think that we could do it and that we should do it, although it will have to be an Act to provide for all the various types of hotels that exist, such as the city hotel which caters for clients all the year around, the hotel in the smaller urban centres whose main business is associated with commercial travellers and such people, and the hotel in the rural districts whose trade is only seasonal and carried on during the summer months.  The conditions which must apply to these hotels, obviously, will vary according to the nature of the trade done, and I think we can consider that separately in a separate Act relating to hotel employees, as I think we should have done in the very beginning.  The initial mistake was to attempt to deal with hotel workers in a Shops Bill. That has been rectified, but I agreed to leave Dublin unchanged until we got special legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has admitted candidly that because hotel staffs in Dublin are organised and have arranged their working conditions he could not see his way to alter them. <Col N="474" /> I want to tell the Minister and the House generally that prior to the organising of the hotel workers their conditions were appalling and their hours were unlimited.  That is the position that you are allowing to continue in Cork, Limerick and Waterford by your action in this Bill.  You bring no relief whatever to the Dublin hotel workers.  Now, as the Minister says, Dublin is the centre from which most hotel staffs are organised.  These men are accustomed to having certain settled conditions in Dublin, and they may go down to Cork and have to endure unlimited hours and appalling conditions, and yet there is no relief for them under this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that at some stage an effort will be made to standardise the conditions of hotel workers.  Will he be more specific on that, and say when it is his intention to introduce legislation giving relief to hotel staffs? He is very simple if he believes in his own argument that because of the difficulty of carrying on the trade the hours cannot be reduced.  Now, I am a long time trying to bring about an amelioration in working conditions, and I never met any set of employers who did not put up that argument: that trade would not permit it, that it would be impossible to make these adjustments, and so on, but when pressure was brought on them they found a way to do it.  If the Minister would take a bold step he certainly would bring the people owning those hotels to realise that their employees ought to have reasonable working hours the same as any other workers in the country.</P>

    <P>I think the Minister should seriously consider bringing in legislation to give relief to people engaged in hotels. The leaving out of Cork, Limerick and Waterford is a very serious blot on the Bill because these people have to endure almost impossible working conditions, and if the matter is left to the employers it will never be improved. The only hope of improvement is to have it done by legislation, and I certainly would urge the Minister to set about the matter at the very earliest opportunity.  It is not my intention to press the amendment, but <Col N="475" /> having brought the matter to the notice of the Minister I sincerely hope he will give it the attention it requires because the conditions are very bad.  These people, as I say, are unorganised and entirely at the mercy of the employers who will not bother their heads to alter the conditions of employment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 23 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the addition of a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  The Minister may, whenever and so often as he thinks fit, by order under this sub-section amend in respect of hotels the provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter which I mentioned on the Second Stage, and I do not know if the Minister has changed his view on it yet.  The argument for this amendment might furnish an argument against the last amendment because it is alleged that even in Dublin it is difficult for the proprietors of hotels to carry out a particular section, Section 23 of the Principal Act, which provides that the proprietor of every establishment shall specify in a notice, which shall be in the prescribed form, the daily hours to be worked by each member of the staff and the intervals for rest and meals to be allowed to each member of the staff.  I am told that this is a provision which is very difficult to carry out&mdash;that is, the actual putting up of the notice&mdash;that in fact, as between the trade unions and the employers the thing works itself out, but the difficulty is found in actually providing a schedule to meet the requirements of the Principal Act.  It is suggested, therefore, that the Minister should take power, after he has <Col N="476" /> had more experience of how the Act works in Dublin, to amend, by Order under this sub-section, in respect of hotels, the provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 23 of the Principal Act.  It is not a matter of change of conditions of employment so much as a matter of more elasticity with regard to the publication of how things are going to go.  It is suggested that when the Minister had experience he might easily find a better scheme which would be agreed to by the hotel proprietors and by the trade unions and which would be an improvement on the present one.  This kind of amendment that I am proposing is, of course, common form.  There are a great many such sections giving the Minister power to make regulations, and I am merely putting it to the Minister that it is a difficult thing which might be overcome in this way better than any other.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the amendment.  In fact I will go so far as to say that it is probably better that the amendment should be adopted.  The original suggestion of the proprietors was that they should be exempted altogether from this obligation to display an hours of work notice.  I could not agree to that because, clearly, the enforcement of the Act by the Department's inspectors involves some arrangement under which the inspector could find out what hours the various members of the staff should be at work, and clearly the members of the staff themselves were entitled to know when they were required on their employer's business. But it may be that the existing section of the Principal Act is somewhat rigid. In any event, I see no harm in having the power to modify it if a good case for modification can be made and, therefore, I have no objection whatever to the amendment.</P>

      <P>There were a number of amendments moved in the Dáil relating to the conditions of employment in restaurants.  The amendments were, I think, sponsored by the Restaurant Proprietors' Association and had previously been discussed between officers of my Department, representatives of the association, and representatives of the union and I found that there was not any very great objection to their adoption.  In order, however, to secure an expeditious passage of the Bill through the Dáil I agreed to introduce amendments in the Seanad to achieve the same results but prepared by the Parliamentary draftsman, because the amendments which were moved in the Dáil were not properly framed.  This is one of those amendments.  The purpose of them is as follows: The Principal Act, in so far as the staffs of refreshment houses are concerned, requires that they should be released for their weekly half-holiday at 3 p.m. or at the expiration of the fifth hour after the time of commencing work, whichever is the earlier.  It has been contended that when the luncheon interval for the staffs is taken out of the five hours of employment on the morning of the half-holiday there is not sufficient time for the staff to complete the essential morning's work in connection <Col N="478" /> with the preparation and serving of dinners before they leave for their half-day.  The amendment provides that the staffs of refreshment houses will be released for their weekly half-holiday at 3 p.m., or on the completion of five hours' work, whichever is the earlier.  That change will get over the difficulty which proprietors of refreshment houses have experienced, and I understand that no objection to the change has been advanced on behalf of the workers concerned.</P>

This amendment provides that, on the morning of the weekly half-holiday, the five hours of work to be performed by the staff shall not be divided into more than two spells and that the interval between such spells shall not exceed more than one hour in duration. The amendment is designed to safeguard the staff of refreshment houses from an unduly long &ldquo;spread over&rdquo; of the work and ensures that the total period of employment on the morning of the weekly half-holiday shall not continue for longer than six hours.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to meet two amendments proposed in the Dáil on behalf of the catering trade and deals with compensatory holidays to the staffs of refreshment houses in lieu of work performed on Sundays.  The amendment removes such staffs from Section 35 of the Principal Act, which provides that if they work on a Sunday for more than two hours, but not more than four hours, a half-holiday must be given, while if they work more than four hours a whole holiday must be given in the following week.  The amendment provides that for such staffs the two hours may be increased to three hours, <Col N="481" /> provided that these hours are worked by 12 noon and that the four hours may be increased to five hours.  If the amendment is accepted, it will mean that an employee of a refreshment house who works up to three hours on a Sunday morning before 12 noon will be entitled to no holiday in lieu; if he works for more than three hours and up to five hours, or if he works three hours or less and this carries him on later than 12 noon, he will be entitled to a half-holiday; while if he works for more than five hours he will be entitled to a whole holiday.</P>

    <P>(b)  is allowed on that day, for the purpose of partaking of dinner, an interval of not less than forty-five minutes, so arranged as either to end not earlier than 11.45 a.m. or to commence not later than 3 p.m., <Col N="482" /> the provisions of paragraph (1) of Rule 2 of the Second Schedule to the Principal Act shall be deemed to have been complied with in respect of that person on that day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Rule 2 of the Second Schedule to the Principal Act provides that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...where the hours of work include the hours from 11.30 a.m. to 2.30 p.m., an interval of not less than one hour shall be allowed for dinner, and such interval shall commence between those hours.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The rule provides that it shall be deemed to be complied with where</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...a person employed as a member of the staff of a refreshment house or licensed premises is allowed in any day an interval of not less than one hour, so arranged as either to end not earlier than 11.30 a.m. or to commence not later than 2.30 p.m.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes that in the case of staffs of refreshment houses who are provided with dinner on the premises, the minimum dinner interval of one hour shall be reduced to 45 minutes, and that the outside hours for commencing the dinner interval shall be changed from 10.30 a.m. to 11 a.m. and from 2.30 p.m. to 3 p.m. This reduction in the dinner interval will not create any hardship where the meals are taken on the premises, since 45 minutes under such conditions is a better arrangement than an hour would be in the case of staffs who have to travel to their homes for lunch or to dine in an external premises.  Owing to the pressure of work in refreshment houses between 12.30 and 3 p.m., it is essential that all available staffs should be on duty between those hours, and in these circumstances it is difficult to arrange for so long an interval as one hour for lunch, and I am of opinion that this concession should be granted in this industry.  I gather from reports of conversations with representatives of the workers concerned that they have no objection to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The deletion of this paragraph would not improve the Bill.  In order that Senator Baxter and other members of the House may appreciate the position more clearly, I shall have to refer to some of the earlier sections. Under Section 4 (1),</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever a sanitary authority have made a proposal, they shall do the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) take all reasonable steps to ascertain the persons (if any) to whom damage may be caused...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section goes on to provide that having taken such steps to satisfy themselves as to the persons to whom damage may be caused, the names of such persons shall be recorded in the book of reference.  Under Section 6 (1) any person whose name appears in the book of reference may make an objection to the proposal.  Section 8 provides that if an objection has been made to a proposal and the objection <Col N="485" /> is not withdrawn, the local authority may apply to the Minister for a provisional order.  Under Section 9, the Minister may refuse such an application for a provisional order or make a provisional order in accordance with such application or alter the proposal which is the subject of such application. It will be seen that, if an objection is pursued under Section 6 (1) by a person whose name appears in the book of reference and an application is made by the local authority for a provisional order under the Bill, the Minister may amend the proposal and the effect of that amendment may be to remove any cause of grievance that a person whose name has already appeared in the book of reference may have, so that, in fact, while a person might be aggrieved at the time the book of reference was compiled, the cause of grievance might be removed by the Minister or by negotiation between the local authority and the aggrieved party before the provisional order was made.  An alternative supply of water might, for example, have been provided.  In that way, the person whose name appears in the book of reference might have no cause of grievance when the question of compensation would come before the arbitrator.  In the light of these facts, the local authority is entitled to contend that the fact that the name was originally put in the book of reference as that of a person to whom damage might be caused does not, in itself, establish that compensation for damage is payable.  In the light of these circumstances, I think the Senator will scarcely press the amendment.</P>

      <P>In line 41, page 8, after the word &ldquo;annum&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or such other rate of interest as the Government may by order from time to time determine&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the amount of interest payable in respect of compensation.  The amount involved may be very small but the question of interest is an absorbing and difficult one.  I know that it has been the practice to insert the amount of interest which is to be payable in cases of this kind but I question the wisdom of our putting in a section determining that the rate of interest will be 4 per cent. per annum in all circumstances.  I may seem to be arguing, in this case, against the interests of the farmers, but the fact is that the owners of land are getting so little under the Bill that I am not prepared to commit myself to a rate of interest of 4 per cent. It is, I think, inadvisable to insert in legislation, which may remain the law of the land for a long time, a provision whereby we must pay interest at the rate of 4 per cent.  My amendment suggests that the rate of interest shall be such as the Government may, by order, from time to time determine.  I think that would be more reasonable.  In this case, at any rate, a certain amount of liberty and discretion should be left to the Minister to regulate the rate of interest in accordance with the value of money at the particular time. I think the principle in the Bill is unsound and it is not one to which I am prepared to subscribe.  I do not know whether anybody else holds my view in this matter, but I put down the amendment because I think the matter should not be permitted to pass unchallenged.</P>

      <P>I hope Senator Baxter will not insist on this amendment because, if it is inserted, I foresee a good deal of difficulty and embarrassment in the administration of the section.  The section provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of the next sub-section of this section a sanitary authority shall pay to every person to whom compensation is payable under this Act interest on the amount (when determined) of such compensation at the rate of £4 per cent. per annum.</P>
      <P>If Senator Baxter's amendment is accepted the following words will be added:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or such other rate of interest as the Government may by order from time to time determine.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While undoubtedly conditions may change&mdash;the value of money has changed, and the rate of interest obtainable on public loans has varied very often within the past 20 years&mdash;on the whole a 4 per cent. rate of interest is a fairly average figure.  If we insert the amendment that the rate of interest shall be such as the Government shall from time to time determine, it will mean that when there is a large scheme in contemplation, or in process of being put into operation, and when the amount of interest would be perhaps a serious consideration either to the sanitary authority on the one hand or to the person whose rights would be at stake on the other, the sanitary authority will exercise all the pressure it possibly can on the Minister to keep down the rate of interest, while the person concerned will exercise all possible influence on the Minister to keep up the rate of interest. If the Minister sides with the individual who has obtained compensation, it will be open to people to make very unhappy suggestions.  If he happens to be a person friendly disposed towards the Government or towards the Minister it may be said that he got a higher rate of interest because he supported the Government in the last election.  If on the other hand the Minister fixes a low rate of interest, I suppose it will be said that <Col N="488" /> he was getting his own back on somebody to whom he was not friendly disposed.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, it is not really, as Senator Baxter admits, a very big issue because the amount of money ordinarily involved in this matter will not be very large, but it seems to me that the arbitrator will have a clearer field with a fixed rate of interest than if the interest is liable to fluctuate from time to time or has to be determined from time to time by the Minister. When the arbitrator is fixing the amount of the award, he will be conscious at least of the fact that that award for a certain period will carry with it a certain amount of interest. He will have a clearer field for reaching a firm figure if the rate of interest is fixed in the Bill.  On the whole, I think it would be wiser to leave the section as it is.</P>

      <P>I just wish to suggest that it is essential that the rate should be fixed in the Act, because if it is not fixed it will be practically impossible for the valuer or arbitrator to decide on the proper amount of compensation.  The fixed rate of interest will be a guide to him. It is, in fact, the only guide he really has in fixing compensation.  I think it might prove a dangerous principle to allow freedom to the arbitrator to consider possible changes in the rate of interest when he is making his calculations for compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply cannot understand Senator O Buachalla's attitude.  He says that the only thing that the arbitrator will have to guide him is the amount of interest which is fixed arbitrarily in this Bill at 4 per cent.  Surely, that is not a proper view.  The arbitrator will be guided by the value of the land in question and not the rate of interest to be paid on the compensation.  The Parliamentary Secretary talked about the arbitrator's taking this matter of interest into account, but I simply cannot see the point of that.  I cannot see how a rate arbitrarily fixed here and passed in a certain amount of vacuum is going <Col N="489" /> to be the only guide in a whole series of individual cases of equitable claims. I do not know what is in the Senator's mind on that point.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of 4 per cent. interest as being a good average.  There is no such thing, I submit, as an average in rates of interest.  Some people may say that the average age of persons in this country is 37 years, seven months, two days, but there may be no person of that age in the country at this moment. After the last war a huge loan was issued at 5 per cent.  When a huge war loan running to thousands of millions was being issued, it governed the whole condition of what is called the value of money, and it would have been inequitable to offer 4 per cent. to people, inequitable to the recipient of that interest.  Similarly at the present moment, when war loans are issued about 3 per cent., it would be inequitable to the giver of the interest to charge 5 per cent., so that to talk about an average in a matter of this kind is rather meaningless.</P>
      <P>I think that Senator Baxter's view that discretion should be given to the Government to determine the rate of interest taking into account the circumstances of the time is quite right. I can see the Parliamentary Secretary's point that if discretion is left to the Minister people may sometimes attribute rather unworthy motives to him.  That is a consideration but, strictly speaking, the Minister's arbitrators are in the position of judges. A judge has to give a decision on one side or the other or possibly arrive at a solution mid-way between the two sides, and it is unfortunate for the judge that the aggrieved party always says that the judge is a rotten judge. That is what you might call a perquisite of the judge's office.  It is also a perquisite of the Minister's office in this case.  If the Minister's conscience is perfectly clear, I do not see what he should worry about.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary need worry <Col N="490" /> about the future.  He may be sure that if there is any underhand dealing, the public will ultimately become aware of it.  We might just as well pass laws fixing an arbitrary punishment for certain offences, providing, for instance, that everybody who robs a gas meter will get five years.  That is not done because it is recognised that in each case justice can only be interpreted in relation to the surrounding circumstances. I think that is analogous to the question at issue here.  Four per cent. might be all right in one set of circumstances but it might be wrong in another.</P>
      <P>I dislike passing laws in this arbitrary way for the convenience of the Minister rather than for flexibility, so as to get exact justice.  This is not a point that I would make a great deal about.  I have no doubt that if the average rate of interest in a secured investment rises to 10 per cent. we will have an amending Bill, whereas if it drops to 1 per cent. we will also have an amendment.  The present Government in every Act that they brought in have had to bring in an amending Bill.  I have no doubt that what Senator Buckley meant was clear to him, but I cannot understand how he could maintain that the only thing the arbitrator has to guide him in making an award is what is stated in the Act, an arbitrary rate of interest.  If I thought that was so I should feel called upon to make a much stronger objection.  I did not pay much attention to this matter, but if I thought we were going to pass a Bill which was going to react on an unknown number of parties, I would object.  I presume the arbitrator will be an honest man, who will take into account the damage done, on whatever the basis may be, and make his mind as blind as possible when what is casually put in is 4 per cent.</P>

People will be compensated for damage caused by the provision of water supplies and the rate of interest is fixed at 4 per cent.  Assuming we adopted the amendment, and taking it that 2½ per cent. or 3 per cent. is now the common rate of interest, surely Senator Baxter or Senator Fitzgerald realises that the provision of a certain and secure rate of interest is very much better than a doubtful or a speculative one in the present condition of the money market.  Is it not much better for a man to know that he will have 4 per cent. certain than an insecure amount which might be only 2½ per cent.?</P>

      <P>A great deal has been said about it.  The average rate of interest is 4 per cent.  I do not agree with Senator Fitzgerald's idea, that the amount will fluctuate between 1 per cent. and 10 per cent.  That is very unlikely.  As Senator Foran pointed out, it is quite possible that the rate of interest for a considerable time may be as low as 2½ per cent. or 3 per cent. Is it not better to ensure that future applicants under this Act will be assured of a steady 4 per cent.?  As the Parliamentary Secretary stated, take it that in 1945 Mr. A gets 5 per cent., and in 1947 Mr. B only gets 3 per cent., nothing will save the Minister of that <Col N="492" /> period from the charge that he unduly favoured Mr. A and unduly victimised Mr. B.  It is much better to have a steady rate of interest so that such a charge should be avoided.  Apart from that, I prefer an assured and steady 4 per cent.  I only wish that we could all be assured of it.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is much in the point, or that it is one to get cross about.  What I object to is the word &ldquo;average&rdquo;, which may be misleading.  Senator Foran got the wrong end of the stick completely.  His implication was that if a National Loan was issued at 5 per cent., the Government the next year might say that they had changed their minds about the rate.  It is nothing of that sort.</P>

      <P>I can only take the case the Senator made.  When the first National Loan was issued in 1924, the amount was 4½ per cent.  It would be perfectly ridiculous if it was decided that other National Loans should be at 4 per cent., because, as time went on and as money conditions changed, the Government was able to issue loans at 3½ per cent., which meant a great saving to the taxpayers.  There is no instability in the fact that as years go by the interest on money invested may differ from that on money that was invested previously.  Where the Senator makes the mistake is having the feeling that the amount might be 4 per cent., whereas if the amendment were accepted it might be 5½ per cent.</P>

My view is that if my property is damaged because of the operation of this Act, I ought to be compensated for that damage.  The rate of interest I am going to get on the compensation is another matter altogether.  There is, however, material damage done to <Col N="494" /> my property and the assessor ought to indicate that that damage amounts to so many pounds or so many hundreds of pounds.  What I will be paid annually by way of interest on the sum of money is an entirely different matter, and I do not think it is one which ought to be taken into consideration by the arbitrator of the damage done.  I do not think it would be equity, I do not think that ought to be the approach at all.  I did not think that the Parliamentary Secretary would put that as an argument in favour of this 4 per cent. rate of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the impression left on me by what he said.  I must say that it is very interesting to hear the Leader of the Labour Party in the House indicating his very conservative attitude, and very great and serious concern for the maintenance of stability in so far as rates of interest can make for stability.  I, too, am very concerned about maintaining stability, but I am equally concerned about the fact that high rates of interest have done, and are doing, more to create instability in the world than many of the other factors to which people attribute the present world situation.  While I have no great interests in the material way to safeguard, I am concerned that people who have possessions should live under world conditions in which these possessions will bring them some reasonable earnings, but I put the amendment down in the belief that the Parliamentary Secretary would embrace it and in the belief that it would bring about a situation which would make the administration of the Act in relation to rates of interest more satisfactory from his and his Department's point of view.  Now it seems that we are to be put into a position in which the law demands that money shall earn a certain rate of interest over a given period and that it does not matter to what extent changing circumstances in the money market may alter the short-term rate of interest within that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is room in this country <Col N="495" /> for some alteration in the more orthodox view held with regard to money and its use and value to the people.  Instead of arguing that the maintenance of stability can be secured only by this high rate of interest, I think that a reorientation of the point of view of all of us on that matter would go much further towards that end.  I cannot carry the House with me if it is not prepared to be less conservative than it has been in the past. I realise that Senator Sir John Keane, from his point of view, would argue strongly that 4 per cent. is a reasonable rate and that it ought to be maintained at that level, but, in my judgment, money has been asking too much for its services in this country and everywhere else in the past.  It would have been better for the world if it had been satisfied with less and if human beings could have got more for their services than they were given.</P>
    <P>I have urged here that we make a start, and that instead of determining that for the next 50 years, if needs be, during which this Act will operate, we are to pay 4 per cent. interest on compensation for damage done to people whose property has to be destroyed or damaged to any extent, the rates of interest be altered in accordance with the prevailing rate at the time the damage is done to the property.  If I sell my farm to-morrow and invest the money I get I shall have to take the current rates; I shall have to take whatever the money can earn.  If the British Government at present can finance a war at 2 per cent., I frankly cannot see why we should determine that for all time we will pay 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>I know that this is all an argument against the interests of the people whose property will be damaged, but I am looking at the matter from the other angle.  There are a great many people with property in this country, which property could be made much more valuable if they could get X million pounds at a rate lower than 4 per cent.  We farmers cannot have it both ways.  We cannot argue with one voice that we must have 4 per cent. <Col N="496" /> if our property is damaged, and, with the other, that we ought to get 2 per cent. for the exploitation and better use of that property.  It is from that angle that I have approached this problem.  While I realise that people like the Labour Party who have tremendous monetary interests in their Labour organisation to safeguard&mdash; money which they have unquestionably put at the disposal of this nation on every occasion on which the nation wanted money to finance any scheme; that must be said to their credit&mdash;may be a little conservative, I think it would be much better for the nation as a whole if they joined with me in approaching this problem from my point of view.</P>

      <P>Before Section 19 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>19.&mdash;(1)  Where, immediately before the passing of this Act, a sanitary authority was taking water from a source of water for the purposes of a water supply provided by them under the Public Health Acts, 1878 to 1931, such sanitary authority may, after the passing of this Act, continue to take water from such source of water at the place, by the method, and in the quantity at, by, and in <Col N="497" /> which they were so taking water immediately before the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  Nothing in this section shall prejudice or affect the right of any person to recover damages from a sanitary authority for any wrongful interference before the passing of this Act by such sanitary authority with the property of such person or for any interference after the passing of this Act by such sanitary authority with the property of such person which, but for this section, would be wrongful interference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is in no way different from the purpose of Section 19, already in the Bill.  It is largely a matter of drafting.  Section 19 which was intended to preserve existing water schemes read:</P>
      <P>Where a sanitary authority is, immediately before the passing of this Act, taking water from a source of water for the purposes of a water supply provided by them under the Public Health Acts, 1878 to 1931, no court shall grant or issue any injunction or order to restrain or having the effect of restraining such sanitary authority from continuing to take water from such source of water at the place, by the method, or in the quantity at, by, and in which they are so taking water immediately before the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>Now, instead of putting a prohibition upon the courts from granting an injunction, this new section gives the sanitary authority a statutory right to take water.  The present Section 19 prohibits the courts from granting an injunction in the case of schemes in operation at the time the Bill is passed.  The new section gives the sanitary authority the right to take water in respect of schemes that are already operating by the method and in the same quantity as they are taking it at the time this Bill becomes law.</P>

It seems to me possible that sources of <Col N="498" /> supply, which are at present being used, might be interfered with.  That point should, I think, be taken into consideration.  What I am anxious about is that the power of the sanitary authority should not be made absolute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator's point refers to future schemes rather than to existing ones.  The amendment relates to existing schemes and is intended merely to protect them as they are at present, and to prevent an injunction being granted against a local authority for continuing to take water in the future in the same manner as they have been taking it in the past.</P>
      <P>On the general question as to how a scheme under this Bill might affect a drainage proposal, that is a different matter altogether.  The Bill empowers a sanitary authority to take water.  It provides for objections by the persons affected.  It provides for a provisional order by the Minister when objection is made and is not withdrawn, and it provides, ultimately, for an appeal to the Circuit Court by any person affected to prevent a proposal coming into operation.  With all these safeguards and provisions, if a scheme is ultimately confirmed, either by the Minister or the Circuit Court, the only redress anyone who may be affected by the scheme has is by way of compensation.</P>

    <P>Whenever a sanitary authority desire to take from a source of water (whether within or without their sanitary district) a supply of water for the purpose of increasing, extending, or providing a supply of water under the Public Health Acts, 1878 to 1931, they may make, under and in accordance with this Act, a proposal <Col N="499" /> for so taking such supply of water from such source of water.</P>
    <P>I might mention to the Senator that this Bill is not in substitution for the powers which a sanitary authority already possesses under the Public Health Acts, but is an alternative method of procedure.  If a sanitary authority chooses to proceed under the Public Health Acts, instead of under this Bill, it can still do so.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter, at an earlier stage, asked as to the position relating to a water supply scheme in Kingscourt.  According to the information available in my Department, amended documents in connection with the proposals were received on the 30th July, 1940, and, on the 14th August, 1940, the board of health were informed that no objection would be raised to the invitation of tenders.  On the 28th November, 1939, the board decided to postpone for a period of six months all public health schemes for which loans had not been borrowed, in view of the conditions arising from the European War.  My position is that, so far as the Department is concerned, on the 14th August, 1940, we informed the board of health that no objection would be raised to the invitation of tenders.  Since then we have not heard anything from the board of health on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for clarifying the position.  This matter has raised a considerable amount of annoyance and ill-feeling.  As a matter of fact, it is probably the one fairly large town in the county that is left without a water supply; all the other places have had a water supply laid on.  There is a good deal of ill-feeling engendered; the people there are under the impression that they are not being justly treated. I have had communications on the subject, and I have been asked to raise it here.  The last report I saw in the Press appeared to put the responsibility on the Department for not proceeding with the scheme.  I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary has clarified the situation for me, and the people in Kingscourt and elsewhere in the county will be glad to know where the fault lies&mdash;that it is not in his Department, and that the responsibility lies with the board of health.</P>

      <P>The Constitution provides that a referendum may be taken in certain circumstances upon certain legislative proposals, and has to be taken where a proposal is made to amend the Constitution.  The taking of a referendum, according to the Constitution, is to be regulated by law, and this Bill contains the provisions for so regulating it.</P>
      <P>The Bill is in three parts.  The first is the preliminary or general part and, among other things, it defines the referenda which may be taken under the Constitution.  The first to be defined is a constitutional referendum and the second is an ordinary referendum. The terms &ldquo;constitutional referendum&rdquo; and &ldquo;ordinary referendum&rdquo; are used throughout the Bill.  It also provides, under Section 6, for the appointment of an officer to conduct the referendum. That officer is known as the referendum returning officer.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill prescribes the procedure which is to be followed for taking a poll at a referendum. Generally, this procedure is similar to that for the holding of a general election.  It provides for the appointment of a day upon which the referendum is to be held and, where a constitutional referendum is to be held, it provides that such referendum may be taken upon a day upon which a poll is held for a general election. In general, the procedure is the same as that which pertains at a general election, the exception being that whereas at a general election people have to vote for or against certain candidates, at a referendum they have to assent to or dissent from certain propositions.  The form of the ballot paper is prescribed in the Second Schedule to the Bill, and the assent to or dissent from a proposition is to be indicated by a vote or by making a cross in the appropriate column.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides for the procedure which is to be followed <Col N="504" /> where the result of the referendum is challenged.  When the referendum returning officer receives the returns from the several constituencies in the country and has considered them, analysed them and tabulated them, he issues what is known as a provisional certificate giving the provisional result of the referendum.  That certificate does not become final and conclusive until after the lapse of an appointed time.  If, within that period, the figures in the provisional certificate have not been challenged by petition or if, having been challenged by petition within the appointed time, the petition is not upheld by the High Court, then, on notification from the appropriate officer of the High Court, the provisional certificate becomes final and conclusive evidence of the result of the referendum.</P>
    <P>Part III, as I have said, of the Bill prescribes the procedure to be followed where a petition is lodged challenging the figures given in the provisional certificate: in fact, challenging the result of the referendum as first declared by the Referendum Returning Officer.  The procedure which has to be adopted for the trial of a petition challenging a referendum differs in some material ways from the existing procedure relating to a petition challenging the result of an election. In the case of an election, as the House of course is aware, the person primarily concerned in defending the petition is the person who has been declared elected.  In the case of a referendum there is no person who can occupy that position; so that there is no person in most cases who can be appointed as a respondent to defend the petition.  Now, where the petition is presented by a private individual the Bill makes provision that the Attorney-General shall defend the result of the referendum.  Where, on the other hand, the Attorney-General presents the petition, as he may do under the Bill, operating, of course, in the public interest, we have a provision whereby, if necessary, the High Court may appoint some person to defend the referendum, and in that way we assimilate as closely as we can the procedure in regard to the trial of a referendum petition to that which obtains in the <Col N="505" /> case of a petition challenging the returns at an election.</P>
    <P>Schedule I contains the rules for taking the poll at a referendum, and, as may be seen, both in the relevant sections in Part I of the Bill and in these rules, the poll is to be taken everywhere throughout the country on the one day, and will be by secret ballot.  Part II of the Bill provides that any member of Dáil Eireann may nominate, first of all, a personating agent to represent him at so many of the election centres or so many of the polling places as he may consider desirable, provided that in respect of each polling place he is only entitled to one representative.  It also allows a member of Dáil Eireann to appoint two persons to represent him at the count of the votes of the referendum in whichever constituencies he elects to be represented at, and it also allows him to nominate himself as one of the persons to represent him at the count. The rules further provide that a re-count of all the votes or of an appropriate parcel of the votes may be asked for, and it is mandatory upon the returning officer to grant this re-count and to continue the re-count until the results of two successive counts of the same ballot papers, whether the whole or a packet thereof, agree or coincide.  In the event of the results of two counts agreeing, then it will not be mandatory upon the returning officer to grant any further re-counts.</P>
    <P>These are the principal provisions of the Bill.  There is perhaps just one other point I may bring out in regard to it, and that is that every person who is entitled to vote at a Dáil election will be entitled to vote at this election, provided that he or she has attained the age of 21 years, and the Bill contains provisions which will permit the returning officer to put questions, to any person who applies for a vote, to elicit the information that, in fact, he or she has attained the age of 21 years.</P>

      <P>An amendment to the Constitution was passed a number of years ago, which provided that after the lapse of three years there could be no further amendments to the Constitution <Col N="506" /> except by means of a referendum. Therefore, as I think the three years have now elapsed, I presume that such a Bill, providing machinery for the taking of a referendum, is necessary.  I have never concealed my judgment that that amendment to the Constitution was not only undesirable but also unworthy, because it implied many untruths.  I have felt always that in the case of a written Constitution, in a comparatively new State, you should have an easy means of amending it over a large number of years.  It is only by meeting the various contingencies that time brings about that one is able to judge what should be a permanent law, only changed with difficulty. The Constitution, as it was prior to a few years ago, was rather derided&mdash;I think it was called then a thing of rags and tatters&mdash;because it had been so frequently amended. During the last three years, or something more than that I think, we have had quite a number of amendments to the Constitution in the form it was given some years ago.  Now, under circumstances, we have to make provision for the taking of a referendum and the machinery of it.  I hope that some time a referendum will be taken for recasting the whole Constitution as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to say much about this Bill, but there are quite a number of things that I should like to have made clear.  For instance, take this business of a member of the Dáil nominating a representative in a constituency. I do not quite understand what was visualised there, unless it were that the member of the Dáil had proposed, by motion or otherwise, an amendment to the Constitution himself. One would assume that any amendment to the Constitution would arise out of a situation, not hitherto experienced, which made it abundantly clear to the responsible representatives in the Legislature that such an amendment was necessary.  I do not quite understand how this thing is going to work in the case of appeals in the court, how it is that one party is going to appeal.  I should like to mention now that, when, in whatever year it was, 1937 I think, at the time of a <Col N="507" /> general election, such a referendum purported to be taken, I had knowledge of quite a number of constituencies, and I am quite satisfied from what I saw that the majority of the votes cast with regard to the Constitution were&mdash;I do not want to say that they were illegal, but they did not fulfil the conditions of the law.  I am quite satisfied that if there were some means of looking over all these papers it would be found that whereas the law provided that the indication of approval or disapproval of the proposed change should take one form&mdash; I have forgotten whether it was a cross or the word &ldquo;yes&rdquo;&mdash;the majority of voters had misunderstood their position and voted in a way that would have meant, if the law had been rigidly applied, that the majority of the votes would have been accounted as of no effect because they did not fulfil the conditions.</P>
    <P>There is only one other thing that I want to say.  If there is a proposal to change the basic law, it can be changed by such a referendum by a mere minority of the people on the voters' list.  We know that the enormous change made some years ago was effected by a minority of the people eligible voting in favour of that change.  I suggest that we want to get rid of all this humbug, if I might use that word, of pretending that somehow or other the whole judgment of the people in a sort of unanimity is brought to bear on the thing.  So far as that change was concerned, there was only a minority vote for it.  I admit that the minority was bigger than the minority voting against it.  Somewhere in the early part of the Bill there is a reference, I think, to ascertaining the will of the people.  That phrase &ldquo;the will of the people&rdquo; is merely a <i>cliché.</i>  I strongly object to the suggestion that if you have 100,000 voters voting and 51,000 vote one way and 49,000 vote the other way that is what can be called the will of the people.  It is only the will of the majority of the voters.</P>
    <P>While it may be necessary at some stage to have more elaborate <Col N="508" /> machinery brought into operation for changing fundamental laws, I think we ought to clear our minds of a certain amount of implied non-truths that were in that last amendment.  The last amendment talked about the people enacting a new Constitution.  That amendment, in so far as it was legal, was legal for this reason and for this reason only, that the Dáil, the legislative authority in this country, had legislated and provided that, certain conditions being fulfilled, that change would take place, and it is only from that that the legitimacy of that change in the law became operative.  I find in this an attempt to carry on what I might call the same disingenuous suggestion made on the other occasion. There is talk here about the will of the people.  The law-making authority in this country is the Legislative Assembly and that authority resides solely in them.  I have always objected to the implication in that last amendment suggesting that, although you have a Legislature in whom authority resides, at the same time the authority is residing in the whole mass of the people.  In so far as this Bill becomes operative, the votes of those people, or the majority of them, will have that certain effect for the sole reason that the Legislative Assembly is enacting that, under these conditions, those votes will have that effect and for no other reason.  Can the Minister give me the reference in the early part of the Bill to the will of the people?</P>

      <P>That reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever the President informs the Taoiseach in accordance with Article 27 of the Constitution that he has decided that a Bill to which that Article applies contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly object to that.  What he means is that it contains a proposal of such national importance that the provisions of this Bill shall be made operative and a vote shall be taken and a decision of a majority of those who actually cast their votes legally <Col N="509" /> according to the provisions of this Bill shall take place.  The idea that the will of the people somehow or other is what 51 people for and 49 against is a thing that I certainly am never going to miss an opportunity of protesting against.  As I say, one has to recognise that, as the law stands, some Bill providing for this type of referendum is necessary.  I want to make it clear that I am only going to support this Bill for the reason that it has been made necessary by another Bill.  I also want to make it clear that I am not going to admit that a thing is true because 51 people say it is true while 49 people say it is not.  I should like to know what will be the Irish text of that clause (a) in Section 10 about the will of the people.  Is &ldquo;people&rdquo; there plural or singular?</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House about this, as the Bill is necessary as the law stands, because our experience during the last few years has shown that we have constantly required to amend the Constitution as it was passed on that previous occasion and, therefore, we must have some machinery for amending the Constitution sometime.  This is a cumbersome machinery.  It is a singularly undesirable form, but we are bound to have it in this form, though when it comes to the Committee Stage I think that one might have quite a number of amendments.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to have given a rather more detailed explanation of the various sections of the Bill. Perhaps he could at some stage during its consideration in this House give us a more or less imaginary picture of a given case being put to the country, the voting taking place on it, and the reasons why one or other of the Deputies of the Dáil would have representatives; an imaginary case of the thing being challenged in the courts and the machinery of that, which I must say, on a not too careful reading of the Bill, I have not got clear.  I have not been able to relate that to what I may call an imaginary case taken to the courts.  I think we have got to pass some such Bill, but I very much regret it is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The only criticism I have to make is that this perpetuates the practice of bringing the people to the polls instead of the polls to the people.  Everybody knows that it is enormously costly, but it is indulged in because, as a rule, what you are to vote on is a political issue between various Parties.  That may be all right at a general election where one Party wants to get into power and the other wants to keep it out.  But it is conceivable when a referendum is taken that it need not necessarily be on a political issue in that sense at all.  The result would be that, unless the Parties were prepared to make it a political issue, nobody would vote, because nowadays people have been trained not to go to the polls unless people produce transport to get them there.  In any case, I think it would be a more advanced idea if the polls were brought to the people rather than having to bring the people to the polls.  Certainly in country districts it is enormously difficult.</P>
      <P>From the fact that certain privileges have been given to members of the Dáil to appoint agents to watch each other and to see that people do not personate, it looks as if it is expected that every time a referendum is taken it must be fought as if it were a contest between political Parties.  I cannot see why that particular privilege is given to members of the Dáil.  The inevitable result will be that in a three-member constituency where a member has died one particular Party will not have any opportunity to appoint an agent, unless it means that a member of the Dáil can appoint an agent in any booth in any constituency that he likes.  I suppose the intention really was that a member of the Dáil in the constituency in which the booth was situate would appoint the personation agent, because there would not be much point in persons from Cork appointing personation agents, for instance, in Louth.</P>

As regards Senator Fitzgerald's point about the difference between 51 and 49, these figures constitute a majority and a minority, respectively, and we must abide by majority rule, unless he wishes us to decide by minority rule. In every other connection, we have majority rule.  As regards Section 11, which deals with the procedure and method of polling, I suggest a more equitable distribution of polling stations.  The machinery is already there, but it has not been sufficiently utilised.  Members of the House who are familiar with the country know that there are many areas in which a voter may have to pass a polling booth quite close to his house and proceed a distance of seven miles to another polling booth in order to register his vote. That position has caused the greatest inconvenience at elections.  It should be taken into consideration in connection <Col N="512" /> with this Bill.  The returning officer, or prospective returning officer, at the next election should be empowered to make a schedule of the polling stations in each area and see how they could be rearranged so as to reduce the distances which voters have to travel.</P>

      <P>It has been ordained by the Constitution that a referendum of the people must be taken in certain circumstances.  We have now to give effect to the provisions of the Constitution and to make arrangements for regulating, by law, the taking of the referendum.  So far as the fundamental <Col N="513" /> theory underlying the Bill is concerned, we must take that as already decided and proceed on the assumption that it is generally accepted.  The practical point which Senator Fitzgerald raised related to the fact that every Deputy is given the right to appoint a personation agent in every polling place in the country, if he so thinks fit.  He wants to know why that is being done. It is being done because we have to give practical recognition to the fact that, if a referendum in relation to ordinary legislation is to be taken at all, it can be taken only as a result of concerted action which has been agreed to by a number of members of the Oireachtas&mdash;a majority of members of the Seanad and, at least, one-third of the members of the Dáil.  It is assumed that, as they will combine to ensure that a referendum be taken upon ordinary legislation which is of great importance, they will also combine to ensure that the result of that referendum will correctly represent the views of the majority of such portion of the electorate as is sufficiently interested in the proposition to go to the polls for or against it.  Assuming that sections of the Dáil act in concert, they may find it convenient to appoint one of their number to supervise, generally, the taking of the referendum on their behalf.  Accordingly, it has been felt that, as such supervision could not be exercised unless there was proper control of those who present themselves and claim to be entitled to vote, this person should be given the right to appoint personation agents to act in the same way as if he happened to be a candidate in each of the constituencies in which the referendum was being taken.  It is for that reason that every member of the Dáil&mdash;we could not purport to act for any section of Deputies&mdash;has been given the right to appoint a personation agent in every polling place, if he so desires.</P>

      <P>As the Seanad is above the heat and dust of Party strife, we thought members would not like to demean themselves by interfering in these rather controversial matters.  If the Seanad feels moved to make such provision, I do not see any objection to permitting a Senator to nominate a personation agent.  I do not think it is a privilege which many members, either of the Dáil or Seanad, will feel called upon to exercise.  A referendum can be secured only by a number of members of both Houses, in requisite proportions, acting in concert. I assume that, as they combine for the purpose of securing a referendum, they will combine also to ensure that the interest they desire to safeguard will be fully looked after during the taking of the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson said that the objection he had to the Bill was that it continued the practice of bringing the people to the polls instead of bringing the polls to the people.  I do not know exactly what Senator Robinson had in mind.  Perhaps he wanted, in the case of a referendum, to have the voting by post.  I do not see any other way by which we could bring the polls to the people except by sending the ballot papers or the referendum papers to the electors by post&mdash;presumably that would be the most convenient way&mdash; and asking them to post the papers back to us with their decision in relation to the question on which the referendum must be taken.  I do not think that would be a very economical method of taking a referendum, nor do I think it would be a very secure or efficient method either.  I think one would have very great difficulty in safeguarding the authenticity of the votes which would be cast by post on the occasion of a referendum.  I think, in fact, the only safe and secure means of conducting procedure of this kind is to provide that every person who feels sufficiently interested in the question <Col N="515" /> at issue, who has formed an opinion on one side or the other in regard to it, and who wants to make that opinion effective, should himself turn up at the polling booth and indicate his will in regard to the question at issue.</P>

What is in the Bill is that where the Legislature has decided that it is desirable to amend the Constitution, before that decision becomes effective, it must be referred to the people and that then, if a majority of those who are interested in the question go to the polls and vote in favour of the constitutional amendment, the amendment becomes effective.  That is not to say that we allow 10 per cent. of the people to make up our minds for us.  The amendment must first of all be agreed to by both Houses of the Oireachtas, and then it is referred to the people. I think we may assume that in this case silence gives assent and if the people refrain from registering their votes, then, at any rate, they are prepared to abide by the amendment of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>It is not a case of nullifying it.  We have got to take the actual practical situation in this regard into consideration.  Presumably, in the great majority of cases at any rate, the proposal to amend the Constitution would necessarily have to be introduced by the Government, or at least it would have to be a proposal of which the Government is in favour, otherwise it would not pass both Houses of the Oireachtas without a change of Government.  If a proposal were introduced which the Dáil considered acceptable and if that proposal were carried against the wishes of the Government, there would have to be a change of Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because, remember, the Government must retain the support of the majority of the Dáil. As well as that, the Bill could not at any stage proceed through the Dáil unless it was supported by a majority of the Dáil.  The Government could not be in a permanent minority in the House opposing a Bill which the Dáil wished to pass.  We may assume, at this stage at any rate, that it is very unlikely that any constitutional amendment could be carried through both Houses against the Government.  If it were carried through the Dáil against the Opposition of the Administration in power at the date of its introduction, it could only be carried through under the aegis of another Government which would presumably be in favour of the proposal and which would naturally, in order to make it effective, recommend it to the people.  It <Col N="517" /> is conceivable that a proposal to amend the Constitution, carried even at the instance of the Government, through both Houses of the Oireachtas, might be a proposal which might turn out to be not of very great moment.  It might be a proposal the need for which had disappeared after a period of time and the Government might not at a general election put the proposal to the people in order to make the amendment effective.  If that were to happen, the proposal would not die. It would remain in a state of suspended animation.  As the Constitution stands at present, it could at a subsequent time be put by any other Government to the people.</P>

      <P>Is it not conceivable that after a Government had been elected for a short time, a proposal to amend the Constitution might come from the Opposition, and the Government, suddenly realising that it might lead to a revolt in their own Party, might allow a vote to be taken with the Whips off?  In that case a majority would be obtained for the Bill although the Government was not responsible for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That might happen, but the moment that happens one of the conventions of the Constitution, I think, would be violated.  The big fact remains that our Constitution is based on the assumption that the Party system, as we know it, will continue to operate, and the moment you begin to deal with important public matters by taking off the Whips, it means, in effect, that the Government places itself in the position of Pilate and washes its hands of responsibility, thereby bringing responsible government to an end.  But I do not think that we need split straws about matters of that sort now.  The point to which Senator James Johnston has referred relates to a difficulty with which it may be necessary at some future time to take special steps to deal, but I do not think it is of sufficient importance at the moment to trouble ourselves about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Honan raised the point that polling places are not very numerous and very often are situated in inconvenient places.  That is a matter which <Col N="518" /> is entirely within the control of the local authorities and the county councils.  It is the county council which determines, with the sanction of the Minister, where the polling places are to be situated.  A great many changes for the better have taken place in the position since 1922 and it would be of great advantage if local authorities generally would review the whole situation and try to make it easier and more convenient for the electorate to vote.  We cannot, however, in that connection close our eyes to the fact that there are certain practical difficulties.  Polling places have to be easy of access; they have to be reasonably large and well-lighted and, in general, buildings which can be placed at the disposal of the returning officer for the purposes of the election at a convenient date.  You cannot conveniently establish polling booths in busy places, and you cannot conveniently install them in private houses.  Generally, a number of people have to be accommodated and temporary structures erected conveniently, and at no great expense.  I know from experience in the City of Dublin that it is not always easy to get convenient polling places, and I have no doubt that position obtains also to a large degree in the country.  I think it would be of great public advantage if local authorities would review the facilities given to voters in their areas at present, to see whether these could not be improved upon.  In the Department of Local Government we shall be only too glad to consider very sympathetically any proposals for improvement submitted for our sanction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion was before us some weeks ago, and in the course of the debate the Minister indicated that he disagreed with the proposal put forward by Senator Baxter, about which I had a perfectly open mind at the time.  But he indicated more than that.  He indicated that to suggest a change in something which a machined majority in the Dáil had voted for was of such a treasonable nature that the censorship should operate against it.  Senator Baxter had referred to a letter, proposing, in the name of justice, a different price to the growers of wheat, which had been suppressed by the Censor and the Minister adverting to that said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am not aware how far the Censor has gone in this matter, but if the Censor has cut out any proposals for an increased price for wheat, I think he is doing his duty.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be perfectly clear at this point. We know that here in the Seanad and in the Dáil the majority of the Government Party do not bother to listen to what is being discussed, but merely walk in and vote as their Party is voting. That may be a perfectly desirable thing in many ways, but, in this matter <Col N="522" /> of the price of wheat, in growing which the farmers are doing a necessary national duty, there is a question of justice, and justice is not determined by the Party Whip in the Dáil telling a machined Party that it has got to vote in a certain way.  Justice does not mean, either, that people who are competent to judge as to what is a just price, by virtue of that machined majority in the Dáil, are never thereafter to have a thought in their minds upon which to form a judgment, or open their mouths as to what they think is a just price.  That, however, is what the Minister takes for granted. I do not pretend to stand up here and say exactly that this sum is the proper price per barrel or per bushel of wheat, that this price is too low or that price too high, but from what I know of agriculture&mdash;I do not pretend to do a great deal, but I will say that, at least, I am not an unsuccessful farmer&mdash;it seems to me to be perfectly clear that if a fair price for wheat at a given time is 35/- per barrel, at a later period, as things are, it will not be a fair price.</P>
    <P>We had, for example, a statement emanating from, I think, a member of the staff of the Department of Agriculture that wheat does not exhaust the soil.  I know something about wheat-growing in other countries, and of the experiences of wheat growers here.  If you start wheat-growing on a farm here under present conditions when you have not an unlimited supply of the appropriate fertilisers, and if one acre produces X barrels of wheat this year, and if in succeeding years you cannot open new soil&mdash;the ordinary economy of a farm does not allow of that&mdash;then that one acre will produce X minus 2 next year, and in the succeeding year X minus 4.  Consequently, with the same amount of labour in ploughing and all the rest, the same amount of land will produce a less quantity of wheat in the succeeding years.  Therefore, it seems to me to be natural that if, in present conditions, this war carries on for a number of years, the real price of wheat production is going to increase from year to year.  The suggestion has been put to us that when the Government tells the members of its Party the price it wants <Col N="523" /> to give for wheat, whether it be 40/- or 45/-, the members of the Party vote as they are told, and that thereafter the machinery of government is to be used to prevent anybody expressing a contrary judgment as to what justice requires.</P>
    <P>On this matter of the censorship, if my memory serves me right, what happened was this.  In view of the emergency arising out of the condition of a world war, which created a certain condition of emergency in this country, the Government quite rightly asked for powers of censorship.  In present circumstances, in relation to the world situation, it is possible for serious harm to be done to this country in its international relations by unrestricted publicity on certain lines, but, if I remember rightly, a guarantee was given at the time by the Government that the power which we voluntarily voted to it would not be used except for the purpose of preserving the integrity of this State in the present condition of danger in the world. The Minister decides that a certain price should be given for wheat.  That price might or might not have been fair when he proposed it.  If it was just fair then, I am prepared to say it would be less than fair at a later stage.  But the Minister now assumes that the Government is to be preserved from any contrary judgment, once it has a machined majority in the Dáil and Seanad to declare that a certain price is the proper one.  That, to me, is an intolerable situation.</P>
    <P>In England at the present time, in a country that is absolutely in the thick of this war and that is fighting for its life, what is the position of the Government there?  I wonder do any members of the House read the English newspapers.  The Government in England recognises, in far too generous a way to my mind, the right of unrestricted, indeed I will go so far as to say, irresponsible, criticism.  But the Government here has seized the opportunity of this world emergency to impose silence upon the country in regard to any criticism of its own notorious ineptitude and fantastic incapacity. That is the truth of the <Col N="524" /> matter.  The Government here has not kept its word of honour.  It does not seem to know what honour is.  If members look back to the time when the Government was granted these emergency powers they will remember that the undertaking of the Government was this: that it wanted the bare minimum of power to restrain writings and publications that were going to be dangerous to this country in relation to the international situation.  In present circumstances we are all agreed that there are certain facts which should not be stated because their publication would be against the public interest.  The method for dealing with that situation was to set up a Defence Conference.  In the Dáil last week a Minister referred to certain information which he did not feel disposed to reveal to the Dáil.  He asked for special powers even though he said he could not give the relevant information to the Dáil.  When the Defence Conference, a body on which there are representatives of the various Parties, was set up the Government said that body would be put in possession of information which it was not in the public interest should be made known.  It was apparent from the discussion in the Dáil that the members of the Defence Conference were not given the information&mdash;the Minister refused to give to it.  It was not revealed in the secret enclave of the Defence Conference.</P>
    <P>Again, a Minister comes here and approves of the arbitrary act of a Government employee to prevent any attempt being made to get what people conceive to be justice for the farmers.  That, to my mind, is intolerable in a number of ways, first of all by the fact that the Government does not recognise its bond of honour.  It does not recognise its duty to keep the undertakings which it has given, and which, I suggest, it has broken.  It has broken the undertaking it gave with regard to the censorship, as well as the undertaking that the Dáil should not ask for certain information since that information would be given to the members of the various Parties represented on the Defence Conference.  We in this country are not in the war, but we are dangerously affected by it.</P>

      <P>There are two ways in which the Government protects its intolerable incapacity.  The first is by not letting the people know what is being said, and, secondly, by running away from, rather than by standing over, the statements it makes.  Last week a Minister stated that, in his judgment, the arbitrary power given to the Government in relation to the present crisis is being properly used when it prevents anybody voicing a case for a certain price for the wheat grown by farmers.  In spite of that members of the Government go around the country asking the farmers to produce wheat. I suggest that the person who ought to be suppressed is the Minister.  The farmers are being asked to produce wheat.  I want to put it to the House that the Government has no right to ask for a special service from any section of the community for which they are not to receive bare justice.  Since the statements I have referred to were made, the Government has, by its own act, admitted that the proposal it suppressed, on the grounds that it was contrary to the well-being of the people of this country, was a just proposal. If it is more than a just price for the farmer who produces the wheat, then the Government had no right to fix it, because in that sense it is an unjust price, and the Government has acted unjustly to the taxpayers.  I have never accepted the Government's idea of neutrality.  The State is something specifically distinct from the members of the State.  Not to be neutral in this country can only be achieved by an act of the Government declaring war. That is how we come to be neutral&mdash;<Col N="526" /> the Government has not taken that act.  The reason we are neutral, that we do not declare war, is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This matter has been raised now because it was referred to in the course of the previous debate, but my personal opinion is that it would be much wiser and more proper to raise it on a separate motion.

      <P>I am quite prepared to deal with it on a separate motion. What is the position?  The Government, by its own act last week, has agreed to 50/- as a just price for wheat. Prior to that it had used the special powers it was given to prevent a case being made before the public with a view to getting what the Government now admits is justice for the farmers. I think that is implicit in what the Government has done and what the Minister stated here.  He has not the guts to face up to a revelation of what is implicit in the Government's statement and action, and I have the same contempt for his character as I have for his utter incompetency in his job.</P>

      <P>We all welcome the Government's decision to increase the price of wheat and we trust that that decision will have the desired effect of producing a sufficiency of wheat to meet the country's requirements.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into detail in relation to the matters mentioned by Senator Fitzgerald.  He accused the Fianna Fáil Party in the Dáil and in the Seanad of being merely a voting machine and he said they had to vote for the 45/- per barrel for wheat because they are in the Party.  I think on examination it will be found that the majority of the Fianna Fáil Deputies and also the Fianna Fáil Senators are farmers, good, solid, sensible farmers, and, whatever about their Party affiliations, it must be recognised that human nature is human nature and those men are going to see that their views will be heard as regards the price to be given for wheat or live stock or any other section of the industry in which they are engaged.</P>
      <P>When the announcement was made that the Government had decided to give an increase of 5/- per barrel for wheat a statement was issued indicating that it might be necessary to increase the price of flour after next harvest.  A similar statement was made with regard to sugar, in view of the increase in the price of beet.  I think before next harvest some scheme should be thought out in connection with continuing the subsidy on flour, such as we have at the present time, because, owing to increased unemployment and a falling off in a number of ways of the people's earnings&mdash;people in our towns and cities&mdash;I am afraid that if the price of the loaf has to be increased as a result of the increased price of wheat, what will be given to the farmer on the one hand will probably be taken away from him on the other hand in the shape of home and other assistance in order to keep the poorer people alive.  If we do not consider some such scheme before next harvest when the increase in the price of flour will come into operation, there will be a considerable amount of distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> We hear a good deal about compulsory tillage, but when we examine the situation, when we consider the amount of propaganda, the speeches that are being made and the inducements that are being held out in the form of increased prices, one wonders is there any such thing as compulsory tillage or whether we are really enticing people to supply us with food by reason of the inducement of good prices.  We know now that we had not the return we expected from our acreage last year and I believe that that was due entirely to the fact that we had not correct statistics as to the amount of land tilled or the amount of wheat returned. I suggest to the Minister that, when the next threshing season arrives, before oil is made available for threshing purposes the mill owner or the threshing-machine owner should be compelled to keep a record of the quantity of wheat threshed for each farmer.  Those returns should be forwarded to the appropriate Government Department and in that way we will be able to get a much better idea of the amount of wheat that is in the country.</P>
    <P>As regards compulsory tillage, we all know that one or two inspectors cannot satisfactorily cover an entire county, and I think that duty should be allocated to the Guards.  When anybody suggests that such duties should be handed over to the Guards the retort is that already they are over-burdened with various duties.  With that statement I do not agree.  The Guards are acquainted with the various districts in which tillage operations are carried on; they know the large landowners and they know where the Tillage Order has been complied with.  Senator Johnston endeavoured to show us here that the larger the number of large holdings in the country the better from the point of view of wheat production, and also the production of other crops. I suggest that if it is at all possible we should this year have a record kept of all the large holdings and the amount of land cultivated on each large holding, on the conacre system or in the ordinary way.  In that way we will know exactly the amount of land cultivated by the large landholder <Col N="529" /> and the amount cultivated by small farmers on the conacre system.  A large owner may get credit for making a contribution to the State which he is not really making.  That credit should go to the person who takes conacre from him, sometimes at an exorbitant rent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the Government to increase the price to 50/- and I trust it will be sufficient to induce farmers to do their duty.  It is a very serious matter when people hold up property vested in them and refuse to make a proper use of it in the interest of the nation.  We had landlords who tried that game and we know what happened to those landlords when they did not carry out their duty.  The first duty of the owners of land and other property is to utilise it so that it will be of the greatest possible benefit to the nation.  I suggest that the best wheat-growing lands have not been utilised to the fullest extent.  There was a time when the lands of County Meath supplied not alone the requirements of that area but of mills of many other counties. That wheat was exported in large quantities.  I suggest that the contention that the lands of Meath are too luxuriant to grow profitable crops of wheat is not borne out by the facts of history.  I think the mistake is in not scheduling wheat-growing lands.  The lands of the Midlands, Meath, Westmeath, portions of Longford, Kildare, and portions of Louth, are capable of giving the highest return in wheat produce.  In the poorer lands, in the congested areas, only small patches of wheat can be grown, except, perhaps, around the Listowel area in Kerry. Perhaps those lands do not count in the nation's economy, but the Government should make a long distance plan for the growing of wheat so that they will never again find themselves in the position in which they found themselves recently.  Wheat-growing lands should be scheduled, taken over in large areas, and worked co-operatively. That should be done in the coming year, if it can be done.  Most of these lands are in the hands of the Land Commission and they could easily be taken <Col N="530" /> over under the Emergency Powers Act. In the coming year the Government should concentrate on these lands, because the poor lands will become exhausted by lack of farmyard manure, which is the best of all manures.  The others are only stimulants and they cannot be got now.  Unless you have on these lands an abundance of farmyard manure, they will cease to grow wheat effectively.  The return throughout the country has been about seven or eight barrels to the acre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a meagre return and is understandable only on the hypothesis that wheat is grown on the poorer lands.  I have known some of the rich lands to give a poor return for the reason that those who cultivated the lands had not the slightest idea of how the crop should be treated. They simply scraped the ground, and it was a waste of energy, and in many cases a deliberate evasion of the Act. The people who have grown most wheat on this occasion are the people who have always tilled.  I have sympathy with the big land owners and graziers who had not the outfit, the mental equipment, the knowledge or the hands available for the work. There is a gold mine in the wheat-producing areas which would employ thousands of men.  It is a mistake to think that the farm labourer is an unskilled workman.  Unless he is a skilled workman, he cannot do his job.  He is an exceedingly skilled workman, although not looked upon by urban workers as such.  Unless he is a skilled worker, he is a very unprofitable investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was rather surprising to me to learn a few days ago that some men who got a training in agriculture in our principal college in Glasnevin, and who had their practical degree in agricultural science, had failed to find a place here.  These people have got their passports for England, although they were trained, in many cases, at the expense of the State.  That is a matter into which the Minister should inquire&mdash;whether the services of the products of these colleges, educated in some cases with the aid of public <Col N="531" /> scholarships, are being utilised in giving instruction to people who need it. The procedure in the country is for a person who owns grass lands and has not equipment of his own to depend upon a contractor, who is generally a farmer himself, to do the sowing and reaping for him.  He has not the men of his own.  I say that the men should be made available.  I know that the great difficulty at the moment is in procuring machinery.  Because of that lack of men and machinery, these people cannot sow or reap when they like and they cannot market their crop properly under the present disorganised and haphazard system in regard to the cultivation of wheat.</P>
    <P>I add my voice to that of the previous speaker in favour of a well-organised plan for the cultivation of wheat.  I am not thinking merely of having instructors running about and telling people that they will have to do this and that.  Every agricultural committee, on which you have, in nearly every case, practical farmers, should be made responsible for its own county or area, in the same way as a county surveyor has been made responsible for the production of a certain amount of turf.  It is futile to have a number of inspectors, whether they come from the City of Dublin or some local centre, running about to see what has been done.  It would be much more effective if these people who propose to grow cereals were brought together and given proper instruction.  More use should be made of the agricultural instructors whom we have in every county.</P>
    <P>The way in which farmers have ignored the great advantages to be derived from courses by skilled agricultural instructors is deplorable.  Farmers are very much to blame in that respect. As I have said, there is a gold mine in wheat in the areas which should be scheduled.  The lands in the poorer districts and the lands which have been cultivated for the last three years or so should get a rest.  The larger ranches should be gone in upon and worked directly by the Government, if necessary, or by some form of co-operative movement.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak at all, but Senator Fitzgerald's speech would get anyone on his feet. The speech was unworthy even of Senator Fitzgerald.  He criticised the Government for increasing the price of wheat to 50/- when, as he said, the Government believed it was unjust.  I do not agree that the Government held that it was an unjust price at any time. I can see the reason for the Government's attitude.  The welfare and the well-being of the people are more important than an extra 5/- or 6/- or 10/- per barrel for any particular crop.  If the Government were convinced that to get the requisite amount of wheat to provide food for the people it was necessary to increase the price to 50/-, then they were justified in increasing it, although there are plenty of farmers who were quite satisfied with 45/-.  In fact, there were farmers who were quite pleased with the results they got from the price of 40/- last year.  Again I wish to state very distinctly that, in my opinion, if it were necessary to increase the price to 60/- in order to save the people from the danger of actual starvation, the Government would be justified in increasing it to 60/-.  I was <Col N="533" /> rather struck by Senator Cummins' speech.  I think he was quite right in saying that the lands that could best grow wheat should be growing wheat. It is most unfair that poor lands should be used year after year to endeavour to produce a crop that could be far better grown on other lands.  Many of the smaller farmers have produced more than their share of that crop, although it may have done some injury to their land.  Senator Fitzgerald spoke of a machined majority.  Every Government must have a majority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the point raised by Senator Fitzgerald, it seems to me that the action of the Government on that occasion was quite logical and was in the interest of the community.  The House should remember that at the beginning of this crisis the Government set out to achieve two things: (1) to have sufficient food to supply the wants of the country; and (2) to maintain the stability of prices at a reasonable level.  They fixed the price of oats, barley, wheat and other commodities, and we must all agree that if the price level of agricultural products <Col N="534" /> and all other products and commodities could be maintained, it would be better for everybody.  But the fact was that the price of other articles which affected the farmers went up. The price of oats and barley went up in spite of the Government's endeavour to keep it down.  Because of the increased price of barley and oats, the position in regard to wheat became serious, and it was necessary that the price should be increased by 5/-.  Then a strong agitation developed with regard to the price of wheat.  There was an agitation, in fact, to have it increased to £3.</P>
      <P>I am strongly in favour of the 50/-, and was impressed with the necessity of giving it.  I realise, however, that in the present situation it was not easy for the Government to increase the price by 5/- a barrel.  But the danger was that the time was passing when the seed should be sown, and if a general agitation continued to have the price of wheat increased, that valuable time would pass when the seed should be sown.  The position was that it was better for everybody that the wheat should be sown.  The main thing for the Government was to see that wheat should be sown, and that there should be no opportunity for propaganda or agitation which would have the effect of preventing the sowing of wheat.  I am glad the Government have seen their way to give the 50/-, because everyone knows that it will result in an increased acreage of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of seed is so urgently necessary that the Government should give special facilities for the procuring of seed wheat.  Seed wheat is very costly.  The great majority of the farmers, especially in the new tillage districts, have not any capital to spare. At this time of the year in the dairying districts money is very scarce, and most of the farmers are not in a position to purchase any quantity of seed wheat.  Therefore, I think the Government would be well advised to guarantee the merchants for any seed which they may supply to the growers.  I think it is only common sense, when a man is willing to sow wheat and has no money to buy seed, that he should be in a position to get whatever seed <Col N="535" /> he requires and pay for it when his harvest comes in.  If that were done, I feel confident, and I am told by those who are in a position to know, that there would be many thousands extra acres of wheat sown that will not be sown if these facilities are not available.</P>
    <P>I also agree with what Senator Cummins said that there should be more co-operative effort in regard to the growing of wheat.  I urge that the resources of the county councils should be utilised to assist in ploughing the land.  There is a scarcity of tractors, especially in the new tillage districts. There is also a scarcity of reapers and binders and there was a scarcity of threshing mills last year.  I know of one district where thousands of pounds worth of wheat went to loss for want of threshing machines.  I think that all the machinery and labour facilities of the county councils, and even of the Army, should be made available for the purpose of helping these people to till their land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. MacCabe Mr. MacCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to a few matters in connection with wheat growing.  I understood some Senators to refer to the soil and to say that the growing of wheat was robbing the soil and that if we continued to grow wheat for a number of years there would be no return.  In the majority of cases, however, the small farmers generally sow their wheat in ground that grew potatoes the year previous, and that ground would have sufficient farmyard manure to produce a good crop of wheat the following year. There is a large number of counties in Ireland which have small farms that are not in a position to grow a large amount of wheat.  They grow sufficient to supply food for their own homes and for the animals on the farms, but to say that they would have wheat for sale in the spring months or any other part of the year would be ridiculous. It would be impossible for them because they have not sufficient with which to carry on.  I sometimes feel amused when I hear some farmers speaking on this matter of tillage and an increased price for farm produce, because I myself know that they have <Col N="536" /> nothing to sell.  As a matter of fact, they are out in the market in the spring months, to use a common phrase, with the bag under their arm, looking for a few stone of oats or wheat, and a few stone of potatoes very often.  I could understand farmers, having large farms and raising a big amount of wheat, oats and barley, looking for an increased price for their produce.  I would say that they are practical farmers and men who are entitled to speak for the farming community, and I could certainly understand their looking for an increase in price.</P>
      <P>We must consider also that the poor people, for instance, who will have to buy the flour that is milled from the wheat will have to pay an extra price for that flour.  They have no land and are not in a position to grow wheat. We must also consider the small farmers, the men with ten, 12 or 14 acres of land, who perhaps also have to go to the market or to the miller and buy wheat or flour at a very high cost.  We should not try to assist the large farmer at the expense of the small farmer and the labourer.  A uniform price should be fixed and, in my opinion, the 50/- that has been fixed for wheat is a reasonable price.  There is no doubt whatever that if any farmer tried to exert himself and was serious about the position, he could grow at least sufficient wheat for his own home and, if he has a couple of acres of land, he certainly could grow some wheat for sale.  He would be what I call a practical farmer and would be really in earnest about his work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to delay the House.  I think I can express my pleasure at the turn events have taken. After all, when we listened to the Minister for Agriculture on the evening that I moved my motion, the position seemed rather hopeless and one felt that we were running up against a stone wall in view of the attitude he was adopting.  Now, while the Minister, perhaps, felt called upon to address himself to the motion in that particular fashion, I had the idea that at the back of his mind he believed there was a good deal in the arguments we were <Col N="537" /> advancing.  I always felt that the Minister's own view about it was that what the motion contained was reasonable and fair, and when the Government have gone the length of conceding that 50/- to the farmers for wheat grown this coming season, my line is to compliment them on their decision.  I will go further and say that by that decision they have created very favourable reactions. I have spoken to a number of people, and I know that members of this House and of the other House have discussed the position with farmers, and all these people have indicated a completely changed attitude towards the growing of wheat.</P>
      <P>Now, that is all to the good.  I am, however, convinced that now that the Government have done this, all of us have got an obligation upon us to press upon the farmers, both by example and by word, to put every possible acre of wheat in that they can manage. Other speakers here on a previous occasion&mdash;and I heard the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures say it in my own county&mdash;have said that we could easily do it, but I think it is a mighty task.  We are going to do something that we have not done for many generations in this country. Now, we want the wheat, and I think the Government have behaved reasonably. I am not going to comment on the time of their decision or on their altered point of view or anything like that.  I think that is not the line to take at this juncture.  I think it is better to say that they have done what is the right thing and we must all help to get the wheat grown.  As far as I am concerned, or as far as anybody with whom I have any contracts is concerned, whatever help I can give I am giving. I am glad the Government have given us this chance and I believe that the whole attitude will be changed.  The Minister for Agriculture knows as well as anybody else that the farmer, like other people, always does what pays, and you cannot expect him, any more than anybody else, to engage in something that will lose money for him, and if there is money in wheat the farmer will grow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that the necessities of the situation raise all sorts of problems <Col N="538" /> and difficulties with regard to the land on which wheat can be grown. Senator Cummins raised some questions in regard to the growing of wheat in certain parts of the country, but this is not all so simple at all.  I should like to compliment Senator Hawkins on his approach to this matter this evening.  It is always a pleasure to listen to him, because his approach is always intelligent and fresh, and he made one point on which I should like some information or to which I think some consideration should be given.  None of us wants the poor to pay more than they are able to pay, and we know that for most commodities, such as food, clothing and so on, the poor to-day have to pay much more than they are able to pay. Now, the statement has been made that this is going to mean an increase in prices.  I am not quite clear how that is going to come about.  It has to be recognised that we are subsidising the millers to the extent of £2,000,000 for the production of flour in the present year.  Some of our wheat cost 40/- and more of it cost, I think, 80/-, or perhaps a little more, and we understand from the Minister for Supplies that if what we have been trying to get from abroad arrives here it is going to cost 60/-.  I cannot see how, if we can get enough wheat at 50/- in our country, the price is going to be raised, but even if it is to be raised as a result of paying the farmers 50/-, in the first place it is better to have flour to buy at 50/- than to have none at all. When you come to making it possible for the poor to buy it, I think we will have to face that question also, and it is mere piffle to be talking about the price being too high when you know that you are creating a situation whereby neither the poor man nor the rich man will have the money to pay if you do not raise the price to a certain level.  If we have to face a situation in which we have to make a further contribution so as to keep the price of flour within reach of the poor man, the State and the community must provide the means.</P>
    <P>There is a certain attitude of mind on the part of some people in regard to the growing of wheat, and the more quickly they disabuse themselves of <Col N="539" /> that the better.  Senator Cummins in discussing the growing of wheat in Meath and Kildare talked about people scratching the ground.  There may be one or two farmers in Meath, and perhaps one or two in Kildare, who do that, but I do not know of any farmer who scratches the ground to grow any crop.  When a farmer goes to the trouble of paying labour to put in a crop, he is very anxious to do his best to get the best return, and I think the Senator's point is one that should not be stressed.  There are, perhaps, some poor farmers badly equipped with poor machines, or with equipment of a character that is not capable of doing the work efficiently, but on the whole I do not think there is much justification for talking about farmers scratching the ground or for saying that it is due to that that wheat yields are so low.  It is a phrase that should not be used, because it is a slander on farmers generally.</P>
    <P>The Senator went on to talk about making county committees responsible for getting certain things done.  I am a member of a county committee for a great many years.  I think our committees would be happy to assist but I do not know they would like to have that obligation put on them.  To demand that service from men who on the whole are hard workers on their own farms, to ask them to accept the responsibility to see that wheat is grown and that the farmers work up to a certain level, is I think asking too much.  Many of those to whom they would go might be very hard workers and might be much better able to do the job than those who went to teach them.  There might be some foundation for the Senator's other suggestion that the farmers have ignored the technical advice given them in various counties but my experience is that the technical men are run off their feet trying to serve the farmers.  That is our experience anyway.  The truth is that the farmers are making such very heavy demands on the technical men that the present staff is hardly able to cope with them.  I do not want to advocate an addition to our staffs because there are limits.  To talk about imposing obligations <Col N="540" /> on men who grow wheat&mdash;and that suggestion was inherent in the motion of Senator Byrne&mdash;if you even talk about Meath and scheduling certain areas, is to ignore the real point at issue.  What the Minister should set about doing is what has been done in other countries, what should be done here on a scientific basis, namely, to get a really proper soil survey.  I think that the future of agriculture is bound up with the getting of such a survey made.  It may be that we shall have to divide our country into zones and to mark out certain areas in which we shall cultivate certain crops in accordance with the quality of the soil &mdash;its texture, its composition from the point of view of fertility, and other factors of that kind, but you cannot do that on any sort of sensible basis unless it be purely scientific.  If you make an order that wheat is to be grown in certain areas, there is not an area to which you will make that apply in which you will not find farms on which wheat could not be grown.  I think that most of this rule of thumb method in determining what farmers are to do is very unwise and ill-advised.</P>
    <P>There is just one point to which I want to refer particularly arising out of what I had to say on the last occasion&mdash;that is, my reference to the advice given by a technical expert as to the amount of fertility extracted from the soil by the growing of wheat. I know quite well it is very difficult for a politician to attempt to deal with a matter that has been dealt with by an expert, because the politician's way of putting it may be somewhat different from the way the expert would put his case and that might make all the difference in the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them are, and some of them think they are.  In my references on the last day to this matter, I made the point that when Professor Caffrey indicated that wheat was one of the lightest crops, in so far as the amount of fertility absorbed from the soil is concerned, that was not related to the facts as farmers understood them.  No one has drawn my <Col N="541" /> attention to this matter, but looking at the problem since and at what I said on that occasion, and considering the approach of Professor Caffrey to this question, I think I should say in justice to Professor Caffrey that I am prepared to concede that if you take a sample of wheat, submit it to chemical analysis and discover its composition, you may discover that the quantity of certain constituents which it has extracted from the soil would be smaller than that extracted by certain other cereals.  That may be true, and on that basis the expert is quite entitled to say that wheat will not extract any more from the soil than certain other cereals, but I think in justice to the farmer I should say that that is not our experience.  It is not my own personal experience nor is it the experience of a great many people with whom I have discussed the matter.  The fact is that after the growing of wheat, the soil is in an entirely different condition from that in which you find it after the growing of oats or barley.  I know that in the case of my own soil after a crop of winter wheat, nothing I could do would prevent the growth of scutch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no experience of the growing of winter oats.  I think the growing of winter oats need not be cited because of the extent to which it is grown.  I think you have to take crops with which we are generally familiar.  My experience, and I think it is the experience of farmers generally, is that after a wheat crop the condition of the soil is certainly inferior to that in which you find it after the growing of oats or barley.  You cannot grow a crop of wheat or a crop of scutch, which has family associations with it, without leaving the soil in a considerably worse condition than the condition in which you find it after growing oats or barley.  Whatever a chemical analysis may indicate, that is the practical experience of the farmer. I am not contradicting what has already been said on this matter.  I am rather attempting to clarify the position, and I do not want to do any injustice to Professor Caffrey as I might <Col N="542" /> appear to have done in my speech on the previous occasion.  I think it is true to say, however, that there is evidence up and down the country that the effects of the growing of wheat on our soil are not satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I was rather surprised the other day to hear a farmer like Deputy Hughes, a man whom most people recognise as being an efficient, competent, and capable farmer, say that his wheat yield was only 5½ barrels to the acre. One must be struck by such a statement coming from a man of the type of Deputy Hughes&mdash;an intelligent man, physically very competent, a man who knows his job and who does his farming well.  He has been cultivating beet and in fact has engaged in every type of tillage.  He is a man of practical experience and he told us that was his yield last year.  When you get low yields like that, you are really up against the position that you have to admit that the growing of wheat is not at all simple, that we were expecting too much, too high a yield.</P>
      <P>I know for a fact that on the best land in Meath last year the yield was only four barrels to the acre.  As against that, I know that Senator McGee reaped 15 barrels and some of his neighbours 16 barrels to the acre. That is much higher than the average. Whatever the effect on the land, or the consequences with regard to raising the price of flour, what we are all after is to get the wheat, to get the farmers to do the job to the best of their ability.  Some of them will do it well, some not so well.  There will be a few who are inefficient, and there will be some to grumble about the price.  Some will want 60/- and I know that a few, if they got 70/-, would not be satisfied. I never subscribe to that point of view. As a nation we will never get anywhere by making extravagant demands on the community.  We have difficulties and problems.  There is no use in men like Senator Cummins telling us that we can order people to grow wheat anywhere.  In my opinion, the more we order the people the less we get done. Farmers were hard hit, but they are independent and can make up their own minds in these matters.  A great deal will not be done by ordering them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> Farmers can stand a great many kicks, but if dealt with in a reasonable way that will have more effect.  In my opinion, there is reason in the decision of the Government with regard to wheat, and it is my belief that farmers will rise to the occasion to the best of their ability.  Despite the attitude of the Minister on a previous occasion, I am glad that we may be able to get the House to accept this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion, which stands in the names of Senators Campbell, Cummins, Tunney, and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Eireann is of opinion, complementary to the announcement of increased minimum prices for certain agricultural products, it is essential to increase substantially wages payable to agricultural workers and to effect reasonable amelioration of their conditions of employment, and requests that the necessary steps to these ends be taken immediately.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that this motion is coming on at such a late hour, because I regard it as one of the utmost importance.  We have been discussing the price of wheat.  As far as the farmer is represented in this House, it is agreed that the price arranged for wheat is a fair price.  It is important to note that, but I do not think anyone will admit that the rate of wages paid to agricultural labourers is a fair one.  I do not think anybody professing Christianity could stand over the wages that are being paid to our agricultural labourers. Speaking on the motion dealing with the price of wheat, we on these benches advocated an increase in order that those engaged in agriculture should have a reasonable standard of living.  We had in mind all the people engaged in agriculture.  The farmer, apparently, is pretty well satisfied with the price arranged for the wheat crop. We are speaking on behalf of the neglected men in agriculture.  We have about 100,000 farm labourers.  They are split into three groups for the purpose of arranging what is termed a wage by the Agricultural Wages Board, a body set up by the Government.  In group I, the rate arranged is 30/- a week, and in group II, it is 31/6 a week. In the vicinity of big cities and large centres of population the rate is 36/- a week.  Nobody will try to defend a wage of that standard. I am sure nobody in this House could possibly maintain himself on that much money, not to talk of having to rear and educate a family.  It could not be done on such a miserable wage with anything approaching comfort.</P>
      <P>In view of the national emergency we are trying to induce the farmers to produce more crops, particularly wheat; but satisfying the farmers is not sufficient.  We must have a contented body of agricultural labourers if we are to get the best possible results from our campaign to grow more wheat.  Amongst the 100,000 agricultural labourers are the men who will be expected to man the defences in the event of invasion.  This is how we treat them&mdash;giving them wages such as I have alluded to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain social evils from <Col N="547" /> which this country has been, and is, suffering.  I will instance the overcrowding of the cities and, latterly, the great flood of emigration, the exodus of the people who ought to be tilling the land and producing food for the nation.  We do not suggest it is possible to remedy all those evils at the present time, but it is possible to give these people covered by the motion a wage that will enable them to attain a reasonable standard of living. Immediately across the water there is a minimum wage of £3 a week being paid to workers, and a person does not have to be over 20 years of age to get that amount.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, in his wisdom&mdash;and I agree with him up to a point&mdash;is refusing to give permits to our agricultural labourers to go across there and get the benefit of that higher rate of wages.  He is preventing people going where there is a reasonable standard of wages provided for their labour&mdash;and that is all they have, their labour.  Other people are prepared to pay a fair price for it.  Are we going to keep these people at home and compel them to exist on the miserable standards which we have set out for them?  The farmers are fairly well satisfied, but are these men going to be satisfied?  Are these men going to make the effort we expect from them in order to produce the nation's food if we are indifferent to the standard of comfort at which they ought to live?</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate opposition from any part of the House in connection with this motion.  I am sure every Senator appreciates the situation just as much as I do.  These men are absolutely unorganised.  They have no one to plead their case and, consequently, we have to do what is obviously our duty to these downtrodden people, irrespective of whether they are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour. They are citizens of this country and they are prepared to give the labour that we require so badly.  Therefore, it is our simple duty to pay them a wage on which they can maintain themselves and their families in a reasonable standard of comfort.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> I do not think I need occupy the time of the House very much longer, because I do not see any reason why this motion should be opposed by any section.  In order to save time, I should like to refer to the amendment in the name of Senator Counihan.  I know he has given the matter a good deal of consideration and, when forming the amendment, has called into counsel a number of wise heads.  He mentions in his amendment a committee of experts. I suggest that what he wants is a committee of magicians, because their job would be to increase the wages of the labourers without any loss to the farmers.  We have already had experts; we saw them performing on various committees and we know their ability to perform.  If we got together a committee of experts to deal with this simple matter, I believe the harvest for 1943 would be in before they would have their minds made up.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words from the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;employment&rdquo;, inclusive, and substitute therefor the following words: &ldquo;desirable that a small expert committee be appointed to consider and report as to what steps, if any, can be taken to increase wages payable to agricultural workers and to improve their conditions of employment, without placing an unbearable burden on the farmers&rdquo;; and to delete the words &ldquo;to these ends&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The motion would then read:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Eireann is of opinion, complementary to the announcement of increased minimum prices for certain agricultural products, it is desirable that a small expert committee be appointed to consider and report as to what steps, if any, can be taken to increase wages payable to agricultural workers and to improve their conditions of employment, without placing an unbearable burden on the farmers, and requests that the necessary steps be taken immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With most of what Senator Foran said as regards the wages of agricultural workers I agree.  I agree that it is very desirable to increase their wages, but how it can be done is a matter, in my opinion, for an expert committee to inquire into the whole conditions of the agricultural industry and see what improvement could be made to increase the agricultural workers' as well as the farmers' incomes.  It has been proved <Col N="550" /> that many farmers have less for their work and for their families' labour than the present minimum wage which they pay to their agricultural workers.  A lot has been said about the increased prices which the Government very grudgingly guaranteed for the 1942 wheat and beet crops.  I do not know very much about the growing of beet, but I am sure I can prove to the House that 50/- a barrel for wheat is not a very remunerative price under present conditions and is not a sufficient price to leave a margin to pay increased wages.  The 50/- a barrel is not the minimum price; it is the maximum price for millable wheat, weighing 59 lbs. to the bushel.  The price goes down after that to 46/-, and a good deal of the wheat grown this year may not be millable at all and we have to take that risk into account.</P>
    <P>I can definitely say from my own experience, and I have some experience of the growing of wheat, that when the guaranteed price for wheat was 30/- a barrel it was a more remunerative price than 50/- is this year. When the price was 30/- my land produced ten barrels to the statute acre, which gave a return of £15.  Last year the produce was less than seven barrels, and at 40/- the return was only £14.  I cannot hope for more than six barrels to the acre this year, which, at the increased price of 50/-, will give a return of £15, and, as the overhead charges and harvesting expenses have increased very much since then, it means that that return, at the price of 50/- a barrel, is not quite as good as when the price was 30/-.</P>
    <P>If you examine the returns which the farmer has for his oats, barley, potatoes and root crops, you will also find that he is not in a position to pay increased wages.  Oats, barley and root crops are mainly grown for stall-feeding cattle, and stall-feeding this season would not leave any profit. Stall-feeding never paid unless there was a substantial rise in the price of beef between the time the cattle were put in and the time they were sold. That did not happen this year.  The controlled price of beef was 11d. a lb. on the 1st December, and that had grown to be the controlled price until <Col N="551" /> next April, then it had to go on to June, to 12d. a lb., while last year, in June, we were getting 12½d. for it.  So where are the prospects of paying an increased wage to agricultural workers? I would also like to remind the House in connection with this matter that our livestock trade was held up for nine months of this year through foot and mouth disease, with disastrous results to the farmers, and very many of them have been left in a very bad financial position.</P>
    <P>If this amendment of mine is accepted, I can assure the Seanad that there is no section of the community more anxious to improve the conditions of the agricultural workers than the farmers themselves, and I am sure that whatever recommendations this committee would propose would be faithfully carried out by the farmers to improve the conditions of their agricultural workers, but what the farmer has not got for himself or his family he cannot give to his agricultural workers, and he cannot afford to give more than the present rate to his workers.  Can I discuss the amendment in the name of Senator Baxter, Sir?</P>

      <P>Well, the only thing I have to say with regard to Senator Baxter's amendment is that if a few experts are put in on that committee, which is proposed to be set up, it would be a good thing, but in an organisation of accountants, such as his amendment proposes, I have not very much confidence.  If you want to take costings into account you will have to consider all the different branches of agriculture, you will have to consider the whole revenue which the farmer derives from his undertakings, and you will have to consider what profit or loss he will have to meet if he is in a position to pay an increased rate to his agricultural workers. I agree with Senator Foran that we should not delay the House, and I think neither of us delays the House by making very long speeches.  I have put the case fairly and squarely, that <Col N="552" /> there is no opposition to improving the lot of the agricultural workers.  There are no people more anxious than the farmers are to do it, but as regards the way to do it, I think it should be left in the hands of an expert committee of practical farmers, who would know something about the job which they were tackling, and not a costings organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDoyle" hpid="Dr. Doyle Dr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Counihan's amendment, and I am seconding it, not for the purpose of shelving the motion.  There is one thing that Senators Foran and Counihan have in common, and it is that they are agreed that there should be an increase in the wages of agricultural labourers, and I think that the whole thing is to find out what is the best way of doing it. I cannot agree with Senator Foran's idea that it should be complementary on the announcement of an increased minimum price for, say, wheat.  I regard the increased price of wheat this year as being merely an offset to avoid a loss.  It is not that the farmer will get any more money, say, next October for the same acreage of wheat. It is simply to avoid a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole trend of legislation for a number of years has been against the agricultural labourer.  For instance, for about three months of the year the agricultural labourer is left without unemployment assistance.  In the summer time he is supposed to be able to find work or go fish or do something like that.  He is cut off from all sources of benefit for a certain portion of the year.  Then the widows and orphans of an agricultural labourer get less money than those of an urban worker.  The agricultural worker is also excluded from the scheme of food vouchers.  So that the whole trend of legislation has been against the agricultural labourer and rather in favour of the urban or town worker.  Unless you make the wages of the agricultural labourer at least equal to the wages of the urban worker the flight from the land will continue.  I know young boys of 18 years of age in what I call a secondary industry who are earning more money than their fathers who have been working on the land all their lives.  If that secondary industry were <Col N="553" /> to close down to-morrow those boys would emigrate; they would never go back to the land again.  If you want to keep such people on the land you must at least make their wages equal to the wages of the workers in the towns or cities.</P>
    <P>Because the price of wheat has been increased by 10/- a barrel that does not mean, as I said, that the farmer will make more money.  Mr. Twomey, who has had 40 years' experience of the farming industry, gave it as his considered evidence at the Banking Commission that in the best of times the farmer could not earn 5 per cent. on his capital.  This year a subsidy of £2,000,000 was given to the milling industry whose declared dividend was over 6 per cent.  Therefore, if the price of wheat is increased, it does not follow that that should mean an increase in the price of bread or sugar or any of those things.</P>
    <P>Another thing is that the price of food and clothing has gone up considerably, especially the price of clothing. I was told yesterday that a workingman's shirt, which used to cost 5/-, now costs 14/6; that a pair of boots, which used to cost 21/-, now costs 35/-. All these things are in favour of an increase of wages, but I cannot see that the cost of that should be put on the farmer, because he cannot bear it and some other method must be found. Probably the system of family allowances would be a good idea.</P>
    <P>When I read in the papers of a supplementary budget in the United States of America for £6,000,000,000 and in about a week another one for £5,000,000,000 or £6,000,000,000, I often wonder how all this money can be provided in time of war.  In times of peace we do not see anything like that happening.  In England, another country which is at war, they are spending, I think, £16,000,000 per day. In times of peace they had some millions unemployed but they did not spend one-tenth of that sum per day then.  So that in case of an emergency it seems to me the countries can find money.  Our country is in a declared state of emergency now.  Why cannot this State, therefore, find the money and put it into the most essential industry <Col N="554" /> that it has, namely, agriculture? I think the Minister should adopt a very bold forward policy.  He should approach the Minister for Finance, the man who holds the purse, and pour money into agriculture and make it prosperous.  The secondary industries, or some of them anyway, can at least carry on, and in that way I believe the country would be more prosperous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion, if the House accepts my amendment, would read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Eireann is of opinion, complementary to the announcement of increased minimum prices for certain agricultural products, it is essential to increase substantially wages payable to agricultural workers provided it has been determined by a technical agricultural costings organisation that such agricultural prices can bear increased costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot pay money unless you have got the money.  You cannot pay it out of agriculture, you cannot pay it out of industry, unless the earnings provide you with the cash.  I am all with the people who argue that the agricultural labourer ought to be better paid.  I think everybody on the land ought to be better paid, much better paid than they are.  I never subscribed to the point of view, and I think it is fatal to our whole future as a nation, that the agricultural worker must be the most lowly paid citizen in the State. It is not that the agricultural worker is not an industrious man.  Neither is he a stupid nor unintelligent man.  On the contrary, our agricultural workers are probably the most intelligent workers in our community.  They have to be, because the industry in its way is the most technical and diversified industry we have in the country.  In other industries some men know something about one side of the industry and others know something about another side.  But the good agricultural labourer has to know everything about every side of the agricultural industry. You cannot have such workers unless they are treated like workers elsewhere and it is, I think, a reflection on us <Col N="555" /> that from the beginning of this State the agricultural worker was not put in a position equal in status to workers in other branches of industry both in town and in country.</P>
    <P>I think it must be conceded that the agricultural worker was not well paid because the farmer who employed him was not himself well paid.  Some years ago the Agricultural Wages Act was put through the Oireachtas.  I sometimes wonder how it was that that Act went through without any serious challenge.  We set up an Agricultural Wages Board and it has been operating now for three or four years.  I think we might say it has been operating absolutely on a rule-of-thumb basis.  It has been arbitrarily deciding what agricultural workers' wages are to be without any sort of technical examination of the agricultural position to determine the capacity of the industry to pay the wages.</P>
    <P>We started first with a wage of 24/- weekly.  Later the amount was raised to 27/-, and it is now 30/- weekly.  It has to be conceded that the wages were determined at the time when conditions in the agricultural industry here were extremely bad.  We have not here what they have in other countries, any sort of technical organisation for determining costs in agriculture.  In fact, we are one of the most backward countries in the world in that respect. We know that for years the Oxford Research Institute on Agricultural Economics has studied costings in every branch of agriculture in England intimately and accurately.  It is a matter of complaint that so few of the publications of this institute are available for examination here.  I noticed recently that attached to the University of New South Wales a costings organisation has been established, headed by an economist, and with four or five other experts attached to the staff.  Here we are in the position that while we have been declaiming against the conditions and the incapacity to bear increased burdens, it is true to say that we have been rarely able to advance figures to prove our contention. We know from our experience in the industry that after outgoings have <Col N="556" /> been transferred to the pockets of other people, who make claims against us, there is practically nothing left for the owners, the farmers who have to meet all the obligations imposed on them in carrying on and managing the industry.  No attempt has ever been made to arrive at what the costings in agriculture are.  That situation should not be permitted to continue.</P>
    <P>I noticed that in the Minister's speech in Cork recently, which was briefly reported, he referred to the fact that the Government method of price-fixing with regard to agricultural commodities was unsatisfactory, and that some other plan would have to be adopted.  I do not know what he hinted at, but I am encouraged to think by his statement that he considers the present plan is unsatisfactory. We have crossed swords in this House and in the other House about the price of wheat, and the Minister when examining my statement indicated that I was not quite sure whether 50/- a barrel was a paying price or not.  That is true.  We have various figures of costings regarding the production of wheat.  If the costings on some farms were put against the costings on other farms they would show a dead loss.  It is the truth to say that as far as agriculture is concerned either for dairying, tillage farming, or stock raising, no costings are available to determine exactly what it means to the farmer to put these commodities on the market.  The net result is that farmers are faced with motions like the present one and are not able to say that from personal experience they are not able to bear the burdens that increased agricultural wages would put upon them.  If you ask farmers to produce figures they are not available.  There was at one time a costings officer attached to the Department of Agriculture. Cost of production on various farms was collected.  It was not a really scientific examination of the cost of production but an approximation. I think the work of that officer has been discontinued and, if so, it is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>Regarding the future of agriculture it has come to this, that if the farmer and his family are to live on the land, <Col N="557" /> and if agricultural workers are to be kept on the land, it must be made worth their while in terms of £ s. d. They are not flying from the land because they dislike the land, but but because they dislike the conditions that are imposed upon them.  I have some figures showing the proportion of the national income of farmers and of people in towns.  Professor Duncan calculated that the national income is £167,000,000 of which £106,000,000 goes to 1,000,000 people living in towns and cities, and £67,000,000 to 1,900,000 people living on the land.  It is obvious that the reason why people in the country are flying to the towns is in order to get a bigger slice of the £106,000,000, and also because conditions there are easier and more attractive. That is why the people are leaving the land.  We cannot afford to be soft-spoken any longer about that problem.  We should face facts.  It is deplorable that more has not been done with regard to determining costs in agriculture.  The time is ripe to do it, because justice cannot be done to the industry until we know the cost of production, and create a situation when farmers will get something more than cost of production.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Senators are aware of the work that was done by Professor Murphy of University College, Cork, in the course of a survey that he made a couple of years ago in certain areas in Cork and Limerick, on some of the best land in Ireland.  That survey does not claim to be an absolutely perfect examination of the position, but Professor Murphy took 98 dairy and other farms comprising probably the best land in Europe.  The area of the farms ranged from 20 acres to 150 acres.  At that time labourers were paid 24/- weekly, and he estimated that farmers and their sons who worked on the land would have about 14/- weekly. My experience is that farmers and members of their families work as hard as any agricultural labourers that are brought in.</P>

      <P>I want any Senator to prove that it is within the power of the farmers to do more for their workers, having regard to the condition in which the agricultural industry is said to be. The income that farmers get for the work they do in agriculture will have to be a very big share of their total income.  That is the important point. It is only when it comes to the balancing of the budget that one can appreciate how little there is left for them after the hard work that farmers put into agriculture.  Apparently my presentation of the case presented by Professor Murphy is contested, but these figures have not been challenged in public.  It would be a good thing if they could be publicly challenged.  If there are people with trained minds who hold the opposite point of view, it would be helpful if the figures were challenged, because nothing is more injurious regarding our understanding of the whole situation with regard to agriculture than to permit any presentation of facts or alleged facts as to the real position, to go unchallenged, if there is a contrary case to be made. It is all to the good that such a case should be made.  I am putting the facts as revealed by Professor Murphy's survey in Limerick and Cork.  Senator O'Dwyer and Senator O'Callaghan know that area, and presumably know some of the farmers, and their incomes, and if they could tell us that conditions now are different I would be prepared to listen to them.  I would like to hear the facts from people acquainted with them.  From my experience I think the figures given in the survey are in accordance with facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the attention of the Labour Party to this, that up to date, as far as can be observed, there has been no increase in agricultural prices.  There have been considerable increases in agricultural costs, and in future we may expect a great addition to these costs, inasmuch as I feel that we are likely to have decreased yields over <Col N="560" /> the whole crop area this year.  It cannot be contested that the shortage of artificial manures this year is going to play a part in reducing crop yields, and to the extent that that affects the fertility of soil, costs of production will be correspondingly raised.</P>
    <P>It does not matter what kind of activity the farmer engages in, he finds that his costs are increasing, even the shoeing of horses, his equipment and machinery.  In every respect his costs are rising before there is any appreciable increase in his returns.  We are speaking in terms of tillage areas and presumably in reference to an increased price that farmers are to obtain in the distant future for their crops, and in reference to which Senator Foran's motion is introduced, but the outstanding fact is that we will probably have 3,000,000 acres of tillage while there are 9,000,000 acres of arable land.  These 9,000,000 acres are going to be a very big factor for the farmer who has to pay labour.  What will farmers get in the way of income from the produce of these 9,000,000 acres?  Prices of milk and butter are at a standstill.  There has been a persistent decline in dairying.  That fact must be recognised.  I pay a tribute every opportunity I get to the Minister for Agriculture because he has done a great deal about the price of butter. He has probably done his best for the industry, but I have argued that he should do more.  The revenue from the 9,000,000 acres is a much bigger factor in determining what wages agricultural workers will receive in future than the Labour Party is prepared to recognise. Can anybody tell me that the profit on agriculture has ever been determined or that any attempt has ever been made accurately to measure the position?</P>
    <P>With regard to agricultural policy for the future, what we have got to realise in relation to our internal affairs, and also our external exports, is that we have got to get a basis and to know what it is costing agriculture to put its products on the markets.  We have to fight in the future for a price that will leave farmers with a reasonable return. A great deal has been said, and it is the popular point of view, about standing <Col N="561" /> for the old competitive system in the sale of agricultural products.  In the past the competitive system brought about such a situation that milk at creameries was worth only about 6d. per gallon.  That left farmers with pigs and poultry products at such a level that they were not able to pay agricultural workers.  Agriculturists in every other land are in the same plight. Wheat growers on the Canadian prairies are declaiming against their Government and demanding a rise in prices on the ground they cannot meet the cost of living.  I am anxious that there should be a technical examination of the position, to see what was left to agriculturists after their costings were made up.  I should like to see responsible people here put into possession of such facts as would enable them in the future to take part in an international conference, when the future of the world will be reshaped, at which they would struggle to see that the prices of agricultural commodities would be raised to a level that would give something more than the cost of production to farmers, in order to pay labourers.  In my view we have reached a stage in the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
