      <P>My object in putting down the amendments that stand in my name on the Paper was more to elicit information than to propose a wording over which I would be absolutely prepared to stand.  The first amendment, in my name, reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to delete all words from and including the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 41, to and including the word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; in line 44, and to insert instead thereof the words &ldquo;the President shall.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment, which I now move, has as its object to delete from the Bill the phrase &ldquo;and the Government determines that such proposal shall be submitted by referendum to the decision of the people&rdquo; etc.  The other amendments have as their object to substitute the word &ldquo;President&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in the various sections concerned with the carrying out of the referendum.  The object of these amendments, taken together, is to bring the Bill into line with the Constitution, as I understand the Constitution.  It seems to me that in the Bill, and especially in that clause referring to the determination of the Government that such proposals shall be submitted by referendum to the decision of the people, something new is being imported into the Constitution, something which is not in the text of the Constitution.  The Government, apparently, are taking there a power that the Constitution does not give them.  In Article 46 of the Constitution the wording seems to me to be entirely mandatory.  Clause 2 of Article 46 reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Every proposal for an amendment of this Constitution shall be initiated in Dáil Eireann as a Bill, and shall upon having been passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, be <Col N="567" /> submitted by referendum to the decision of the people in accordance with the law for the time being in force relating to the referendum.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that the reference to &ldquo;the law for the time being in force relating to the referendum&rdquo; simply means the machinery for the time being for carrying out the referendum; it does not refer to any possibility of having the referendum postponed or giving the Government any power to do anything else except at once submit Constitution amendments to a referendum of the people.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, then, that that sentence in Section 8 goes altogether beyond the Constitution and that it should be deleted.  Again, the reference to the Minister, it seems to me, also implies some power being given to the Minister as a member of the Government, which it is not intended by the Constitution that he should have.  I am putting down these amendments not because I am an admirer of the machinery that has been adopted in the Constitution, or because I am in any respect a strong believer in the referendum for Constitutional purposes, but because I do not like to see a certain untidiness being admitted into a Bill in the way it is proposed to be done here, or to see a sentence in a Bill which seems to me to be completely against the spirit of the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose I ought to begin by admitting at once that, so far as the provisions of Clause 2 of Article 46 of the Constitution are concerned, the position is not at all pellucid.  It would appear, on a first reading, as if the point which Senator Tierney has made was correct, that this clause of the Article makes it mandatory to hold a referendum as soon as a proposal to amend the Constitution has passed both Houses of the Oireachtas.  On the other hand, that Article might also be taken as defective to the extent that it does not impose upon any organ of the State the responsibility for taking a <Col N="568" /> referendum or the duty of arranging for a referendum to be taken.  There is, apart from that, however, a difference in wording between Clause 2 and Clause 5 of Article 46, which, I think, is of importance in this connection.  I might paraphrase Clause 2 by saying that it states that every proposal for an amendment of this Constitution shall, upon having been passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, be submitted by referendum to the decision of the people.  It might be argued&mdash;I am not saying that it could be conclusively argued&mdash;that the proper construction of that clause in the Article might be held to be that as soon as a proposal to amend the Constitution had passed both Houses of the Oireachtas it should thereupon be submitted by referendum to the decision of the people. As against that, however, we have the phraseology of Clause 5 of the Article, which, I think, is very important. That clause reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A Bill containing a proposal for the amendment of this Constitution shall be signed by the President forthwith upon his being satisfied that the provisions of this Article have been complied with in respect thereof...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, I think that the difference in phraseology there is important in trying to construe the Article, because if the intention had been, as is suggested in certain quarters, that, immediately upon the passage of a proposal to amend the Constitution through both Houses of the Oireachtas, a referendum should have been taken, I think the phraseology which has been used in Clause 5 of the Article would also have appeared in Clause 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, that the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; would have appeared in Clause 2?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think that is what was in mind, bearing in mind what is the usual technique of draftsmanship. I think that the practice is not to use a differing phraseology, which might lead to a different construction, where in fact the same thing is to be implied, and therefore I think <Col N="569" /> that if there were uniformity of intent there would be uniformity in the verbal construction of each Article.  However, apart from that, we have this fact, that while Clause 2 states that a proposal to amend the Constitution cannot finally become Constitutional law until it has been submitted to the people and approved by the people, it does not place any responsibility upon any organ of the State to take that referendum.  On the other hand, in Clause 4 of Article 47 we have that, subject to certain provisos which really express the criteria by which the result of the plebiscite is to be determined, the statement that the referendum shall be regulated by law, and I take it that the real reason for that is that we could not embody in the Constitution detailed proposals for the referendum. I take it that the object of that Constitutional provision is to allow both Houses of the Oireachtas the fullest discretion and the fullest freedom in formulating the detailed provisions which would be necessary in order to enable a referendum to be taken effectively.  So, in the light of that, I do not think it could be argued very forcibly&mdash;not conclusively, at any rate &mdash;that the provisions of Section 8 of the Bill are repugnant to the Constitution, and I think that was the main point which Senator Tierney stated he had in view when he was putting down these amendments.</P>
      <P>Now, the next point that would arise on the amendments&mdash;if they are to be taken not merely as something to elucidate the Constitutional position&mdash;is this: that I do not think they make any significant change in the present provisions of the Bill.  The Bill provides that the Government shall determine that a proposal to amend the Constitution shall be submitted to the people.  It appears to give to the Government, and I think it does give to the Government, the option of deciding whether it shall take the conclusive step of submitting a Constitutional proposal, which we may assume it has been responsible for putting through both Houses of the Oireachtas, to the vote of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> Senator Tierney proposes to give to the President, in fact he proposes to make mandatory on the President, the duty of providing that steps to have a referendum shall be taken within one week.  But there we are in a rather difficult position, because Article 13 of the Constitution definitely limits the discretion of the President in regard to additional powers and functions conferred on him by law, for Clause 11 of Article 13 states that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No power or function conferred on the President by law shall be exercisable or performable by him save only on the advice of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now it seems to me that if we were to accept Senator Tierney's amendment in the form in which it stands, it could be held, and I think it would be held, that Section 8 (1) of the Bill, as Senator Tierney would propose to amend it, would be repugnant to the Constitution, for the section would confer on the President, first of all, an additional power and an additional function and it would make it mandatory on the President within one week after such determination, to appoint, by Order, the day upon which the polling on such referendum would take place.  On the other hand, in so far as Parliament may confer additional functions upon the President, it is provided by the Constitution that he can only exercise these functions on the advice of the Government. Accordingly, I think, as I have said, if we were to amend the section in the manner proposed by Senator Tierney, that we would be acting <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution and that that section of the Bill would be held to be repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In saying that I do not want for a moment to disguise the fact that a certain difficulty does exist in relation to proposals to amend the Constitution. Apparently, as the Constitution stands at present, and subject to any device which lawyers may be able to conceive of to deal with the situation, there does not appear to be in the Constitution any way in which a proposal to amend the Constitution can <Col N="571" /> be finally disposed of except by referendum.  If there is a proposal for ordinary legislation, and if the President does decide that it is of sufficient national importance to take the opinion of the people upon it, then that proposal, unless either a referendum or a general election occurs inside the space of 18 months, would appear under the Constitution automatically to lapse.  There is no such proviso, so far as I can see, governing the position of a Constitutional amendment, so that a Constitutional amendment can pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas and can remain in a state of suspended animation if the Government which passes it, or any succeeding Government, does not decide to take the voice of the people upon it.  In relation to proposals to amend the Constitution, once they have gone through both Houses of the Oireachtas, they would seem to be removed completely from the control of the Government, with the exception which we propose in this Bill, and to remain in a state of suspended animation until some unspecified authority elects to take a referendum upon it.</P>
    <P>Now, the position we are in is this: that, in order to get over that difficulty, we think that the Government which was responsible for initiating a proposal to amend the Constitution should determine whether it is to travel the whole course and submit the Bill finally to the people.  There is nothing which we can do beyond that which would really bind the Government to do the latter and which, at the same time, would not be <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution.  Therefore, we can only do this, so far as I can see at this stage: we can only say that if the Government elects to take a referendum upon this proposal to amend the Constitution, then within a certain statutory period that referendum shall be taken.  As I have shown, I do not think that it makes any effective difference to substitute the President for the Government in determining if and when a referendum shall be taken, because, if we were to adopt Senator Tierney's amendment, it would be only a change in form and no change <Col N="572" /> at all in substance, as the President would be bound to act on the advice of the Government, and, if the Government elected to advise him to the contrary, so far as this Bill is concerned I do not think there would be any way out of the deadlock which would arise.  Therefore, I submit it would be more prudent and the sounder view to take of the responsibilities of the Government to give the Government the right of determining if and when a referendum upon a proposal to amend the Constitution shall be taken. That is all I have to say in relation to the amendment, but I think a great deal of what I have said applies also to the amendment in the name of Senator Johnston.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I never thought much about this Constitution, but, as it works out, it appears to get worse. The referendum itself has merits, particularly in a highly-developed democracy which has exercised functions and is keenly conscious of the importance of those functions.  I am not so sure whether we are in that state yet ourselves.  I am not very clear about the value of the referendum in our conditions.  I can see few merits in the referendum itself.  Perhaps I should not discuss that.  However, Article 46 of the Constitution does appear to make it mandatory that, if you pass a Constitutional amendment through both Houses of the Oireachtas, you must submit that amendment to the people, and I find nothing in Article 46 to support the view of the Minister that, in spite of the Article, you may pass a Constitutional amendment through both Houses and then put that amendment into cold storage&mdash;the Minister called it suspended animation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us whether there is anything in this Article or anywhere else in the Constitution which implies that a Constitutional amendment passed by both Houses may be left in a state of suspended animation.  I do not think it should be so left.  The great merit of this Constitution when it was put through both Houses was alleged to <Col N="573" /> be that it would be cast-iron after a certain period, that following an initial period of three years, every amendment would have to be submitted to the people.  Now the Minister takes power in this Bill in Section 8 to allow the Government to intervene to make nugatory the provisions of Article 46.  That seems to me to be what it means; that an amendment is passed and, in spite of the amendment having been passed, the Government does not carry it on to the final stage. It seems to me that Article 46 is mandatory:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every proposal for an amendment of this Constitution shall be initiated in Dáil Eireann as a Bill ...</P>
    <P>It cannot be initiated in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>. . . . . and shall upon having been passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, be submitted by referendum to the decision of the people in accordance with the law for the time being in force relating to the referendum.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me a very great straining of these final words&mdash;&ldquo;in accordance with the law for the time being in force relating to the referendum&rdquo;&mdash; to assume that the law for the time being in force can provide that there need be no referendum.  That seems to be a strain which nobody could possibly put on the Article.  The Article appears to contemplate that there shall be a law&mdash;it is common form&mdash;to determine the machinery of the referendum.</P>
    <P>It does not contemplate that there shall be a law which will make the whole of Article 46 null and void and of no effect.  There, certainly, ought to be machinery in this Bill which does not exist in the Constitution for determining how the provisions of Article 46 shall be carried out.  The Minister's point that the President would only act on the advice of the Government would not invalidate an amendment providing for the insertion of the word &ldquo;President&rdquo; here.  If the word &ldquo;President&rdquo; were inserted here and if he were given certain <Col N="574" /> powers, that provision would be mandatory on the Government.  Surely, the Government could not advise the President against the exercise of powers conferred on him by law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>If we conferred that power on the President, the Government would not have the power to advise him to the contrary&mdash;to break the law.  The real difficulty is that this Government is responsible for drawing up a Constitution with all sorts of trimmings and fallals, making it very democratic; but, having been in office, they feel that nobody should exercise any powers except the Government.  I think that the provisions of Article 8, whereby the Government can hold up an amendment to the Constitution, are contrary to the words of Article 46 and to its whole spirit.  If a Government does not want a particular Constitution amendment to go to the people, it need not let the Fifth Stage of the Bill pass in the Seanad.  There are all sorts of methods open to a Government which has a majority in the Dáil or in both Houses&mdash;as, under the Constitution, every Government will now have&mdash;by which they can prevent a Bill from going to a referendum.  The Minister himself is sufficiently experienced in politics to know that.  If they do not want to submit a Bill to referendum, they need not let the proposal go to its final stage.  They can get the opinion of both Houses but they need not pass the Bill and they need not have a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have Article 46 of the Constitution making a referendum mandatory and we have Section 8 of this Bill giving the Government power to put it into cold storage or to leave it in a state of suspended animation.  The two things are quite contrary.  Did I misunderstand the Minister when I <Col N="575" /> thought he said that he was now proposing to insert an amendment in this Bill by which it will be mandatory on the Government within a certain period to have a referendum?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I misunderstood the Minister.  If the provisions of the Constitution have any value in respect of the referendum proposal, there should be a provision in this Bill to confer upon somebody the right and power to see that, within a certain period, the referendum would be taken.  If that is not done, it would be better to amend the Constitution and take out the referendum provision altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the amendment and with the Minister in the difficulties under which he is suffering, judging by his speech.  I served on a committee a considerable time ago which endeavoured to prepare drafts of a Constitution. A good many of these drafts never saw the light of day, but some of them did.  Some things in them seemed to me excellent in theory at the time, but my view was shaken afterwards when I saw them under the actual operation of government. It seems to me that the Government have been unduly affected by recent events.  In this case, they are picturing a Government which will advance to a certain stage and then retire to a certain position.  They are now trying to prepare that position so that it will be possible, having piloted a Bill through both Houses, for a Government to change its mind and to say that the people should not have an opportunity of expressing their view upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a certain extent, we are discussing what is unreal because we are dealing only with very rare cases.  I can see what I have mentioned happening only when a Government has come to the conclusion that it has not the confidence of the country by the time the Bill is through or that they have lost the confidence of the <Col N="576" /> Oireachtas.  They would not have brought the Bill through both Houses unless they were quite confident that the people wanted the proposed amendment.  We are, therefore, dealing with one type of case&mdash;a case in which there is a change of public outlook or of Government policy.  In that case, it seems to me that it is not right that a Government which have had full time for consideration of a Constitutional amendment should have unlimited time left to them in which they would leave that amendment in a state of what has been described as &ldquo;suspended animation.&rdquo;  They ought to drop it altogether or they should have to submit it to the people.  I would vote for this amendment, though I am not satisfied that, without further amendment, it would be satisfactory.  The Minister should accept the principle that the Government should put the issue to the people or that the Bill should be regarded as dead and should not be revived unless replaced by a new Bill.  If the Government does not believe sufficiently that the people want the proposed amendment, I do not see very much use in going to the expense of a referendum because the Government would probably use its Party machinery to get the amendment defeated.  That would create an absurd position and would not make for respect for the Executive in the country.  To that extent I disagree with the amendment&mdash;it does not go far enough.</P>
    <P>As to the argument regarding the constitutionality of amendments to the Constitution, I have, during the considerable time I have been a member of this House, discovered the futility of trying to decide the meaning of an Act which we have passed.  There is only one place in which the meaning of an Act can be finally decided.  We may think that we know what an Act means when passing it, but, once it is out of our hands, its meaning is also out of our hands.  Any argument based on whether the Minister or Senator Tierney is right would not get us very far.  The Minister suggests that the Bill is Constitutional, <Col N="577" /> but that Senator Tierney's amendment, if adopted, might be unconstitutional. All that belongs to &ldquo;might-be&rdquo; and I do not think we should make any decision based upon it.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I cannot agree that the absence of the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; means that there can be indefinite delay.  I find that, according to the Constitution, the President, on the nomination of the Dáil, has to appoint a Taoiseach.  I do not see the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; in the Constitution there.  On the Minister's argument, the President could wait for a year before appointing a Taoiseach.  I do not believe that the absence of the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; has the significance which the Minister suggests.  Therefore, that particular argument will not hold water.  The practical side of the matter is to find what is desirable. Can we find any way of reaching a reasonable position?  I do not think it is desirable that the Government should be in the position simply to leave a Bill dealing with a Constitutional provision for a year or for two years without any referendum.  I think it preferable that the calling of a referendum should be in the name of the President rather than by the Government, especially in Constitutional amendments.  While the aim should be to detach him from Party politics, I would prefer to have the President. I do not claim, however, that that would make an enormous difference. Whoever does it, it should be done within a reasonable time, and not more than six months or a year should elapse before the referendum.  We know from experience, and from the debates on the Constitution that a period of time or the re-reading of a section raises doubts as to the exact meaning.  The Minister is doubtful as to the exact meaning of a certain clause.  He has not formed that opinion through any action in the courts because the matter has not been tested.  The same thing might apply to any Constitutional amendment.  If it is not going to be put to the people at once, but brought forward again in 24 or 36 months, it should come forward as a new Bill and be rediscussed in the light of changing events.  Looking at it <Col N="578" /> from the practical point of view I think the Bill should be changed in the manner I indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the arguments on this section and on the amendment are of a negative character.  I presume the words objected to are &ldquo;and the Government determines&rdquo;.  That leaves it to the Government to decide if it shall go on with their proposal or shall go to the referendum.  We are presuming that the Government does not decide to do so.  I do not think any Senator put forward a reason why, after the Government sponsoring a Bill in both Houses of the Oireachtas, they should then decide that they would not put it to the referendum.  We are assuming the possibility of that happening, but we cannot give any reason why it should happen.</P>

      <P>If Senators want to put the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; in the Bill that would be <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution.  It seems peculiar that the Party that opposed for all they were worth the powers conferred on the President when the Constitution was being passed through the Oireachtas now want to confer additional powers on him, and to say &ldquo;the President shall do this&rdquo;.  It seems strange, after all the opposition there was to the powers that the President was assumed to receive, but did not receive, that we now have this amendment to confer on him additional powers which would be <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution as passed.  I cannot see why the Government, having passed an amendment through both Houses, should not put that to the referendum fairly quickly.</P>

      <P>There is a subsequent amendment in the name of another Senator that seems to me to <Col N="579" /> be more reasonable.  Suppose the Government decides that the time is not opportune for some reason&mdash;say that foot-and-mouth disease had broken out in the country or that epizootic disease was raging&mdash;it would be difficult there and then to hold the referendum as such an outbreak might rage for six months.  I am putting up that as a possibility that the Government would have to deal with.  Is it not possible then for the Government to come back to both Houses and say that the time was not opportune, and that it did not meet Government policy to support a proposal for the referendum? Could the Government not submit to both Houses a motion for the rescinding of a proposal for the referendum?  These are matters on on which it seems to me we are arguing in the negative.  We are assuming that the Government acts with full responsibility, and then presuming that they will come forward and say that they would not do what was proposed.  I think this amendment is perfectly ridiculous and would be <i>ultra vires</i> if passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of what the last speaker said, that we are assuming that the Government is going to do all these things. That is not implicit in the amendment but was rather implicit in the line taken by the Minister.  It seems to me to be not an unreasonable proposition, that Clause 2 of Article 46 makes it mandatory, once a proposed amendment of the Constitution passes the two Houses, that it must go to the people.  The latter part of the section leaves no question, except as to the form in which it must go and what machinery will be used and determined by law.  I think that can hardly be questioned if this matter went to the courts and if it were challenged. The last speaker misunderstood the line taken by the Minister.  So far there has been no proposal as to what limit it should go.  As I understood him, what the Minister proposes is that if an amendment to the Constitution was introduced in the Dáil, and passed both Houses, the last speaker <Col N="580" /> seemed to assume that it could only be introduced by the Government.  It might be introduced by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator assumed that the discussion was concerned only with whether it might be a longer or a shorter time.  As I understand it, the implication of the present Bill is that, although the Constitution says that this shall be submitted to the referendum, the position as conceived by the Minister is that it need not be submitted at all to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker proposed a way of meeting a possible difficulty, and he instanced a case in which there might be foot-and-mouth disease all over the country.  I think myself that in such circumstances a simple resolution introduced into the Dáil and passed by the Dáil and Seanad, after an amendment had been adopted by the two Houses of the Legislature, might <Col N="581" /> justify the Government in not submitting such amendment to the people. At the present moment, I do not see how it can be said that the Constitution does not command specifically that if such an amendment is so passed, it shall be submitted.  It seems to me that to refuse to submit it would be quite unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>With regard to having the decision about putting the referendum to the people in the hands of the President instead of in the hands of the Government, the Minister says, I understand, that that is ruled out by the words: &ldquo;No power or function conferred on the President by law shall be exercisable or performable by him save only on the advice of the Government.&rdquo; I think that this Constitution is a bad Constitution, badly drafted. Personally I detest referenda, as I believe that they are against the wellbeing of the State, but, if I remember rightly, the Constitution also provides that the President in his own discretion may decide at a given moment that the Government has lost the confidence of the Legislature or of the Dáil.  Now I quite agree that the powers given to him there are not conditioned by the clause I have just read from Article 13 because that Article refers to powers given by ordinary statute law, whereas these powers given to the President are conferred by the Constitution itself.  But you could easily have a position in which an amendment is introduced into the Dáil against the wishes of the Government and passed by both Houses.  The mere fact of that having happened might be a datum on which the President might decide, entirely on his own discretion according to the Constitution, that that Government had lost the confidence of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Say that an amendment has been introduced into the Dáil against the wishes of the Government and that it has passed both Houses, it is not the law of the land until such time as it has been submitted by referendum to the people, but the Government has fairly lost the confidence of the Dáil.  The only power of the President to refuse the advice of the Government is in relation to the dissolution of the Dáil, but here is a position where the Government is given this power, against the Legislature to which it is responsible, to thwart the wishes of that Legislature. If this amendment as proposed is passed, the decision will be put into the hands of the President, but the Minister says he can only act on the advice of the Executive Council.  It does seem to me in that case, inasmuch as the Constitution itself says that it shall be submitted to the electorate&mdash; that is a command of the Constitution, &ldquo;it shall be&rdquo;&mdash;and the conditions relating to it having been fulfilled, as it has passed both Houses, the Government in refusing to advise the President to have it submitted is itself acting against the Constitution.  Its refusal to act would be a completely illegal course.  I think that then&mdash;I am not purporting to speak as a pundit in the matter&mdash;a case could be taken to the courts for an injunction against the Government commanding it to give the appropriate advice to the President.  I admit these things are fantastic, but it is just because the Constitution we are working is an ignorant, stupid and fantastic Constitution. There is one thing perfectly clear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Constitution makes it mandatory on the Government to submit an amendment under these conditions to referendum.  I do not think the Minister could possibly argue against that.  That is the fact. I admit that in so far as the Constitution has not specifically set out the time within which this should be done or the machinery by which it should be done, the Government may postpone indefinitely the time when it should be submitted, but implicitly it is only postponing and is not absolutely abandoning the proposal for a referendum.  The Minister, however, gets up here and says that by virtue of Article 13, Section 11, it would be unconstitutional to give the President the powers proposed in this amendment.  If that is so it is equally clear that it is unconstitutional to pass a law which visualises the Government refusing to act according to the demands of the Constitution.  The Constitution leaves no doubt whatever that once an amendment has passed the two Houses, it shall be submitted to the people, but it leaves another question as to the machinery that will <Col N="584" /> be employed and as to the time that may elapse.  I am satisfied myself that if you pass this Bill, and if a case were taken before a competent court, that competent court would have to say that, in so far as this Bill permits the Government not to submit an amendment to the people, it is acting unconstitutionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not altogether agree with those who maintain that this matter is of very little importance.  It is easy enough to visualise circumstances in which a position such as is contemplated in the Bill might lead to all sorts of undesirable manæuvres and stratagems, especially in connection with the Constitution which should be above manæuvres of that kind.  What I dislike about this section of the Bill is that it re-introduces the Executive's power to come between the Legislature and the people.  The Constitution provides apparently that once an amending Act has gone through the Legislature it shall automatically be submitted to the people.  The Bill then comes along to reintroduce the Executive at that stage and to give the Executive power to come between the Legislature and the people and to say that something which the Legislature has passed shall not be implemented. If that procedure were applied to ordinary legislation, it would amount to a dictatorship and would mean that the Government could step in at any moment, once a Bill had been passed by the Oireachtas, and say: &ldquo;That Bill shall not become law.  We have changed our minds.  We do not think it desirable that the Bill should be carried into effect and it is hereby postponed or hung up.&rdquo;  It is the principle involved, whatever its consequences in any concrete situation might be, which seems to me to be very objectionable.  I think this is a power which a Government with any real respect for the Constitution should not take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I saw that provision in the Bill for the first time, I must say that my unregenerate spirit was rather inclined to rejoice, because personally I <Col N="585" /> have no great belief in a referendum, and particularly a referendum which is intended to make amendment of the Constitution, and of this Constitution especially, more difficult.  I think it very foolish to have given the country a Constitution which it is almost impossible to amend, but, at the same time, when we have done that deliberately, I am merely trying to prevent the Government from driving a coach and four through the Constitution which it has itself solemnly promulgated and given to the people and which it has got the people to accept. It is easy enough to visualise circumstances under which a Government might resort to various stratagems in order to postpone the carrying into effect of legislation of its own, and of legislation that had been forced upon it.  It might well happen that a Bill for an amendment of the Constitution would pass both Houses of the Oireachtas in spite of the existing Government.  This section of the Bill would then give the Government power to hold up such a Bill.  In any case, I think it very undesirable to contemplate circumstances, under which the Oireachtas, having solemnly and perhaps lengthily debated a Constitutional amendment, the amendment is then to be held up for several months, and perhaps several years, and ultimately brought to the people at a time when they have practically forgotten about it and have lost interest in it.  The whole procedure contemplated in this section seems to be very undesirable, both in principle and so far as it can be reduced to practice.</P>
    <P>I do not think there was much substance in the point the Minister made about its being mandatory on the President to take action within one week.  In my amendment, the reference to one week is struck out of the Bill&mdash;the time limit is abolished.  It is mandatory on the Minister as the Bill stands, but, if my amendment is accepted, no time limit for the President's action is contemplated.  I introduced the President into this because the procedure for ordinary referenda involves the action of the President.  That was my only reason for doing so, and I am quite prepared <Col N="586" /> to accept any other machinery which would, in fact, carry out the provisions of the Constitution.  As regards the point the Minister made about Article 13 of the Constitution, I fail altogether to see what its substance is.  Under Article 13:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No power or function conferred on the President by law shall be exercisable or performable by him save only on the advice of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As Senator Hayes has pointed out, that machinery does not contemplate that the Government should advise the President to contravene a law of the Oireachtas.  If we pass a Bill and the President accepts it, it becomes law, and it is surely not contemplated that the Government should advice him in the teeth of such a law to refuse to act?  It seems to me that that question of advice refers to matters of machinery.  It would be right and proper that the Government should be called on to advise the President as to the exact date on which a certain declaration should be made and that in that matter the President should act as the organ of the Executive, but, beyond that, I fail to see what application Article 13 has to this situation at all.</P>
    <P>Even if it were true that this matter is affected by Article 13, surely it would be better to leave such a matter for decision as between the President and the Government when it arose, if it ever did arise, than to enshrine in an Act of Parliament words which, on their face, bear a construction contrary to the express words of the Constitution?  I do not think it is relevant or useful to bring Article 13 into this matter, nor do I think it is relevant or useful to make points about the use of the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; in Article 46, as the Minister has done. It would require a philologist to make a study of this Constitution and examine the cases in which the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; is used.  The obvious construction of that word in Article 46 surely is that the President's action in this case is mandatory&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

That is the only meaning it has and it has no reference to this situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I think should be understood and that is the position we should try to create &mdash;that the President should, without any further demur or delay, or any action to postpone the implementation of such an Act of the Oireachtas, proceed to carry it into effect at whatever time may be convenient.  He cannot be bound to do things the very next day.  Some convenient time will have to be given for setting up machinery and making arrangements, but beyond that I do not agree that the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; has any relevancy at all to this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not quite agree with what Senator Douglas said about the uselessness of arguing matters of this kind and about the necessity for having these questions decided by courts of law.  When we are engaged in passing legislation to set up machinery for carrying out the provisions of the Constitution, surely we are entitled&mdash;and not merely are we entitled, but surely it is our duty&mdash;to take account of the provisions of the Constitution and to interpret these provisions not as judges or lawyers but in the light of ordinary commonsense? It seems to me that anyone reading Article 46 in the light of ordinary commonsense would say that, undoubtedly, it is mandatory&mdash;that there is no question whatever of any power being given to the Government <Col N="588" /> in it, or any power contemplated for the Government, to hold up legislation already passed by the Oireachtas. I am not at all an admirer of the referendum nor am I an admirer of the Constitution.  I put down these amendments merely in order to secure that the matter would be discussed and that it should not be passed by without attention being paid to it, but, apart from that, I have no particular interest in it and do not propose to press the matter to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what Senator Tierney has said, I do not think there is much purpose in dealing with the points raised, but I can assure the Senator that men of commonsense do differ, and differ very strongly, as to whether Clause 2 of Article 46 makes it mandatory upon the Government, or upon any person, to proceed to take a referendum upon a proposal to amend the Constitution. Under the Constitution and by tradition, there being a tribunal to interpret statutes, we cannot proceed in this House or elsewhere to act according to the notions of every individual's commonsense, because what may be commonsense to one man may appear to be sheer nonsense to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, we have to try to get some common principles of interpretation. One of the principles of interpretation, I understand, is that a statute or Article or section must be read as a whole.  When we find in one section of Article 46 the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; used, meaning, as I have said, that the President shall proceed to discharge certain functions without any further demur or delay and when we see in Section 2 of the same Article a different phraseology used, it certainly can be interpreted that, whatever else the phraseology in Section 2 of Article 46 may mean, it does not mean &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;.  Therefore, it does not make it mandatory upon the Government to proceed to take a referendum.  Not merely does it not make it mandatory on the Government to proceed to take a referendum, but, if we get back to the commonsense interpretation of it, the plain fact is that Section 2 does not make it mandatory <Col N="589" /> upon anybody.  It does not say that the President shall do it, nor does it say that the Government shall do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's contention then that, unless the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; is used everywhere in the Constitution, no provision that does not contain that word is mandatory. I think dozens of cases could be quoted to show that that is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that this Article of the Constitution which relates to the referendum has to be construed as a whole, and that inside the limits of that Article the same word shall be used to express the same condition so that there shall be at least uniformity of phraseology and, therefore, uniformity in interpretation. I am advised that the indisputable effect of Section 2 of the Article is this: that, whatever else may happen, the Constitution cannot be amended unless the proposal to amend it has been submitted by referendum to the people.  That is what Article 46 does.  I have said that Section 2 of Article 46 imposes no executive function or responsibility upon any person, or upon any organ or instrument in the State.  On the other hand, we have Section 2 of Article 28 which, I think, is very clear and unambiguous.  That section of Article 28 states that the executive power of the State shall, subject to the provisions of this Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">

What we are proposing in this Bill is that, so far as the regulation of the referendum is concerned, the executive power will rest in the hands of the Government. That is to say, our proposal is consistent, and, mind you, I am afraid it will be held that it is the only proposal that would be fully consistent with Section 2 of Article 28 because there we say that the Government shall determine when the referendum is to be taken.  We do not give <Col N="590" /> the Government, in that section, the power of determining that the referendum shall not be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What we say in the section is that the Government shall determine when a referendum is to be taken.  In constitutional theory, we are not conferring on the Government the right to say that a referendum on the proposal shall never be taken. In fact, I have pointed out to the Seanad that the only way in which a proposal to amend the Constitution can be finally disposed of is by reference to the people, and that no Government can kill a proposal to amend the Constitution once it has passed both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Perhaps it might be possible by some such device as Senator O'Donovan has referred to: if it were possible to amend the Standing Orders in such a way as to wipe out all the anterior proceedings in both Houses prior to a Bill to amend the Constitution being deemed to have been passed by both Houses.  That, maybe, is the only way one could kill it.  Therefore, I say we have got to look at this thing as practical men.  I presume that if a Government assumes responsibility for putting a proposal to amend the Constitution through both Houses of the Oireachtas, it does it having a practical constitutional end in view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>But must that proposal be put forward by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It only means that it must be initiated in Dáil Eireann.  But then one must read the Constitution as a whole.  The Senator must know that no Government can exist unless it has the confidence of Dáil Eireann.  He knows that the Taoiseach has to be nominated by Dáil Eireann, and that the whole personnel and constitution of the Government is built around the Taoiseach.  In my view it would be quite impossible to carry a proposal to amend the Constitution through Dáil Eireann, particularly against the opposition of the Government, because it would be a <Col N="591" /> matter of primary importance upon which the Government would be bound to stand or fall.  Once the Government was defeated in Dáil Eireann, then, according to our Constitution, the Taoiseach has either to resign or get a vote of confidence, and surely no House of the Legislature which was determined to secure an amendment of the Constitution would give a vote of confidence either to the Taoiseach or to a Government which was determined to resist that amendment of the Constitution.  Therefore, we have got to look at this as practical men.  It is, of course, theoretically possible to conceive a situation in which a proposal to amend the Constitution might pass both Houses of the Oireachtas and, at the same time, not be referred to the people.  On the other hand, while such a situation is constitutionally conceivable, nevertheless, as a practical proposition, it is, I think, most improbable, because you would simply have a deadlock there, and it would have to be resolved by the dominant element in the Constitution: that is to say, by Dáil Eireann deciding to have a change of government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say, in regard to everything which has been said here, that this section in the Bill, in the particular form in which it has been drafted, is not an attempt to give effect to any ulterior motive of the Government.  The plain fact is that we have been advised that Article 46 does not make it mandatory to take a referendum, and at the same time, it does not impose, as I have said, on the Executive the function or responsibility of taking a referendum.  We have, therefore, tried to get a practical way out of that difficulty.  The form in which the section is drafted is, we have been advised, the most feasible and least objectionable way of getting out of the impasse.  Therefore, as I have said, we have had no ulterior motive in drafting the section in this particular form.  In the light of that advice, and in view of the arguments which I have used here, I do not think that any practical purpose would be served by substituting the word &ldquo;President&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;Government&rdquo;, because <Col N="592" /> under Article 13 the President cannot act against the advice of the Government. There is nothing in the Act or in the Constitution which would bind the Government of some future day to advise the President, in accordance with Section 8, say, as amended as Senator Tierney would want it to be amended.  The Government could give perfectly unfettered advice to the President, as it would need to have regard to the circumstances of the time.  There may be many reasons why it would be unwise and contrary to public interest to take a referendum on a proposal to amend the Constitution&mdash; for instance, if we were suddenly attacked or if the international situation had changed during the passage of a proposal to amend the Constitution through the House.</P>
    <P>There are some circumstances which might make it conceivable that, even when an amendment to the Constitution had been adopted or was deemed to have been adopted by both Houses of the Oireachtas, it would still not be prudent, in the national interest, to have a referendum on that proposal.  In these circumstances, the Government would have to advise the President and give unfettered judgement according to whatever was best in the national interest; and the suggestion that the Government would be bound to advise the President to operate in accordance with this section might be found to disappear.  In any event, the main thing is that the Government exercises its executive powers in virtue of the fact that it has the support of Dáil Eireann, and if, in refusing to give that advice, it were supported by Dáil Eireann, there is no way in which it can be bound, particularly in view of Article 13, which makes it quite clear that the Government is unfettered in the advice which it may give to the President.</P>

      <P>Is it unfettered to the extent that it can advise the President to break the law?  Does the Minister lay it down as a constitutional principle that, whenever the Government thinks it is not in the national interest to obey the law, it may so advise the President?</P>

      <P>I do not want to be driven into the position of saying that the Government could advise the President to disregard the law, but&mdash;where the terms of the Constitution are so explicit that, if additional powers are conferred on the President, those powers could only be exercised on the advice of the Government&mdash;the President could not proceed to act in accordance with Section 8 if the Government advised him not to do so.</P>

      <P>I will not argue with the Minister as to whether there is not some devious motive in the Government's mind.  I quite understand the position.  The referendum in itself is a disastrous proposal, but it is in the Constitution, and in an absolutely iron-fast Constitution it is also a disaster to the people.  The main interest is to get this Constitution as easily amended as possible and to have the minimum hindrances in it.  When the Minister or the Government has been advised with regard to the interpretation of certain things, it does not necessarily follow that I will say &ldquo;Yea&rdquo; every time an adviser advises and say that he is quite right, even though the advice might have been quite good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says an Article must be interpreted in the light of all it contains. He brings in the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; in relation to clause 5 of Article 46, imposing something on the President.  It is a simple business, that the President acts entirely without any intermediary legislation, according to that Article 5, which is complete and which requires no further consideration.  The &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; relates to time&mdash;that, certain things having happened, the President shall do something forthwith.  If that which is to be done requires the setting-up of machinery &mdash; he does not require machinery to sign a document&mdash; obviously that word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; should not be there, as you need an intervening period to have the machinery set up.  &ldquo;Forthwith&rdquo; means <Col N="594" /> that, without any delay at all, the President shall do a certain thing.</P>
    <P>Clause 2 says that a certain thing shall be done, but it is something involving an alteration by all the people in the country and it requires machinery.  That is the only possible implication of the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; there.  You cannot say, the moment the Dáil and Seanad have passed a certain proposed amendment to the Constitution, that &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; the people shall vote, as machinery is required.</P>
    <P>When the original Constitution was passed, there was a law to the effect that a general election should be held not less than every six years.  There had then to be passed an Electoral Act, inasmuch as the election had to be held every six years, laying down the conditions and mode of holding the election.  Had the Government refused to pass an Electoral Act, the position would be that it would cease to be a legal Government at the end of six years and there would be no Government. Therefore, they would be breaking the Constitution by refusing to perform an act the performance of which was made necessary by something laid down in the Constitution.  This clause 2, inasmuch as it says that, under certain conditions, a referendum must be held, has made it necessary that a certain Bill be passed, setting up machinery and conditions for the referendum.</P>
    <P>The clause does not state a time and we agree that, as far as the Constitution is concerned, you cannot say that the referendum must be held within one, two or three months.  There is, however, an undefined term after which you can say that the Government is implicitly breaking the Constitution by not having the referendum held.</P>
    <P>There was such a case in the last year or so&mdash;I remember seeing it in the newspapers; it was the case of an ex-Fianna Fáil T.D.&mdash;in relation to the Army Pensions Act of 1933 or 1934. That Act did not say that the commission set up to consider those things must have brought in its findings with regard to every single applicant&mdash;there are about 60,000 of them&mdash;within a <Col N="595" /> certain time.  A case was taken in the courts in which a man said that it was against reason that the decision in regard to his own particular case had not been taken, and, if I remember rightly, the courts agreed with him.  We admit that, as far as the Constitution is concerned, there is no time laid down as to when a referendum must be held. The Constitution says it must be held, but it does not say when, and its being held requires the setting up of machinery.  When we come to this Bill, it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever a Bill containing a proposal for the amendment of the Constitution shall have been passed or be deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government determines that such proposal shall be submitted by referendum to the decision of the people&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister says this is not giving the Government power not to have a referendum.  I say it is, because this lays down, as a condition for the holding of the referendum, not merely that the two Houses of the Oireachtas shall have passed or be deemed to have passed a Bill containing a proposal for the amendment, but it also lays down that the Government must have determined that such a proposal shall be submitted to referendum.  The Constitution has determined that such a proposal shall be submitted to referendum. That is already determined in the Constitution.  The Government can determine exactly when it is going to be held, but implicit in that section there is a new condition.  Whereas the Constitution says that it shall be held, this Section 8, sub-section (1), says implicitly that not the mere passing shall cause a referendum; it requires another condition, and that is, that the Government itself shall also determine that it ought to be submitted.  The Government says: &ldquo;This only happens when I determine it.&rdquo;  If there is a binding law prior to that which says: &ldquo;It shall be done&rdquo; and you make a law which says: &ldquo;It shall only be done when I determine it&rdquo;, you are actually breaking <Col N="596" /> that prior law.  With regard to the advice which the Government has got, I will say that, if the case put forward by the Minister in which he brings in &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; in sub-section (5), Article 46, was the case put forward by his advisers, and if the advisers have told him that sub-section (2) does not make it mandatory that a referendum shall be held, and if they base that advice on the grounds of bringing in an interpretation of sub-section (5), I can only say that the advisers are so ill-advised that they clearly misunderstood not merely one sub-section of that Article but the whole thing.  It is relating to certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Certain conditions are fulfilled; a man writes his name on a paper, which requires no more than a fountain-pen and possibly a pair of eye-glasses.  In the other, a certain operation by every voter in the country is involved, which can only be done after the necessary machinery has been set up.  That requires intermediary legislation, but the legislation must only be passed on the known fact that is laid down by the Constitution; once the amendment is passed or deemed to be passed by the two Houses, then a referendum shall be held.  &ldquo;Forthwith&rdquo; means that the President must act in a week or so. This has not laid that down.  I think, if you pass this Bill as it is, and the Government does not within a reasonable time submit a referendum to the people, it will be open to any one of us to take a case in the courts and ask for an injunction insisting that the Government shall carry out what is laid down by the Constitution.  Government advisers or no Government advisers, I am satisfied that the courts will not say that the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; in sub-section (5) means that the Government need never do it at all.</P>

I think that in those circumstances, that is, that an amendment on the lines proposed by Senator Tierney would be repugnant to the Constitution, the Government would be quite entitled to advise the President to disregard it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After sub-section (1) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) A Government which fails to submit such a proposal by referendum to the decision of the people within 12 months from the date on which the Bill containing the proposal has been passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, may not submit such a proposal at any later date to the decision of the people by referendum unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas authorising such submission, and must so submit such proposal if a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas ordering such submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I came into the House to-day I was rather inclined to support Senator Tierney's amendment and withdraw my own, but, in view of the debate which has taken place and the arguments put forward by the Minister and others, I am now of the opinion that my amendment meets every reasonable case put forward by the Minister, and ought to be insisted on. It seems to me that, as the Referendum <Col N="598" /> Bill now stands, the Government are claiming, in Section 8, a kind of negative power of legislation; in other words, they are claiming power, in circumstances in which a constitutional amendment has been passed by both Houses, to delay indefinitely, and if need be till Tibb's Eve, the submission of that amendment to the people, knowing that by such delay they are in fact negativing the decision of the Oireachtas.  That seems to me to be a most improper procedure.  The Government would presumably have gone through the motion of creating a constitutional amendment in co-operation with the Oireachtas, and then by this form of words they are claiming the right and power to make the whole proceedings abortive.  That seems to me to be part and parcel of the essential function of legislation, and in this case the Government are usurping to themselves the sole right of legislating in that respect, a right which belongs to the Oireachtas and not to the Government of its own simple will and motion.  I admit there is something in what the Minister says &mdash;that it might happen, after a Bill had passed both Houses of the Oireachtas, that circumstances were not propitious for submitting it to the people within the next few weeks.  Anything might happen making it inadvisable that the Bill should be submitted forthwith, but at the same time I think the Constitution requires that the Bill should be submitted without unreasonable delay.  In my amendment I suggest that the Government should have a year in which to decide on the opportune time for submitting that Bill to the people and if at the end of that year they have not so submitted that amendment then the whole thing would lapse unless, by the procedure I suggest, it was resurrected.  The procedure of resurrection is, negatively, that the Government should not have the power after the lapse of a year to submit an amendment to referendum unless authorised by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas and, positively, that the Government should have to submit the amendment to referendum if required to do so by a resolution of both Houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> The principle of the amendment is that the power of legislation in this matter, as in all other matters, should be put formally and actually where, under the Constitution, it belongs, and that is fair and square on the shoulders of the Oireachtas, and that the Government, acting by itself, should not be able to do something which amounts in effect to a form of legislation.  I do not see that in any way my amendment would lessen the real power and constitutional function of the Government but, in this very important matter of what amounts to an exercise of legislative power, it does require the Government at all stages to act in co-operation with the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As the Bill now stands, it could happen that the Government might delay for a year or more submitting an amendment to the people and then might change their mind about the whole thing and decide never to submit that amendment to the people, but it is equally possible that the Oireachtas might change its mind too and it is altogether desirable that the Government should be under the formal constitutional and legal necessity of consulting the Oireachtas before it makes any such decision about submitting or not submitting an amendment to referendum.  That is the whole point of my amendment and I think it deserves the serious and sympathetic consideration of the House.</P>

      <P>The amendment as it stands seems to prevent the Government from postponing the submission of a decision of both Houses to the people.  It prevents the postponement for more than 12 months.  I think <Col N="600" /> that is reasonable.  The Minister may explain the matter but it seems to be a reasonable proposition.  It would save any difficulty about indefinite postponements.  I instanced a case of such postponement.  If the Government were to postpone or prevent the possibility of a referendum for six, eight or 12 months, this amendment would bring before both Houses the fact that it had been postponed and it could be reauthorised.  I would like to say &ldquo;a&rdquo; Government.  The speakers on the other side referred to the Government and seemed to assume that the present Government is going to last for all time.  I hope it lasts longer than they would wish it to, but this amendment can apply to any Government we are legislating for in the future.</P>

      <P>I may have misunderstood the last speaker.  I got the impression that he was thinking that this amendment meant that the Government had to submit a referendum within a reasonable time.  I may have misread the thing, but in a hasty reading what I understood by it is that the proposed amendment is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas; the Government does nothing about it for a year; then, according to this amendment, nothing can be done about it.  If the Government does not submit it to referendum within a year, it cannot submit it.  It is not meeting the case I have had in mind all the time that it must be submitted.  I may say quite frankly that my whole object, and that of anybody who cares for the government of this country&mdash;and I think the present Government will agree with it&mdash;is to simplify and make as feasible as possible, within the limits imposed, amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this proposal, if it is not submitted within 12 months then it cannot be submitted unless further action is taken.  I do not like that.  I would like the Government to have the maximum latitude.  A referendum is a ridiculous proposal really.  We have got to have it, and it is full of dangers, and I can quite see a hundred circumstances besides what the Minister proposed in which it would be recognised <Col N="601" /> as nationally harmful to hold a referendum.  Therefore, I do not want to tie the Government too much but, supposing the Government has done nothing within a year, something else has to be done; it may not submit it then unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas authorising such submission and must so submit such proposal if a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas ordering such submission. Suppose it does not submit for another year?</P>

      <P>What you are doing is simply giving the Government more power to prevent the Constitution from being amended.  That is what I understand by it.  First of all, the non-Government or Deputies in opposition to the Government introduce and pass a proposed amendment.  The Government can laugh at them.  All it has to do is to sit tight for a year.  At the end of that year the Deputies are still anxious to assert their power and to achieve a certain thing, and they pass another resolution asking that it be submitted.  The Government laughs again and just leaves it there and then, according to Senator Johnston, the will or the decision of the majority of the Legislature has been quite simply thwarted by the Government sitting down and doing nothing.  I am not misinterpreting it.  Is not that so?</P>

      <P>I would like to support any amendment which insists that once the majority of the two Houses have declared in favour of an amendment to the Constitution, the necessary <Col N="602" /> steps must be taken to make it possible to have that amendment implemented. I recognise at the same time that if you tie the Government too much, and say that within X weeks or X months of such a resolution having been passed a referendum must be held, you are possibly going to make for trouble. The root of all that trouble lies in the Constitution itself, and we have got to do the best we can with it.  I would be quite prepared to say that the Government must within 12 months submit it to a referendum or, if they see reason against that being done within that time, then they must get a resolution passed by the two Houses empowering them for another 12 months not to hold the referendum, and if it is not held then, they can bring in a resolution or some other form of legislation annulling what has been done by the Oireachtas.  But I do think that once the Legislature has declared its judgment that the well-being of the people in this country would be best achieved by amendment of the Constitution, then it is nullifying the whole significance of the Legislative Assembly and putting everything into the hands of the Government, if you make it possible for the Government, by the simple expedient of not doing anything, of negativing the act of the Oireachtas. I have never pretended to be what is called a democrat, and, judging from certain earlier remarks by Senator Hayes, I disagree as to what people understand by the word &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;, but it does seem to me that you have here a Legislature, to which the Government is responsible, and you are now, by Senator Johnston's proposal, going to make the Government so eminently irresponsible that it can negative the whole act of a majority of the Oireachtas by doing nothing.  If that is the right interpretation, as I judge it to be, then I would be wholeheartedly against this amendment.</P>

      <P>In my opinion, Senator Fitzgerald has not been speaking to the amendment at all.  The amendment deals with the question of the long finger.  If an amendment of the Constitution is proposed and, when the 12 months is up, if the Government suddenly decides to go ahead with it, then they have got to do <Col N="603" /> a certain thing, but there is nothing in this amendment that I can see that bears out Senator Fitzgerald's case at all.  I understand they have to introduce the proposals before the 12 months is up, and that after the lapse of 12 months resolutions must be passed by both Houses before they can begin on that particular proposal again.  I understand that is what the amendment is about and not what Senator Fitzgerald has mentioned.</P>

What Senator Johnston says is that, far from making them implement the decision of the Oireachtas, they shall not be allowed to implement that decision after 12 months unless the Oireachtas re-enacts what it did before.  That is my interpretation. So far as the amendment is concerned, the Government need not do anything for another year; there is no time indicated.</P>

      <P>I would not like this amendment to be pressed.  We are in a difficulty&mdash;I have said it in the other House and I say it here&mdash;in relation to this particular Article, but I do not think we are going to solve our difficulty by adopting this amendment. The real criticism which has been launched against the section in the Bill is that it prevents a referendum being taken automatically upon the passage of the Bill through both Houses.  On the other hand, there is nothing in the Constitution which enables such a referendum to be taken automatically.  We have interposed the Government as the active agent. As Senator Fitzgerald has pointed out, this amendment would mean that if, within 12 months, the Government had not taken a decision to hold the referendum, the Government could not hold it without securing the support of both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a proposal to amend the Constitution was deemed to have been passed by both Houses&mdash;had been passed by the Dáil, but had not been passed by the Seanad, had been merely deemed <Col N="604" /> to have been passed by the Seanad&mdash; this amendment would give the Seanad an absolute veto, once the 12 months had elapsed, upon the taking of the referendum.  I think, therefore, that Senator Johnston's proposal would not solve the difficulty in which we find ourselves.  I realise there is a difficulty and I would like the Senator not to press the amendment.  I have been looking into Section 8 to see if we can find any way out of the crux which has arisen.  I will not take the Report Stage of the Bill for another two or three weeks, with the consent of the Seanad, and, in the meantime, we shall see if we can do better.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Second Schedule, I happen to know that, when the referendum was held on the present Constitution, in many places vast numbers of people did not fulfil the technical requirements.  I <Col N="607" /> have forgotten whether it was a matter of putting a cross or &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, but, whatever the people were supposed to do, many of them did the other thing. I now admit common sense would suggest that what a man means to do is to vote for it or against it, but the returning agents did not obey the law. The legal position should have been that unless a man voted according to the regulations laid down, then his vote should be considered invalid.  If you could get hold of the papers that were counted and accepted as valid, I am not sure that you would not find a majority, according to strict law, were invalid votes.  I should like it made abundantly clear that unless the people vote as the law indicates they must vote, their votes shall be declared invalid. I would not mind betting that if you were to select only the valid votes that were cast on the last occasion, you would find a majority of the votes deemed to have been valid were really invalid.</P>

The whole purpose of the law is to make the thing as clear as possible.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>On this matter, A Chathaoirligh, I think we may take some credit to ourselves for having been successful in persuading the Minister to alter materially the original Order.  The procedure which is adopted here is that you move to revoke an Emergency Order, not because you want the whole Order revoked or because you object to the principle of the Order, but because that is the only method which is open to us to put before the Minister certain arguments for amendment of the Order.  Now, that procedure was adopted here, and we may take to ourselves, as I have said, the merit of having persuaded the Minister, and I think that while taking that merit to ourselves we could also congratulate the Minister upon the procedure he has adopted.  He listened to the debate here, he promised that he would consider the matter, and then he came back and gave us a very comprehensive and full statement of his intention, which really involves the issuing of a <Col N="610" /> completely new Order.  With the Minister's procedure we could find no fault whatever, and we ought to be grateful to him for the manner in which he dealt with the matter.</P>
      <P>In regard to the merits of what he has done there are, of course, certain things as to which we have not been satisfied, but it would be right to say, to begin with, that he did fully meet certain points of detail which were made.  For example, he is providing, in the new Order that he proposes to make, entirely for a child under 14 years who is dependent or who has been personally injured.  He is providing also for the case of the adopted child, and he has entirely altered the maximum sum of £600, which was to be a lump sum grant, and changed it to a weekly grant.  He has also agreed, contrary to the provisions of the original Order, that where a person has suffered a personal injury by bombing, and the employer makes any contribution, that contribution shall not be calculated to relieve the State from the amount which the State, under the Order, will be compelled to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in these matters the Minister has entirely met opinions expressed by myself and by other members of the House.  He has also altered, as far as I understand it, the maximum figure, of 30/- a week for a married person, up to 30/- a week for the man, 7/6 a week for a wife, and 4/- a week for each child.  I think I am right in saying that there is no maximum.  That, of course, makes a very material difference between the Order as we found it and the Order as the Minister now proposes to make it, but it seems to me, as I said on the previous occasion, that the Workmen's Compensation Act was adopted simply because it was handy and because it did not necessitate any great thought upon the matter.  The Minister still clings to a certain degree to the principles of the Workmen's Compensation Act, an Act which I think is entirely unsuited to the circumstances contemplated by this Personal Injuries Order.  I wonder whether any consideration has been given to what the standard is here below which a family reaches what is <Col N="611" /> called the poverty line?  A family which is below or on the poverty line is ill-nourished, the children are incapable of properly benefiting by the education provided for them by the State, and they are eventually a liability and a burden on our various social services, such as hospitals, unemployment assistance, and so on.  I think it should be agreed that a person who has suffered injury owing to enemy action or owing to bombing accidents should not be compelled to rear his family in conditions such as I have described.  For a man and his wife and three children, under the revised Order, the figure available will be 49/6.</P>
    <P>I notice that in Great Britain a calculation has been made for York by Mr. Rowntree, who made out that in 1936 a man and his wife and three children would require at least 43/6 in order not to be below the poverty line. That figure in England would probably now be in the region of 60/- or £3 a week.  I wonder whether any steps have been taken to establish any figure for this country?  I doubt if the cost of living, in Dublin at any rate, or in any of our towns, is substantially less than it is in Great Britain.  There may be a difference between rural and urban conditions, but, in any event, the measuring standard to be adopted, I think, should not be that of the Workmen's Compensation Act; it should be to keep the person from dropping below the poverty line and from rearing children in such a way as to make them subsequently a burden on and a cause of further expenditure to the State.</P>
    <P>I should like also to take exception entirely to the Minister's statement in the original debate that to advocate justice and additional payments for this particular section of the community, for citizens who are bombed and who suffer personal injury, is to advocate new taxation.  I think that argument is not sound.  It is very belated when it comes from a Minister who himself, I think, has over and over again said that he was proud of increased expenditure and of increased taxation.  It is rather belated to produce that argument when that argument <Col N="612" /> was not produced, for example, when the Seanad was revived and Senators' allowances fixed at the old rate; when the allowances for Deputies were raised and when Ministers' salaries and emoluments were really in effect raised.  We may need to have retrenchment but, if we do, at least we ought not to have it at the expense of being unjust to any particular section of the community; we ought to have retrenchment at everybody's expense. I think it does not lie in the mouth of the Minister, or the people who so substantially increased our expenditure and taxation in the period from 1932 to before the war in 1939, to say when a particular proposal is made that it involves new taxation, and that this is the particular point at which we must now stop.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether any calculation has been made as to what we may have to pay for personal injuries and how long we may have to pay it.  I am not particularly expert at figures or at finance, but assuming we have to provide £1,000,000, we can get £1,000,000 at 3¼ per cent., or £32,000 a year, and pay it back at the rate of £50,000 a year, which seems to be a rather small figure &mdash;the £82,000 decreasing year by year, of course.</P>
    <P>May I say one or two words as to the debate on the motion originally? Senator Foran took exception to a statement that compensation should be given on the basis of the earning power of the person injured.  I think that was a perfectly sound principle which the Minister has not adopted.  I think that Senator Foran, in objecting to that principle, and in calling it the principle of recognising social standing and social status, was simply indulging in the same kind of lazy thinking that put the Workmen's Compensation Act into this Order.  Earning capacity and social status are not the same thing, but the difference in earning capacity has been recognised and is being constantly recognised by way of compensation.  It was recognised, for example, after the 1916 Rising in the distribution of money at that time by the National Aid Society and the White Cross.  Indeed, there is no place where social status and different earning capacity are more clearly recognised <Col N="613" /> than in the trade union movement. There is an immense difference between an official of the Irish Transport Workers' Union and the casual docker.  Those of us who have had an opportunity of living in working-class houses and of understanding working-class people know that a carpenter and a builder's labourer are members of two different social castes and classes. Perhaps that is one of the difficulties of the trade union movement from a certain angle.  I feel that Senator Foran was throwing out rather lazily an opinion about something which he had not read and in which he has not taken a very considerable interest.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general position, may I say to the Minister that he seemed to me&mdash;and it was rather unusual for him&mdash;to be particularly annoyed with Senator Douglas on the last occasion.  He said that Senator Douglas was vociferous.  I do not know that there is any adjective in the English language which would have less application to Senator Douglas than that particular one, and I am sure the Minister will recognise that now.  At any rate, between Senator Douglas and myself and certain other people, our voices were raised, and they proved to be efficacious in getting the Minister to go a certain distance.  We hear of the power of faith to move mountains. The voices that moved a Minister for Finance to added expenditure on certain schemes are comparable with the faith that moves mountains.  So far as we are concerned here, the Seanad can do no more in a matter of this kind dealing with finance than put its view on record and endeavour to persuade the Minister as best it can to make an improvement.  We have done that in this case, and I should like to express on my own behalf, and I think on behalf of every Senator, my satisfaction with the procedure the Minister adopted in dealing with this matter. I think it is only fair to him to say further that he has gone a certain distance.  All we can do about the matter in that case is to congratulate ourselves on having been able to accomplish a certain amount, and on having been met courteously and fairly enough by the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="614" /> With regard to the motion, I presume it must be withdrawn, because it was put down for the purpose of enabling a discussion to take place and to get an improvement, and that improvement has been accomplished. While the improvement, particularly the improvement in principle, does not go as far as many of us would like to see it going, we have to acknowledge that it does go a certain distance, and to be grateful for the support we got in the House and for the hearing we got from the Minister.  On that basis I ask leave to withdraw the motion.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Seanad Eireann is of opinion, complementary to the announcement of increased minimum prices for <Col N="615" /> certain agricultural products, it is essential to increase substantially wages payable to agricultural workers and to effect reasonable amelioration of their conditions of employment, and requests that the necessary steps to these ends be taken immediately.&mdash;Senators Foran, Campbell, Cummins and Tunney.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the debate on the last occasion, I was discussing the wisdom of, and necessity for, the State getting down to a basis of ascertained costs with regard to agricultural production. I feel strongly that, in respect of our dealings with people outside the State, such costings would be of very great value to us.  We may not yet have reached the point at which people who buy agricultural products are prepared to say that the people who produce them are entitled to get a livelihood out of their work, but I think we shall be up against such a situation very soon.  As these commodities grow scarce people must necessarily ask themselves whether a higher price-level for agricultural products would not be a great incentive to increased production.  Apart from what costings might effect in the hands of the Minister in fighting for better prices elsewhere, I think that, as between different parts of the country and different groups of farmers, it is absolutely essential to obtain, as accurately as we can, the costs of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know how difficult it would be to arrive at costings over which one could absolutely stand.  Costings will differ just as soils differ and the technique of farming differs.  While it is true that costings are different in Limerick and Meath from what they are in Carlow, South Kildare and other tillage areas, it is nevertheless a fact that we make no differentiation in the rate of wages to be paid in the different districts.  That is so notwithstanding that the farming in which these districts engage and the fruits which accrue from the farmers' labours differ.  The fruits of the farmer's labour in one district bear no relation to those of another district in which a different type of farming is practised. <Col N="616" /> Senator Foran argues that the fruits of the tilled fields in the future will command a considerably higher price and that, for that reason, labour should get a bigger share of the value of the products marketed.  While that might be argued with a certain amount of force, there is the other consideration, that in many areas there has been no increase whatever in agricultural prices.</P>
    <P>If you take the great dairying districts in the south, in my own county and part of the west and north-west, you will find that the price of butter last year was around 16.14d. per lb. and that, in 1940, the price of a gallon of milk was 6.43d.  I have in my hand the balance sheet of one of the most successful creameries in my own county and, indeed, in the whole country.  The price of a gallon of milk in 1940 was 6.43d. and, in 1915, it was 5.82d.  The average price of butter in 1915 was 16.17d. and, in 1940, 16.14d.  So far as dairying is concerned, there is no justification for urging that farmers should pay higher prices for labour because they are receiving higher prices for their products.</P>
    <P>Ancillary to dairying, you have pig raising.  Senator Foran may not be aware of what the position is in the pig and bacon industry.  Since the last meeting of this House, we have had a decision taken which has virtually reduced the price of the heavy pig by about £2.  The pig weighing 2 cwts. is worth to-day £2 less than it was worth the last day this House met.  In passing, I may say that this decision of the Ministry, made in arbitrary fashion, was very unwise.  It would not have been come to if we had some accurate system of costings established.  If such decisions have to be taken, the farmers engaged in the particular types of production affected should get notice&mdash;at least, a month's notice.  You have, then, these prices and, at the same time, a demand for increased wages which, I think, the industry cannot pay.  Our whole system of determining wages at present is unfair.  We put rich and poor areas on a flat rate and we apply the same rates of wages to the best and the worst worker on a farm.  That is unsound.</P>
    <P>I pointed out on the last occasion <Col N="617" /> that we had, at one time, a costings branch in the Department of Agriculture. It is to be deplored that that branch is not now functioning.  The Minister will, no doubt, have something to say as to why such a position should have been permitted to develop. The whole trend with regard to every type of production for a considerable time past has been towards ascertaining the cost of production.  Why we should leave agriculture outside the scope of this trend, I cannot imagine. With regard to the future, there is no other sound basis on which the Minister can determine the prices agricultural commodities must command in order to keep farmers in production. If this emergency continues for a year or two years, the Minister may be forced to raise agricultural prices in some cases to much higher levels than those at which they stand.  On what basis is that to be done?  I do not think it should be determined by the amount of clamour that can be raised because of the development of a certain situation.  It ought not to be in the power of any group of producers to reach a given point by the amount of noise they can make, unless they have facts to support them.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that we ought to have in the State some organisation or body inquiring into costings and determining them as accurately as possible. That costings instrument would be at the service of the Minister for Agriculture in making regulations and determining prices.  It would be also valuable to producers.  Nothing would more help to hasten an improved technique in agriculture than a system of costings which would indicate what good farming could produce and how low its production costs might be.  The basis for determining costs would have to be that of tolerably good farming. If we had costings of that type, those who were not good farmers would soon reach a point at which they could not remain in the industry if they did not improve their technique.  We ought to aim at such an improvement by a scientific process which would not alone help the Ministry in determining prices but help the individual farmer to educate himself by seeing what good farming could do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> Consumers must be perturbed at present by the cost of food.  The extraordinary thing is that while they are perturbed about the cost of food, other commodities have always been available to them at prices which cover the cost of production and leave a profit to the manufacturers.  Farmers have never, I think, enjoyed that position and people will have to accustom themselves to pay such prices for their food in future as will leave some margin above the cost of production to the farmer.  A limited number of farmers can produce costings which indicate fairly clearly and accurately what food is value for when it reaches the market.  These costings would not be accepted, throughout the country as a whole, as representative, but they would be a basis on which to go.  I know how meritorious is the demand by agricultural workers for increased wages.  I know the difficulties they are experiencing in providing themselves with the necessaries of life.  But it is my experience and the experience of my neighbours, working side by side with their men, that they have the same difficulties.  If a labourer tells me that he had to go into town and pay 3/- or 4/- for a quarter pound of tea, I can say that the farmer's wife has had to do the same thing.  The problem is common to both of them. The difficulties are not solely the lot of the agricultural labourer.  They apply also in the case of the farmer&mdash; big or small&mdash;with whom the agricultural labourer works or for whom he works.</P>
    <P>If a decision were to be taken at present, that out of the present income of agriculture a bigger share should go from the farmer to the men working side by side with him, the farmers would be driven into despair.  The result would be that a number of agricultural labourers would have to be dropped, because the income is not sufficient to carry a higher level of cost than it is at present bearing.  One cannot take blood from a turnip and one cannot secure an increased rate of wages for the farmer's worker when the farmer is unable to find the money. Senator Foran did not indicate the higher levels which agricultural prices <Col N="619" /> have reached which would prove that the money was there to pay the increased wage.  If a decision were reached to increase wages in agriculture, a number of labourers would be dropped and the farmer would be depressed.  The farmer struggles to put in a crop and, then, has to look forward to the harvest; he does not know what God will send as regards weather and he has difficulty in finding men to reap the harvest.  No decision should be taken which would add to the farmer's difficulty.  If the farmer, because of conditions imposed upon him, had to drop some of his men, that would mean that less work would be done and that it would not be so well done.  That, again, would mean lower production, and the people who would suffer most would be the poor people in the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>I would impress on Senator Foran that those who have suffered most because of the scarcity of food are the poor people in the towns and cities and they are the people who will, again, suffer if higher prices have to be paid for agricultural products.  If we could produce more, the problem would be simpler for all of us, but the farmer is not growing richer because there is a scarcity.  In an agricultural college in England they have been carrying out an investigation into costings.  I presume we could do something similar at Ballyhaise, Athenry or Clonakilty. They discovered that, on their own farm, the cost of a horse for a year was £33 15s.  They show how this cost was made up.  The horse was worked 1,500 hours or, approximately, 200 days, which meant that it cost 5¼d. per hour, or if you take into consideration a man and two horses, 1/6 an hour.  If you told a farmer here that his horse cost him £33 15s. a year, what would he say?  One hears talk about farmers having things at first cost.  These are some of the costs which have to be borne.  In different ways in England, they have carried out investigations along these lines and the results are of considerable value to them.  We have no such guide.  Before we, in the future, set out arbitrarily to determine <Col N="620" /> wages for agricultural workers or to increase or reduce prices of agricultural commodities, there should be some ascertained basis on which we could determine whether these figures will be equitable or not, whether they will be fair to producers&mdash;I include in that term those who work for the farmers as well as the farmers themselves&mdash;and fair to the consumers.</P>
    <P>On the last day when I was discussing the summary which Professor Murphy had prepared in this regard, I was interrupted by Senator O Buachalla.  I think probably the Senator may have looked into the matter since and, if so, he will have discovered that all the people to whom Professor Murphy's calculations related were divided into adult units of labour.  This is a short summary of the conclusions arrived at by Professor Murphy on the investigations carried out on 98 Limerick and Cork farms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Charging family labour at the same rate as equivalent hired labour, but making no allowance for interest on capital, and the managerial and risk-taking functions of the former, the average &lsquo;surplus&rsquo; per farm was £23.  On 37 farms (38 per cent. of the total number included) there was a deficit; on 43 farms (44 per cent.) there was a &lsquo;surplus&rsquo; of less than £80; and on the other 18 farms (18 per cent.) the surplus varied between £80 and £200.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was giving the family labour the same rate of wages as hired labour. This summary showed the position some short time back and, in my judgment, the position has not altered materially since.  If it has, it has altered not at all favourably for the average farmer in certain districts.</P>

      <P>Has that surplus been arrived at after allowing for the maintenance of the farmer and his family?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the surplus arrived at after deducting all costs.  If it were not, I would point out to Senator Alton that £23 would go a very short way towards keeping a family for 12 months.  Finally, I would draw the attention of the House to a <Col N="621" /> statement made by the British Minister of Agriculture in discussing the effect of increases in wages on food prices. Here is the relevant paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Commenting on this development in the House of Commons, the Minister of Agriculture said it had always appeared to him to be wrong that the agricultural labourer should have been regarded as properly the recipient of the lowest rate of wages in the labour market.  &lsquo;We shall now have the problem of adjusting farmers&rsquo; returns to cover the increase in costs of production due to this increase of wages,' Mr. Hudson added. &lsquo;It is not going to be an easy task, but I have no doubt that we shall be able to accomplish it.  You cannot pay the agricultural worker of this country a decent wage unless you are prepared to pay a reasonable price for the food which he has produced, a price which will enable the farmer to continue not only cultivating the land, but maintaining it in a proper state of fertility.&rsquo;  The money to meet this wage increase, as Mr. Hudson pointed out, will have to come from the consumer or out of the taxpayer's pocket.  The old cry of cheap food had helped to depress agricultural wages.  If, after the war, we were to depend for the employment of many millions of our people on the manufacture of goods for export, our interest was to see that the great consuming countries of the world, which were primarily agricultural countries, were prosperous enough to buy the goods we manufactured. They could only be prosperous if we paid them a decent price for the food they sent us.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point which the Minister of Agriculture makes there is that you cannot pay the agricultural labourer a decent wage unless you pay a decent price for the food which he produces, &ldquo;a price which will enable the farmer to continue not only cultivating the land, but maintaining it in a proper state of fertility&rdquo;.  That should be exactly our line here.  We cannot pay the agricultural worker a decent rate of wages unless we pay more for our food.  We may as well face that fact and the <Col N="622" /> time to face it is now.  In my judgment you could create a body similar to that under which Professor Murphy carried out his investigations and make it the nucleus of a small organisation that would set about its task in a scientific way, a body that could be regarded as independent of farmers, labour, or of any interest in the State, to determine what the costs of production on a farm were</P>
    <P>I think, apart from any other consideration, it is essential that we should proceed along those lines.  I think the Minister in future should have the advice and the assistance which a scientific organisation like that, properly constituted, could afford to him in determining what were reasonable prices.  In the last analysis it is the people who have to pay, and the people will have to pay a reasonable price unless they are going to impose on the producer of food a lower standard of living than is consistent with the bodily health of those engaged in food production.  If people are going to pay that price, they in turn will have to be satisfied that they are paying it because the goods cannot be produced for them at a lower price.  If they insist on food being provided at a lower price, the net result will be that there will be far fewer people willing to provide such food, a scarcity will be created and ultimately consumers will have to pay more for their food.</P>
    <P>I hope Senator Foran realises that it is not in the best interests of agriculture or the nation that we should proceed blindly to-day to increase agricultural wages without relating them to the farmers' capacity to pay.  I would urge that that capacity to pay can be determined only on the advice of people who are technically competent to determine it.  I cannot see that it can be determined in any way other than the method I suggest in the amendment as an addition to Senator Foran's motion, namely that a technical agricultural costings organisation be set up.  I think such a machine as that should be a fundamental adjunct of progressive agriculture in this country in future.  I think no branch of our national services <Col N="623" /> would benefit to the same extent by the creation of such a body as the Department of Agriculture, and I would urge on the House that that is the line to take in regard to this motion.  I hope that the Minister also will say that he himself is satisfied that the time has come when something of this kind should be done and that he himself will take such steps as are necessary to bring such an organisation into existence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to second the amendment standing in the name of Senator Baxter, but actually my own sympathies are more in the direction of the amendment already proposed by Senator Counihan.  I take it, however, that that will not preclude me at this stage from discussing in a general way the problems arising out of the minimum wage for agricultural workers and the proposal that that wage should be substantially increased.  I must say there are serious objections to any form of minimum, as applied to an agricultural wage, which are of theoretical and, perhaps, of practical importance. It is possible to argue, and I probably shall argue, that if, under present conditions, no minimum whatever were fixed, and agricultural wages were allowed to find their own level in a free market, which at the moment is by no means glutted with available labour, agricultural wages would average higher than they do now under the minimum, and would be better related to the capacity of the workers concerned. There would be a degree of gradation of agricultural skill, and consequently a greater differentiation between lower and higher agricultural wages, and the average would be higher than it is now under the principle of the minimum wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the minimum which now exists, no matter where you put the minimum, unless you put it very low indeed, you are ensuring that employers who, for one reason or another, find that the labour in question is not worth the wage which is fixed, will simply do without that labour.  To that extent, all who are what might be called sub-marginal workers, all workers who, in the judgment of the <Col N="624" /> employer, are not worth the minimum wage, will be discarded by the employer and will have to find other employment, if they are lucky enough to do so.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the minimum system is that, in actual practice, it probably has the effect of the minimum becoming the maximum.  A farmer might, perhaps, like to discard some of his less efficient workers, but for various reasons he cannot do so and he has to pay them the minimum wage; but he gets compensation for himself, if he can, by paying the others, the better workers&mdash;I am thinking of the farmer who employs five, six or a dozen workers&mdash;a smaller weekly wage than he would like to pay them if he had not to pay his less efficient workers so much as he has to pay them; so that one effect of the minimum wage principle, so far as it does not push sub-marginal workers out of employment, is to level down the wages of the best workers to close to the level of the wages of the worst workers who are working on a minimum wage level.</P>
    <P>Another effect of the minimum wage principle is that it seems to me to encourage the casualisation of that fringe of agricultural labour on which our larger farmers are so largely dependent. If a farmer finds that he must pay a whole-time worker 30/- a week and if already he has one or two reliable permanent workers on his staff, if he has to pay 30/- a week for the whole time of a third worker, he is going to think out ways and means by which he can do with only an occasional one day's or two days' labour from that third worker, and he will pay for these days' work at the minimum rate; but, in actual fact, that third worker may find at the end of the year that his annual wage adds up to perhaps only an average of 10/- or 15/- a week, whereas if that farmer had been free to employ him at less than the minimum wage, he might have found it well worth his while to have his whole time for a wage of 20/- or 25/- a week; so that the minimum wage has a certain tendency to make farmers employ extra labour three days a week when they would rather employ them for six days a week, and make <Col N="625" /> the surplus labour element get less days' work in the year, and, consequently, a smaller annual wage than they would get if they were free to make a bargain and the law did not fix a minimum wage.</P>
    <P>This motion rather assumes, without evidence, that the mere fact that the prices of agricultural products have been increased, and substantially increased, automatically increases the profits of the farmer and, therefore, the fund out of which additional wages might be paid to agricultural workers; but there is no such obvious inference in the nature of the case.  There are such things as agricultural costs as well as agricultural prices, and everyone knows that agricultural costs have been mounting up just as well as agricultural prices and it is not by any means certain that even in the case of wheat at 50/- per barrel, the ordinary producer will reap any larger surplus of money from growing wheat this season than last season when wheat was only 40/- per barrel.  It all depends on the yield, on the weather and on various other factors which are quite beyond the power of any person to foresee.</P>
    <P>If we consider the present minimum rate of agricultural wages, which, I think, is about 30/- a week for the country as a whole, in relation to the present net output of our total agricultural production, we arrive at some curious results.  The most recent figure I have seen for what is called the gross output of agricultural production relates to the year 1939-40, and, if I remember aright, adds up to a total of some £60,000,000 in value.  Out of that gross output must be taken the cost of materials, seeds and so on, bought in by our agriculturists and worked up in the course of their production.  That element of materials employed used to amount to some £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 and probably amounts to something of the same order now, although the quantities of materials used like manures, and so on, are certainly very much less and prices are very much higher, so that gross output being about £60,000,000, net output is probably not much more than £50,000,000 odd, and, out of that net output, rates, annuities and various other expenses like <Col N="626" /> veterinary services, depreciation of machinery and so on, have to be paid before you arrive at the fund which is really available for the profits of the farmer and the remuneration of labour, whether the labour be family or hired labour.  That being so, to say that the value of net output available for distribution between the 600,000 people who are now occupied in our agriculture exceeds £60,000,000 would be extremely optimistic.</P>
    <P>The farmers, by their own thrift and labour in past generations, have built up a considerable value of capital assets associated with their agriculture, which I have recently had occasion to examine in another connection which will be available publicly in two or three days' time. According to my estimate, the total value of the capital assets associated with our agriculture adds up to the very respectable figure of £466,000,000, if you include the value of the dwelling accommodation and farm buildings of farmers as well as the value of their land, fenced and drained, at an average of about £15 an acre.  Even farmers might reasonably expect some return by way of interest on their real investment of capital in Irish agriculture, and at a moderate estimate, it would not be absurd to set aside out of that net output the figure of some £24,000,000, representing a modest 5 per cent. on the capital value of the investment in Irish agriculture, owned for the most part by our operating farmers, but in some cases borrowed from outside sources, and in respect of which they have to pay interest at a rate of at least 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>If you take £24,000,000 from £54,000,000, you are left with £30,000,000, and you then come down to the region of the amount which is available for distribution as payment for the labour of the 600,000 people who are occupied either on their own or family farms, or earning wages working for other farmers.  Dividing 600,000 into £30,000,000, you get a figure of a modest £50 a year as the average income available for the people who are now occupied in Irish agriculture, and already the minimum wage of agricultural labour averages 30/- a week, or <Col N="627" /> £78 a year, so that already agricultural labour is receiving a much higher wage than it would get if all the available labour income from Irish agriculture were divided equally between the 600,000 people who are actually labourers in Irish agriculture, although only 140,000 of them are wage-receiving labourers.</P>
    <P>That sounds almost like an economic absurdity, but it is a simple elementary fact, and the explanation of it, of course, is that the great bulk of the persons occupied in Irish agriculture are sitting around on the small farms of 30 acres or less and are really superfluous to the work to be done on them. The output per person of the persons so occupied on the smaller farms is probably lower than £50 per person per year.  Consequently, the output per person of the persons occupied on the larger farm is certainly, on the average, higher than £50 per person per year, and in the few cases which I have personally investigated of a few large, well-equipped and adequately capitalised farms, I arrived at the conclusion that the net output per person occupied in such farms reached as high as £215 per person per year, and in other cases was well over £100 per person per year.  If we consider the large farms, the best equipped and best managed farms, the net output, which is compatible with the actual minimum wage of 30/- a week, might even be compatible with a slight increase in the wage payments due to the people who are working on the larger farms.  The fact is, of course, that whereas we have nearly 400,000 agricultural holdings, there are only some 50,000 farmers who employ any wage-paid agricultural labour at all.  In general these are farms with 50 acres or more.  It happens that the output per person is, on the average, much higher on the larger farms.  In particular cases it is very much higher, and for that reason the men with the larger farms are able to pay the present minimum wage.  Indeed, if one were to look into the matter in the manner suggested by Senator Baxter, it might even be found that, under present conditions, most of <Col N="628" /> them could pay a wage somewhat higher than the present minimum.  But, even in the case of these 50,000 farmers who employ wage-paid labour, there must be gradations.</P>
    <P>Some may be occupying better land than others; their situation may be favoured more by present economic conditions, or they may have more skilled labour at their disposal, but, whatever the reason, there must be any number of gradations amongst these 50,000 farmers.  There must be thousands of them who could, possibly, pay more than the present minimum wage, but equally there must be 1,000 or more of them at the bottom of the scale.  Therefore, you must consider the marginal cases to whom the addition of even less than 2/6 per week to the persons they employ would mean perhaps all the difference between solvency and the other thing.  In increasing this minimum wage, one has to be conscious of its possible effects on marginal employers as well as on marginal workers.  By a marginal employer I mean one who, under present conditions, can only just afford to pay the present minimum wage, and who might feel the burden of any increase too much to be borne.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the principal need of our agriculture, as I see it, is more capital intelligently used in the development of agricultural production, of better equipment generally, and of better management, especially on the larger farms.  There are, of course, difficulties in war time in the way of getting new machines.  They simply cannot be got now.  From such evidence as I have been able to see, those farmers who are adequately capitalised, well equipped and themselves good managers, are able to pay the present wage and they could, probably, pay a somewhat higher wage. If, therefore, we could only increase the number of farmers in that category, then I think it might be possible to bring about a substantial improvement in the economic condition of our agricultural workers, but I would deprecate any flate rate effort to try to raise all round the income of agricultural workers, good as well as bad, from farmers who could afford to pay it as well as from those who could not.  I <Col N="629" /> would deprecate that because of its possible repercussions on our whole agricultural production campaign and national economy.  There still remains the human problem of the family circumstances of the agricultural worker who is unable to make both ends meet on his present inadequate wage.  That is a problem which I would like to approach in a different way&mdash;from the point of view of human need and of social justice.  The remarks that I have to make on that aspect of the question I propose to reserve for a later motion.</P>

Scairteann dream aca a chúig, scairteann dream eile a deic, an chéad dream eile cúig-déag agus mar sin, ach <Col N="632" /> sé donas an scéil nach iad na daoine is aoirde scairteas a dhíolas an dochar, ach muinntear na hEireann uilig.</P>
      <P>Is dóigh liom féin go bhféadfadh na feirmeoirí b'fhéidir beagán níos mó a thabhairt do na hoibrightheoirí fá láthair, gan árdú ar bith fháil ar a dtoradh, nó ón Stát.  Tá siad ag fáil luach maith ar a lán rudaí, ar chruithneacht, ar bhiatas, ar lín, ar olainn, agus ar mhóin má tá portach aca; agus níl a gcostas ag dul suas dá réir, óir gheibh siad cuid mhaith dá mbiadh, agus go minic adhbhar teineadh, gan costas, ach a saothrú.  Is minic adeir siad, agus is fíor é, go dtig gach adhbhar cothuithe ón talamh.  Tig, agus tá seilbh an tailimh ag na feirmeoirí.  Ach tá taobh eile ar an sgéal.  Is le muinntear na hÉireann an talamh agus tá siad i muinighin an tailimh le n-a mbeatha a thártháil. Má fágtar gann i mbiadh no i dteine sinn, geallaim daoibh go mbeidh raic ann agus go mbeidh malairt seilbhe ar an talamh.  Mura mbainfidh na feirmeoirí adhbhar cothuithe ón talamh don phobal, bainfear an talamh díobh agus cuirfear bail úr ar an talmhaíocht. Céad bliain ó shoin nó suas le céad bliain ó shoin bhí gorta mór ins an tír seo, gorta a mhairbh níos mó daoine ná marbhuigheadh ins an domhanchogadh seo go fóill, gorta a chuir gráin ar an saol mór go dtí go raibh morán náisiún mar na Stáit Aontuithe agus fiú an Turkey ag cur biadh go dtí an tír seo, biadh nár shroich na daoine go minic.  Cuireadh an mileán fán ghorta sin ar Riaghaltas Shasana agus ar na tighearnaí talmhan agus bé an ceart an mileán a chur ortha mar níor ghlac siad tuairim ar bith faoi mhuintear na hÉireann.  Ach má thagann gorta anois go hEirinn, cé air a gcuirfear an mileán?  Is dóigh liom fhéin go gcuirfear é b'fhéidir ar dtús ar an Riaghaltas ach ina dhiaidh sin beidh an mileán ar na feirmeoiri nár bhain siad go leor biadha ná teas ná rudaí eile as an talamh.</P>

    <P>Má tá ciall ag na feirmeoirí, agus creidim go bhfuil, ciall cheannuighthe, tuigfidh siad gurb é a ndualgas go leor bidh a bhaint as an talamh leis sinn a chothú agus má cuireann siad, an rud ba cheart dóibh a dhéanamh, acraí go leor den talamh fé curaíocht <Col N="633" /> le biadh do sholáthar don phobal, beidh cuid mhaith congnamh ag teastáil uatha ó lucht tuarastail agus caithfidh siad tuarastal réasúnta a thabhairt dóidh.  Tá slí amháin ann gur féidir cúitiú a thabhairt do lucht oibre fán tuaith gan morán d'ualach do chur ar an Riaghaltas nó ar na feirmeoirí sé sin, acra no dhó de thalamh do thabhairt mar chon-acra do gach teaghlach den lucht oibre le saothrú dhóibh féin ar chíos réasúnta, cuir i gcás, an méid a chosann sé do na feirmeoirí iad fhéin, cúpla punt an acra, an suim is mó de.  Fá lathair ní féidir le lucht oibre sin a fháil gan cíos i bhfad róthrom a dhíol air.  I gContae na Midhe agus i gContae Tír Chonaill tá fhios agam go bhfuil fir obire a dteastuíonn con-acra uatha go gcaithfidh siad £7 an acra a thabhairt mar chíos.  Níl sin ceart.  Níl na feirmeoirí fhéin ag tabhairt a leath-oiread sin ar an talamh.  Bhéarfaidh sin cúitiú mór do lucht oibre.  D'fhéadfadh fear oibre go mbeadh teaghlach aige biadh go leor a sholathar dóibh, cúpla acra prátaí, no cúpla acra cruithneachtan no eornan agus d'fhéadfadh sé biadh do sholáthair dóibh an chuid is mó den am. Rud eile, bhéarfadh sé baile comhnuidhe seasamhach dó agus ní bheadh an fonn céanna air teacht isteach ins na bailte móra no imtheacht go Sasana no Alban no America.  Sin rud nach cosnóchadh aon rud, no fiú aon rud, don tír agus chuirfeadh sé leis an bhiadh agus leis an ollmhaitheas as an talamh.</P>
    <P>Cuirim an moladh sin agus na tuairimi seo fá bhráid an Riaghaltais agus fá bhráid lucht oibre, cibé ar bith is fiú iad.</P>
    <P>Ní fheadar an bhfuil tuilleadh moladh agam ach amháin tagairt do rud a chuala mé annseo i mBaile Átha Cliath Dé Domhaigh seo caithte ar an sráid.  I gContae na Midhe tá Gaeltacht nua ann agus tá tuairim trí scór feirmeoiri ins an áit sin.  Tá teaghlach i ngach áit aca san agus iad ag fás agus tá go leor lucht oibre aca fhéin agus níos mó ná go leor, ach má theastúionn uatha tuilleadh tailimh a fháil le saothrú caithfidh siad suas le £7 sa bhliain an t-acra a thabhairt air sin.  Téigheann siad amach agus chíonn siad mór-thimpall ortha na <Col N="634" /> mílte acra ina luighe bán.  An talamh sin níl aon mhaith ann d'aoinne ach don fheirmeoir ar leis é.  Ní dhíolann sé tuarastal.  Níl air ach cúram a thabhairt do na buláin agus má gheibheann sé profit cuireann sé ina phóca é.  Níl aon tairbhe don tír ann. Deirtear go bhfuil 3,000,000 acra d'ithir na hEireann atá intreabhtha agus nach treabhtar.  Tá sé ina luighe bán faoi fhéir agus faoi na buláin agus na caoirigh agus na ba.  Tá fhios againn go léir nach bhfuil morán maith annsin don tír.  Tá an seachtú cuid den tír atá intreabhtha faoi curraíocht.  Tá beagnach a leath den tír ina luighe bán agus tá 7,000,000 eile nach bhfuil intreabhtha ach gur féidir úsáid a bhaint as ag baint mona, ag cur crainn agus rudai mar sin agus níl faic á dhéanamh leis.  Is mór an náire é.</P>
    <P>Tá sé i n-am dúinn smaointiú ar an rud is fearr a dhéanamh don tír seo agus é dhéanamh, agus cibé ar bith duine a gcuirfidh sé as dó é a chur a leath-taobh agus smaointiú ar mhaitheas an phobail go léir.</P>
    <P>Seo é an rud a chuala mé Dé Domhnaigh.  Tá tuairim leath na feirmeoirí ins an Gaedhealtacht go bhfuil aimsir le sparáil ag na teaghlaigh agus go bhfuil siad ag cloisint bolscaireacht mór go bhfuil cruithneacht ag teastáil uainn sa tír.  Bhí tuairim aca go nglacfadh siad ocht n-acra gach teaghlach agus go gcuirfidís cruithneach annsin, sé sin os cionn 400 acra a bheadh fé chruithneacht agus, abair,. ceithre míle barraille cruithneachtan.  Bheadh siad sásta sin a ghlacadh ón talamh bán a bhí ina luighe annsin thart timpall ortha, ach é fháil ar chíos réasúnta, agus ní bhfuighidís é.  Beidh an tír an méid sin goirid de chruithneachtain i mbliana mar gheall air sin.  Tá iongantas orm fhéin.  Ní thuigim cén fáth nár glacadh seilbh ar chuid den talamh bán sin agus é thabhairt do lucht oibre a bhí fonnmhar é oibriú agus cruithneacht do chur ann.</P>
    <P>Tá rud amháin eile a chuala mé annseo indiu.  Chualamar ologón ó na feirmeoirí i dtaobh na droch-aimsire a bhí aca fé lathair.  Scéal o professors é agus ní chreidim é.  Ní chreidim Professor Murphy no professor ar bith eile <Col N="635" /> nuair deir sé go bhfuil droch-aimsear ag na feirmeoirí fé lathair.  Má tá, is ortha féin atá an locht.  Tá ceist cile ann.  Cén luach atá ar an talamh?  Má theastuíonn feirm uaim-se cé mhéid a chaitheas mé thabhairt air?  Luaidh mé cheanna féin an cíos ar fiú an talamh i gContae na Midhe&mdash;£7 an acra.  Is mór an méid sin agus níos mó ná a leath de sin gheibh an feirmeoir in aisce é.  Níl sé ag díol £2 an acra agus £4 no £5 fágtha aige go dtig leis cur ina phóca. Léigh mé ins an bpáipéar tá tamall ó shoin fá luacha roinnt feirme a díoladh le goirid agus siad na luachanna a fuair siad ortha, ó £30 go dtí £60 an t-acra.  Anois, más féidir nach bhfuighidh feirmeoir ach £50 ins an bhliain as a saothar, cad chuige nach ndíolfadh sé an fheirm sin ar, abair, £5 an t-acra?  Measaim go dtig le na feoirmeoirí níos mó tuarastal a thabhairt dá lucht oibre agus go mba cheart dóibh an cheist sin do scrúdú go cúramach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a good many of the speeches that have been made are more or less superfluous at the moment, particularly when I draw the attention of the Seanad to the fact that the Agricultural Wages Board is there.  The Agricultural Wages Act was passed in 1936 and I think it is true to say that there was practically no opposition at any stage of that Bill in either House of the Oireachtas, so that it can be taken that the different Parties at that time were as favourable to the Bill being passed as were those who introduced it.  In that Act there was machinery for the fixation of a minimum wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible that there are certain Senators who do not exactly remember what way that Act operates and it may be no harm to mention that under the Act there are regional committees set up.  On each regional committee there is at least one representative of the farmers and one representative of the agricultural labourers from each county; in some of the bigger counties there is more than one representing each interest.  There are five regional committees in the country and they are arranged more or less on a <Col N="636" /> geographical basis for the convenience of meeting, where there is a convenient centre for meeting.  In addition, there was an Agricultural Wages Board, a Central Board set up.  On that board there are four representatives of the farmers, and four representatives of the agricultural labourers.  There are three neutral members nominated by the Minister for Agriculture and a chairman, also nominated by the Minister.  That is how this machinery is planned.</P>
    <P>When the chairman is informed there is a request from either side, from the labourers or the farmers, that there should be a review of the wages, he calls meetings of the regional committees. He goes to each committee in turn and gets the views of the farmers' representatives and the labour representatives and, having visited all the committees, he calls a meeting of the board, and puts before the board what he has gathered from the various committees.  If they have passed a resolution asking for a higher wage or for some change in the conditions of employment, he puts these matters before the board and gives them an account of the voting at the committee meeting.  The board then discusses the business.  The chairman tries to get the board to agree.  He is the chairman of a conciliation board and it is his business to get agreement, if he can.  If he fails to get agreement, then he is bound to give an award himself, so that he acts in a judicial capacity if he fails to get agreement from the board as a whole.  If the four representatives of the farmers and the four representatives of labour and the three neutral members agree on any particular thing, then the chairman must abide by that decision.</P>
    <P>The position at the moment is that the committees have met.  The chairman has been around the committees during the last four or five weeks&mdash;I learned this from the chairman.  I did not ask him what the decision of the committees was, because it is not my business to find that out.  I know that he has attended the meetings of five committees.  He concluded those meetings some day last week and his <Col N="637" /> next business is to call a meeting of the board.  He is calling that meeting and it will meet some time early in March.</P>
    <P>I think, under the circumstances, that if the Seanad were to come to a decision on this motion it would interfere with the machinery already set up by the Oireachtas.  In fact, it would be very much like passing a resolution giving the Seanad's opinion of what the decision of even the High Court might be in a particular case.  I think it is not advisable that the Seanad should come to a decision on this particular motion or on any of the amendments. Senators know that this board fixes a minimum wage.  They have no business to interfere with any farmer who pays more than the minimum wage and, so far as any law or order is concerned at the present time, any farmer can pay as much as he likes to his labourer.  In fact, as we know, a number of farmers are paying more than the minimum wage.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to enter into the merits of the case.  It would not be right for me to do so at the moment. If there had been a different type of motion put before the Seanad, I might like to express my opinion on it, just as well as anybody else here; but I think as regards this particular motion it would be wrong that I should express any opinion whatever on the merits.  It is very easy for any of us to say that we think the agricultural labourers should get more.  It may require a certain amount of moral courage, even on the part of a Senator here, if this goes to a division, to say that he will vote against the motion brought in by Senator Foran, because it might be made to appear that he is voting against an increase of agricultural wages.  I think what he really would be voting for is this, that the machinery already set up should be allowed to function and that the Seanad should not interfere by expressing any opinion at this moment.</P>
    <P>If the Seanad should carry this motion, what effect will it have?  In my opinion it will have no effect whatever. Who is going to interfere?  The mover of the motion does not say. <Col N="638" /> Surely, the Government are not going to interfere?  The Government got the Dáil and Seanad to set up machinery to establish a minimum wage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there any Seanad at all at that time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>Who fixes the price of wheat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government fixed the price of wheat, but the Government did not ask&mdash;although they may ask soon&mdash;the Dáil or the Seanad to put up machinery for the fixing of the price of wheat.  I think they would be wrong in fixing the price after they asked the Dáil and Seanad to set up the machinery.  The Dáil and Seanad having asked the Government to set up machinery for dealing with agricultural wages, I think it would be wrong now, at the request of the Seanad, to ignore the Agricultural Wages Board.  Therefore, I say that if this motion is carried it may be all right for Senators who vote for it, because they can go to the country and tell the agricultural labourers that they are their friends, but they must realise at the same time that they are not achieving anything for the agricultural labourers.  They are expressing their opinions&mdash;we can all do that&mdash;about the agricultural labourers getting more.  I am sure there is no Senator who would object to the agricultural labourers getting more&mdash;but that is all it amounts to, a record of those who favour an increase of wages for the agricultural labourers, but without saying anything of how it is to be done or anything else. Those who vote against the motion, on the other hand, as I say, will be, in my opinion, in a more logical position, because they will at least vote that the machinery is there, that as long as it is there it should be allowed to operate, and that there should not be any what <Col N="639" /> I might call sentimental or humanitarian considerations brought in here to interfere with that machinery.</P>
      <P>Now, I think that the Agricultural Wages Board should be allowed to proceed with their business.  I do not know what they may do.  I have not the slightest idea of what they may do, but if, when they meet in two or three weeks' time, they say, for instance, that in their opinion an increase of wages cannot be given, and if there are Senators here who dislike intensely that decision, then I think that what these Senators should do is to put down a motion to repeal the Agricultural Wages Act.  That is the only thing that could be done in the present circumstances because nobody can interfere as long as that Act is there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a meeting specially called to consider the matter of wages. I cannot say definitely at the moment &mdash;I have not the Act with me&mdash;what moves the chairman to call the committees, but I know that he has called them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that it is very desirable that a debate on the motion with regard to family allowances should take place before the Agricultural Wages Board take their decision on the matter to which the Minister refers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another point, but at any rate the committees have met and the board must now meet.  I was not able to get a definite date for the meeting from the chairman, but he said that the board, in the ordinary way, would meet in about three weeks after the last meeting of the committees. Now, when I say &ldquo;in the ordinary <Col N="640" /> way&rdquo; I do not want it to be said that I misquoted the chairman if it should happen to be four weeks instead of three.  The point is that the question must come up now.  I suggest that if the board decide to leave things as they are, and if any Senator is dissatisfied with that decision, then the best thing for such a Senator to do would be to move for the repeal of the Act, so that that board could be put out of existence.  If, on the other hand, the board should decide to increase the wage, then it is a matter for Senators to decide whether that increase is satisfactory or not.  If it is satisfactory, I take it that everybody would be satisfied, and if it is not satisfactory, then I take it that Senators may feel that they should do something about it.</P>
      <P>I do not think, however, that I can be impressed by a motion of this kind, or by sentimental speeches to the effect that the agricultural wage-earner is in a bad way, and so on, or by humanitarian arguments used to the effect that the man cannot live on his present wages.  I have to put up with the machinery that is there, as long as it is there.  If, however, the Seanad, by a majority, were to pass a motion that the present machinery is altogether unsatisfactory and that the Act should be repealed, then I say that, naturally, I must be impressed by that and must see what can be done to replace it. Now, so far as the motion is concerned, and I think also so far as the amendment by Senator Counihan and the amendment by Senator Baxter are concerned, all that they really advocate is much what the Agricultural Wages Board have to do themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have to take all these things into consideration.  They have to take into consideration the two big items: what the agricultural labouring man can live on and what the farmer can pay, and they have to do the best they can as between those two considerations. Sometimes it is impossible to reconcile them, but they have to do the best they can, and I think that in that way you have the views of farmers, as to whether they can pay or not, which I think is the big point in Senator Counihan's amendment.  Perhaps we cannot regard these men as expert costings officers, and so on, and <Col N="641" /> in that respect we may not meet what Senator Baxter wants; but, on the other hand, they may be the best that we have at the moment, because at least they have been considering this point for the last four or five years. They have, I take it, built up a certain amount of information and knowledge on the subject of what the farmer can afford to pay, and although their decisions may not be based on a scientific foundation, they are based, to a large extent, anyway, on a common-sense view of the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that their decisions ought to be based on a scientific foundation, if you can get one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether they would be much better off if you could get a scientific basis, either.  I do not know whether a higher wage could be paid.  I suppose we would all like that, but some Senators&mdash;Senator Counihan for one, and some other Senators&mdash;are not sure, I think, that the farmer can pay an increased wage. That is the very point that this Agricultural Wages Board will be dealing with.  We may take it for granted that the board, so far as the Labour representatives are concerned, will be persuaded that the agricultural worker should get more, and the farmers' representatives on the board will probably argue against it.  I do not know, of course; maybe they will say that they are prepared to pay more, and maybe they will not; but I take it they will argue against it, as farmers here in the Seanad would argue against it to some extent.  Now, they may be induced by the chairman to come to some compromise.  He may get a decision from the board, or, if he fails to get it, he may make an award himself, but at any rate you have men there sitting around a table where they have got the views of at least one representative of the farmers of every county in the country and at least one representative of the agricultural labourers of every county in the country.  They have got all these views before them, and I think they will be in as good a position as we can reasonably expect any man to be in at the <Col N="642" /> moment to discuss this matter of wages.</P>
      <P>As I have said, when this thing is over there may be some who will be dissatisfied with the decision.  If so, I think the duty of such a Senator is obvious: to put down a motion to have the Agricultural Wages Act rescinded. I think that nothing is going to come of a fairly loose motion and a fairly loose discussion, which talks about an increase in agricultural wages but does not come down to the very material point of how much that is to be, when it is to be given, by whom it is to be paid, and from what source the money is to be got.  These are the points that the board will deal with, and I think these are the points that matter in a case like this.  It does not matter very much to the farmers or to the agricultural labourers what Senator is in favour of an increased wage or what Senator is against it: what does really matter is the particular points of how much is to be paid, where it is to come from, who is to pay it, when it is to operate, over what period it is to operate, and so on.  For these reasons, therefore, I am strongly of opinion that the motion should not be pressed to a decision, at least until&mdash;in fact, not at any time, in my opinion&mdash;but at least until the board have met, and possibly that will be within the next two or three weeks.</P>

      <P>I should not be surprised if the discussion, so far as it has gone at any rate, should have led to some confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact, the position <Col N="643" /> could hardly be otherwise in view of the clash of ideas implied in the motion and in the two amendments which have been tabled to it.  Senator Foran did not waste much time, last day, in proposing his motion, and he certainly put such points as he wished to make very briefly and very clearly. For myself, I would be very happy indeed if I could see how it would be possible to give our agricultural labourers as high a rate of wages as is being paid to similar workers in England.  I think Senator Foran mentioned that they are getting up to £3 a week, and that their getting it does not depend on whether they are 20 years of age or not.  I believe that, in the first place, if this were a very rich country and if we were at war, and, further, if we had our backs to the wall and had, incidentally, a very rich Empire under our control, it might be possible to do it.  But one thing we ought to remember is this: that it takes the threat and, I should say, the immediate threat of a great catastrophe to bring people to such a frame of mind that they will hand over, or that they will allow to be taken from them, such wealth as they possess in order that production may be assured in directions considered advisable by the Government and at prices considered expedient by the Government.  Back of all this there would still be the day of reckoning.</P>
    <P>To what extent wages can be raised here, in view of all our circumstances, I will not attempt to say.  The proposer of the motion, as the Minister has pointed out, did not say to what extent they should be raised; nor did he say, explicitly at any rate, from what source the increase should come.  These are matters that should be dealt with. We have just completed a long discussion on the price of wheat.  Some people hold that the increase granted is really in the nature of a bonus or, if you like to put it in another way, in the nature of an insurance premium which is being levied off the community in general to ensure its full supply of essential foodstuffs from the rural section of the community.  Others, on the other hand, contend that the increase merely secures to the farmers <Col N="644" /> their costs of production and no more. These are the two views that are held on that question of the increase in the price of wheat.  Who is going to decide which is the correct view?  If the first view is correct, then obviously it is on the farmers that the demand for this increase in wages must be made. If the second view is correct, then the urban community must foot the bill.</P>
    <P>I may have done Senator Foran an injustice by saying that he did not say definitely from what source this increase in the wages of agricultural workers might come.  I recall that he did say something like this, that the farmers were fairly satisfied.  The Senator possibly subscribes to the first view and, if he is correct in that, then the farmers, being a generous body, may be willing to share their satisfaction with the people whom this motion is designed to assist.  I have seen sad cases of poverty in rural Ireland, cases where the fault could not fairly be laid at the doors of the sufferers themselves.  But cases of poverty, from whatever cause, are happily a very very small proportion of the agricultural population.  On the other hand, while what we call the nominal wage of the agricultural labourer may seem very small&mdash;and I agree, when all is said and done, that it is small&mdash;yet when it is measured in terms of real wages certain very important compensations are revealed. For instance, it would scarcely be denied that such items as rent, fuel, and the availability of food commodities of various kinds are of real advantage to the rural worker as compared with the position of the urban worker.</P>
    <P>Now I know that Senator Foran did not suggest that wages in the urban centres should be taken as a fair standard by which to gauge the wages of the agricultural labourers.  I am sure Senator Foran would be the last to suggest that the wages of the urban workers secure anything like the standard of living that he would consider reasonable, and I certainly will agree with him in that.  But I will have to add this, that I wish I could see how a real rise in the standards could be achieved, especially under <Col N="645" /> present conditions; that is a rise in wages which would in effect mean a genuine rise in the general standard of living.  Any rise in wages which does not bring in its train a rise in the standard of living in the way I have mentioned would be useless.</P>
    <P>But to return to the point, it was suggested during the debate that the rural workers were very much worse off than the urban workers.  It was stated in the course of the debate, by Senator Dr. Doyle, I believe, that the whole trend of legislation in recent years has been against the agricultural worker.  Now in view of the peculiar conditions of rural economy I should like to ask is it really unjust, for instance, to cut off the rural worker from unemployment benefit during a certain three months of the year?  In view of, say, rural housing developments, the establishment of the agricultural wages boards, which have been dealt with by the Minister just now and which seem to have functioned very well and smoothly up to this, in view of the extension of medical and dental services, hospitalisation, and even the extension of unemployment allowances, not to mention many other advantages, it is hardly fair to say that the whole trend of legislation is against the agricultural labourer.  It is a pity Senator Dr. Doyle did not expand on that bold, forward policy which he recommended to the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance.  Perhaps some Senator could name a committee of magicians, such as Senator Foran recommended to Senator Counihan, to aid the Ministers.</P>
    <P>Like the wages of the agricultural labourers, various advantages sought to be given as result of legislation may not be as high as one would like them to be, but that is another point altogether.</P>
    <P>An amendment before the House recommends the establishment of a board or organisation which would be responsible for obtaining agricultural costings, and it suggests that the payment of increased wages to agricultural workers should depend on that organisation finding that the industry could afford such increase.  The proposer of <Col N="646" /> the amendment deplored the fact that in this country so little had been done on the question of costings.  The Senator's words were: &ldquo;We have not here what they have in other countries, any sort of technical organisation for determining costings in agriculture.  In fact,&rdquo; the Senator continued, &ldquo;we are one of the most backward countries in the world in that respect.&rdquo;  The quotation is from the Official Debates, Volume 26, No.6, page 555.  If the extent to which some of our agricultural spokesmen are informed were indicative of the knowledge of people throughout the country, then I would be inclined to agree that we are one of the most backward countries in the world.  The Senator also said: &ldquo;We have not even any sort of technical organisation dealing with costs.&rdquo; Surely the Munster Institute is a highly technical organisation.  Its tests and its costings are published in considerable detail periodically.  We have cow-testing associations.  Are not these associations in fact costings organisations? Does not almost every county committee of agriculture engage in costings activities?  There are other bodies engaged in that work, for instance, our agricultural colleges.</P>

      <P>In what was almost the next breath the Senator proceeded to say: &ldquo;The Minister for Agriculture and Senators are aware of the work that was done by Professor Murphy of University College, Cork.&rdquo; The paper which he held in his hand at the time and to which he was referring, opened with these words: &ldquo;In May, 1938, an inquiry was started by the Department of Dairy Accountancy and Economics, University College, Cork, into the costs and income of a number of dairy farms on the Cork-Limerick border.&rdquo;  So, there is a department of dairy accountancy and economics in the country in addition to the organisations I have already mentioned!  The Senator, of course, may declare that he does not recognise the Department of Dairy Accountancy and Economics of University College, Cork, as a technical agricultural costings organisation.  I have discovered that it is difficult to please him.  But, at any rate, it is interesting to note that he relied on the findings of that department to support whatever case he was trying to make here.  I presumed Senator Baxter had made a study of the report in question and was about to discuss it, which, of course, he would be entitled to do. Because of that I ventured to ask him if he considered children of 14 years of age should be considered as adults in <Col N="648" /> a survey of the kind.  I should like to have heard his opinion on that as well as on a few other points, but to put it mildly, he was not very encouraging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction, they were not considered as adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>What I had in mind at the time were the difficulties that those studying problems of urban industry and unemployment are confronted with in connection with what is called juvenile labour and I was wondering to what extent young people between 14 and 18 might be considered as juveniles in connection with agricultural employment.  I was also troubled with this point, that in view of the efforts we are making to get parents to continue to send their children, after leaving the national schools at 14 years of age, to our vocational schools and to agricultural schools, if it is eventually decided to establish them, what exact importance would be attached to the losing of the services of these children or juveniles.  That was a very important point and I thought that one who poses as an authority&mdash;and I suppose he has the right to claim considerable knowledge of the problem&mdash; would be able to help me.  However, later on he suggested that the results of the survey were being contested and further stated that any Senator was free to challenge them publicly.  I have already stated that when I want information on technical matters I like to go to the expert for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Senator that I had no intention of contesting Professor Murphy's results.  I admire his valuable contribution in this matter of farm costings and I am very sorry to see the work of this young man being used&mdash;or misused&mdash;in the way it is.  I should not be surprised if it were to deter him and people like him from engaging in such difficult and such arduous work or publishing their results in future. When I go to experts for information I am always entitled to seek an explanation on matters on which I am not clear.  For instance, I should have liked to know from Senator Baxter to what extent he would consider that the <Col N="649" /> results of a survey covering the years 31st May, 1937, to 30th April, 1939, would be applicable, say, to the present time; to what extent they might be taken as a guide to conditions obtaining to-day.  I should like to know whether the wage of 25/- mentioned in the report is really typical of the wage being paid to-day.  By the way, I might remind the Senator that although he had that paper in his hand he misquoted the wage mentioned by Professor Murphy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not quoting Professor Murphy at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  The wage mentioned in the paper actually was 25/- and not 24/-.  One shilling may not seem a very big lot but as a percentage it is certainly important.</P>
      <P>The main object of costings, as many Senators know, is to discover as accurately as possible the cost of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Senator again to say that what I was referring to was the wage fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board?  My quotation dealt with wages fixed at 24/-, 27/- and 30/- by the board.  They were not Professor Murphy's figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have misquoted the Senator or done him any injustice I certainly apologise.  As I stated, the main object of costings is to discover as accurately as possible the cost of production of any commodity, to reveal unprofitable operations or activities so that producers could see what steps might be taken to eliminate or reduce them, or else to change their methods of production or the incidence of cost in order that such activities might be made more profitable.  Costings usually enable waste to be traced and eliminated and economies to be effected.  On the whole the survey of the department of dairy accountancy and economics fulfilled these functions, fulfilled them very well indeed, but I am afraid most of them would not be of much interest to Senator Baxter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am referring to costings, I should like to say at the same time that <Col N="650" /> we should not overrate their importance especially in relation to some branches of agriculture.  As we know, conditions may change rapidly, and so render much of the costings matter obsolete.  Costings are really a branch of statistics and every student of economics and statistics learns very early on in his studies that statistics, which have been described as the raw materials on which the economists largely work, are on occasion of very little help to him in arriving at a conclusion applicable to problems demanding immediate solution.  For that reason, I for one, am very slow to use published statistics on every and any occasion without very careful consideration of them beforehand as to their applicability. Very often we must approach the solution of economic and social problems&mdash;for instance, the very problem we are discussing, that of raising agricultural wages&mdash;on the basis of costings for what such costings are worth, in conjunction with experience and compromise.  Senators may wonder why I have devoted so much time to this matter.  I shall explain without delay.  Senator Baxter unwittingly has directed attention to the manner in which a genuine rise in wages may become possible, namely, as a result of increased or of more profitable production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not done unwittingly at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>When I studied in the paper, with which Senator Baxter was dealing, some of the items there set down under the heading &ldquo;Items of Expenditure&rdquo; and when I noticed amongst other things that between 5 per cent. and 6 per cent. only of the land was tilled, that calf mortality was as high as is recorded in the survey, that milk yields are as low as they are, that so much is spent on concentrates, and that large farms form such a large percentage as a whole, I cannot but feel very confident and hopeful as to the future of this particular branch of agricultural industry, providing, of course, that the purpose of the costings is properly understood and that people are prepared <Col N="651" /> to follow out the lessons which are to be learned from them.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the rate of interest which should be paid on the capital involved in agriculture.  I do not wish to enter just now into any discussion as to whether agriculture should yield as high a rate of profit as, say, a manufacturing industry or commercial enterprise, but I do suggest that owing to the peculiar nature of agriculture, its permanency as an industry, the security with which so much of its capital is endowed, we cannot jump to the conclusion that its profit rates should be as high as those obtainable in other industries or activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be some hidden reserves somewhere from which the farmers may be compelled to disgorge the wherewithal to meet wage increases.  Failing that, on the other hand, it may be possible to mulct the urban community for a further levy, but in the meantime I suggest that a more complete use might be made by certain agricultural labourers of the resources already made available to them for the definite purpose of supplementing their ordinary earnings.  It is anything but a satisfaction to read of a board of health having to threaten some of the occupiers of its cottages with eviction if they do not till the land included with cottages, a half-acre or acre in many cases, for which many of them pay 2/- or a little more per week, inclusive of rates.  More profitable production on the farms, more production by labourers themselves of poultry, for instance, on which the future economic well-being of the country will largely depend, more production by the cottiers of pigs, honey and so on, are the only sources from which a real rise in wages can come.  It is from these sources and these sources only that it is possible to raise the standard of living which is what Senator Foran has in mind. For that reason, I must incline to the view expressed by the Minister that the wiser course for us would be to leave this matter to the special organisations which have been established to deal with them, namely, the Agricultural Wages Boards.  As far as I know <Col N="652" /> these boards have functioned very smoothly.  All interested parties are represented on them, and it would be very unwise on our part at this juncture to butt in by passing this motion, especially in the terms in which it has been put down.  I do hope the motion will be withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to say that I was not at all pleased with the Minister's attitude in connection with this matter.  After all, I do not see why, if a member of this House thinks something is not going right, he should not raise it here. The fact that the Agricultural Wages Boards are there and that they have not given sufficient wages to agricultural workers indicates that this is the only place we can raise that matter. Should there be a vote on this motion I do not think one Senator would vote against giving increased wages to agricultural workers.</P>
      <P>Nowadays, we hear a lot of talk to the effect&mdash;and, of course, it is a fact&mdash; that the nation is dependent on produce from the soil.  Is it not too bad, then, that the very people who produce food from the soil can never themselves think of having a square meal? I look upon it as being a very serious state of affairs that the very people to whom the production of food for every individual in the nation is entrusted, do not get half enough themselves.  Take the case of any farm labourer.  Senator Baxter suggested that some of these labourers were better off than the farmers; but take the case of an agricultural labourer with six children who is in receipt of a wage, say, of 30/- a week.  He has got to pay rent and other outgoings, but let us assume that he pays no rent, and that there are seven in his household.  It takes 27/- per week to keep two inmates in the Dublin Union.  That means that the people who are primarily responsible for producing the food of the people are not half as well off as inmates of the Dublin Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, for one, make no apology for subscribing my name to the motion, in order to try to lighten the burden of these people, and I hope the Seanad will pass the motion.  If it does no good, it will certainly do no harm.  I <Col N="653" /> am not satisfied that the Wages Board has tackled this question in a proper manner.  Senator Baxter has raised the question of farmers' costings, but the Senator should not forget that within the past ten years the farmers have obtained many concessions.  They have had their annuities halved; they have got a 50 per cent. increase in the guaranteed price of their produce; they have got grants for the improvement of their land, and a remission of agricultural rates; but the poor farm labourer has got practically nothing.  I am not one of those who say that all farmers are in a position to pay increased wages, but I do say that if the farmer is not fit to pay a fair wage, the nation should pay it, and should see that people who are stuck in the soil from Monday morning to Saturday night must be properly provided for by the people of the nation.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious question, a question that will have to be tackled sooner or later.  I know a case of a farm labourer who reared six sons, and not one of these would follow the occupation of his father.  I asked the last of them why he was not taking up his father's occupation.  He replied that he would not be such a fool, that his father had to work very hard but never saw anything for it.  I say it is no wonder that people are leaving the land and coming into the city.  In County Dublin, a farm labourer, who has won two or three prizes as a ploughman, is working for 33/- a week.  His daughter has nearly double that wage in industrial work.  I am not saying that she is getting too much, but these are the facts, and I feel that if we are to keep the people on the land, and if we are to produce the food that the nation requires, it is not going to be done by leaving the people who are directly responsible for the production of that food to work under sweated labour conditions for a miserable wage.  You cannot have prosperity in the country by allowing these people to go half-starved.</P>
    <P>At the last meeting of the Seanad the Minister for Agriculture told us, I think, that prices of agricultural produce in this country were as good as they were in England while at the <Col N="654" /> same time we were told the wage of the agricultural labourer in England was £3 per week.  I can state here to-night that the wage of an agricultural labourer in England is £3 15s.  Surely if English farmers can pay £3 15s. to their agricultural labourers, we should be able to pay at least half that figure? I, for one, should like to see the standard of living of the agricultural worker raised as it should be because I feel he is one of the most important workers within the nation.  We have heard a lot of talk in this debate about professors and the statistics given by professors.  Are we not all professors in this matter?  Surely each one of us has sufficient intelligence to know that no family can exist on 30/- a week? I think the suggestion of Senator Baxter to refer this question to professors is absolutely ridiculous because of the very fact that every Senator will admit that the farm labourer and his wife are compelled to live in a state of semi-starvation.  The farm labourer perhaps gets a suit of clothes on the day he gets married and until the day he dies he can never purchase another one.  He has to depend on clothes given to him by other people because he can never get the price of another suit together.  These are facts that will have to be faced if we are going to keep people on the land.  We expect these people to go out and work on the soil where they require more clothes, more boots and in fact more nourishment than people engaged in sheltered positions, and still we refuse to pay them half as well as people engaged in sheltered positions.</P>
    <P>I hope that the motion will be passed without a division and that Senators Baxter and Counihan will be decent enough to withdraw their amendments.  I am sorry that the Minister has left the House because I should like to know how representatives on the Agricultural Wages Board are selected.  I am afraid that they are, at least, not very good trade unionists when they agree to a wage of 30/- a week for agricultural labourers.  The Minister has stated that nobody suggested what would be a reasonable wage.  I say that a wage of anything less than 45/- a week <Col N="655" /> would be an insult to an agricultural labourer.  That is the figure I have arrived at, and I do not think any reasonable person would object to it. Even at that figure, they could not afford many luxuries, but it would be something on which they could reasonably hope to exist.  I am glad to have this opportunity of mentioning that I was in a farm labourer's house yesterday evening and I found that there was no tea, sugar, bread, or tobacco there.  These are the men we expect to turn out to till the soil and produce essential foodstuffs.  We hear all this talk about professors but these are the glaring facts.  I shall take anybody who wishes to that house to-night and he will find that I am not exaggerating.  I, for one, do not want to have any delay in this matter by waiting for any inquiry by an Agricultural Wages Board.  I feel that we should do our duty, and if the Agricultural Wages Board does not do its duty, I shall move that it be abolished.</P>

      <P>The complacency with which the opponents of this motion have dealt with it amazes me, for the reason that they seem to be blind to the fact that we are approaching a very grave crisis in this country's agricultural position.  Those of them from the Dublin area who spoke seem to forget what is happening down the country in regard to farm labourers.  It was stated here that a farm labourer with six sons would not put one of his sons to this work.  That is happening all over the country, and in one generation you may have the country again populated by beasts and a few <Col N="657" /> herds, and may have reached a condition in which the cultivation of the land will be a lost art.  No son or daughter of an agricultural labourer will remain on the land, if there is any opportunity of going away anywhere from that land.  Why?  It is not that they hate the land because I maintain that, when born and reared on the land, they must love every plant, every tree and every stone of the place in which they are born, and will cling to that homestead if there is any inducement to do so.  Travelling through parts of Kerry two years ago, I found that there were only a few young people in whole townlands.  Few went to the local churches but elderly people, and, according to the latest returns, the males of the country are in a minority, except in areas like Dublin and the areas around big cities.</P>
      <P>Anybody who takes cognisance of these facts cannot regard with complacency this great fundamental question of our national existence.  Factories are all very well in their way, but from what are the factories to draw their sustenance?  Can we ever hope to compete, even when the world comes back to sanity, with the mass-production of large factories and with the enormous firms all over Europe whose entry into the manufacturing world is comparatively recent?  Senator McGinley spoke of the Donegal peasants and of the comfort in which they live.  He told of the use they made of their homes and their cottages, and I was very glad to hear it, but I think that what is happening in Kerry is, to some extent, happening in Donegal.  I was glad to find that he took a different line from that of his colleague who abused the workers for not making proper use of the patches of land they had.  Fifty ranchers in Meath have nearly as much land under their control as the whole of the cottier tenants of Ireland, and because a few cottiers here and there allow their land to go waste, the whole mass of the cottiers are criticised and condemned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senator Buckley took the trouble of inquiring, he would probably find that the cottages to which he referred were inhabited by old age pensioners <Col N="658" /> or by old women, and he would probably find also that the plots were not being entirely neglected as would appear from a casual glance, but that there was some industry being carried on there, like the rearing of fowl, and possibly pig production.  The cottiers, too, are blamed for going out of pig production.  Cottiers are buying, and have bought, bonhams for £2 10s. and £3 and have fed them on expensive foods when they could buy such things for two or three months and have then sold them at cost price and even, I am informed, at less than cost price.  What is the inducement there?</P>
    <P>It all arises from the fact that the fundamental industry of our country has not got first claim on the community. If the money the farmers are making is not sufficient to enable them to pay the labourer a decent, living wage, then I say the community is in debt to these people who are producing food for the community.  Governments have interfered in many countries in respect of farm wages.  They have set up farm boards, and although we of the Labour Party advocated the setting up of these boards here, we are very disappointed with their working.  Whatever the reason, the working of these boards has not proved satisfactory.  In a letter which appeared in the local Press the other day, a branch secretary of the Labour organisation in a district in the south which is almost entirely agricultural, points out that the agricultural workers were at vanishing point.  &ldquo;They hoped,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for brighter days for the agricultural workers when the Agricultural Wages Board was set up, but their hopes were disappointed.&rdquo;  As the writer expressed it: the Act was like a strainer, composed of loopholes and the employers with the aid of the lawyers were able to circumvent it.  Six hours per day they worked in winter.  No employment or wages on wet days.  When they complained: &ldquo;Call in the inspector, if you are dissatisfied,&rdquo; said the employer.  The inspector was called in, but he could offer no consolation.  The agricultural workers, he said, had no remedy, as the Act clearly stated that they were to be paid only for the hours worked. <Col N="659" /> We found ourselves in the happy position of being worse paid than before the Act was passed.</P>
    <P>For some reason or other that has been the result of the Act.  Some people think it may be due to the constitution of the board.  The Minister fairly outlined its constitution, and said that in actual practice it was all that the ordinary person could expect.  The fact, at any rate, is that its operations need early attention.  The writer of this letter went on to say that the members who kept the branch of which he was secretary in being were now awaiting their passports to leave the country. That may be an extreme case, but the facts in the letter have been verified. What is described in it is occurring all over the country, and gives cause for alarm.  Still, the position is not as bad, or as doleful, as it has been represented by some speakers here.  There is still poverty in the midst of overwhelming plenty.  We know that there are cases of malnutrition to be found, especially in the rural districts.  Some of these have to be cared for at a later stage in our hospitals.  Others of them develop tuberculosis, and when sent to hospital their maintenance costs about 28/- a week.  The country seems to make nothing of that.  Hospitals are being put up which are costing thousands and thousands of pounds. But, when it comes to financing the main industry of the country, people grumble if proposals are put forward to vote a few thousand pounds to assist our farmers and farm labourers to produce the food we need.</P>
    <P>In New Zealand they deal with such matters in a different manner.  The Government there see that the farmer is placed in a position to enable him to pay his agricultural worker reasonable remuneration so that he may be able to live under Christian conditions. As things are the money system is the bane of civilised life.  In the new world that will emerge after this war, I think we will see big alterations.  Changes, I think, are bound to take place.  We will not then be sending across the world the things that we need at home&mdash;beef, bacon, cereals, etc.&mdash;in return for what may only be as valuable as the <Col N="660" /> German mark was after the last war. In my opinion the farmers should get adequate prices for the valuable commodities they are exporting to-day.</P>
    <P>Instead of cash payment returns for these commodities the Government should insist on getting the raw materials that we are so badly in need of to keep our industries going, agricultural as well as industrial.  I think some system of barter should be introduced so that instead of getting cash payments for our farm produce we should get in return coal and the thousand and one other things that our farmers and factories require.</P>
    <P>This nation holds an honoured place in the League of Nations.  When the State was set up we started off with high ideals and the best of intentions, but despite that we made very few alterations in the traditional methods that brought our agricultural industry to an impoverished state even before the outbreak of the present war.  No attempt was ever made to create a home market here.  As I said before, we have poverty in the midst of plenty, but while that is so, in the Golden Vale &mdash;in Munster&mdash;a child has to travel miles before it can get a halfpenny worth of milk.  Is it any wonder we see so many children suffering from rickets, malnutrition, and many of our people from mental and physical degeneration.  We see that going on before our eyes, and seem to have no remedy for it except to carry on in the old traditional way.  It may seem a far-fetched thing to bring the League of Nations into a debate like this, but I submit that it has a distinct bearing on the motion.  We are an honoured member of the League of Nations and one of the articles in the Treaty of Versailles, to which we are pledged by virtue of our partnership in the League of Nations, lays it down that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the duty of a State-member of the League of Nations to secure payment to its employees first of a wage adequate to maintain a reasonable standard of life as it is understood in their time and country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is universally acknowledged that the agricultural workers in this country&mdash; and by workers I mean farmers as well <Col N="661" /> as labourers because between 40 and 50 per cent. of our farmers employ no labour&mdash;are the lowest paid in the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that the figures I have given are approximately correct.  Before the Wages Board was set up farm labourers enjoyed certain perquisites.  Even though their wages were very small, in some cases almost insignificant, they were helped in great measure by these perquisites.  They have lost them since this board was set up and are now much worse off than they were before.  In the pre-board days, it was the custom, in many cases, to plough their plot of land for them, to give them manure at a cheap rate, and so on.  All that, as I have said, has ceased, and all that they receive now under the board is the minimum wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="662" /> The Wages Board has not been functioning properly.  If the labourer had 30/- all the year round it would be all right, but it is a seasonal occupation. Very few of the workers are employed all the year round.  Until the farmers are in such a position that farm work is carried on season in and season out, and the workers are in constant employment and farm work is carried on continuously as in a factory, I do not think there is very much chance for labour.</P>
    <P>In England some years ago, in advocating family allowances, somebody seriously suggested that it would be profitable and beneficial to double the farm wages.  What was happening in England then is happening in our own country now&mdash;the flight from the land. An increase for farm labourers would raise the purchasing power of the workers and enable them to invest in farm produce.  It would do something still more important&mdash;it would preserve the race sound and healthy.  There is no future for industry that I can see unless it is industry based in large measure on the raw materials and product of the land.</P>
    <P>In a statement some time ago in regard to the Wages Board, President Roosevelt stated that any industry unable to pay a reasonable wage to its employees deserved to perish.  Unless agriculture can be made pay a reasonable wage to its employees, I see no future for it.  It will mean that in one generation you may have the country a wilderness.  In this emergency, when you wish to raise the price of grain, Senator Baxter says you should set up a committee.  That would be side-tracking: it is drawing a red-berring across the track to suggest a committee.  Everybody knows that 30/- is not a living wage.</P>
    <P>Some of the men are supposed to be earning 30/- from March to October but there is no unemployment benefit for certain classes of those men for six months of the year.  Even though there may be a disabled father and mother, they may perish or seek work elsewhere.  That seems to be a terrible state of affairs, and a country based on such things simply cannot live.  President Roosevelt said <Col N="663" /> that no business which depends for its existence on paying less than a living wage has any right to continue.  There is no use in saying that there is plenty of unemployment in America.  There is, but provision is made for the unemployed. They are throwing away animals and food and throwing tea into the river Plata, while the capitalists are looking for benefits and interests.</P>
    <P>The President of the Australian Arbitration Board states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Basic wage is understood to mean the lowest wage which can be paid to an unskilled labourer on the basis of the normal needs of an average employee regarded as a human being living in a civilised community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Wages of £1 a week do not mean more than £20 or £30 a year and a man is expected to live a civilised life on that amount.  This concerns 250,000 workers, if we include dependents, apart from a population of up to 2,000,000, possibly, who derive&mdash;directly or indirectly&mdash;their living from agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Government has found money for cases of emergency, to raise the price of wheat and beet, and they could find the money in some way.  I do not want to impose any burden on the farmers, but money could be found in the way of credits that may be given.  There is £180,000,000 bulging out of our banks at present, looking for investment <Col N="664" /> abroad, and now is the time to invest it in our own country, and secure credits on the strength of the nation. Even one-twentieth part, or less, of those millions, lent to the nation at 1 per cent., which would be a working cost on such an amount, would set up agriculture.</P>
    <P>We should not wait until after the war for reconstruction.  Now is the time to deal with it.  I appeal to any bankers listening to me to-night to consider this matter.  It has been raised before in many forms.  It is a tragedy that £180,000,000 of our money should be under lock and key, waiting for 10 per cent., 15 per cent., or 20 per cent. gross interest, while lending it would cost only 1 per cent., and would help the nation.  The bankers have a great opportunity to rehabilitate themselves now in the life of the people of the country.</P>
