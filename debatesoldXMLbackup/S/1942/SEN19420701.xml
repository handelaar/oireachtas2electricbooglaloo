      <P>Is méala mór liom a fhógairt go bhfuair Cú Uladh bás obann i mBaile Atha Cliath indiu.</P>
      <P>It is with the deepest regret I have to announce to the House the death, suddenly in Dublin to-day, of Seanadóir Cú Uladh.</P>
      <P>During his period of membership of the Seanad the late Senator had impressed his fellow members with his sincerity, earnestness and close attention to the business of the House.  Of strong opinions and convictions, to which he gave forcible expression in debate, he, nevertheless, displayed to his fellow members a kindliness of disposition which made him the friend of all.  His work for the national language will be his greatest memorial and to that aspect of his public life others will pay tribute.  His death will prove a blow to the national activities in which he had taken so prominent a part over a long period of years.</P>
      <P>With the assent of the House I shall convey to the family and relatives of the deceased Senator the expression of our deep sympathy.</P>
      <P>Go ndéanaidh Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom-sa a Chathaoirligh roinnt bheag do chur leis an méid atá ráidhte agat fhéin.  Bhí aithne mhaith agam ar feadh i bfhad ar Chú Uladh. Duine de sna sean-ionndúirí do b'eadh é a chaith dúthracht agus dáiríreacht le hÉirinn agus le Gaedhilg.  Bhain sé le dream stát-sheirbhíseach sa tsean-aimsir fé réim na Sasanach&mdash;lucht Custum agus Máil &mdash;a dhein an-shaothar don teangain, nuair ná raibh tuarastal ná tairbhe dóibh féin ag baint léi.  Dhein sé féin gach cuid den obair sin&mdash;scríobhadh <Col N="1614" /> agus stocaireacht agus múinteoireacht. Bhí sé riamh daingean dásachtach ina chuid tuairimí agus ba mhinic achrann ar siúl aige.  Ach fiú amháin na ndaoine ná raibh ar aon aigne leis bhíodar sásta nár staon sé riamh ón gceart mar a tuigeadh dó féin.  Bhí tuigsint aige don ghreann agus ba dhuine lághach Gaolach ina thigh féin é.  Tá an Seanadóir Cú Uladh imithe agus tá cumha orrainn ina dhiaidh.  Thug Dia seal fada dhó agus do bhronn clann fhairsing air.  Beireann sé leis go dtí an uaigh cuid de sean-shaol ná fuil cuimhne anois air ach ag fíor-bheagán daoine.  Is boichte-dhe sinne an saol sin agus na daoine sin do bheith ag sleamhnú uainn.  Go dtuga Dia grásta síorraí dá anam.</P>

      <P>Uair o shoin agus mé ag teacht isteach san Tigh chualas an sgéal brónach mar gheall ar bhás Cú Uladh ár sean-charad. Tá brón orainn uilig go bhfuil sé imthighthe uainn ach, ar an uair chéanna, sílim gur féidir linn a rá go bhfuil bród orainn gur gheall Dia saol chó fada air.  Thosuigh Cú Uladh ar obair na Gaedhilge nuair a bhí géarghá le daoine chun tabhairt faoi'n obair sin.  Thosuigh sé ar an obair sin i gcúis na Gaedhilge nuair a bhí an náisiún i mbaol báis agus tá cuid mhaith de na daoine a thosuigh in éindigh leis imithe uainn.  Gheall Dia saol fada do Chú Uladh chun an síol do chur; thug Sé saol chó fada sin dó go bhfaca sé cuid de thoradh an tsíl sin dhá baint.  Níl aon chall dom a chuid oibre a mholadh.  Rinne an Seanadóir O hAodha é sin, mar ba cheart.  Theasbeáin Cú Uladh duinn cad ba dhúthracht agus dílseacht ann, agus sin é an ceacht d'fhág sé againn go léir; agus sin é an ceacht a chaithfeas na daoine óga a fhoghluim uaidh.  Níor fhan Gaedhil na hEireann go raibh sé ro-dheireannach chun onóir a thabhairt do Chú Uladh as ucht a dhúthrachta agus a dhílseachta i gcúis na Gaedhilge.

      <P>As the Minister for Finance, who is also the Tánaiste, is present may I ask what legislative programme he expects the Seanad to conclude before the close of the summer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="The Tánaiste Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I can answer Senator Hayes as fully as I would like or as fully as his question should be answered, in regard to the legislative programme as a whole.  My particular interest is in that programme so far as it affects the Minister for Finance, and for the moment that is all I can deal with.  I was not aware that the Senator would like me to speak with regard to the legislative programme as a whole.  If I had been notified of that, I would have been happy to find out the position and inform the Seanad accordingly.  In regard to Finance, besides the Finance Bill there is one small Bill dealing with customs, but I think the House would not find it necessary to spend a very long time upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other Bill&mdash;the Central Bank Bill&mdash;to the discussion of which I am sure the Seanad would like to give a good deal of time.  That Bill will come before the Dáil this week or early next week on Report Stage. There are many amendments down for that stage and the Bill may take a good deal of time in the Dáil still.  It is difficult to say when it will come before the Seanad&mdash;it might be after the middle of July.  The Second Reading <Col N="1616" /> might occupy some considerable time here: I have no idea how long, but, to judge by the discussion in the Dáil, it may be very considerable; so it is hard to say when the discussion of the various stages would be concluded. If the Seanad would like further information as to the legislative programme as a whole, I will ask the first Minister who comes here next to try to find out beforehand what the full legislative programme to be put before this House is likely to be and to bring to the House such information as he can get, at the earliest opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, there is not much mystery about it.  I think there is no difficulty in the case of the Appropriation Bill, which must be concluded before the Recess.  In regard to the Customs Bill, I am taking the Minister's word that it is not important, and in that case the discussion would be short. We have got a copy of the Emergency Powers Bill already; it is a renewal of the Emergency Powers Act and I presume that, in the circumstances, we must complete it also.  The real matter is the Central Bank Bill.  I do not want a decision now, but I would like to put it to the House and the Minister that it is hardly fair we should enter upon discussion of such a very important measure in the last week of July.  It would mean spending the month of August at it.  The Minister would find that the Bill would get better discussion and be passed rather more rapidly if this House were to meet in the middle of September to take it up.  By an understanding then, perhaps we could take the Committee Stage within a week of the Second Stage.  In putting that suggestion to the House and to the Minister, I may say that the Central Bank Bill is the most important thing we have to deal <Col N="1617" /> with.  The question whether we have to deal with it now or after the recess is the important one.  I suggest that we should do it in September and give the Minister such facilities as we possibly can at that particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support that suggestion.  At this time of the year we have always had a certain amount of difficulty.  It is not purely a matter of our own consideration, but from the staff point of view, it is desirable that there should be an interval of four or five weeks.  I feel that Senator Hayes' suggestion would be a good one, provided, of course, that some other Minister does not come to the House with some other Bill for which we would have to sit in August. I am quite sure that, if we take the Central Bank Bill at the end of this month, we could not expect to have it finished, with the requisite time between the different stages, before early in September.  That would not be desirable from anyone's point of view.  If it were agreed that the Bill were to be taken about the 15th September, in view of the fact that there was ample notice, it might be possible to have an agreement by which the Committee Stage would be taken a week after the Second Stage, though such an arrangement would be undesirable if the Bill were being taken now.</P>

      <P>It is in the interests of all concerned that the Central Bank Bill be taken after the holidays in September.  If it is taken now, as soon as it is ready, I feel that, in view of the approach of the holiday period, it will not receive the consideration an important measure of the kind would merit.  I cannot help feeling that it would be in the interest of all, especially in the interests of the Government, that it should be taken in September.</P>

      <P>I have always found this House, if I may say so with respect, reasonable.  Senators have always been kind to me, and have facilitated me in every way.  I am anxious personally to get this Bill off my shoulders, so to speak, as early as possible.  I certainly would <Col N="1618" /> like, if I saw a possibility of getting finished at the end of July, to get it finished, but I am not so sure that that is likely to happen, in view of the length of time it may take in the Dáil, and the possibility of its taking a certain time here, even on the Second Reading Stage.  I would be very happy to fall in with the wishes of the House.  I know that my own staff have been occupied with this Bill for a long time.  They are very keen in asking me to get it pushed through as early as possible.  Of course, whatever representations are made to me in the House, from any side of it, will certainly receive my most sympathetic consideration.  If you, Sir, and Senators would not mind leaving it over for a few days for consideration, I would be very happy to see what could be done to facilitate matters.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1942 (Certified Money Bill)&mdash;Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I find a certain amount of difficulty in understanding how wide or how narrow Section 3 is intended to be.  The first sentence says that it relates only to commodities not produced commercially in the State in the 12 months ended 31st August, 1939.  If that were taken just by itself, it would seem to me that the section was not going to prove nearly as helpful as it is possibly intended to be.  It is quite possible that this section may be interpreted rather more widely, because, after all, it is mainly a section to give discretion to the Revenue Commissioners under certain circumstances. But, there is a certain amount of uneasiness&mdash;it has been expressed to me&mdash; that if it is not understood that it will be interpreted reasonably and with some breadth, it may prove a discouragement to certain manufacturers.  It is quite clear that where a particular commodity was not manufactured before that date because it was not considered to be an economic proposition, and is <Col N="1619" /> now manufactured, because of scarcity, on an uneconomic basis, this section gives full discretion to allow any cost to be chargeable on assessment of income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not quite so clear, and possibly the Minister could help me in the matter, that where the commodity was manufactured or was available, but where the emergency or the war circumstances have forced it to be manufactured in a totally different way and by different means unlikely to be continued afterwards, the relief desired will be given.  What I have in mind is this: you may have a certain commodity manufactured here and finished with a certain raw material.  Machinery is available for the use of that raw material, but the raw material is now unobtainable, and alternative materials may be used, but they necessitate new machinery.  The alternative proves not to be as good and the new machinery may become completely useless after the emergency.  It seems to me that the cost of that machinery, in so far as it becomes useless afterwards, should be a charge over the period as depreciation, because it is in the public interest that the commodity should continue to be made, and we do not want to discourage anyone.  You have another very simple illustration of the same thing in the case of a firm using motor deliveries.  If it becomes undesirable, or impossible, to use petrol for the purpose of those deliveries, and if firms for the period of the emergency introduce horses and vans, the public will have to put up with the slower transport and certain inconveniences. Firms will be rather unwilling to do that if they find that the expenditure will be regarded as capital expenditure and could not be written off as soon as the vans become useless.  That is a simple type of illustration.  I have been asked by the Chamber of Commerce to raise this point, and to ask how far this section will be interpreted narrowly.  One letter I had from a representative of the Chamber of Commerce mentioned a case where, in order to continue a particular type of manufacture, the manufacturer <Col N="1620" /> had to adopt a Heath Robinson type of machine, as he called it, which he would certainly abolish as soon as he could, although it is getting the job done.</P>
    <P>On strict reading, I am not at all sure the section would meet his case, and if he did instal machinery of that kind it might happen to be regarded as capital expenditure.  I think the Minister could help me with regard to that.  There is also the case where a commodity was made before 1939 from raw materials and where the manufacturer has now to make the raw material.  In that case I gave it as my opinion that the section would cover it, although in the previous case I was not at all sure it would.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure Senator Douglas and any other members of the Seanad who are interested, that the intention is that this section should be interpreted widely, and the Revenue Commissioners given full discretion to use their commonsense in the matter.  There is one example that occurs to me as to how the word &ldquo;commodity&rdquo; might be interpreted. Paper was manufactured here before 1939 from wood pulp.  That paper manufactured from wood pulp if still so manufactured would not be interpreted as a commodity here, but if manufactured from any other materials, straw, for instance, it would be regarded as a commodity within the meaning of the sub-section, and would get the benefits that are set out in the section.  With regard to capital expenditure on machinery rendered necessary as a result of the emergency, it is intended that the section be interpreted widely and generously, too.  As regards transport, it would be very wise for everybody concerned to submit these cases to the Revenue Commissioners, who will use their discretion. So far as the Minister for Finance is concerned, his desire would be to help people who are trying to help the country with supplies over the difficult period of the emergency.  This section will be interpreted in that way.  If we find that the law is so drawn that specific cases brought before the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1621" /> cannot be included in a generous interpretation of the section, I am quite prepared to come to the House again to ask for further powers to interpret the section more widely, so as to include any industrialists who have put up machinery or employed new capital or something that necessitates the expenditure of capital to help the people with commodities not available otherwise than by expenditure for special purposes during the emergency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much obliged to the Minister.  I hope that his suggestion that a case might be put beforehand will get some publicity. It is most important that people should not be discouraged from taking some financial risks at the present time which might add to the total supplies available to the country.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to say with regard to this section that it removes a particular flaw in the operation of the excess profits tax which I criticised last year.  It seemed to me, that as it was framed last year, there was a possibility that a company might be obliged to pay excess profits tax in one year even though actually the company might have lost over a longer period and might not properly be liable to the excess profits tax at all. My reading of the section is that it completely removes that flaw.  Possibly, I have referred to the wrong section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say, on behalf of both traders and manufacturers, that this is a very satisfactory provision.  It seems that not only is it a matter of simple justice but it means, in effect, that where a firm had a good year last year&mdash;it was a good year in a number of cases&mdash;the excess so made will be allowed to remain as a security or reserve, should there be a loss at a later period, to cover such loss.  That means that a <Col N="1622" /> company can go ahead, taking a certain amount of risk with some confidence, even risking a loss which it could not possibly face if the money had been paid over to the Revenue Commissioners and was irrecoverable. It seems to me only right that there should be an excess profits tax during an emergency of this kind.  Provided that it is not paid on what is not actually an excess profit, I am altogether in favour of this tax.  I just want to make it clear that this provision represents an enormous improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether a point to which I desire to refer is appropriate to this section. It is a fact that we have an agreement with the British with regard to double taxation, that is, taxation here and in England.  In England, at the moment there is an excess profits tax of 100 per cent. and there are firms which operate both in England and in this State.  I understand that the British Government, in considering an assessment for excess profits tax, will take into consideration&mdash;I do not pretend to be an expert on this and I may be wrong in the details&mdash;corporation profits tax paid here.  I understand, on the other hand, that where the British Government demands a tax of 100 per cent. the Revenue Commissioners here, in deciding what taxation they are going to impose on a firm operating here and in England, will consider the profit made by that firm but which is not enjoyed by it as the excess profit has been taken from it by the British Government and will impose taxation on that profit.  The effect of that would be that any firm which increases its business&mdash;I am speaking of a firm, of course, operating in the two areas of jurisdiction&mdash;thereby making some additional profit will, in fact, by reason of that fact have losses imposed upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two firms which I happen to know which operate in England and which it is desirable should also operate in this country.  It seems to me that their aim must be rather to avoid any extension of their business over here or in England to keep the total profit down because the <Col N="1623" /> excess profits they make will be taken by the British Government less a deduction for taxation here.  I understand that the Revenue Commissioners do not take into account in the same way the imposition of the 100 per cent. excess profits tax in England.  The result is that if a company which before the war was making £5,000 should make £7,000 during this year, that £2,000 excess will be taken by the British Government but the Government here may say: &ldquo;They made that £7,000 here.  We are going to demand taxation upon that sum which has been taken from you by the British Government.&rdquo; I am not sure that I have got my details correctly, but I remember examining a case some months ago and I was quite satisfied from my examination that it would be necessary for such a firm to avoid doing extra business because any additional profits they made would only result in their being involved in loss.  I should like the Minister to let the House know whether that is the case and, if so, he regards it as equitable or desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Senator is correct in his assumptions in this matter.  The taxes paid by an Irish company trading in England are allowed here.  If excess profits tax has to be paid in England, there is an allowance made for it when they come to reckon what they have to pay here.  <i>Vice versa</i>, in the case of a British company operating here, any excess profits tax they have to pay here is taken into account in Britain.  It does not mean that they are any worse off than their neighbours.  If they make extra profits and they have to pay extra tax here, that is taken into account on the other side.  Similarly, we take into account any taxes they pay to the British Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say that because as I remember the position it did not appear to be so.  The Minister has now stated that our Revenue Commissioners in deciding what sum a firm operating in this country has to pay will, before they approach that, take from the sum they <Col N="1624" /> are going to consider, the amount of taxation that has been imposed by the British Government?  That is clear?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>So that it is not possible that any firm operating in the two countries by reason of the operation of the excess profits tax will, as a result of making extra profit, involve itself in a loss?  Can the Minister assure me that the arrangements are such that no firm could lose by making an extra profit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be going very far.  I could not say that any firm was not going to lose.  All I can say is that we allow here what is paid on the other side, in the case of firms who are obliged to pay tax here. There is no reciprocal arrangement, but that is the common practice.</P>

      <P>I referred last week to just one matter&mdash;that people by getting married, with comparatively <Col N="1625" /> small incomes enjoyed by the two parties, because they get married have additional taxation imposed upon them.  Personally, I believe that to be undesirable.  My recollection is that the Minister pointed out that immediately on the birth of a child the married couple would receive an exemption with regard to £60.  I do not think that is a true statement of the case.  I think the Minister himself is misinformed.  If people get married, say on the 31st March, they are then treated as enjoying the marriage remission for the financial year ending on the 31st March.  If a child is born, say on 5th May of any year do the parents enjoy the remission with regard to that child for that financial year?  I would like to know does the Minister wish to change what he said, that immediately on the birth of the first child the married couple would enjoy that remission.  There are probably thousands of people who have to pay as though they had no child for a period when in fact they have imposed upon them the cost of a child.</P>
      <P>If that is so, the general financial legislation in this country should be so amended as to rectify that position. The whole history of the development of the Finance Acts is something like the history of the policeman and the burglar, the Government wishes to impose taxation on the people equitably, and the clever lawyers or even the non-lawyers get together to see how, within the law, they will be able to escape the imposition that the Government desires to place upon them.  The Government seeks to close the loophole.  If you are going to try to get justice you cannot do it by merely adverting to the needs or the rights of one party, when two parties are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied myself that there are hundreds of cases where the taxation laws work out inequitably and it is almost inevitable that it should be so, because the drafting of the taxation laws has not had in mind so much general justice to the Government, to the common good and to individuals. It has one thing in mind, namely, that any possible loophole should be closed so that nobody can possibly escape <Col N="1626" /> from paying taxes that they should pay. That is quite right, but at the same time if the Government is to be guided by justice, it must also have in mind that taxation will be so imposed that nobody will be called upon to pay tax which, strictly speaking, in equity they should not be called upon to pay.  I think the whole tax code should be examined, not merely from the point of view of the policeman and the burglar but also to see that the law should be such that people should not be unfairly treated.  I gave just one instance last week where, by getting married, with a comparatively small sum, the joint income can be reduced by taxation by £50 a year.  The Minister gave another case in which the income could be reduced by only £11.  But I could run along a whole scale showing that it is financially undesirable in many cases that people should get married.</P>
    <P>I queried the Minister's statement that immediately the first child is born the parents get exemption.  I looked it up, and I saw that it depended on the date that the child was born, because by getting married on 31st March one is exempt for the whole of the previous year, whereas if a child is born some time after that the parent is not only not exempt for the previous year, but is treated as if there was no child at all for the previous year.  If that is so, there is a case for alteration of the law. It is quite right that the law should say that so far as the policeman and the burglar is concerned the burglar should go to jail, but the analogy is not quite exactly that.  Every one of us is bound to pay tax.  The taxation laws are drafted on the assumption, and it is a fairly sound assumption, that everybody is going to try to dodge paying taxes if they can.  That is quite all right, but the Government in doing that is bound in justice surely to see that their drafting will not be such as to impose inequitable taxation on some people by a flaw in draftsmanship.  Am I right in thinking that the Minister was not right when he said that immediately on the birth of a child the exemption was enjoyed?</P>

      <P>I had in mind shortly after, but I think it is not as shortly as I thought.  The Senator is probably right when he said for the greater part of that year or at least for the first half of it the couple might not get the benefit of the allowance for the child.  There is that much right in what the Senator said.  Maybe for the greater part of that year the allowance would not come to the benefit of the income-tax payer.  The principle the Senator speaks in favour of &mdash;of separating the wife's income from that of the husband&mdash;is one that would have to be very carefully examined as to its repercussions not alone on the Exchequer but on married people as a whole.  The natural thing is that couples will be married and that the husband will be the earner, and that his will be the income that will keep the family going; and it is on that basis that the income-tax laws are arranged.  If we go on another basis, and separate them, and arrange for a new principle&mdash;that the wife's income will be always separately assessed&mdash;it would probably hit the married couples, and therefore you would be hitting the majority of the taxpayers of the country.  I have not had time to have the matter thoroughly examined.  The point which Senator Fitzgerald has raised is an interesting one.  It probably has been examined already at other times and in other places, but I have not had time to examine it thoroughly yet.  It is certainly true that, if we were to adopt in principle what Senator Fitzgerald suggests, married couples as a whole would not benefit.</P>

      <P>The Minister will pardon me; he has assumed that the <Col N="1628" /> condition which I pointed out can only be met in one way, namely by treating the two incomes as distinct.  That is not the only possible way of meeting it.  It can be met by treating them as one, if you like, but arranging the incidence of taxation in such a way that people will not actually be detrimentally affected financially by getting married as distinct from not getting married. It is a wrong conclusion that that can only be met by drafting the whole income-tax code on the assumption that the two incomes are distinct.  Of course, I am not asking the Minister to go into the whole matter now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my proposal. At the present moment, a single person has £120 free of income-tax. Therefore, two people have £120 each, or £240 in all, free of income tax. If they get married they have only £220 free of income tax.  As I said, if each one of them has £100 on top of that, they have each their £100 at the half income-tax rate.  They will have, as unmarried people, £240 free of income-tax, and then the two of them together will pay half income-tax on £200.  If they get married, the two of <Col N="1629" /> them will have £220 free of income-tax instead of £240, and they will then have only £100 at the half income-tax rate.  That would bring them up to £320 and they will then have, I think, £80&mdash;I am making this calculation rather hurriedly&mdash;on which they will pay the full income-tax.</P>
      <P>The arrangement as to how much you are going to have free as a single person, or on how much you are going to pay half income-tax, and at what point you will pay the whole income-tax, could easily be re-adjusted so that the benefit would be in favour of those who get married rather than of those who avoid marriage.  That will not mean that everybody will have the option of deciding whether they will have the incomes treated as one or two.  It could be arranged quite simply on half a sheet of paper.</P>

      <P>I think £20 tax free is not going to weigh so heavily in the balance; no matter how charming the girl may be, you will think a little more of the matter.  Any Minister for Finance would have to have this matter examined from the revenue point of view, and it is not quite so simple.  I do not think anything relating to income-tax is very simple, from my own experience.  Anybody who had the interest and the time to read the different sections of the Finance Bill, and the amendments which were introduced this year, will realise that income-tax is anything but a simple matter.  I can imagine something of the type of Section 4 or Sections 16 and 17 taking a lot of time. I can imagine, as Senator Douglas told us last year, people putting their towels around their heads, not alone to try to understand them, but to write them.  A good deal of that would be required, I think, to put anything like what the Senator has in mind into <Col N="1630" /> operation.  Naturally, no Minister for Finance, and less still, probably, his staff, would like to be urged to introduce modifications or amendments of that kind.  Looking at the matter purely from a social point of view, if the saving of tax on £20 a year would encourage people to get married, I should like to be able to do that.  I should like to help young people, if that would be a help to them, to decide on the matrimonial state rather than to stay single or to live as the Senator suggested the last time we were here that they might live, if they feared the income-tax burden becoming so much heavier.  At any rate, it would require time for study.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Principal Act was going through the Dáil in 1927, I was a member of that House and, on the Committee Stage, I moved an amendment that the Electricity Supply Board, about to be set up, should have power to adopt Part IV of the Local Government Act&mdash;that is to say, that it should have power to introduce a pension scheme.  It was understood that the scheme they would introduce would be on the basis of the scheme included in the Local Government Act of 1925.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time pointed out that the whole scheme was in the nature of a great experiment and that he thought it desirable that a pension scheme should not be introduced until at least the first five-year period would have elapsed and we could see how the whole scheme had worked out.  Neither he nor any other speaker in the debate suggested that, when a pension scheme was introduced, it should be less favourable than the scheme provided in the Local Government Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fifteen years later, we have provision being made for pensions for the board and members of the staff.  The only scheme detailed in the Bill&mdash;the pension scheme for the board&mdash;is much less favourable, in my opinion, to the recipients than that embodied in the Local Government Act.  The custom in the public service is that pensions should be equal to two-thirds of the salary at the end of the full term of service.  If the pension itself is not actually two-thirds of the salary, it is usual in the Civil Service to make it equal half the salary, with a lump sum, both being equivalent in value to two-thirds. In this case, the maximum pension provided for the members of the board is not two-thirds or even half the salary.  The maximum is 20 forty-eighths of such salary.  These two amendments, taken together, provide that the pension for the members of the board who qualify for the full amount should be equivalent to two-thirds <Col N="1632" /> of their salary&mdash;that is to say, that their pension should be half their salary and a lump sum, based on their years of service, the same as civil servants get. I have read as carefully as I could the debates in the Dáil on this question. The case made by the Minister did not convince me that he was justified in fixing for the members of the board a pension rate which, in my opinion, is lower than that paid to officials in the public service or in the service of the local authorities.  In the course of the debate in the other House, on Second Reading, the Minister referred to the qualifications which the men to be appointed to the board are to possess.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will, I think, be generally appreciated that the magnitude of the undertaking which the board is called upon to administer and its importance to the nation demand that its personnel should possess the highest administrative capacity.  The necessary qualities and the necessary experience can only be found in men who have demonstrated their ability in other callings and, consequently, it is inevitable, in the order of things, that the Government choice, in making a new appointment to the board, must be limited to persons who are fairly advanced in years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He pointed out that one way of improving the position of men appointed to public offices at an advanced age is to add years.  In this case, the difficulty was met by making the fraction forty-eighths instead of eightieths or sixtieths as the case may be.  While that did meet the position to some extent, it did not meet it sufficiently, and I can see no good reason why the pension should not be, at least, equal to half the salary at the end of the man's term of office.  In the course of his remarks in the Dáil, the Minister said he was equating this pension scheme to that of the Civil Service but, except in so far as this provision for men who joined at an advanced age is concerned, I cannot see where the equation lies.  I think that there is a strong case for having the maximum pension equal to half the salary and <Col N="1633" /> the second amendment should be accepted whereby the usual lump sum would be given at the end of the members' term of service.  Circumstances might arise&mdash;something like that was foreshadowed in the Miniister's statement in the Dáil&mdash;which would necessitate a reorganisation of the board.  In that case, it may be necessary to dispense with the services of some of those people who are at present on the board and I think they should be treated generously.</P>
    <P>The difference between what is asked for in these amendments and what is in the Bill is insignificant in a concern which runs into £10,000,000 or £15,000,000 and has an income of £2,000,000 a year.  After all, if we are to get satisfactory service from these people&mdash;we have placed a very heavy responsibility on their shoulders&mdash;it is essential that they should feel that they are being treated fairly in comparison with members of other public services.  They should have no sense of grievance in the matter of pension provisions.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment, because I consider that it will be in the interests of the undertaking as a whole if it is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass (Minister for Industry and Commerce) Mr. Lemass (Minister for Industry and Commerce)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass (Minister for Industry and Commerce)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Connell that members of the Electricity Supply Board should be treated fairly, and even generously.  I submit, however, that we are treating them fairly and even generously in the proposals in this Bill.  I do not know by what criterion Senator O'Connell thinks we should measure our generosity. I think it is not unreasonable to propose that we should measure it by the provision made for members of the public service, and particularly those members of the service who have got professional or technical qualifications somewhat similar to those possessed by members of the Electricity Supply Board and in consequence of which they are recruited under somewhat similar circumstances, by which I mean that they are recruited only after they have established their capacities in some occupation outside the service and come into the service comparatively <Col N="1634" /> late in life.  In so far as the proposals contained in this Bill for members of the Electricity Supply Board can be compared with established practice in the provision of superannuation allowances for members of the public service, the Electricity Supply Board members are being treated generously.</P>
      <P>They are being treated, in fact, substantially better than the members of the public services.  To the extent that it is possible to measure the improvement of their treatment, I would say that it is about 25 per cent. better than the treatment given to members of the Civil Service.  A member of the Civil Service has to serve for 40 years before he becomes entitled to the maximum pension.  He cannot retire at the end of 20 years' service on anything like the same proportion of his retiring salary as will be available to members of the Electricity Supply Board.  Members of the Electricity Supply Board will be entitled to retire on pension after ten years' service.  The ordinary civil servant cannot get in the circumstances contemplated here, the gratuity payable upon death in the service proposed for members of the Electricity Supply Board until he has served for at least 20 years.  In almost every respect in which it is possible to institute comparisons between the proposals of this Bill and the established practice of the Civil Service, the members of the Electricity Supply Board will be treated better than members of the Civil Service.  I think we must, in deciding what course of action to follow in a matter of this kind, bear in mind the possible reactions of undue generosity on our part.  It is almost certain that, whatever standard is established for members of the Electricity Supply Board, it will be quoted when persons occupying analogous positions in other organisations make a case, as they will, no doubt, eventually make a case, for similar pension provisions on retirement, and even quoted by members of the Civil Service who are not infrequently in agitation for the improvement of their conditions of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I agree that we should not be ungenerous in our dealings with the <Col N="1635" /> members of the Electricity Supply Board, but we must limit our instincts towards generosity by having due regard to the possible consequences of it.  I think we are not ungenerous.  I could not propose to accept the amendments that would improve the position to the extent suggested by Senator O'Connell.  I think the main provisions of the Bill, a pension of 20/48ths after 20 years' service, the possibility of retirement aften ten years' service if the member is over 60 or in ill health, and the provision for payment of a year's salary in respect of any member of the board who dies while in the service of the board are, taking all in all, sufficient provision to make for the members of the body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>One point struck me about Senator O'Connell's first amendment&mdash;I am not referring to the second one.  I think the Minister stresses too much the analogy between membership of the board and the position in the Civil Service.  Those who go into the Civil Service usually join it at the beginning of their career, and it is well known that the superannuation provisions are defective with regard to professional people joining the service when they are over 30 or 40 years of age.  On the Minister's own showing, he is absolutely right.  It will not be possible to recruit members of the board themselves unless they are people who have already made their names.  I wonder if he has thought of this particular contingency?  He allows 20/48ths yearly salary and contemplates a maximum service of 20 years.  Is it not true that very few members of the board will have more than 20 years' service, particularly in the future?  Senator O'Connell's first amendment contemplates that a maximum of 24 years' service could be granted&mdash;1/48th of the salary for 24 years' service.  Therefore, no person would get that amount except a person who became a member of the board at the age of 36.  I think the Minister will agree that that would be rather an unusual case in the future.  There has at least been one case in the past, but, in the future, the normal entrant will be over 36.  If <Col N="1636" /> you do appoint a member at the age of 36, and he remains in good health until he is 60, that would be rather an unusual case, and it would seem that the amount of money involved out of the resources of the board is very small indeed.</P>
      <P>As I understand Senator O'Connell's first proposal, it merely means that in the case of a person who goes in at the age of 36 or at less than 36, he will get what the Minister provides for every year of his service up to 24.  That would seem to me to be a very small amount.  The Minister is quite right, I think, in saying that usually&mdash;I am not speaking of the present members of the board&mdash;a Minister for Industry and Commerce looking around for members will not appoint people under 35 years of age.  The average would be over 40. If there is a particular person in the service of the board for 24 years because he had exceptional ability at the age of 36 when he was appointed.  I do not think it would be too much to give him 24 years' service, and the truth is &mdash;I think the Minister recognises it&mdash; that the analogy with the Civil Service is not complete.  Most of those going into the Civil Service or, at least, the great bulk of them, go in at the age of 18.  The administrative class, the first division, go in at about the age of 23, and the Civil Service is defective to that extent and is prevented from getting good recruits by the fact that entering the Civil Service at a late age is not a very sound proposition for professional men.  Therefore, what is involved in the first amendment would appear to me to be very, very small. and the additional zest that a person would get from knowing that he was going to get the full period of 24 years would fully repay the small cost involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might reply to Senator Hayes, I feel that a discussion of this kind is not going to be very satisfactory because nobody can produce decisive arguments.  It is a matter of opinion as to what constitutes generous treatment in all the circumstances relating to the appointment of members of the Electricity Supply Board, and what does not.  The <Col N="1637" /> absolutely certain thing we must keep in mind is that while it is undoubtedly correct that a great many of the staffs of Government Departments enter the service at an early age and intend to remain all their lives in Government Departments, retiring on pension at the end of their service, there are in the public service persons with qualifications analogous to those possessed by members of the Electricity Supply Board and appointed under similar circumstances.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the House will agree that some of them have technical qualifications as high as any possessed by members of the Electricity Supply Board.  They also enter the public service fairly late in life, after their reputations have been established by the work done by them in outside offices. They enter the Civil Service on scales of salary lower than those available to members of the Electricity Supply Board.  It is true they may have greater security in office.  I should like to stress that their scales of salary are calculated in relation to the fact that there is a pension provision for them. As everyone knows, the salaries of members of the Electricity Supply Board were fixed before there was any proposal to provide pensions for them on retirement, and it is not now intended that those salaries should be revised in the light of the fact that this Bill proposes to make pension provisions for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, we are proposing that the dependents of a member of the Electricity Supply Board will be entitled to a lump sum payment on the death of the member in the service. That provision is not enjoyed by members of the Civil Service, who are on the 1 in 60 basis of pension.  The 1 in 60 basis in the Civil Service corresponds to the 1 in 48 in the Electricity Supply Board except that the Electricity Supply Board basis is 25 per cent. better.  In certain classes they are on the 1 in 80 basis and after 40 years' service they get half of the retiring salary in pension.  They get a lump sum in addition on retirement. Those on the 1 in 60 basis get neither. It is with persons on that basis that comparison should be made in assessing the merits of the provisions of this <Col N="1638" /> Bill.  The provisions made in the Bill for members of the Electricity Supply Board are, in fact, 25 per cent. better than those made for public servants on the 1 in 60 basis.  In addition, it is proposed that members of the Electricity Supply Board will enjoy the benefit of this insurance for their dependents, in that a lump sum equal to a year's salary will be paid to the dependents on the death, in service, of the member.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I can say much more than that.  I can hold out no hope that the Government is prepared to accept an amendment to this Bill. The provisions of the Bill relating to pensions for the board naturally had to be discussed with other Government Departments interested in the conditions of the public service and the possible reactions of any proposals in relation to the Electricity Supply Board on the conditions in the public service, and it would not be possible now to effect amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister speaks of generosity.  I am not saying that there is anything in this amendment which could be described as generosity. I am still not convinced by the Minister's statement that this scheme is 25 per cent. better than that available to civil servants.  His arguments were not very convincing.  He stresses the fact that he must keep in mind analogous positions in other services. It is hard to conceive any other undertaking of the extent and nature of the Electricity Supply Board, with such a comparatively small number of people responsible for its maintenance and administration.  It should not be difficult to give them pensions which would compare favourably with those given to other public servants.  I still maintain that giving them a pension of less than half their salary, without any payment of a lump sum, does not compare in any favourable way with what is paid to other public servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister cannot see his way to accept at least the first amendment, where he is asked for an increase from 20/48ths to 24/48ths.  As has been pointed out by Senator Hayes, the difference in actual money <Col N="1639" /> would not be large.  I do not think it would mean 6d. per year to the biggest consumer of electricity.  If the members of the board feel, as I believe they do, that they are not being treated on the same basis as the public services, it is a pity the Minister could not see his way to accept at least that first amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister's arguments, but I have great sympathy with him, as he is in the grip of the Department of Finance, which has to deal with this kind of thing.  What is really wrong about it all is that everything must be considered from the point of view of the Establishment Branch of the Department of Finance, which was framed originally to deal with clerks.  I think that the Minister himself has plenty of experience of that.  I do not expect him to agree with me, but, having been Minister for the past ten years, he must have been confronted with this difficulty.  The Establishment Branch has not been either generous or just with anybody but the barristers, who have beaten them to a frazzle.  The Department has to pay barristers.  I am not saying that the Minister is ungenerous. I do not want to be ungenerous, but the truth is that the Electricity Supply Board, like many another undertaking, is quite outside the ordinary run of Civil Service work.  It is one of the multitude of things introduced in the last 30 years, particularly since the last war and with increasing speed since the present war began.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no real analogy with the Civil Service in this case.  The attempt to make an analogy falls down.  If a man were appointed to the Electricity Supply Board at the age of 36, the difference to the board in giving him 24/48ths instead of 20/48ths would be negligible, and the number of cases where it would occur would be very small.  If it is right, it ought to be done.  The late professional entrants into the Civil Service are, in fact, very badly treated.  That is the truth; I saw it myself for ten years, as Chairman of the Civil Service Commissioners. <Col N="1640" /> There were advertisements saying that &ldquo;the following scales of salary are sanctioned by the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  You never could persuade the Minister for Finance to give anything to anybody who was not a clerk, except a very small sum.  That is what is wrong with the Civil Service and with the whole outlook on payment by the Department of Finance.  If there were any case they could make, I could understand it, but there are no analogous cases at all.</P>
    <P>The first amendment by Senator O'Connell involves such a very small sum and deals with such a very special set of cases, both now and in the future, that it might very well be accepted.  The whole analogy with the Civil Service, and with professional entrants into the Civil Service, is wrong and does not really lie at all.  I know the kind of case that is made. The Civil Service is not able to adapt itself to this idea of taking in people with special qualifications at a late age &mdash;say 35 or 40.  It has not done it in a manner satisfactory either to itself or to the entrants.  The fact that the Civil Service has not done that satisfactorily should not be allowed to prevent the Minister for Industry and Commerce, now or in the future, from getting the best type of people for the Electricity Supply Board.  The amount involved would be very small and the principle on which the Minister refuses is really not a principle or analogy at all.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sub-section, as it reads, would appear to be one of general application, but in actual fact it affects one person and, as far as I can see, never can affect anybody else.  If there is one person who should get special consideration in connection with the supply of electricity in this country, it is the person who is affected by this particular sub-section.  If we have electricity supplied on a wide scale, a network of supply all over the country <Col N="1641" /> to-day, it is almost entirely due to the vision, the foresight and the pertinacity of the particular individual who is affected by this sub-section. This man was appointed one of the first members of the board.  He was the originator of the Shannon electricity scheme.  He was appointed as a member of the board and, after serving in that capacity for almost four years, he was dropped by the former Government. Personally, I could never quite understand what the actual difference between the Government and himself was.  It was a matter of policy, I believe.  Whatever it was, it could not be due to any defects in the man himself for after some 13 or 14 months, when the present Government came into office, he was reappointed and is still a member of the board.</P>
    <P>In 1931 when his services were being dispensed with, the Minister at the time, now Deputy McGilligan, explained to the Dáil why what the Minister now calls a gratuity, but which in my humble opinion is not correctly styled a gratuity, was paid.  I have an extract from Deputy McGilligan's speech here in recommending that this sum should be paid to this person at the time.  The reference is column 1647, Volume 39.  Deputy McGilligan then stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;By reason of the fact that he was the author of the scheme and by reason of the very great industry he showed in it, and the tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm he put into its promotion, and the great amount of hard work he put into its development since its inception, I ask that we do now what an ordinary business firm would do.  He has followed a policy which I put to the House was wrong but it was a policy which was honestly taken up.  An ordinary commercial undertaking would allow a man in such a position who left their employment at least a year in which to look round for other work and would finance him accordingly, and we want in this case to pay a sum of money which would be equal to a year's pay if he had remained on in the services of the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> That sum was paid.  Now, the only explanation as far as I can gather, for the insertion of this particular sub-section is that this sum that was paid was in the nature of a gratuity as we understand gratuities under the Superannuation Acts, that it was in fact something in the way of a pension for the services he had rendered.  I maintain that that is not so at all, that it was really compensation for loss of position.  He had a warrant or guarantee of appointment for five years. For some reason which seemed good to the Government at the time, his services were dispensed with after about three and a half years or some such period.  As the Minister at the time stated, the Government did what any practical business firm would do. They assumed that it would take something like a year or two for him to look around to get anything like a similar appointment and they gave him what amounted to a year's salary. Because of that, this sub-section appears here, a sub-section which in calculating his pension would deprive him of almost four years which he gave to the service of the board.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister, taking all the circumstances into account, taking into account especially the person concerned, the only person concerned, that it would be what I might almost call shabby on the part of the Oireachtas to include this sub-section in the measure and deprive this man to whom we owe the Shannon scheme of whatever benefit it might be to him.  It might not affect him at all.  He may have ultimately the 20 years' service which the Bill specifies as the period for a full pension.  He may have that without counting those four years, but we do not know what may happen in future.  For some reason or other, something may crop up between the Government and this individual as it did before, which would necessitate the termination of his services.  In that case he would not have the full 20 years to qualify for a full pension.  On the other hand, he may fall into ill health and he would not be in a position, if he had to retire on that account, to reckon these three and a half or four years in order to get a <Col N="1643" /> pension.  That would mean that he would be forced to accept a considerably reduced pension.  I certainly would press the Minister as strongly as I can, and I hope the Seanad will agree with me, that this sub-section should be dropped.  I do not think it is necessary because, as I see it, no case could crop up again of a similar nature.  If something like that happens again, there is provision made to meet it in the Bill.  I ask the Minister very earnestly&mdash;I think it is only right and fair and there is no question of generosity involved in this case&mdash;that he should agree to accept this amendment and drop this sub-section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator O'Connell that this sub-section can relate to only one person.  It provides that where a person becomes entitled to a pension under this Bill, he will not be entitled to reckon for the purposes of such pension any period of service as a member of the board in respect of which he has received a gratuity.  The proposal, therefore, is that, neither now nor in the future, will the board be entitled to pay a pension for a period of service in respect of which a gratuity has already been paid. Senator O'Connell says that this sub-section relates and can only relate to one particular person.  That individual, now a member of the board, was removed from office as a member of the board, after some years of service.  On his removal he received by way of special provision a sum of £2,000.  My opinion of the suitability of that person for membership of the board was expressed by the fact that on coming into office I recommended his re-appointment to the board.  If I had not been prepared to do that this question would not have arisen now.  Senator O'Connell says that the payment made to him in 1931 on his removal from office was not a gratuity.  If so, the section does not apply to it.  If that case can be sustained, then there is certainly no point in amending the Bill because all the Bill does is to advert to the payment of pensions in respect of any period of service for which a gratuity has been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel certain that nobody in this <Col N="1644" /> House will seriously contend that, where a member of the board has on retirement received a gratuity in repect of a period of service, he should be entitled at some later stage to come forward after reappointment and claim that that period of service should be taken into account in determining the total period in respect of which pension should be paid.  Even if this were a solitary case, and the circumstances were as described by Senator O'Connell, I feel that no injustice is being done.</P>

      <P>I maintain that, despite what the Minister has said, there is only one person affected by this particular sub-section, or can be affected.  If it is the Minister's case that the person concerned might go to the courts and ask for a declaration as to whether or not what he got, and which was not described at the time as a gratuity, is, or is not, a gratuity. I do not think that is putting the case very fairly, because that is what the Minister suggested.  If it is not a gratuity, then it would not affect this particular person.  The only people who could decide are the courts, and I hardly think that it is treating this particular individual in the way he is <Col N="1645" /> entitled to be treated by this Oireachtas to suggest that that is the only way he has of claiming and getting the benefit of those three and a half years.</P>

      <P>If the circumstances are as described by the Senator, that in fact this sub-section does not apply to the individual he has in mind, because that individual did not in fact receive a gratuity, I do not see why he should be concerned about the sub-section.  I have no objection to the amendment at all except that I want to make it clear that if at any time in the future the question should arise of the payment of a gratuity to a person on retirement at that time, provision will have to be made that a pension cannot be paid for the same service subsequently.</P>

      <P>Sometimes the Minister is very annoying.  He caught Senator O'Connell on the wrong foot. Senator O'Connell said that he did not think it was a gratuity at all.  The Minister is quite right in this.  If a man is in office and is taken from that office, and he gets compensation for the loss of his office, then, of course, he should not count that period as a pensionable period.  In the case of the individual Senator O'Connell mentions, I do not think the money he got under an Act of the Oireachtas in 1931 was stated to be compensation for the loss of office, or a gratuity.  However, if it does not apply to him it is all right.  The Minister is going to take out the sub-section now, but I think if he wanted to put in what is in his mind he would express it this way&mdash; that a person who got compensation for loss of office should not be entitled to count that period as a term of service.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 5, line 6, after the word &ldquo;Finance&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and the Board&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is one to which I made some reference on the Second Stage.  It seems to me to be a completely simple matter.  The Electricity Supply Board was set up under an Act, the plain intention of which was stated to be, and in effect was, to keep the board at arm's length from the Government and the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  The board enjoys and exercises, and has satisfactorily exercised, it would appear, very wide powers, but when they come to frame a superannuation scheme for their employees they are brought entirely under the control of, in effect, the Minister for Finance, and the power given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in consultation with the Minister for Finance in this section is very great.  The thing about the Minister for Industry and Commerce in consultation with the Minister for Finance is, of course, for those with administrative experience, rather misleading verbiage.  It means that the Minister for Finance has power to frame a superannuation scheme for the employees of the board without consulting the board and without putting into the scheme any one single thing suggested <Col N="1647" /> by the board.  I would like the House to listen to the words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When a scheme has been submitted to the Minister in pursuance of the foregoing sub-section of this section, the Minister shall either, as he shall think proper, refer such scheme back to the board for reconsideration and fresh submission under the sub-section or, by order made after consultation with the Minister for Finance, confirm such scheme either without modification or with such modifications&rdquo;&mdash;note the words&mdash;&ldquo;(whether by way of addition, omission or variation) as the Minister shall, after such consultation, think proper.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry may make mistakes and any member of the Seanad may make mistakes, but when the Minister for Finance comes into the picture he never makes any mistakes. The effect of that plainly is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after consulting the Minister for Finance, may promulgate and confirm a scheme which is entirely contrary and entirely different to the scheme the board wants, and to the scheme that the board's employees want, or to the scheme which the board and its employees have agreed upon.  I think that is a complete departure from the spirit of the original Acts and from the whole notion that was behind the setting up of the board itself.  In order to effect a very slight improvement in it&mdash;and it would only be a slight improvement&mdash;I move that we should add after the Minister for Industry the words &ldquo;and the board&rdquo;, so that the Minister, before he confirmed a scheme, with or without modification, should consult not only the Minister for Finance but also the board.  I am sure the Minister for Finance did say on the Second Stage that the board would be consulted, and that his intention is that he will not be thwarted by the board's refusal to promulgate a scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave in this House and in the other House an example of a scheme for pensions for railway employees which never came off, but I think there is no comparison whatever <Col N="1648" /> between the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;at the moment, or in the future as far as we can see&mdash;and the railways, which are at a very low ebb and at a very difficult moment of their existence.  I think there is no likelihood that the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;this one or another one&mdash; would entirely refuse to bring in a superannuation scheme for its employees. Therefore, at least they ought to be consulted before the Minister proceeds to form a scheme which may be very different indeed from the one they submitted to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes referred to the fact that the original idea was to have this board at arm's length from the Government.  That is quite so.  It was felt that, as this board was running what might be called a commercial concern in the country, it would be impossible to have it subject to the control of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, who would make a report that would be examined by the Public Accounts Committee amid that publicity which is not desirable in the case of a commercial concern.  On the other hand, there were certain decided difficulties about that.  It was decidedly undesirable to have this undertaking running as a business in the country and differing from other businesses in that, instead of setting out to make a profit and pay dividends, any profit it made should be applied to reducing the cost of electricity to the consumers.  It differed from other commercial concerns in that way.  It was also undesirable that any Deputy in the Dáil could get up and ask the Minister detailed questions in regard to it.  A Government is quite different from a commercial concern in that way, and that situation was sought to be met by this arm's length policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, the Minister, in his administrative acts, in any act he performs under legislation of the Oireachtas, is acting subject to the control of the Legislature.  Therefore, the Legislature has the right to demand from him an account of his actions.  It does seem to me, therefore, that if the Minister takes the powers <Col N="1649" /> given to him&mdash;I am not saying that it is undesirable that those powers should be given in a general way&mdash;with regard to pension proposals, then, by the ordinary idea of Parliamentary control, the action that he takes, whether it be to add to or to take from or to vary the pensions proposed, must be subject to the control of the Dáil.  He must be in a position to be called upon to give an account of his actions there.  If his actions are going to be accounted for, that may also raise the question of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has considered the possible repercussions of this particular clause, namely, that it does bring the matter under the general supervision of the Dáil, and does mean that any member of the Legislature has the right to query, to criticise or to condemn a particular action that he has taken.  It does seem to me that, if that is so, then we are moving the Electricity Supply Board into the position of being a much more Parliamentarily controlled Government institution than was the original intention. I should like to know if the Minister does accept the suggestion that, under that clause, his actions are liable to query and discussion in the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the answer to what Senator Fitzgerald has said is this, that when the Act establishing the Electricity Supply Board was passed it did not provide power to the board to pay pensions to its employees. If it did, this Bill would not be necessary. At a much later stage, we are coming in to empower the board to pay pensions to its employees.  We are proposing to give them that power subject to certain limitations which are set out in the Bill.  We are not attempting to give statutory sanction to the actual pensions scheme.  We are saying to the board: &ldquo;You can prepare and bring into operation a superannuation scheme for your employees, subject to certain limitations which are set out in the Bill&mdash;equal contributions and so forth.&rdquo;  One of the limitations which we are proposing should be placed upon the power to be given to the board is this, that when they have prepared <Col N="1650" /> their scheme they will submit it for consideration to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I stated already the reasons why it was considered desirable that there should be some power to examine, and if necessary to revise the scheme, by a representative of what I might call the public interest, because this is not merely a matter between the Electricity Supply Board and its staff.  It is one that may have an effect upon the development of social policy generally in the country, and consequently we feel that the representative of the public should, at that stage, have an opportunity to examine what exactly the board is proposing to do.  That is what this section provides for.  It says that, when the board has prepared this scheme, it shall submit it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  When he gets it, he can confirm the scheme, in which case I am sure Senator Hayes will agree that consultation with the board will not be required; or he can refer it back to the board for reconsideration in respect of particular parts, setting forth no doubt the particular points which he thinks the board should reconsider; or he can himself, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, confirm the scheme with qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes, I think, misunderstood the point I was trying to make arising out of my experience in connection with the pensions scheme for the employees of the Great Southern Railways Company.  It was not that there was any similarity between the position of the Great Southern Railways Company and the Electricity Supply Board, but rather that there was a defect in the legislation which we enacted in 1933 relating to the railway company's employees, in so far as the legislation did not make provision for resolving a position of deadlock. As Senators will remember, the Act required the railway company to prepare a scheme and to submit that scheme to a tribunal, and gave to the tribunal the obligation of saying whether or not the scheme met the reasonable requirements of the employees.  The company prepared a scheme, and submitted it to the tribunal.  The tribunal declared that it did not meet the reasonable requirements <Col N="1651" /> of the employees, but the Act did not say anything beyond that. Consequently nothing happened after that, and the movement to establish a pensions scheme for the railway company's employees was stopped.  The possibility of restarting it was, of course, considerably reduced by the catastrophic fall in the finances of the company in the years that followed.</P>
    <P>We should have in this case some provision to ensure that a deadlock cannot arise here.  The aim of this Bill is to ensure that there shall be a pensions scheme for the employees of the Electricity Supply Board.  It will not be open to the board to say: &ldquo;We will or will not exercise the powers conferred upon us now at our discretion.&rdquo; They must prepare a scheme. They must submit that scheme for the consideration of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have power ultimately if necessary to require the board to go ahead with a scheme based upon their original draft, but modified if he considers modifications are necessary.  In practice, that situation is unlikely to arise here, because we know that the Electricity Supply Board are anxious to establish a superannuation scheme for their employees, and there is complete agreement between them and us as to the desirability of it.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the only question upon which some differences of opinion may arise will be questions of detail. It is unlikely that those questions will be of such a character that they cannot be resolved by discussion and agreement.  I do think, in so far as we are now merely providing legislative foundation for the whole thing, that we should have there as an ultimate safeguard some means of resolving a deadlock if it should arise.</P>
    <P>The insertion of the words which Senator Hayes proposes is unnecessary, and in a sense undesirable.  If in fact there is no disagreement they are unnecessary.  Once the board has submitted its scheme, and has reconsidered any points that are submitted to it for reconsideration, it is probable <Col N="1652" /> that the scheme will be confirmed without further ado, and consultation at that stage between the Minister and the board need not be made mandatory.  If, at that stage, it becomes necessary to suggest further modifications of the scheme because of the reluctance of the board to alter it in the manner which may be suggested to it, then I do not think it is likely that it will be necessary to use this power to compel the board to accept amendments to which they themselves object.  It is true that the wording of that sub-section, as it stands, would enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to be queried in the Dáil as to why he did, or did not, exercise his power to require modification of the scheme.  If the Minister does exercise that power to amend the scheme or if he proposes an amendment to the scheme submitted by the Electricity Supply Board, he should be answerable to somebody.</P>

      <P>There is merely a difference in the understanding of this section between the Minister and ourselves. As I understand sub-section (2), the Minister has two alternatives. One is to refer the scheme back to the board for reconsideration.  The words are: &ldquo;or either&rdquo; refer the scheme back.  The other alternative which the Minister has is, by order made after consultation with the Minister for Finance, to confirm the scheme or modify it.  I know that these provisions are treacherous and difficult to understand, but I have read a great many of them and it seems clear to me that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has power under this sub-section, after he receives a scheme from the board, to put any scheme he likes into operation, having either consulted the board or not consulted them.  I am not playing politics and I do not say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, here and now, is going to do that but we cannot be sure of an angelic succession of Ministers for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister could stretch that power to the extent of proposing a new scheme for the board.  What is going to happen? The board will go to their actuaries and tell them to prepare a scheme of pensions for them on a certain basis.  They will give them the <Col N="1654" /> number of employees and their average ages and they will tell them to work out the whole business.  Those will be the bones of the scheme.  There will have to be certain provisions as to management of the fund and the election of a committee of management, but the bones of the scheme will be prepared by the actuaries of the board. The attitude of the Department of Industry and Commerce will likely be that of making the various assumptions of the actuaries more conservative than the board might be inclined to make them, if any question should arise between us.  In assuming the income to be derived from any superannuation fund, various calculations are possible and, in assuming the outgoings, various calculations are possible. Figures were produced in the Dáil based upon the assumption which, I think, was unfounded, that half of the staff would elect to retire at 60 instead of 65 years of age.  That is most unlikely.  Senators who were members of the Government in the past are aware that persons due to retire at 65 immediately petitioned to be allowed to remain on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is much more likely that people will go on to 65 and try to remain after 65 than elect to retire on a smaller pension at 60 years.  In respect of that we may urge, and probably will urge, that a conservative assumption should be made during the initial period in which the fund will be operated as to the charges that will fall upon the fund and the income the fund will be capable of earning.  In order to give bigger pensions to their employees, the board may be prepared to adopt less conservative assumptions. It is on matters of that kind that any dispute may arise and, in the last analysis, it is the calling in of a third actuary which will settle points in dispute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary draftsman drafted this provision on instructions.  Sometimes he makes things clearer than he was expected to make them.  The Minister knows as well as I do that there have been cases in which Ministers were astounded at <Col N="1655" /> the interpretation placed by the courts on legislation which they thought was quite satisfactory when being put through the Oireachtas.  The words used here are very strong.  The Minister may confirm the scheme without modification or with modifications whether by way of &ldquo;addition, omission or variation&rdquo;.  I do not know that you could get words stronger than these, though a skilled lawyer might find stronger words.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that no power is too great for the Department of Finance.  There is nothing which the officials of the Department of Finance are not able to do and nothing that they do not know better than anybody else.  They are prepared to do anything about anything.  The Minister knows that.  They must have pestered the life out of him, but I do not expect him to admit that what I say is true.  They know all about the Electricity Supply Board.  They know more about the actuarial work than the actuary.  They know all about the plumbers, carpenters and clerks employed by the Electricity Supply Board.  This sub-section, as worded, seems to give power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, to make very important changes in the scheme.  If you add to the scheme, omit something from it and vary something in it, it means that you can produce something much nearer your heart's desire than the desire of the persons who originally framed the scheme.  That being so, the power should not exist unless, as the Minister says, the Minister concerned is responsible for exercising it, but it is only a short step from that to saying that if he is responsible for the exercise of the power, he should also be responsible for the method in which he exercises it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in favour of the Minister having this power at all, but it is inevitable that if Ministers have the power that they should not exercise it without consulting the board, and that if they have exercised the power they should be prepared to answer to the Oireachtas for the way they did it. <Col N="1656" /> There is no possibility of avoiding that.  I am only giving the Minister the logical Parliamentary development of the powers he seeks.  What is the criterion in the Dáil when a man puts down a question?  The theory is that a certain Minister must be responsible. You cannot put down a motion at large, you must say that the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce can do something in the matter. Surely, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce combined with the Minister for Finance to modify a scheme by way of variation or addition, there must and there will be a Parliamentary method, even if we do not put it into this amendment, of bringing that responsibility before the Dáil.  If this power is going to be put in the section, I think there should be prior consultation with the board.  It is of considerable importance that the scheme should not become law without that consultation.  I am admitting that the Minister has a point of view in the matter and I am not questioning his motives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the fact is that the Senator is exaggerating the functions which the Department of Finance have to play under this section.  It is not the Department of Finance which will come in and say that the scheme must be amended.  It is the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He is obliged to consult the Minister for Finance before he requires modifications to be made, but he does not necessarily have to accept the declarations of the Minister for Finance in the matter.  The procedure is laid down fairly clearly in the Bill&mdash; a scheme is prepared by the Electricity Supply Board and submitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister for Industry and Commerce can ask the Electricity Supply Board to reconsider the scheme in any respect he wishes.  If, on reconsideration, the board send back the scheme to him in a manner in which, in his opinion, amendment is still desirable, no doubt he can ask them to reconsider it again.  I do not think there is any limitation upon the number of <Col N="1657" /> times he can ask the board to reconsider the scheme, but in the last resort he can modify the scheme himself. The Department of Finance come into it before he can modify the scheme, because he must consult the Minister for Finance, but it is possible that the Minister for Finance would adopt the view of the board rather than that of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>I really think the Minister should look into it.  I have been considering it while Senator Hayes was speaking and I do not think it is very <Col N="1658" /> clear.  The sentence was most involved. The Electricity Supply Board is run largely as a business concern.  I had some experience of superannuation schemes carried out through insurance companies, and it has always been necessary to discuss a considerable number of details with the staffs because you must have the staffs satisfied and willing to work in with the scheme.  These discussions take time. It seems to me that when the board has prepared a scheme, Government Departments may proceed to interfere in that best old British Treasury tradition which I think we have here, and thereby complicate the whole working of the scheme which has been drawn up by the board.  I do not think the Minister wants that and, as one member of the House, I do not want it. The present wording of the sub-section is too complicated and I think the Minister should look into it before the final stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), page 6, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; where it first occurs in line 48 to the end of the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sub-section to which this amendment is being moved is the one which penalises employees of the Electricity Supply Board who belong to the pensions <Col N="1660" /> scheme by depriving them of the benefits of that scheme if they go on strike.  This section is probably the most objectionable one in the whole Bill, and, in my opinion, very definitely mars what is, as I said last week on the Second Reading, a very desirable piece of social legislation.  It is altogether unnecessary and it has aroused more antagonism to the Bill than any other proposal, particularly among manual workers and workers organised in the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>The amendment asks that the service of participants in pension schemes should not be broken for the purpose of the pension scheme simply because they have gone on strike.  The object that the Minister has in view in this Bill could have been achieved better by setting up some form of conciliation machinery, making provision for the prevention of disputes, rather than by making provision for penalties as now set forth, if workers are constrained for some grave reason&mdash;a reason of conscience or some other valid reason&mdash;to withdraw their labour.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I would like to dispel the idea, pretty prevalent in circles outside the trade union movement, that strikes are a form of national pastime engaged in by organised workers.  Anyone who has had the misfortune to be a participant in a strike, particularly a long strike, knows the economic consequences which follow.  Workers are very slow to go out on strike unless there is a very grave reason.  In this connection, I submit that the Minister already has the power he needs in the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, and in the originating Act of the Electricity Supply Board, where it was made a criminal offence to interfere with the generation, transmission, and distribution of gas&mdash;or, in this case, of electricity.  I think he has all the safeguards required in both of those measures.</P>
    <P>We regard that portion of the sub-section that we propose should be deleted as entirely unnecessary, and, having regard to the two Acts to which I have referred, as redundant. Many workers will find difficulty in <Col N="1661" /> participating under this Act&mdash;particularly lower paid workers&mdash;because of the financial obligations it will impose on them, but they would be willing to get over those difficulties if this definitely objectionable clause could be disposed of.  I have some knowledge of the feelings of workers&mdash;particularly manual workers&mdash;in regard to this section.  They feel that, as long as this section stands, very many of them will not participate in any scheme.  I know that the Minister has stated that there is no obligation on them to take part and that, if they want to leave themselves free to take part in any action such as strike action, they can do so by not coming into this scheme.  That would be very undesirable.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect that we, as representatives of the trade union movement, cannot overlook.  Many good employers in industry pay pensions to their workers without any obligation.  Because they are good employers they pay those pensions. In my own trade, rather substantial pensions are paid to certain classes of workers.  If we were to let this section go, without making a protest, it might occur in future that employers would put an obligation on workers who participate in any pension scheme, to give an assurance that they would not engage in strike action at any time. We feel that it is necessary to make a protest here about that.  The Minister himself has stated that he would like to see a development of pension schemes for other classes of workers. If he gets away with this Bill, he may be tempted, in any schemes in the future, to impose a similar clause&mdash; even though the service might not be an essential service or one where workers should not go on strike.</P>
    <P>In regard to the statement about workers having the desire to strike, I would say there is no desire on their part to engage in that costly luxury without very grave reason.  If this country were invaded by an alien power and the Electricity Supply Board workers decided, as has been done in the past, that they would close down for a week, would they be regarded as taking action coming within the scope <Col N="1662" /> of this section?  Would they be penalised for that?</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the provision in paragraph (c) of sub-section 3, where it is laid down that &ldquo;all contributions paid to the said fund by such person, or by the board on his behalf, in respect of the period of service so excluded shall remain in the said fund and shall not be repayable.&rdquo;  That is a very unfair clause.  I will not go so far as to say it is ungenerous, but it seems to me to be rather unfair that workers participating in the scheme should be penalised, not only in respect of pensions in the future but also in respect of contributions paid before the commission of that &ldquo;wilful act&rdquo; which caused, or might have caused, an interruption in the generation, transmission or distribution of electricity. The worker should be entitled at least to the repayment of the contribution he had made prior to the commission of the overt act which will cause this service to be excluded in the computation of his pension rights.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to give at least some consideration to the points which I have made in respect of this sub-section.  We believe it is altogether too harsh.  There is no desire to go on strike.  If the Minister introduced some sort of conciliation machinery, it might much better serve the object he had in view.  Having regard to the good conditions and constant employment already referred to, we do not think there is any desire for precipitate or hasty action, but we think it is an affront to the manual workers in the service of the Electricity Supply Board that they should have this section imposed on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the inclusion of this provision, from a somewhat different point of view from that-put forward by Senator Campbell.  It appears to me that the Minister is using a Superannuation Bill to do something which should be done, if done at all, by a separate measure.  He is introducing in a piecemeal, partial way something which, if done at all, should be the subject of discussion in a separate Bill.  There may be very many arguments which could be put <Col N="1663" /> forward in favour, not only of conciliation, but also of arbitration, and even of compulsory arbitration.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anyone amongst the workers or any other section of the community who is anxious to have strikes.  I believe that everybody is anxious to do everything possible to avoid them.  I do not share entirely the views expressed by labour representatives that a tribunal could not be found in this country which would arbitrate fairly, honestly and justly on matters of dispute.  I would not accept it as a general principle that there should be no such thing as compulsory arbitration, which this really amounts to in essence.  Although it is not stated, that is what this means in effect. It is a penalisation of the worker unless he is prepared to accept compulsory arbitration.  If there is to be compulsory arbitration for the settlement of disputes, the Government should put that forward as a general principle for the acceptance of the Oireachtas, to apply not only in particular cases where pensions are provided, but in other cases also.  This is a pettifogging way to introduce this very big principle into what, strictly speaking, should be a superannuation Bill&mdash;penalising people by depriving them of pensions to which they have contributed.  If they exercise a right which they have at the present time&mdash; it has not been taken from them by legislation and it is not being taken from them&mdash;they are penalised by being deprived of pensions and the contributions which they have paid over a long period of years.</P>
      <P>I think that is not the way to deal with this problem.  I think that instead of introducing it in this measure, and possibly in other measures that may crop up at other times, in this piecemeal fashion the whole problem should be tackled, if it is a problem.  It should not be dealt with in this manner.  This attempt to bring about a certain result by inserting a penalty in a superannuation Bill is not the proper way to deal with the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the point of view expressed by Senator O'Connell.  I made it pretty clear on previous occasions, in discussing the general question of industrial disputes, that I do not think the right to strike is something which should be extended to every service.  My opinion is that the time has come when we should provide for compulsory arbitration in essential services.  To my mind the Electricity Supply Board is not only an essential service now but, quite likely after the war, it may be extended to become, perhaps, the most essential service in this country.  Our difficulties with regard to coal and various other supplies seem to me to make it almost certain that some Government will have to try to exploit further our natural resources.  For that reason, I would be in favour either in this Bill or preferably in a separate Bill of a definite provision for compulsory arbitration, but I do not like the method which the Minister has chosen to bring that about.  The workers retain the right to strike but they are told that should they exercise it, they will have to do without a pension.  If they are to have a pension, they must have compulsory arbitration.  I cannot see any relation between the two things at all.  It also seems to me that instead of getting accepted what I believe is desirable, a properly thought out scheme of compulsory arbitration for all the workers, you will have compulsory arbitration for part only of the servants of the Electricity Supply Board.  You may have people deciding not to avail of superannuation provisions which in ordinary circumstances they would be glad to avail of. I am afraid that the Minister, probably with the intention of giving effect to the idea at the first opportunity, may defeat his own purpose by these means and may find it far more difficult to adopt it in future.  I am altogether out of sympathy with the method which he has chosen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is dangerous to compel workers in any organisation at the present time, particularly in a semi-State organisation, to decide this question: &ldquo;Will you come into a superannuation <Col N="1665" /> scheme, to provide pensions for yourself and make provision for your families, or do you say that it is more important to retain the right to strike, or the right to refuse compulsory arbitration, in certain circumstances?&rdquo; The question of a desire to strike has nothing to do with it.  I do not believe that any trade union deliberately desires a strike or any group of employers would desire a lockout any more than a few years ago there was any country which deliberately desired war, but we know that these things happen.  Employers may get involved in lock-outs without having any intention of doing so, and we know that trade unions are very often involved in strikes which six months previously they had never contemplated.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree at all that the provision contained in this sub-section is inappropriate to the Bill.  Clearly, the Bill must provide for the determination of the period of service in respect of which a pension will be paid.  The pension receivable by a manual worker employed by the board at the end of his period of service will be reckoned in relation to the number of years continuous service he had in the employment of the board.  Some method of determining the number of years and the continuity of that service must exist.  Provision is made in the Bill for the possibility of a break in the service.  A break in the service will not cause any loss of pension to the worker provided he is willing that his contributions should remain in the fund and provided also that the break in service was not due to any wilful action on his part which caused an interruption in the generation, transmission or distribution of electricity.  It is true that one of the aims of the sub-section is to lessen the possibility of manual workers employed by the board taking strike action in a manner which will cause an interruption in the generation, transmission or distribution of electricity or which will impede the due performance of any of the functions of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Campbell referred to the Act of 1870.  I confess that I thought that <Col N="1666" /> the existence of that Act, which was made to apply to employment under the Electricity Supply Board by the Electricity Supply Act of 1927, was an argument in favour of my contention rather than in favour of his.  Under that Act, a worker who wilfully withdraws his labour in a manner which causes an interruption in the supply of electricity in any town becomes guilty of a criminal offence for which he can be charged in the Criminal Courts.  That is the law so far as electricity is concerned since 1927.  It has been the law so far as gas and other public services are concerned since 1870.  Circumstances may make it difficult to apply that law in individual cases, but so far as the electricity supply workers are concerned in this Bill, there is no question of depriving them of the right to strike if they want to.  We think we ought to take every step, however, that will result in discouraging them going on strike.  These steps must include certain penalties, if they choose to go on strike and certain safeguards if they choose not to go on strike.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board service is, as Senator Douglas says, one of vital importance to the whole country.  On the maintenance of the supply of electricity there depend the livelihoods of thousands of other workers.  A sudden or protracted interruption in the supply of electricity would jeopardise the employment of the great majority of workers in the country.  It eventually would bring practically all industrial employment to a standstill.  I suggest that it is not unreasonable to say that the comparatively small number of workers employed by the Electricity Supply Board should not be permitted to bring about that situation.  It could be argued that we are not preventing them bringing about that situation under this Bill.  We are going no further than discouraging them from doing so but I do not think it will be seriously suggested that the whole of our legislation should not be directed towards discouraging an interruption in the supply of electricity, in view of the widespread and catastrophic consequences it would have for workers throughout the whole country.  These <Col N="1667" /> workers are employed by the board at standard rates of wages provided for in agreements made by the trade unions representative of them in respect of their classes of employment generally.  The board pays these standard rates.  In the negotiations and the agreements in which these standard rates were set up&mdash;agreements which were made, not with the board, but with other employers engaging the services of similar classes of workers, carpenters, electricians, lorry drivers, etc.&mdash;I am quite certain that consideration was given to the fact that these workers, when employed by ordinary commercial employers, have no guarantee of continuity of employment.</P>
    <P>In determining the hourly or daily or weekly rate workers' representatives would keep in mind what, having regard to normal employment, the average worker's yearly earnings on the basis of these rates would be.  The Electricity Supply Board worker obviously is in a very much better position. He has continuity of employment, and a reasonable assurance of continuity in the future.  In addition, we are proposing to ensure for him what other workers have not got&mdash;a pension on retirement.  Clearly, the position will be much better in every way than that of workers in the same grades or of the same skill employed by other employers.  They will have, on the one hand, the same rate of wages, and, on the other hand, a reasonable assurance of continuity of employment and a pension on retirement. In these circumstances, it is not unreasonable to say to them: &ldquo;We ask you to submit any matters that may arise in dispute between you and the employers to the arbitration of an independent tribunal.  We are not denying you the right to strike, either before or after the submission of your case, but we do impose on you this penalty, that if you go on strike in the manner contemplated in paragraph (a) of sub-section (3) then you have broken continuity of service, and the reckoning of your pension on retirement will date from the day of resumption.&rdquo;  As <Col N="1668" /> a safeguard to the workers we have established a tribunal.</P>
    <P>I have said before that the right of a worker is not so much the right to strike as the right to justice.  There is an obligation on us in framing legislation of this kind to ensure a means of obtaining justice to the workers and we have given them an alternative and, in my opinion, a better means of getting justice than the utilisation of the strike weapon.  In the normal course, I presume, all matters in dispute will be the subject of negotiation, but in the event of negotiation not leading to a settlement in a manner acceptable to the workers there will be an independent tribunal with power to give a final decision upon the merits of the case.  That safeguard will, in the long run, prove much more valuable to the workers than the right to withdraw their labour and take strike action.  It is much more likely to result in an improvement in the conditions of the employment, and the speedy rectification of any grievances that they may feel they have.</P>
    <P>The whole decision of the Government to apply the provisions of this scheme to manual workers employed by the board turns upon the retention of this provision.  Originally when the Bill was being framed the Government considered carefully whether the scheme should be applied to the manual workers employed by the board or not.  We could easily have contended that so long as the board gave to the manual workers the best conditions which workers of the same kind have from any other employers, then the board has discharged its obligations in full.  We decided, however, to go further.  We decided to apply the scheme to these manual workers, subject to the provision that workers who elected to come under it would be then in the position that matters that normally arose in dispute between themselves and the board would be settled by arbitration rather than by a withdrawal of labour.  It is true, despite what some Senators said, that a worker need not come under the scheme if he likes.  A manual worker can elect to remain as he is, and we have not worsened his position.  He <Col N="1669" /> will continue to get the standard rates of wages and a reasonable assurance of continuity.  If he elects to come under the scheme, then he knows that he will be contributing towards a pension to him on his retirement, subject to the possibility of the loss of these contributions if, at any stage, he withdraws his labour wilfully in a manner that interrupts the generation or distribution of electricity.</P>
    <P>Senator Campbell gave rather a fanciful illustration of a problem that might arise in the event of an alien Power invading this country and the workers deciding to close down for a week.  I do not think that they should have their own initiative, even in these circumstances.  I believe that in circumstances such as those mentioned there would still be some form of national leadership, to which proposals of that kind should be referred before being acted upon.  Having regard to the very serious consideration given to the whole question by the Government, I am unable to accept the amendment.  The only possibility of modifying the Bill in the manner indicated would be in association with the proposal to withdraw the manual labour from the scope of the Bill altogether.</P>

      <P>I have been a bit in the dark, not knowing the 1870 Act.  Various speakers and the Minister himself, seem to imply two things.  The Minister said that there was no intention to deprive the workers of the right to strike, but on the other hand, Senator Campbell said that the powers wanted by the Government were already contained in the 1870 Act, incorporated in the Electricity Supply Act.  Is it the position that any organised strike which would interfere with the distribution and generation of electricity is an illegal act?</P>

      <P>I am at one with the Minister.  I think it is an impossible position if the peculiarly favoured number of men who are acting for the Electricity Supply Board are going to be in a position to cripple the whole operation of life in this country by the arbitrary act of striking. That is a power that should not be in their hands.  If it is not, well and good, but on the one hand we are told that if they are attempting that, they are committing an illegal act, while Senator Campbell suggests that a number of men will not avail of the superannuation in order to retain in their hands the power to commit an illegal act without the loss of contribution. I think it is an impossible position if the people of the country are going to be dependent for the continuity of ordinary needs of life upon any whim that may suddenly take possession of these men, especially when they feel that they are in possession of such power that unless their arbitrary demands are met, everybody has to face up to disaster or inconvenience or lack of necessities.  That is a power that should not be in their hands.  The Minister seemed to imply that it was a criminal act, but on the other hand seems to say that there was no decision to prevent the right to strike.  I think there should be a decision in this matter.</P>

      <P>The scope of this section is clearly wider than the 1870 Act.  In any event, it did not apply to lorry drivers and repair staff or any manual worker.  The 1870 Act refers only to a withdrawal of labour in circumstances which would cause an immediate cessation of supply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as the immediate cessation of supply would be local and would not do much harm it might be all right, but certainly I do feel that every care should be taken that the whole life of the community is not going to be put in the hands of a small body of favoured men and of a trade union that dominates their acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulty in keeping my patience with the kind of vocabulary Senator Fitzgerald uses <Col N="1671" /> in this matter.  He is very vexed at the existence of this monstrous situation where a number of men can exercise a whim, and in an arbitrary manner hold up the life of the community.  One would imagine that workers go out on strike for a whim or in an arbitrary manner.  I can assure Senator Fitzgerald that they do no such thing. Striking is far too serious a business to be indulged in for a whim or in an arbitrary manner.  There are inadvisable strikes, of course, but the kind of vocabulary that people who hold a certain point of view use about it is simply making things worse instead of improving them.  The same thing arises when Senator Fitzgerald talks about people who occupy a favoured position. People employed by the Electricity Supply Board are giving value for their money.  They are earning their living, the same as the rest of us are, and it is simply not true to say that they occupy a favoured position any more than a teacher occupies a favoured position, or any carpenter working on a building far away from the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>On the question of this particular section and Senator Campbell's amendment, I entirely agree with the Minister that we ought not to have stoppages and strikes in essential services. Putting it in that mild and entirely correct manner, I agree with Senator Fitzgerald.  I agree with the Minister also in that I think he is probably offering them in this tribunal as set out in the Bill a better method than the strike method for settling their grievances and their difficulties.  I also agree that the consequences of a strike in the Electricity Supply Board would be catastrophic.  I do not think that the word &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo; used by the Minister is an exaggeration.  I think Senator Campbell or any other Labour representative in this House or outside it will agree with that, because the Electricity Supply Board affects not only Dublin but every town in the whole State.  If the consequences of a strike in the Electricity Supply Board would be, as has been said, catastrophic, then we ought to face up to that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> What I find wrong about this particular provision in the Bill&mdash;I do not know what the remedy is&mdash;is that it is an oblique, kind of sideways, method of reaching a very desirable result. What the Minister desires to achieve is a situation in which men in essential services would not go on strike but would submit their difficulties to a tribunal.  With that I am in entire agreement.  I would even be entirely in agreement, under certain conditions, with preventing people in essential services from going on strike.  I think we have to face up to that.  Some time ago here in this House Senator Douglas proposed and I seconded a proposal dealing with a tribunal.  It did not go as far as compulsory arbitration, but it went a certain distance.  The Minister was not prepared to accept it, and the Labour members who spoke on it were not very clear or helpful on the matter either.  This particular Bill, as the Minister has phrased it, brings us to the point when we see that it must be done, but it cannot be done piecemeal. The Minister, while he would not accept the general proposal with regard to arbitration on labour disputes, whether strikes or lock-outs, is now inserting in this Bill a proposal which refers only to a certain number of employees, and which has been exciting feelings of irritation in the minds of those particular employees.  The proposal is rather a peculiar one, it seems to me.  I do not know what exactly is the definition of a manual worker, but I presume it has to be defined later on in consultation between the board and its employees.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether it will be settled between the board and its employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it will be settled by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would a messenger in Stephen's Green, for example, be a manual worker.  I do not know.  I do not ask if the Minister knows; possibly he does not.  In any event, the proposal is that there is a scheme for superannuation.  The manual workers are either to enter it or not as they choose.  It is rather a costly scheme.  It is not such a wonderful thing at all for the manual <Col N="1673" /> workers as one reading the Title of the Bill and hearing the Second Reading debate would imagine.  It is a contributory scheme, and, in order to enjoy any benefits from it, a person who went into the employment of the board in 1927 or 1930, or in the last ten years even, would have to make rather heavy contributions to make up his back payments, so that without any regard to this particular section of the Bill, a number of manual workers may find the thing too costly and may not enter at all.  Others of them, without being enthusiastic for strikes themselves, may feel that a certain limitation is placed upon them that was not placed upon them before, and that is not placed upon other workers in other places, and they may refuse to become members of the scheme, with the result that the manual workers are going to be divided between contributors to the superannuation scheme and non-contributors, and presumably if strike action is contemplated for any reason &mdash;I hope it will not be and I doubt that it will be&mdash;certain people could quite legally and without any penalty of any kind exercise their full right to strike.  Other people would find themselves deprived of their continuity of service, and also deprived of their contributions, under the sub-section which Senator Campbell mentioned, paragraph (c).  That seems to me to be a very strange situation, and very bad from this point of view, that the result of it might very well be what we had in the Dublin Corporation&mdash;a strike, loss of service for certain people, and then a Bill brought into the Dáil and passed through both Houses to restore to people something they had lost.  As a general principle, that is very bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we should face up to this difficulty, pass legislation about it, and then stand fast by the legislation. One of the difficulties of this may very well be that some time or other you will have a partial stoppage, and, in order to remedy the difficulty created here, you will have further legislation, which I think as general principle and procedure is very bad.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who will not back the general proposal for a <Col N="1674" /> tribunal, and in that he is supported by the Labour Party, finds the employees of the Electricity Supply Board, so to speak, under his hand, and he says: &ldquo;Well, now, we will not have a general tribunal, but we will make those fellows sit up,&rdquo; and he uses this particular superannuation scheme to get a number of such workers in under a tribunal scheme, which is a good scheme in itself, but I think the piecemeal method is very bad.  As Senator Douglas said, it gives a man a choice between superannuation and strike, and it may very well have the effect, combined with the cost of the scheme, of excluding manual workers altogether.  As I said on the Second Reading, I think that would be a very great pity, because the idea of a pensions scheme for manual workers, even if the scheme has defects in the beginning, is a very good one; it is a very good seed to sow, and might have very good effects later on.</P>
    <P>I think we really need conciliation and arbitration in general, so as to limit the number of disputes, and we might have special provisions for essential services.  I do not mind saying that I am quite in favour of special provisions for essential services, because the life of the whole country cannot be held up by a trade dispute, but it would require considerable thought, and it would require action which some people would not be prepared to take.  It might require for example, as well as compulsory arbitration, compulsory trade unionism. What I am wondering is to what particular type of person do the words &ldquo;generation, transmission and distribution&rdquo; apply.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is the definition of &ldquo;manual workers&rdquo;.  It might very well happen that some people would go on strike and not have this section applied to them, while others might go on strike and have it applied to them.  What I think is really wrong with this section is not its principle so much as its partiality.  It applies only to a certain number of workers, and applies in conditions which are not very clearly defined and may prove to be very unsatisfactory.  It might very well result in injury to the principle of <Col N="1675" /> tribunal and arbitration, which in itself is absolutely sound and should be accepted. The way it is put in here is very partial and is not satisfactory.  A direct prohibition in respect of certain service in certain conditions and applied to all would be much more satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has certainly drawn attention to a definite aspect of the trade union movement, the right to strike.  &ldquo;Essential services&rdquo; is a phrase which has been very much used in the course of the debate.  The right to strike was granted under the 1906 Act.  This Bill imposes limitations and inhibitions in respect of that right. If those are to be applied to other services which may be regarded in the future as essential services, we shall come to the point where we clearly eliminate and, ultimately, destroy the whole right to strike.  That may not be the intention of this Bill but, from remarks passed by Senators this evening and from the statement made by the Minister, it seems clear that the inevitable tendency of legislation of this character will be to deprive the manual worker of the right to strike. Electricity supply has been described as one of the most essential services in the country, if not the most essential. It is difficult to see what service, provided within the community by a section or element of the community, is not essential to the community.  Railway and general transport will be considered as essential to the life, welfare and health of the community as the provision of electricity.  To-morrow morning we may have transport services dealt with in the same way as electricity supply is being dealt with, and we may have legislation of the same character as we are debating here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That industry will be regarded as highly essential and it is to be presumed that, following the precedent set in the legislation this evening, we shall have the same inhibitions in regard to manual workers in the railway service as we have in this Bill.  We may go on from railways to the provision of general foods.  We may come <Col N="1676" /> down to the farms.  Farmers have also the habit of withholding supplies when their general interest necessitates such action.  When we have finished naming essential services, we will find that we have, probably, included every service essential to the life and welfare of the community.  In all these services we have manual workers and I presume the same type of legislation will be applied to these services as is contained in this Bill. The result will be that we shall arrive at the point where the right to strike is completely destroyed.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1875&mdash;the Criminal Conspiracy (Protection of Property) Act&mdash; to which reference is made in the Bill, gives the State the right to deal with the withholding of labour from such essential services as electricity, gas and water.  That provision being in the hands of the authorities, there is no necessity, as has been said already, to come in in an oblique manner for the purpose of hurting the interests of the worker who may desire to participate in this superannuation scheme.  The worker will have a vested interest in his pension and he will have to consider very seriously whether he will jeopardise that proprietary position if he desires to exercise his elementary right to strike.  That does not seem to me to be the correct way to deal with a position of that character, especially when there is already in existence an enactment to deal with those who may withdraw their labour. Furthermore, it will have the effect of dividing the service against itself. Some will desire to participate in the scheme because of the advantages to be secured from it.  Others will have regard to the attendant circumstances which may limit their right to strike and, consequently, you may have the house divided against itself.  Like other houses in that situation, it cannot stand.  This legislation seems to be redundant in view of the legislation available for this purpose since 1875.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The last two speeches missed the point.  Senator Hayes said that arbitration, or judicial investigation of the merits of the issues involved in a trade dispute, represents the rational way of resolving these disputes. <Col N="1677" /> But he said that that principle should not be applied partially, that if it is to be applied it should be applied generally.  I disagree entirely.  I think that by far the most effective method of applying it is partially.  If we can get it accepted partially in branches of industry, the advantage of it will become more generally evident and its acceptance will be rendered all the more ready in circles and places where it would not be accepted now, where, in fact, the application of the principle would be resisted now.  I think that it is entirely unsound to say that because we cannot apply the principle to all branches of industry or to all essential services now, we should not apply it to any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of approach contemplated by this Bill&mdash;the introduction of a new principle to one service, the essentiality of which will not be disputed, and its subsequent application to others&mdash;is the best method.  The right to strike is not an issue here at all.  I want to make that clear.  What this Bill proposes to do is to reduce the advantages of strikes and to impose certain disadvantages upon those who elect to have their grievances rectified, as they think, by strike action rather than by the more rational method of submission to the tribunal.  This Bill does not impose any restriction on the individual's right to strike.  We say to the individual, however, that in consideration of the enactment by the Legislature of provisions which will ensure&mdash;upon a contributory basis it is true but, nevertheless, ensure&mdash;him a pension on retirement, we propose to make it of less advantage to him to go on strike and of greater advantage to submit his disputes with his employers to the arbitration of a judicial tribunal.  In other words, we are merely ensuring that the general inclination of the worker will be towards acceptance of the decision of the tribunal rather than towards endeavouring to secure a settlement by trial of strength, which is, of course, what a strike represents. The outcome of the strike may be no indication of the merits of the dispute. It merely indicates that the stronger party succeeded in imposing on the <Col N="1678" /> other their views on the merits of the dispute.</P>
    <P>The Act to which reference has been made does not arise here at all.  That was an Act passed to ensure that persons who interrupted public services, such as supplies of water or gas, by withdrawing their labour, became amenable to penalties.  In the Electricity Supply Act of 1927 the principle of that Act was applied to the generation and transmission of electricity.  How far it extends down the various grades of employees of the Electricity Supply Board, from the person who keeps his hand on the switch to the person drawing coal into the dump, I could not say, but at some point that may be legally determined.  It seems clear to me, however, that the effect of that Act is only to apply the penalties contemplated by it to those whose actual labour directly influences the supply of electricity and is not merely incidental thereto.  The manual workers employed by the board, who will be defined in the superannuation scheme applying to them, will include others not immediately or directly concerned with the generation of electricity at all. We want to get the position created that their advantage will be in the acceptance of arbitration rather than in an attempt to determine matters in dispute by strike action.  There is, in fact no interference with the right to strike.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to extend the time for the completion of new houses which are in the course of building by private persons and public utility societies in rural areas and the reconstruction of existing houses by small farmers and agricultural labourers, <Col N="1682" /> under the system of grants established by Section 5 of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.  Under the Act of last year, grants were payable for houses which were erected or reconstructed before the 1st April, 1942.  The present Bill extends that period to the 1st April, 1943.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill does not relate to the construction of houses, but is intended to enable local authorities to appropriate houses provided by them under the Housing of the Working Classes Act or Labourers Act, for the purpose of accommodating persons who may be rendered homeless by reason of bomb damage, explosions, etc., caused by any foreign agency.  As the House is aware, in the letting of such houses the local bodies must comply with certain statutory provisions, and the purpose of this section is to enable them to waive compliance with those provisions in the particular cases which I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Bill will validate certain grants paid or promised in respect of the erection or reconstruction of houses to persons carrying on the trade of small shopkeeper.  The Labourers Act, 1918, extended the definition of the expression &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; so as to include any person not working for hire but working in a rural district at some trade or handicraft without employing any persons other than members of his own family.  The interpretation of the expression &ldquo;trade or handicraft&rdquo; to include a shop has been held to be unduly wide, and it has been decided that thenceforward a grant could not properly be made for the reconstruction of a shop or shopkeeper's residence.  Prior, however, to this decision, grants had been made and undertakings to make grants had been given to persons such as I have described.</P>
      <P>The purpose of Section 4 is, firstly, to validate the grants already made and, secondly, to permit us to fulfil our undertakings in the limited number of cases in which such undertakings have been given.  I may say that the section will not operate to permit of grants being allocated in any similar case in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Seanad, in a general way, welcomes this Bill providing for the payment of housing grants.  As one interested in this work, I would also welcome an amendment by the Minister to make it valid for a person carrying on a business or shop to be entitled to receive a grant.  I have met a number of cases where people carry on business in a new house, more or less of the workshop type.  I have in mind dressmakers, tailors and shoemakers&mdash;local people in country districts who carry on those trades.  As the Act stands at present, they would not be entitled to a grant if they employ persons other than members of their own families. They would not come within the definition of an agricultural worker and, therefore, would not be entitled to receive a grant.  I know one or two cases where there is great hardship&mdash; one where a local dressmaker had a new house erected on the understanding that she would be entitled to £80 of a grant.  When the inspector came, she was informed that, as she happened to employ one person other than a member of her own family, she was not eligible.  I would ask the Minister, if possible, to amend this Bill in the Seanad now, by inserting the word &ldquo;shop&rdquo;, so that persons of that kind would be entitled to receive a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know very well the great strides that have been made, since the present Government came into office, in housing, particularly in rural areas. On various occasions in this House we have heard talk about the flight from the land.  I trace that back to the lack of proper housing.  If we look at the question, we find that a young agricultural worker employed by a farmer, when he makes up his mind to get married, finds that the only place he can take himself and his wife into is some slum room in the city, as there is no housing accommodation in the country, for rent or otherwise, to be got.  Although in a number of districts the boards of health have made great strides in the erection of labourers' cottages, I can safely say that there is not a county in which a sufficient number <Col N="1684" /> of these cottages have been erected. We know that owing to war conditions it is very difficult to procure housing materials at the present time, but I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the need for cottages and for improved rural housing in general.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a concession to people who have set aside portion of their houses for shops.  In that connection there is one question which I should like the Minister to answer. Prior to this, if a man erected a house with a shop attached, it would be necessary to have a separate entrance for the shop.  I should like to know if that condition still holds, in order to obtain a grant under this section.  In addition to people who were deprived of grants because they set up shops, there was also a number of people who lost grants owing to the restrictions imposed as regards floor area.  When the 1932 Act was passed the floor area was fixed at a maximum of 1,250 square feet.</P>
    <P>That was afterwards reduced to 875 square feet.  Meanwhile a number of people who had begun to build their houses were caught out, because they found that the new regulations prescribed that the floor area should not be greater than 875 square feet. They were informed when the houses were completed that they were not entitled to grants.  Quite a number of people had incurred debts and had contracted for the building of these houses on the assumption that they were entitled to the usual grant.  As a matter of fact in a number of cases, approval certificates were issued by the appointed officers and on the strength of these certificates people contracted debts.  They were later informed after the prescribed floor area had been reduced from 1,250 to 875 square feet that they were not entitled to grants.  They found themselves in a very awkward position indeed.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether it would not be possible to make a concession in regard to those people.  They would not amount to a very large number.  I think that at least the people who started work after the approval certificates were issued by the appointed <Col N="1685" /> officers should have their claim for a grant reconsidered.  So much for rural housing.</P>
    <P>Coming to the question of housing in urban areas, under the 1932 Act a person or a public utility society erecting a house in an urban area was entitled to receive a grant of £70 It was subsequently reduced each year until it was brought down to £45, and for a number of years now these grants have been suspended entirely. While there may be very few people who undertake the erection of houses in urban areas at present, I think it would be a very good thing if these grants were renewed.  The Minister perhaps might be able to make a stronger case if the numbers were much greater and the demands on the Exchequer correspondingly higher.  I think personally that those who would avail of these grants at present would be very few but, even so, those few should get some assistance by way of a grant.  We have undoubtedly made great strides as regards housing, but if we examine the position I think it will be agreed that much still remains to be done.  In Galway City, for instance, a number of houses have been erected by the local authority and by private individuals under the Small Dwellings Act.  The houses erected by the Galway Corporation were almost entirely given over to people removed from slum areas.  That of course is a policy with which we all agree but, at the same time, we find that the young labourer who gets married has no house available and he is compelled to go into a room for which sometimes he pays double the rent he would pay for a house.  He remains there until a tenant is removed from the slum area and then he does his best to get into the house vacated by the former slum tenant so that in due course he will be entitled to be regarded as one who should be removed from the slum area to a newly-erected house.</P>
    <P>We should endeavour to rectify a position of that kind.  To my mind the only way we can do it is by encouraging enterprise or utility societies to undertake the building of houses for people with incomes sufficient to <Col N="1686" /> enable them to pay an economic rent. It is for that reason I urge that the Minister should reintroduce the scheme under which public utility societies or private individuals received grants for the erection of houses for the accommodation of people such as I have referred to.  If we leave it to the local authorities, it will be years and years before the problem is dealt with. What we see happening in Galway must be happening on a larger scale in Dublin.  As the slums are being cleared, they are being as quickly reoccupied, and this process will go on until the housing problem is tackled vigorously instead of leaving it entirely to public bodies.  A question then arises as to the ability of the prospective tenants to pay the rent charged.</P>
    <P>I think that we could do two things at the one time in helping to solve that problem.  If we undertook the development of housing sites by means of relief schemes, employment would be provided on the one hand and eventually the cost of the house would be reduced, on the other.  If we look round our cities and towns we see a number of old derelict ruins.  I think that as an emergency measure these old buildings should be demolished and the sites cleared.  If there were any trouble in this country, invasion or an upheaval of any description, I hold that these places would be a source of great danger and great hindrance.  In cities like Galway and Dublin one sees many old ruins on the point of falling asunder.  I think that if we tackled the problem of pulling these down and clearing the sites, we would be providing much-needed employment and, at the same time, we would be preparing for rebuilding when building materials became available.  We would be giving useful work at the moment and we would be giving hope to those people who are anxiously looking forward to the time when they may have a home for themselves.</P>
    <P>Coming back to this Bill which deals principally with rural housing, I have on several occasions here urged that the question of rural housing should be a matter principally for the Land Commission. After all, the Land Commission <Col N="1687" /> is, as it were, the landlord of rural areas.  Yet we see many houses in the country which are no better than the slums in the city.  These houses are occupied by small farmers for whom the grant of £80, given by the Department of Local Government, is very little use to enable them to erect new houses, and because of the low valuation and the low value of the land they find it difficult to get a loan.  If they get a loan the repayment of it would be a heavy drain on their income, and therefore they are not anxious to undertake the liability.  In cases like that, the Land Commission should be either compelled, as a tenant in any house in an urban area would be compelled, to put such a house in order, or, at least, to make the means to do so available to the tenant.  I know one or two cases where out of society funds in consideration of the applicant's position and the number in his family, advances of from £10 to £15 were made so that an advance might be secured from the Local Government Department. I suggest that that was done to overcome a difficulty of this kind, and that the Minister or his inspector should be empowered to go with the county medical officer of health and report whether or not an applicant should receive special consideration.</P>
    <P>Bad houses have been the cause of tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, and if we are going to wipe them out in country districts we cannot do it with hard and fast rules, but if power were given to the medical officer and housing inspector to recommend, in such cases, a larger grant, or instruct the board of health to have a residence built for those people, it would meet the situation. In the case of small holders of land they find that the £80 grant is not sufficient, and as they have not the necessary means at their disposal they cannot get a house under any conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference to the extension of benefits under the Housing Acts there is one thing I wish to point out and it is that the county authorities and the board of health <Col N="1688" /> are pushing too far the question of building houses around suburban areas for workers in rural areas.  They have the benefit there of sewerage and light and other amenities of the town, but there are many handicaps.  There are rural workers living in those houses who are paying as much as 4/6, 5/6 and 6/6 a week for such facilities.</P>
      <P>They are not able to pay that rent and there are, consequently, difficulties about it.  In most cases they are prohibited from keeping either fowl or pigs.  The rural worker contributed very largely to the pig supply in this country, and that has been done away with in the neighbourhood of towns.  I know whole families of farm workers living in an urban area who do not rear a hen or a pig.  They have in some cases half-an-acre or a rood of ground that could be made available for such purposes, but is lying idle.  I think rural workers should have something after the style of the provision made in the West of Ireland where four or five families live in villages, within a short radius of each other, and where they have the social life that is so much prized.  I know that there are difficulties in the way and that some farmers do not wish to have many cottages on their land, but that could be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about repairs to houses, and in some counties particularly the local authorities are very much in arrears in that respect.  One of them, Wexford, seems to stand out on its own.  We have reports that conditions there are very bad.  I do not know who is responsible for it, but it is a matter that should be attended to.  In the allotment of new cottages power seems to be vested entirely in the county medical officer of health.  This, no doubt, relieves the members of the board of health very much, and possibly works out very satisfactorily, but while not due to abuse on the part of an official, but rather to the system, it appears that families may live in a condemned house for a considerable period, and after applying from time to time for new cottages, they find that comparative strangers have come in and got houses.  In some cases although a <Col N="1689" /> man is six months resident in a place preference is extended to him over a man waiting five or six years.  The local authorities seem to have no say in the matter.  I wonder if that is because the county medical officer of health has all to do with the appointment of a tenant.  I have complaints from some counties that men have been brought out of the towns and put into the cottages in preference to local applicants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Johnston Mr. Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amending Bill brought in by the Minister for Local Government, because I consider that it is very necessary, and there are very few points I want to make on it. I have some experience of the work of building houses under the Housing Act of 1932.  I have been chairman of a utility society since 1930, and we have built over 1,100 new houses under the 1932 Act and amending Acts.  I know that there is a limit to what we can discuss or recommend or ask for under this amending Bill, but I want to say&mdash; I have already called attention to this matter&mdash;that farmers who want to reconstruct their houses are handicapped by the fact that there is a valuation limit of £25.  A farmer with a valuation of over £25 cannot get a reconstruction grant at the present time.  I want to ask the Minister if it is possible, under this amending Bill, to increase that valuation limit.</P>
      <P>In the county that I come from, there are quite a number of farms on the mountain sides with high valuations and very poor land.  Those farmers cannot put £100 into the reconstruction of their houses, and I hope it will be possible for the Minister to increase the valuation limit.  As a matter of fact, I would recommend doing away with the valuation limit altogether in the case of reconstruction, because farmers with very high valuations will not look for reconstruction grants.  If their houses need reconstruction, they will be in a position either to carry out that work or to build new houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also another case which has come to my notice in my own county. There is one town in County Monaghan ruled by town commissioners.  A farmer who has his residence inside the borders of that town is held not to be entitled to get a grant for reconstruction or for building a new house within the borders of the town.  He must go outside the town, and build his house out on the farm.  I wonder would the Minister consider whether that provision <Col N="1691" /> can be amended?  I would very strongly urge the Minister to have amendments inserted to deal with the two matters to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I feel that it is very much justified, because in every county you have a certain section of people who did not heretofore come within the category of the agricultural worker, but what I would be particularly afraid of now is that, by the introduction of this Bill, you will have in every county what happened in County Dublin, where many of those people are already housed, and where the agricultural labourer, who has a very small wage, has to pay the self-same rent.  In Garretstown, where the agricultural wages are 33/- a week, the board of health put the same rent on those unfortunate people as on the people convenient to the city who are in receipt of £5 or £7 a week.  In my opinion, that is most unfair, and I do hope that the Minister will make some provision to ensure that those who are wholly engaged in agriculture will get some preference over people who are fortunate enough, through a trade or otherwise, to be in receipt of twice, or in many cases three times, the wages of the agricultural labourer.  I do not for a moment say any of them is receiving too much.</P>
      <P>The next point to which I should like to refer is in connection with the type of individual referred to by Senator Hawkins, that is the person whom the Land Commission does not consider sufficient security for a building grant, and who at the same time does not qualify for a house from the board of health as an agricultural worker.  You have in County Dublin, and I am sure in other counties, quite a number of those people who are not able to get sufficient security to erect a house for themselves, and there is no other body in a position to erect a house for them.  I should like if something were done to bring in that type of person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to utility societies, I should like to say to Senator Cummins&mdash;I am speaking now as one who has been chairman of a utility <Col N="1692" /> society for ten years&mdash;that we have got nothing from anybody.  As a matter of fact, we have got very poor grants, and have had certain difficulties placed in our way by other people who might have a personal interest in building houses.  I can assure Senator Cummins that at any time he can send along anybody he wishes to inspect the books, and he will find them in order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Principal Act, grants for the extension of small farmers' houses were refused in certain cases.  Quite a number of the houses were thatched, and the extensions which were erected were also thatched.  They built an additional room on to the house and thatched it in the same way as the main portion of the building.  The whole building turned out very symmetrical, but when the inspector came along he deemed that, because the extension was not of stone, slate and tile, the grant could not be awarded.  I think that is very irregular, because, when the main portion of the house is thatched, if you add on a room which is roofed with slate or tile, the whole thing would be a most ridiculous structure.  In any case, those people were refused the grant.  I think the Minister's predecessor at one time promised that the matter would be looked into, but I do not know whether or not that has been done.  I would ask the Minister to look into it now, and, if it is decided to give the grants in such cases, I think it should be made retrospective.  The matter should be looked into even now, because the refusal of those grants was a great injustice.</P>

      <P>Although the shadow of the emergency lies across this Bill, as we are reminded in Section 3, still it is a very helpful Bill and one in which every woman should be interested.  The Minister has reminded us that it is of limited scope but, no matter how limited its scope, it is a step in the right direction.  We all welcome the extension of the facilities accorded to private individuals and to public utility societies to assist in the <Col N="1693" /> solution of the housing problem.  That is the root of our social well-being.  If you have not houses, as Senator Hawkins reminds us, it is very difficult for young people to marry.  It is very important that houses should be provided capable of accommodating a family under decent conditions and at such a price that people will be able to pay for them.  It is regrettable&mdash; this is the point which I wish particularly to make&mdash;that persons who have got public grants for the building of houses have set these houses at exorbitant rents, rents that make a heavy demand on tenants.  I know several instances of these excessive house-rents. When public grants are given for the building of houses, conditions should be attached to them which would prevent public money from being used by the recipients for profiteering from the necessities of their poorer neighbours.  There are many things which I should like to discuss in connection with the construction and reconstruction of houses, but they would not be germane to this Bill. Therefore, I refrain from discussing them.  I hope we shall have an opportunity later of discussing housing generally.</P>

      <P>A good deal has been done since the passing of the 1932 Act to improve housing conditions, but there are still a great many slums in town and country.  In some of the small towns, the slums are, at least, as bad as, if not worse than, those in the big cities.  We have done a good deal to improve the conditions of the slum dwellers in the urban area to which I belong and I regret that the Minister has not seen his way&mdash;perhaps he would&mdash;to increase the amount on which the two-thirds subsidy is payable from £350 to about £400.  The cost of building has gone up considerably since the war, but the houses must be built.  It will be impossible in urban areas to let houses at a fair rent if all the cost between £350 and the present cost of building has to be met by the council.  Building is now costing £50 a house, at least, more than it did.  If the two-thirds grant were given up to £400, it would improve the position in <Col N="1694" /> most urban areas.  A great many of the urban district councils did not put the Housing of the Working Classes Act into operation, but we did. Unfortunately, some of the people who reconstructed their houses under that Act and who, through a clerical error, were not notified by the clerk of the council at the time, were deprived of the grant.  It was no fault of theirs and, perhaps, it was no fault of the clerk.  Probably, he had not got a copy of the Act at the time.  If the Minister could see his way to change that clause in the Act, he would be doing justice to these people.  I appeal to him to increase the amount on which the two-thirds subsidy is payable at present from £350 to £400.</P>

      <P>The Preamble to the Bill says that it is designed to &ldquo;amend and extend&rdquo; legislation relating to housing.  I think that I am relevant in suggesting that the whole of our policy of housing, particularly in the agricultural districts, has been greatly spoiled by the fact that, for financial and political reasons&mdash;to get so many houses built at the minimum cost&mdash;the three-room house has been the stock article.  From the point of view of social betterment, I think that there is nobody here who does not realise the results of this policy.  You have your kitchen, sleeping room and one spare room.  You have a big family of boys and girls and, as they grow up, it means discomfort for the parents and want of social uplift, if I may so describe it, for the children.  The girls are brought into the room of the father and mother or the boys and the father sleep together in one room and the girls and the mother in another.  That is not right.  It never has been right.  When this housing campaign was initiated&mdash; when Deputy Mulcahy was Minister for Local Government&mdash;I raised this question.  I recollect well pressing the matter.  It was a question of the finances available at the time.  If the Minister cares to look into the matter he may find that this Bill gives him an opportunity to avoid the perpetuation of what I consider is a state of social existence which should not be permitted <Col N="1695" /> longer than is absolutely necessary.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out, the scope of this Bill is very limited.  It is intended mainly to extend for another year the time-limit originally fixed by the Principal Act for the building and reconstruction of houses in respect of which grants could be given to private persons or public utility societies.  I could not do justice to all the points raised here without going into a very full review of the housing situation and the difficulties which confront us. There are, however, one or two points which I should make clear, because they may, if allowed to go uncorrected, lead to misunderstandings which might result in loss and hardship to the persons concerned.  Senator Hawkins seemed to gather from what I said that Section 4 of this Bill enlarges the definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; so as to include shopkeepers living in agricultural districts. The contrary is the fact.  It does not so enlarge the definition.  It is intended only to validate what has already been done under a misinterpretation of the statutory definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo;.  It was found, on examination made at the instance of the Committee of Public Accounts, that grants made to shopkeepers under the Labourers Acts were <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
      <P>It has become necessary to introduce Section 4, in order to relieve persons to whom those grants were made, and to relieve persons who had reconstructed their houses upon an undertaking that grants would be made and to validate what has already been done owing to misinterpretation of the law.  I would like to make it very clear that people cannot proceed on the assumption that shopkeepers in rural areas reconstructing their houses, and involving themselves in expenses will get a grant under the Labourers Acts.  They will not.  The definition does not include shopkeepers, whether those shopkeepers employ only members of their own families or whether they employ persons outside their own family circles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1696" /> I should like to deal with the point made by Senator Honan who stated that persons who had enlarged their dwellings by building an additional room and who, to conform with the general structure of the house, had roofed the extension with thatch, were excluded from the benefit of the reconstruction grants.  Again, that is done under statutory authority, and I have no power under this Act to amend it, and I doubt whether I would find it possible to approach the Minister for Finance, even in normal circumstances, for his agreement to the promotion of legislation making it permissible to give grants in relation to thatched houses.</P>
    <P>The general view of the Department is that, from the point of view of public health, thatched houses should not become general again throughout the country, and whether that is a well-founded view or not, it is, at any rate, the principle upon which we have been proceeding.  It must be remembered that one of the main purposes of the housing programme has been to improve public health and the health of the individual citizens by providing them with dwellings which are generally regarded as being sanitary, and, at any rate, a preventive against the spread of disease. I am afraid&mdash;again I am speaking in this matter as a layman&mdash;that the prevailing medical opinion is that a thatched roof dwelling is not the best. I am not saying that in particular circumstances, where the thatch is well maintained, and the house is properly looked after, it does not make a sanitary roof but, we have to look, not at particular cases, but at the general situation, and to base our opinions upon facts derived from general experience.</P>
    <P>A number of other matters were argued by Senators but, there, in relation to those I have to say this, that at the present moment, due to a variety of reasons, the principal of which is that supplies of building material available are strictly limited and have, in fact, been mainly appropriated for national uses&mdash;purposes of defence and ancillary purposes &mdash; it would not be possible to go ahead with a large-scale <Col N="1697" /> housing drive.  We have also to bear in mind in that connection that the Exchequer is passing through a very difficult time.  The demands which are made on it are numerous, and the demands made on the taxpayer to keep the public purse filled are also very heavy.  It is very unlikely therefore that the Minister for Finance, whose consent to public expenditure is an essential prerequisite to the introduction of a Bill, would agree that I should in any way amplify or extend the very wide provisions of the existing housing code.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are many things it would be desirable to do, but we cannot, in that connection, leave out of account the fact that for all the houses that have been built during the past ten years the burden is now falling with increasing weight every year upon the Exchequer.  This year, under that subhead, Subsidies to Local Authorities for Housing Grants, the Estimate for my Department amounts to over £600,000 more than the whole cost of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, when the then Minister for Local Government and Public Health, the present Minister for Finance, took over that Department ten years ago, and these liabilities, even without the additional houses, are going to increase from year to year.  In addition, we have to provide for many other social services, for the reconstruction of our schools, the maintenance of our hospitals, and make provision to deal with all these diseases which undoubtedly may be fostered and fed by existing housing conditions, but which, at the same time, seem to be not entirely conditioned by these things, and which affect all sections of the population alike, and for the proper treatment of which demands are beginning to be made upon us in increasing numbers, to an increasing extent.</P>
    <P>All these matters have to be attended to.  We have done a great deal for housing.  When times are more propitious, we will do still more, but we must remember that this is only one of a number of demands for social improvement and social amelioration that have to be considered, <Col N="1698" /> and that the public purse and the taxpayers' and the ratepayers' ability to meet all these demands is strictly limited.  It is much more limited now than it was in 1938, and I, personally, hold the opinion, whether well-founded or not, that when this war is ended and peace is restored, our financial and economic ability to deal with these matters may be still further diminished.  Accordingly I have to look at these things in that light.  It may, perhaps, be that these apprehensions of mine will turn out to have been not well-founded, but still I think these are doubts which I think must be present in the minds of all of us and I am suggesting this to all our people: it would be better if we really tried to realise that probably all the things we think desirable and all the social ideals we wish to realise may be very much more difficult in the future than they have been in the past.  However, I suppose when the future comes we will know better the extent of our resources, and we will be able to shape our policies accordingly.</P>

      <P>This Pensions Order is necessary in order to make provision for the case of a man who was dismissed from the Dublin Metropolitan Gárda in 1925.  He was out of the service for three or four months and then reinstated.  He has <Col N="1700" /> now retired and the existing Pensions Orders do not cover a case of that kind.  This is introduced to ensure that he will be entitled to a pension for his actual service, that is, for his service before he was dismissed and after he was reinstated.  There may be one or two other cases like this, but they will not arise until the time comes for the men to retire.</P>
