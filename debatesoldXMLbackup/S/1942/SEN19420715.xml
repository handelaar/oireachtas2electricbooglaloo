      <P>I should like to repeat on the Final Stage of the Bill very briefly what I said on the Second Stage that the principle of the Bill is a good one, in so far as it is a principle of arranging a long-deferred superannuation scheme for the employees of the Electricity Supply Board and in so far as it embraces the manual workers in that scheme.  In other respects, the Bill is not so good.  It departs from the principle of the 1927 Act, the aim of which was to keep the Electricity Supply Board and its operations at arm's length from the Government and the two Houses of the Oireachtas. Whether the Minister desires it or not he has in this Bill power not only to approve of a scheme of superannuation submitted by the board, but power which is tantamount to allowing himself to frame a new scheme and put it into operation.  It may very well be that he does not intend to do that. People never intend to do the wrong thing, but nevertheless they sometimes do it.  That is the power now assumed by the Minister.  It is, I think, an extraordinary thing considering the immense power the board enjoys in other directions.  This is an addition to the powers of the Executive, whose powers are being constantly added to.  In other respects the Bill has certain provisions with regard to the right of the manual workers to strike and the penalties imposed on them if they do strike.  I think the problem which is there to be dealt with should be faced and dealt with as a whole, taking into consideration its repercussions in other directions.  The Minister chose, as he told us himself, to deal with them piecemeal in this Bill.  That, I think, is not a sound scheme and to that extent the Bill is defective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to repeat what I said in the course of the discussions on the earlier Stages of the Bill on the points referred to now by Senator Hayes.  It is true that the Bill as framed brings in the Government to the extent of requiring Government approval of the scheme prepared by the board for the purpose of establishing superannuation funds for the benefit of their employees.  I <Col N="1703" /> explained before why, for reasons of public policy, it was considered desirable to do so.  It is not considered necessary or desirable to interfere with the board in the carrying out of its functions relating to the generation, transmission or sale of electricity, but where action taken by the board might have repercussions in other directions it is considered desirable that the Government should have powers of supervision over what they do.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second point raised by Senator Hayes, I explained at length on another Stage the reasons why the Government thought it was desirable to propose in this Bill to provide inducements to workers employed by the Electricity Supply Board not to take strike action for the purpose of securing redress of any grievances they have, or any they may feel they have.  It was felt, too, that in the case of an organisation such as this, performing essential functions for the country as a whole, such inducements should exist, particularly if other, and more effective, methods of securing redress of these grievances are provided as this Bill proposes to provide.  While it may be that there are often good arguments in favour of doing nothing until one can do everything, I think it would be unwise to delay taking action in the case of the employees of the Electricity Supply Board until we had a general scheme for dealing with labour disputes in all the public services, and I cannot agree that it is inopportunte to take action in the case of the Electricity Supply Board on this occasion.</P>

      <P>This is a renewal Bill.  When the Bill was first brought before the Dáil it <Col N="1704" /> was intended to have it a permanent measure, but the Labour Party objected; consequently we bring it in for renewal every year.  The Bill enables the State to take possession of any goods belonging to illegal organisations which are found in raids, and provision is made for an appeal to the courts in the case of any question as to whether the goods are wrongfully taken or not.  Last year very little was taken, but since the Act was passed one sum of $20,000 was forfeited, one sum of £100 and one sum of £1,000.  Smaller sums, together with eight motor cars and miscellaneous articles, including four wireless sets and equipment, a duplicating machine and typewriters, were also taken.  In no case was there any application made to the High Court.  Apparently, no one from whom we took them thought that they would be able to prove their right to hold them, and consequently we had no appeal at all.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second time&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is being proceeded with merely as a precautionary measure.  The main purpose is to enable the Minister for Local Government, if circumstances compel him, to postpone the holding of the local elections until September, 1943.  I said &ldquo;if circumstances compel him&rdquo;, because it has already been decided to hold the local elections, probably either on August 12th or August 19th.  The precise date has not yet definitely been fixed, but I may say for the information of the House and of the country at large, the probabilities now are that the elections will be held on the 19th rather than on 12th August.  If the elections are <Col N="1705" /> held, the only section of the Bill likely to be effective will be Section 5, which is necessary, first of all, to validate the proceedings which have already taken place at meetings of local authorities held between June 22nd and the 1st July last, and secondly, to make provision for the first quarterly meetings which must be held after the local elections, and at which the elections of lord mayors, mayors and chairmen of county councils will have to be proceeded with afresh.  Section 6 gives the Minister power to remove any difficulties which may arise by reason of the postponement of the local elections, but it has been decided to hold the elections and the probability is that it will not be necessary to avail of the powers in Section 6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Conditions now are very peculiar.  Since the decision has been taken to hold the local elections, the situation has completely changed.  I suppose we may take it that legislation which the House already has passed&mdash; the Managerial Bill&mdash;will come into operation immediately the new bodies are called together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it they will be for some short time functioning with the powers which exist at present.  What the people are concerned about is that, as far as one could read about the debate on the Second Stage, one got the impression from what the Minister said that it was hoped that we were going to have local elections for the purpose of getting administrators of the highest possible character.  The hope also was expressed that this would be achieved without any set Party effort.  It would be as well that the country should know at once where it stands in this, because, apparently from a statement which appeared in yesterday's paper, we gather that the political organisation of the Government Party has intimated that it is their view that local units of the organisation can select candidates, and we presume, rightly or wrongly, that these candidates would be selected as representative of the organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is going to be the position, <Col N="1706" /> it ought to be clarified at once.  From my contact with local opinion, I feel that while on the whole most of our administrators have made a very good effort to raise the standard of local administration, there have been failures here and there.  The greatest failures have occurred in those counties or areas where the Party ticket system was developed to an extreme extent. We have a peculiar situation to-day. It is seven or eight years since the last elections, and we have a number of representatives on local authorities who have been working together for such a considerable period in harmony that the old lines of political division have, to a great extent, broken down. Men have come to recognise that political divisions are a hindrance rather than a help in local affairs and that the most effective administration is where the Party point of view can be left outside the council chamber and decisions taken on the merits of each case.  Representatives of the different political Parties have accepted that position and now realise the worth of it.  If we are going back again to contesting elections on Party lines, we are going back to the old position.  I do not know whether the Minister realises that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am really wondering at is how we can discuss the actions of political organisations here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into a discussion on it, but I took it that the Minister expressed a desire to get away from the old position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed the desire that the elections would be fought calmly and that there would be no bitterness or factiousness as a result of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I misunderstood the Minister.  It is rather a different matter if we go on to try to organise political Parties and tell them to take whatever action they like.  If the aim of the Government is to get the most competent administrators into local authorities, it is not going to be achieved by any encouragement <Col N="1707" /> to candidates on the part of the Government to run on a political ticket.</P>
      <P>I think it is going to have a disturbing effect on local conditions from the aspect of our internal unity&mdash;a very important aspect.  I had the feeling that we were going to have from the Minister, and those collaborating with him, some form of appeal to the citizens to realise that there was an obligation placed upon them to select candidates regardless of Party affiliations, or any other consideration, except their competence to run the affairs of the local authority, county council, urban council, or municipal body.  If we are going back to the old system, I think it would be a retrograde step in our present conditions. No matter what you may try to do to mollify political influences, if you disturb men's minds in times like these, you cannot avoid the consequences of Party contests.  I am aware that a number of people are quite convinced that this decision to hold local elections is in the nature of a try-out for a general election.  That may not be anything like the fact, but, nevertheless, it is very unfortunate in present conditions that the Minister himself, especially charged with the great responsibility of local government, where the highest possible standard of administration should be aimed at by every public man, should find himself handicapped, as I think he must be, by what apparently is the decision of the Party with which he is associated, that candidates must be elected and the campaign run on Party lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to continue on that line if it is out of order to do so.  I merely raised the question because I felt, after the Minister's statement in the Dáil, that he was in earnest and concerned that we would get the best people into the local bodies.  I am prepared to concede that that is the Minister's desire.  Certainly, the people desire it themselves, and they feel that the local services can be run more efficiently if Party divisions are avoided.  This Bill provides for postponement of the elections under certain circumstances, but I think that we must admit that except for Section 5, a great deal of it is out of order.  Perhaps it is going to be healthy for our local affairs if we have our people stirred up and made to realise that it is their responsibility and obligation to take a close interest in the management of their local affairs.  I do not mean that there are great signs of activity now, or any degree of considerable concern, and I feel that a great deal of the legislation passed already has been a factor in that.  I had hoped that by raising the question I would have been able to get clarification of the situation, but if I am not in order in expecting it from the Minister, I have to be satisfied in accepting what he said.</P>

      <P>During the past couple of years, a considerable number of houses have been built in the suburbs in the City of Dublin. Some of them are very far out in the suburbs&mdash;beyond the Deaf and Dumb Institute at Cabra, in the North, and as far as the Half-Way House in Crumlin, in the South.  As can be easily understood, it would be necessary to have some transport to bring those people to the polling booths which are situated in the districts in which they originally lived.  It is evident from the newspaper report I have read, whether Senator Baxter has seen it or not, that it would be necessary to have some transport, but, apparently, we are not going to have any transport.  This will make it very awkward for candidates in the elections. There is one other point: paper is now very scarce, and I do not know what can be done about the supply of polling cards and printed literature. That I think will also mean a very awkward situation for those who are contesting the elections.  At a Dublin Corporation meeting very recently, when this question of the elections was discussed, I expressed the view that the elections should be held, in the hope of getting experienced and independent-minded candidates for election and in the hope that they would be elected.  I am not finding any fault with the holding of the elections, but with the length of time given.  I think it is too short.  It will take at least a week before any candidate can be selected, and that will leave only about three weeks for the preparation of literature, polling cards, and all the other things essential for the holding of an election.  Those are the complaints that I am making.  As I said, I did not intend to introduce anything contentious, but I understood that Senator Baxter did make some reference to whoever would select the candidates, and I should like to know <Col N="1710" /> who that will be.  As I see the situation, it is quite possible that we will have a multiplicity of candidates.  That is my own opinion; I have not been speaking to anybody on the matter.  I do not know who the candidates will be, but in my opinion it will be a case of everybody nominating a candidate of his own, and it is quite possible that there will be a very large number of candidates.  That is all I wish to say on the matter, but I am afraid it will be a very awkward election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I asked was this: a good many people had hoped&mdash; this being a very busy season of the year&mdash;that the elections would be held on 15th August, which is a holiday.  If the elections are held on an ordinary week-day there may be many people who will not be able to leave their work in order to record their votes.  On 15th August they will have to attend to their religious duties, and I think that would be a suitable date on which to hold the elections.  If there is a good reason why that date should not be chosen, I suppose the Minister will be able to explain it.  I do not want to be accused of being out of order again, but I should just like to refer to one matter.  Down the country, it is found that the very best candidates are not usually the most ambitious, and unless there is somebody or some organisation to request those people to go forward as candidates, there will probably be no candidates at all.  I think there is nothing whatsoever wrong with having it either on Party or general lines, as long as you have somebody to request the best candidates to go forward.  Otherwise, I think that, down the country, you will not have sufficient candidates to fill the posts.  The elections need not, and I am sure they will not, be run in any contentious way, but we should make an effort to secure the best candidates no matter to what Party they belong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the last speaker in appealing to the Minister to choose 15th August as the date of the elections.  It is generally observed as a holiday and, provided the Church has no objection, I think that day would be very convenient for the public generally.  The polling booths are usually situated near the churches, and when the people go there to discharge their religious obligations they can also discharge their obligations to the State without any inconvenience to themselves.  At least 90 per cent. of the people will be going to some church on that day and, therefore, it will be no inconvenience to them to record their votes.  Otherwise, I am afraid we will have a rather unsatisfactory poll.  The working people generally observe 15th August as a holiday.  This is a very busy season of the year and, on an ordinary working day, the people would be slow to leave their work and travel a distance of three or four miles to record their votes.  I think that matter should be seriously considered, provided the Church has no objection.  Elections have already been held on Church holidays, and I do not think any objection was raised from any quarter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the only case for this Bill is that it is not intended to carry the Bill out and, as far as I am concerned, that is the only reason why I am in favour of it.  I am glad the Minister has decided to hold the local elections.  I have no sympathy at all with the point of view that, because there is an emergency, we should not carry on our business and attempt to carry it on properly.  Also I have no sympathy with the attitude that people cannot express different points of view and at the same time be perfectly loyal to their country and prepared to act together in an emergency.  I believe it would be a tragedy if the various Parliamentary Parties endeavoured completely to control local affairs; I think it would be a tragedy if all local affairs were to be fought on similar issues to Parliamentary affairs because I think Parliamentary business is, and ought to be, different to a great extent from local affairs.  As far as I am concerned, I think it is a <Col N="1712" /> healthy thing and a wise thing that the elections are going to be held, and for that reason I am in favour of the Bill because the Minister says he is not going to carry it out unless he is more or less forced to do so.  I do not know what he thinks might force him to do so; I presume that, in the present completely abnormal circumstances, he wants to have the powers but has no intention at present of postponing the elections.  In that case, I see no objection to giving him the precautionary powers provided in the Bill.  If it were proposed to postpone the local elections for another year or two I would vote against the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Johnston Mr. Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a very good thing that these elections are being held.  I have been a member of local bodies for a number of years and take a very great interest in them, and the holding of the elections will induce the people generally to take an interest in local administration.  With regard to Senator Baxter's statement about interference by the different political Parties, I do not think it is right that they should interfere in local elections to any very great extent, but I do not think the political Parties should be ruled out altogether.  I submit to you, Sir, and to the House that the best local administration from 1899 up to the present day was the result of the elections held on a purely political ticket in 1920.  There never was a better local administration to my mind since it was first initiated in 1899.  But I do not think it is right that the political Parties should select people merely because they belong to a certain Party, and irrespective of their suitability.  A person belonging to any particular Party may be a very suitable candidate, and his suitability should be considered irrespective of Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the date of the elections, I have read some of the discussions in the Dáil and have discussed the matter with people in my own area, and a number of them are very strongly in favour of holding the elections on 15th August.  I do not think they would care to have that established as a precedent, but it would be a great advantage at the present time.  As <Col N="1713" /> Senator Cummins has pointed out, most of the polling stations are convenient to the churches, particularly in the rural areas, so that the people who are attending Mass on that day will be able to record their votes.  If the elections are held on a week-day the people will find it difficult to leave their work.  If the Church has no objection to the holding of the elections on that day, I would be very much in favour of it.</P>

      <P>As Senator Douglas has indicated, the Bill is good not so much for what it contains as for what the Minister has taken occasion to say. That is not contained in the Bill at all. What is really being supported is not a Bill to postpone the elections, but a Bill to hold the local elections on a date provisionally mentioned by the Minister.  I am entirely in agreement with the Minister that the elections should be held.  I read the Minister's speech in the Dáil and I had great difficulty in ascertaining where he was going but, eventually, he agreed with an amendment put down to the effect that the elections should be held.  We ought to be sufficiently grown up and sufficiently strong in our national and public health to be able to hold local elections without getting abusive of one another or in any way hampering such co-operation as there is locally in matters arising out of the emergency. I took occasion to complain here before of the constant use of the word &ldquo;politics&rdquo; as if it were a dirty, low thing, of which people ought to be ashamed.  Properly understood, I think that it merely means interest in matters concerning the State.  Local bodies, in so far as they do local work, are engaged in politics.  Their work need not be of the same kind&mdash;of its nature, it is not&mdash;as the work done here and in the Dáil and the lines of demarcation should not be the same, but I think it is true to say that, when people are elected to local bodies on political lines, they do succeed in avoiding the political differences which <Col N="1714" /> exist at the top in the doing of their local work.</P>
      <P>The last Senator alluded to the good local government bodies we got in 1920.  I think that he confused the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;national&rdquo;.  The councils elected in 1920 were elected on a great wave of national enthusiasm and, in fact, did not belong to separate political Parties at all.  There is hardly any analogy between that period and the present time.  While it would be undesirable for political Parties to seek to monopolise representation, they may have a particular rôle to play.  What was asked in the Dáil and what, I think, we should ask is that the elections should be conducted with a realisation of their importance, with a desire to get the best people elected and with no desire to create trouble or rowing. The difficulty is, I think, that when people stand up on a platform they do not make the type of speech which they intended to make.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health is, himself, a notorious example in that respect.  If the Minister would exercise a self-denying ordinance and take no part in the elections, the national good might be served by the holding of the elections.</P>

      <P>I suppose I ought to address myself to the issues outside the Bill which have been raised, and only refer to the Bill to confirm Senator Douglas's expectation, that I shall not avail myself of the powers contained in it unless I am compelled by exceptional or abnormal circumstances to do so.  I should like to say, emphatically, that that is my intention.  I have no prophetic vision, and I do not know what circumstances may arise in the future, but unless we have some sort of national catastrophe, the country may take it that the elections will be held on either the 12th or 19th August.  In that connection, Senator Healy suggested that we were not allowing people sufficient time.  He referred, particularly, to the position in Dublin.  These elections will be held upon the register which came into force on 1st June last, and the qualifying date for that register ended in November, 1941, so that most of those <Col N="1715" /> who will vote at the elections will appear on the register as voters in respect of the premises in which they are now living.  Accordingly, I think that the difficulties the Senator anticipated, by reason of the fact that there has been a considerable change over the past five or six years in the places of habitation of voters in the City of Dublin, need not be feared.  In addition, we have asked the local authorities to bear in mind the difficulties which will be placed in the way of voters owing to restricted transport facilities, and to compensate for that by the provision of additional polling places.</P>
      <P>May I briefly touch on the issue raised by Senator Baxter to say that he read more into my statement in the Dáil than an examination of the text would warrant.  I did not ask that parties, groups or associations should abstain from participation in these elections.  I think that that would be an unwarranted encroachment on the rights of association and the liberty to combine given our people under the Constitution.  I did say that I hoped it would be possible for all parties to make an appeal to the electorate to conduct these elections calmly and with full advertence to the issues involved, to the importance of the functions which might fall upon members of the local authorities in future, and to the important part which these local authorities play in our national and civic life.  I went further and said that an appeal might be made to those who were considering the putting forward of candidates in the elections to nominate persons who would have all the qualifications of personality and character which, in my view, are required for membership of local authorities. We want honest, energetic men, and men of capacity and vision on these boards.  I hope that the efforts of those who have a voice in the selection of candidates, or, subsequently, in the election of candidates will be directed to getting the right type of men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see that, in connection with these elections, any acute political <Col N="1716" /> issues will arise.  In so far as Parties or organisations may concern themselves with the elections, the results, from the point of view of these Parties or organisations, will be satisfactory according as the proper type of candidate is selected and it is to be hoped that the people will pay more regard to the character and personal qualifications of the candidates than to the political ticket on which they stand.  At the same time, that does not suggest that, if groups or organisations feel they have members particularly worthy or suitable for membership of public authorities, and if they feel it desirable to do so, they are not to put them forward.  So far as the organisation of which I am a member is concerned, I gather that the National Executive decided in that regard to leave it free to members and branches of the organisation to put forward and support candidates or not as they, in their local wisdom, thought best.  I gather that that is the view of other organisations as well.</P>
    <P>Provided that the spirit of common citizenship which has animated all Parties in the State in recent years&mdash; I do not fix September, 1939, as the critical date&mdash;is maintained throughout the country, I do not think there will be any of the Party bitterness or bitterness amongst neighbours which is the one thing that people fear and deprecate in the holding of public elections for any office.  With regard to the suggestion that the elections be held on August 15th, I may say that, unfortunately, difficulties have been encountered in that regard and, in deference to the views of others, I will not be able to fix the elections for that date.  I do not think there is anything else I might usefully say in regard to the points raised in the debate, but I may add that it is not likely on this occasion at any rate that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health will participate in the elections or be guilty of those platform indiscretions to which Senator Hayes so feelingly and sympathetically referred.  I hope that the elections will be conducted in the spirit in <Col N="1717" /> which this Bill was debated in the Dáil, and in the spirit in which the elections have been referred to to-day. If the elections are carried through in that way, I have no doubt that the results will be very satisfactory, from the point of view of all Parties in the State and from the point of view of the State, which is above all Parties.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a Select Committee, consisting of nine members, to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, be appointed to consider the method of election of the forty-three panel members of Seanad Eireann, and to make recommendations as to any legislative changes they consider necessary in the present system;</P>
      <P>That the quorum of the Committee be five.</P>
      <P>I am sure we all regret that it is not possible for the Taoiseach to be here, as we are all anxious to hear his views on the present system of nominating and electing the panel members of the Seanad, particularly as many of us believe that the whole plan was, strictly speaking, his own creation.  I know it is a difficult job to produce a plan which would give complete satisfaction to everybody.  Many plans have been tried out since 1922, and none of them seemed to give complete satisfaction. First of all, we had 30 members nominated by the then President of the State and 30 nominated and elected by the Dáil.  Of the 30 members nominated by the President, 15 were elected to hold office for 12 years and the remaining 15 for six years.  Of the 30 members elected by the Dáil, 15 held office for nine and the other 15 for three years.  We then had Senators elected by a special register of the people of the Twenty-Six Counties, which was to be the permanent form of election; but that plan proved so unsatisfactory that it was abandoned after one trial.  The next plan was one whereby members were elected by the Dáil and Seanad.  Now we have the fourth plan, which everyone knows about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was agreed generally that the first plan produced the most representative Seanad, and that the second plan proved too expensive and most unsatisfactory; I think it was admitted that the third plan was the most <Col N="1719" /> acceptable, while the present plan, most people admit, is the worst of all. It has pleased nobody.  Even the Taoiseach himself is, I believe, disappointed in its results.  Many people complain that the Seanad, as at present constituted, is only a replica of the Dáil, that the panels are a failure, that the nominations and elections are too much on party lines, that a candidate not taken up by some political party has as much chance of being elected as a camel has of passing through the eye of a needle.</P>
    <P>I believe that a Select Committee of the Seanad could devise a plan to rectify those faults in the present system.  We are all anxious to have the most representative people in the different vocations elected to their respective panels.  The form of election does not matter so much as the selection and nomination of the candidates. I am perfectly convinced that some form of selection board, to examine the qualifications of the candidates for the different panels, should be set up.  I am sure that every responsible member of any political Party would be glad to be relieved of the responsibility of nominating Senators.</P>
    <P>I am only concerned with the panel members and I am interested particularly in the agricultural panel.  I should like to say that I have no fault to find with the personnel of that panel.  My complaint is that they are indifferent to matters vital to the best interests of agriculture.  I have tried on two or three occasions to get members of that panel to meet to discuss important agricultural problems, but I could not on any occasion get more than three or four members to attend the meeting.  The majority of the members have no independence and are too subservient to the wishes of the Government. It is a matter which we should try to rectify and something should be done to make Senators more independent of the Government of the day.</P>

      <P>But they are not the majority.  I think that object could best be achieved by having all Senators elected for a definite number of years except the 11 nominated by the Taoiseach.  I think that those should go out at a general election.  I do not want to discuss now any plan for nominating and electing the Seanad as I think it is better that that question should be left to the Select Committee which the motion proposes to set up. We have still in this House many members who were elected to the first Seanad and who have been elected by the forms of election which have been adopted since then.  I am sure, from their experience, these Senators are as well qualified to devise a plan for electing a Seanad as any commission which could be set up.  In any case the recommendations of the committee which I suggest would be useful to the Government in considering the report of the Vocational Commission or any other plan for electing a new Seanad, for I am convinced that there is going to be some alteration in the present method of selection or election of members of the Seanad before the next Seanad is appointed.  For that reason, we should try to put our own house in order and get members to say what we think should be the best form of nominating and electing Senators.</P>

      <P>I have always been an optimist, and I hope somebody will tell the Senator what he thinks of this attack which was directed not so much against this side of the House as against the other.  I think the other side of the House will resent his statement. The suggestion that the third plan pleased nobody is, I think, an uncalled for statement to make.  I think that any system which would be put forward would have its faults, but, generally speaking, I think that this House is as representative as any House which could be got under any other system.  It may have its weaknesses here and there, but its good points far outweigh its bad ones.  With regard to the various difficulties which Senator Counihan suggested he experienced in getting the various groups or panels to meet, so far as I remember any time the agricultural panel was called together, I think there was a reasonably good attendance.  We discussed various matters from time to time, and on every occasion there was a reasonably good attendance, and a very lively discussion on the matters which came up for consideration.  With regard to the motion itself, I am opposed to it for various reasons, in fact for several reasons which I had not thought of until Senator Counihan spoke.</P>
      <P>The critical part of the Bill to regulate Seanad Elections is the provision it makes with respect to nominations. In the Act of 1937, that responsibility is divided between the nominating bodies and the members of Dáil Eireann, although in each case the candidate must have the qualifications required by the Constitution and by law.  It would require a convincing argument to satisfy me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an ordinary typewritten document.  It would require a convincing argument to satisfy me that the division of responsibility for nominations was not a wise one.  It might not be desirable that the Dáil should have the power to nominate the entire panel membership, and the same remarks apply equally to the nominating bodies although the candidates nominated may have all the qualifications required.  There is room for more than one opinion as to the qualities, apart from qualifications, which make a good member of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obvious defect in Senator Counihan's proposal is the fact that the committee, if constituted, would have no powers.  How are they going to take evidence?  They cannot insist on the attendance of witnesses, and any decisions they might come to would represent merely the opinions of such persons as would choose to give evidence.  Before departing from the existing system for giving effect to the Constitution, it is reasonable to expect that there should be clear evidence that the system has failed by reason of inherent defects.  This Select Committee is not in the nature of a commission of inquiry.  It is merely to consider the method of election.  That presumably does not mean alternative methods of election; there have been many alternatives suggested from time to time&mdash;all of them with very obvious defects.  Before the committee can prove that legislative changes are necessary, they surely must have evidence on which to arrive at a conclusion that a change is necessary. How is it proposed that the committee should proceed to get the basis for <Col N="1723" /> a recommendation for legislative changes?  What that evidence is cannot be forecasted.  The Seanad has no voice in its constitution, since it was not in being at the passing of the Act. Possibly it may be advanced that the arrangement whereby the Dáil nominates persons on sub-panels should be of a transitional nature and that the time has come to recast that portion of the Act.  Direct representation by representative functional or organisational bodies was contemplated, but I think was abandoned.</P>
    <P>In the Second Reading speech the Taoiseach stated as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we should become organised in that way in the future there is no provision in the Constitution so that a measure such as we are now proposing could be amended to allow representative functional or organisational bodies when formed to elect their members directly on to the Seanad and reduce by a corresponding number those elected on the panel system.  We are not organised in that way and in the main, I think, there are no statutory bodies to which we could hand over the power and the right to elect members directly on the Seanad.  Consequently, we have to try to get this functional Seanad by an indirect method,&rdquo; etc.</P>
    <P>The conditions have not since changed except to the extent that in the meantime a Commission on Vocational Organisation has been set up.  Until the commission has presented a report it would be wrong to set up any commission to attempt to effect changes in the constitution of the Seanad.  It is, therefore, entirely premature to suggest that the system of the constitution of the Seanad as laid down in the Act of 1937 should be recast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The document which was read by Senator Quirke, and which he read so quickly that I could never quite get its full import, sounds to me very much like a document which would be prepared by a civil servant.  I do not really mind that, but I think we should have been told what view it represented.  In the <Col N="1724" /> absence of that, I will give you my own point of view.  I think this talk about vocational representation in this country has been extraordinarily misunderstood and garbled in every way, and I think that one of the worst things introducing that effect has been the constitution of the Seanad. What I understand by a desirable form of vocational body is this&mdash;and such a form of body has a certain recommendation to us from very important documents emanating from the Pope&mdash;in <i>Quadragessimo Anno</i> there is very definite reference implying approval of something in the form of a vocational council.  Senators will remember that the Pope then goes on to point out, with regard to an individual case, what seems to me to be definite disapproval.  He says that many people think that the form he had referred to was considered as a further aggrandisement of the State, further State imperialism, extending beyond the proper sphere of parliamentary government.  My idea is that it would be a good thing to have a vocational council, but I cannot think of a vocational council as otherwise than bad if it is the direct imposition by the Government on society of that council.</P>
      <P>Various very important documents have indicated that under the State there should be associations related to vocational activities or the productive activities of the people.  It has been indicated that these organisations should, themselves, be representative of two types, namely, the workers and the employers.  In that regard we see that our trade unions as we have them here are not the type of vocational organisation that we would aspire to. If you had every productive activity in this country organised within itself&mdash; organisations of workers such as trade unions and organisations of employers &mdash;we would still not have reached the point where we would have the means for producing a proper vocational council, because as between workers and employers there should be a corporation which would be representative of both of them, and it should be from such a body that the representation should come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> Another thing that seems to me to be important is that if you have a certain number of productive activities in the country so organised, but not all of them, the country is still not ready for what I conceive to be an appropriate vocational council.  One of the recommendations of such a vocational council is that during a period of historical movement the tendency has always been in the one direction, a most undesirable direction, and that is of the State constantly enlarging its sphere of activity and constantly encroaching into realms which are not its business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not pretending to be optimistic.  If you had all the bodies in this country, representative of workers and employers in corporations, each corporation acting to settle its own affairs, and if you had this central corporation in which all these bodies were represented, you would have representatives covering the whole of the productive or economic activity of the people, and, to my mind, only when you have it in that complete form would that body really be desirable, because the proposal generally advocated is that in all relations to vocational activity, both inside the corporations and between them, the government altogether should be regulated by the council of the corporation.  I will give you a crude illustration.  Suppose, in the making of motor cars, the production of wheat, and the making of tables, you have corporations.  In the individual corporation relating to the making of tables the workers might come along and say: <Col N="1726" />&ldquo;We want X pence per week,&rdquo; and the employers might say: &ldquo;We will give it to you, but we will charge extra for the table.&rdquo;  That has been largely the history of the 19th century.  First of all, you have the hard-fisted capitalists grinding the workers, and then you have the workers, realising their power in organisations, putting pressure on the employers, and then, when the employers saw the power they had, they made a deal with them and said: &ldquo;Yes, we will increase wages, but we are not going to lose; we are going to put it on the consumer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It seems to me that that movement was feasible in so far as those industries capable of rationalisation were concerned, but in the case of agriculture where a man has to co-operate with nature, you had a totally different situation, and my reading of it has been that the whole course of development has been in favour of industrial labour and town workers, and has left agriculture out of it.  For instance, if a manufacturer of shoes finds that shoes are being produced at such a rate that the market is overcrowded and tends to depress the price so that he cannot make such profit as he desires, then all he has to do is to turn the key in the factory, and say: &ldquo;We will reopen on the 5th November next.&rdquo; In the case of the farmer producing wheat in Canada, who finds that his crop is going to be exceptionally great, he cannot say to the grain: &ldquo;Stop growing until the 5th November.&rdquo;  He has to let the grain go on, and when the grain grows, if he has a particularly large crop, say 100 barrels, where normally he had 50, then he would not get the price even of 50, so that you had a situation in Canada of men burning wheat, because the greater quantity of wheat, when it was available, would not yield the price of the lesser quantity when the greater quantity was not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember at the time we had nice, pious, moral people in the world saying what an appalling situation it was that they should be burning coffee in Brazil and feeding wheat to the railway engines in Canada.  Not being one of those sentimental, well-meaning <Col N="1727" /> people, I felt that if I were a farmer in Canada I would reply that I had given my labour for 12 months, and put the savings of years in the land to produce this crop of wheat, and it was now proposed to me that far from receiving payment for all my labour, the net result of my year's work should be that I had decreased the amount of the savings I had accumulated. I might have said: &ldquo;I am ready to meet you.  I am ready to give my wheat for nothing, provided that the men who are going to load it into the elevators, the men who are going to load it into the trains, the men driving the trains, the men putting it on the ships, the men driving the ships, the men going to unload the ships, and the shop boys behind the counter are all prepared to work on the same terms as I am.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, a proposition such as that would not have had any wide response at all.  It seemed to me that the farmer in Canada burning his wheat, and the coffee producer in Brazil burning his coffee, were actually people acting in the same way as a striker or a locker-out. In a strike in a boot factory, the men making the boots want to get a bigger profit from it, and so they cease making the boots.  In the case of the farmer, the whole production has to go on.  As far as the boots were concerned, they were simply murdered before birth, but the farmer had to let the crop grow to fruition and destroy it afterwards.  In the case of the boots, the crop was destroyed in the negative way by not allowing it to come into being.</P>
    <P>I come back to my idea of the council. If you had every activity in the country represented you would, first of all, in the corporation have discussions between the employing side and the workers' side as to what was fair wages.  In considering what was fair wages only in relation to this affair, they could fix it at any price they liked provided they were able to get that price out of the public to cover their profits.  It seems to me that when you would have all organised, the council or corporation, in fulfilment of the functions and exercise of the powers residing in it, could operate in such a <Col N="1728" /> way that the motor-car producer would say he wanted so much money, or so many barrels of wheat, for his motor car, but the agricultural people would say: &ldquo;What you are proposing is that men who have the good fortune to be employed in the service covered by your corporation by working one hour, shall have the right of buying, as the fruit of their labour, the produce of seven hours of men working on the land, and that is against justice.&rdquo;  I do not know whether I am conveying what I have in mind that when you have a corporation representative of every section of the community, within itself there can be that discussion and decision as to what is a proper ratio between bushels of wheat, a mahogany table and a motor car.  But, if you only have a section of the community organised, and you have the carpenters and the plumbers and the motor-car makers and so on in the corporation, and if they are going to have the power that is appropriate to a council or corporation in fixing what they consider to be justice, they would be in a position to enforce gross injustice on those others who were not so organised and represented.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned on other occasions, to look on this as a vocational council, and to have representatives of labour, <i>per se</i>, in it was perfectly ridiculous. Everybody here, if he is representing any vocation whatever, is representing labour, and the representation of labour, without representation of manufacturers and others, is in itself one sided, and any power so granted is calculated to produce, not justice, but injustice.  Now, I will come to my idea about a vocational council.  First of all, it should have nothing whatever to do with anything which is a specifically legal decision in regard to government&mdash;nothing whatever.  In this so-called vocational council, every Bill which goes before the Dáil has to come to us for consideration.  As a matter of fact, if we were a vocational council, we would have nothing whatever to do with anything that is appropriately called political in the country, but we have.</P>
    <P>Secondly, as far as Government and the political legislature are concerned, <Col N="1729" /> it should have nothing whatever to do with the economic activity of the country, and we know that the Dáil has quite a lot to do with it.  In creating the Seanad in its present form we have merely tended to confuse people's minds.  There is nothing vocational about us&mdash;we know that perfectly well&mdash;and if we were vocational, it would be disastrous.  Did you ever know anything so absurd as having as a nominating body some town tenants' association I have never heard of?  I am not sure that being a town tenant makes one a representative of any particular organisation, and I cannot see why town tenants should have any say whatever, except as part of a larger body, in nominating anybody to the Seanad.  We are not a vocational body.  If we were, we would be harmful, unless we were so organised as to be completely representative of every vocational organisation in the country. We should have total control over the vocational activities of the country to the total exclusion of the Dáil or the Government, except in this regard, that when you want to get economic equilibrium of justice where, for instance, the manufacturers of motor cars and the representatives of agriculture failed to come to agreement as to what ratio there was between bushels of wheat and motor cars.</P>
    <P>Then the vocational body should appeal to the juridical entity of the State, and the State, that is, the political Government, as a juridical entity, judging between the rival claims of the two organisations, should exercise this function to decide.  That seems to me to be the position adverted to by enlightened people who have seen in the creation of vocational organisations a means of improvement of the economic position of the world.  One of the good purposes of it, particularly in so far as it had religious advocacy in Rome, is to take away the activities from the Government which Governments have arrogantly allocated to themselves.  As a matter of fact, we are a part of the political Government of this country and our function is that of the ordinary Second House.  What I would like is this: I do not see that you can have a proper vocational council, a vocational council that is otherwise than misleading <Col N="1730" /> and a probable machine for injustice, unless the society, or the people in Ireland itself, out of itself, organises itself into corporations, and when that is done the State will agree to pass over to a council of such bodies as are contemplated, all those economic activities that the Government has so wantonly, arrogantly and, as I may say, imperialistically, taken to itself.  I do not see at the moment that we can hope for any immediate vote to have a desirable vocational council.  It should come from among the people.  If you look at <i>Quadragesimo Anno</i>, you will see that where it was arbitrarily imposed by the political Government there was a very definite indication of disapproval of that action.  Nevertheless, I can see that although it might in more perfect conditions be non-permissible and undesirable, the Government might consider how best it would encourage the promotion, within society itself, of such corporations.  Now, as far as the Legislature of this country is concerned, I have always thought that it was desirable to have two Houses in relation to the political government of this country.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Quirke who said that there was no good in asking for too much perfection from anybody, and there I am at one with him.  It may be remembered that, when there was a proposal to abolish the Seanad as it then was, all the faults and blemishes of the then existing Seanad were pointed out.  Then we were told in the Dáil that, if anybody could get up and propose a system which would produce a perfect Second House, there was nobody more ready to accept it than the then Government.  Just note the false arguments in that.  The first question was: is a Second House desirable or not?  The action that was proposed to be taken was the abolition of the Second House and the retaining merely of a Single Chamber Government. The question for the people to decide was: is it better to have a Single Chamber Government than a Double Chamber Government, and will the condition which will result from the Act now being brought forward be an improvement, that is to say, will a Single Chamber Government consisting <Col N="1731" /> of the Dáil only be an improvement on a Double Chamber Government consisting of the Dáil and the Seanad then existing?  I quite agree that we cannot expect a perfect Seanad.</P>
    <P>What I have been leading up to is this: first of all, if we are to consider how the Seanad should be elected, I want to see to it that this ridiculous red herring of alleged, bastard vocationalism will not be used as a weapon &mdash;as was done with regard to the present Seanad&mdash;to propose a system far from being approximately the best but more approximately the worst, as I think was the case with this Seanad. I myself would be quite ready to say: &ldquo;Let the Taoiseach himself nominate a second body, provided the second body will be what we are, that is to say, a body with legislative functions in the purely political sphere and not in the purely vocational sphere.&rdquo;  Senator Counihan has proposed that a Select Committee of nine members be appointed.  I do not know whether or not I want that done, because going around this country and talking to the people I find that the whole idea is that vocationalism has something to do with the Seanad, and that somehow or other the Government was calling particular representatives, corporations, county councils and so on, to elect a vocational council.  Let it be recognised that we are either going to be a political legislative House, a Second Chamber, or there is going to be a council of corporations.</P>
    <P>If the idea is a council of corporations, I do not even believe as many people do in trying to reach it gradually through the means of a legislative House.  We should not have proposed to have a vocational legislative body until the total organisation and the total functioning of vocational councils is and has been for some time operative in this country.  Consequently, when people get up and talk about this as a panel of representatives, I take no notice whatever of it.  Is not that just as well?  Do we want to stress it?  I figure on the administrative panel, and, when it comes to putting down qualifications on paper, I think I will show <Col N="1732" /> as good a qualification of experience in administration as any member of this House, so when I speak on this matter I have no fear that I am living in a glasshouse.  There is another panel, misnamed the cultural panel.  If anybody came into this House and listened over a sufficiently long period to hear every Senator speak, I wonder would he be able automatically to pick out those who are on the cultural panel? It does not matter a bit, because the thing was complete humbug, but for Heaven's sake let us get away from humbug.</P>
    <P>We are now an ordinary Second House of a political Legislature.  Let us bear that in mind.  I remember at one time down in a certain constituency an old man was speaking to me about the elections there.  This was long before the Treaty.  At that time there was no proportional representation, so the constituencies were much smaller. There was no universal suffrage, so a less wide section of the community voted.  The consequence was that the total number of voters there was about 2,000.  I see Senator Goulding looking at me; I imagine he must think that I am referring to his own neighbourhood. On that occasion it was pointed out to me that, with a couple of thousand voters, it would be a simple thing to give a couple of &ldquo;bob&rdquo; for a drink to practically every voter. One of the things that can be said about proportional representation is that it has made it pretty well impossible for anyone to be able effectively to bribe the number of voters operating in his individual election.  How many were required to elect a member to this Seanad?  I am not saying that the elections were not held perfectly properly; temptation, I admit, does not make a sinner.  But it does seem to me to be a system which would certainly not be watertight against forms of corruption.</P>
    <P>What I really got up here to say was that I am afraid of a committee being formed consisting of people with all sorts of ideas about vocational bodies and about the Pope himself having approved of vocationalism.  For Heaven's sake, if we are going to have a committee, let them knock vocationalism <Col N="1733" /> out of their minds right away, because before you can do anything you must have a total reorganisation of the whole productive activity of the people and a reorganisation of the people so occupied.  I myself will certainly argue and put up any fight I can against any proposal to create a vocational council until the vocational activity of the people of this country is totally organised in corporations, and is functioning so long that it will be capable of producing representatives to form a really vocational body here. That is the reason I have taken up the time of the House, because time and again since this humbug about a vocational Seanad was put up here I have heard ridiculous and ill-conditioned remarks.  Even when I said that, in a vocational council, nothing would be more absurd than to have representatives of Labour, <i>per se</i>, I heard the very hair bristling at the napes of the necks of my Labour colleagues behind me.  I was not arguing against their being here, but I certainly think that to have representatives of Labour, <i>per se</i>, in a vocational council controlling the whole economic activities of the country would be disastrous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not altogether sure that I am glad I gave way to the previous speaker, not because I would have wished for the world to have prevented the House from getting the benefit of his extremely interesting address on vocationalism, but because it does not make it particularly easy to follow on the specific matter of the motion moved by Senator Counihan. As far as the more learned part of Senator Fitzgerald's address is concerned, I think it was extremely interesting, and will probably be even more elaborated when we receive the promised report from the Commission on Vocational Organisation in this country.  As far as the second part was concerned&mdash;I think it was not quite so learned&mdash;in which he came down more or less to the motion, I am in complete agreement with him.  The only surprise I got was to find that there is one member of this House who considers it necessary to explain at considerable length that this is not a vocational <Col N="1734" /> Seanad.  It seems to me very obvious. Frankly I do not know anyone to-day who pretends that we have a vocational Seanad.  The reasons why it is impractical and impossible are probably very much those suggested by the Senator himself.</P>
      <P>The fact that we have not got sufficient vocational organisation to permit of the election of a vocational council, apart from the question whether that vocational council should be a Second Chamber of the Legislature or not, does not affect the contention that it might be highly desirable, even within the present Constitution, to consider whether some improvements could not be made in the composition of the Second Chamber which, in my opinion, will have to be a political body for many a long day.  It will have to deal with 90 per cent. of its problems on political lines, because they will be problems that will affect the political life of the country.  If he considers the two principal speeches we have heard to-day, I think that Senator Counihan will be convinced that, however good his idea, it would at present achieve no useful purpose.  When Senator Quirke reads his speech&mdash;I have not the slightest objection to his doing so&mdash;one believes that it has more inspiration than when he delivers a speech which is not written.  I, therefore, gather that Senator Quirke's speech represents the general attitude which would be adopted by half of this House.  If that be so, what use would there be in appointing a committee of nine, as suggested by Senator Counihan?  It is quite obvious that we have not reached a stage at which we could sit down to consider this question with some hope that, if we did agree on some scheme, action would be taken.  If the members of the committee did not believe that, it would be very difficult to get them to devote their minds to the problem.  If you add to that the general attitude of Senator Quirke and those who generally act with him and Senator Counihan's own complaint, that too many members of this House are not free to act and vote as they might think right, it would be futile to appoint a committee of nine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1735" /> I do not believe that this is the worst possible Seanad, nor do I believe that it is the best.  I do not believe that the present method of selecting a Seanad is the best method, nor do I believe that it is the worst method. The attempt to introduce a certain element of vocationalism, which could only claim to apply to a few of the panels, has not helped, but I do not think that we have necessarily got a much worse Seanad than we might have got from the last method, assuming the electorate was as it is now.  The Dáil had in the selection of the present Seanad and the last Seanad too much say.  A big drawback is that all the members of this House retire at the same time.</P>
    <P>I think that that is a bad arrangement in connection with a Second Chamber.  It would be better to have one-third of the members retiring at a time.  With the very limited powers of delay which this House possesses, I think it is quite unnecessary that the whole Seanad should go out at the same time.  If there were a readiness amongst Senators to come together and discuss these matters and if there were a possibility that, if a good scheme resulted, the recommendations of the committee would be acted upon, I would support Senator Counihan's proposal, but I do not believe that these conditions exist.  Senator Counihan did not go into much detail.  I was completely puzzled by his idea of having a selection board to select Senators. As much time would be spent in providing political machinery for the selection of the selection board, with all the same difficulties and abuses, as would be spent in the selection of Senators. The founder of the Constitution of the United States conceived the idea of an electoral body to elect the President.  The idea was that they would get a better person by that means than by direct vote.  Everybody knows that the President is chosen by direct vote long before his name goes before the body which, theoretically, has been elected to choose a president. I cannot, for a moment, believe that Senator Counihan or anybody else could discover a way of selecting a selection board which would select a <Col N="1736" /> good Seanad.  If that could be done, you could select the Seanad by the same method.</P>

      <P>The motion of Senator Counihan presupposes that this House, after its experience of this particular scheme for creating a Seanad, would like to sit down in all seriousness and hammer out a better scheme for the selection of the 43 panel members. This is not the kind of thing that, even if one had a majority, should be decided by majority vote.  I think that Senator Douglas was right when he said that, when Senator Quirke read his speech, it must have had a certain amount of inspiration, even though it was not very inspiring.</P>

I have seen several members of the Opposition reading speeches from behind their chair, time and again, and we did not assume that there was anything ulterior in their doing so.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is Senator Counihan's practice.  I do not know why we should be so thin-skinned. <Col N="1737" /> Senator McEllin is amazingly innocent. Senator Quirke, leader of the majority party here, rises in his place to deliver himself of a prepared oration, which is very unusual for him, and if Senator McEllin thinks that he did that without seeking advice or counsel from any citizen outside, he is very innocent for a West-of-Ireland man&mdash;more innocent than the politicians of Tipperary or Dublin.  The point that Senator Douglas makes is quite sound.  If there is not some sort of general agreement to do this job properly, there is no use in entering upon it at all.  The situation in regard to the Seanad is not so bad as many people thought&mdash;and I was one of those who thought so&mdash;it would be when this Seanad originally came into existence. There is difficulty in electing a Second House of Parliament.  A great deal of literature has been written on that question; and a great many efforts have been made in different places and in different ways to obtain a suitable Second House, and not one of them was very satisfactory.  The present Government did not like the Seanad arranged under the first Constitution. The Taoiseach developed the point of view that there ought to be no Second House in the Parliament.  He was supported by Senator Quirke in that&mdash; entirely on Senator Quirke's own responsibility, of his own free will, and without inspiration from anybody.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach then changed his mind and provided us with a Second House.  What is really wrong with this, as a Second House, is that it is supposedly vocational, and that elaborate machinery has been set up to give it a vocational appearance, while, in fact, it is not vocational at all.  To that extent&mdash;I am not going any further than that&mdash;it is a fraud and a humbug.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true for anybody to say that he was elected because of his particular eminence in a particular vocation&mdash;and we all know it&mdash;and it is not fair to the public or to nominating bodies outside that elaborate machinery should be very cunningly set up with the intention of getting the House to support the Government of the day&mdash;this <Col N="1738" /> or any other Government&mdash;while at the same time appearing to be vocational. All the elaborate machinery goes for naught, and the nominating bodies who go to the trouble of nominating people cannot be successful unless they have their eye on political Parties.  If we want to have the Seanad honestly political, in the same way as the Dáil, it would be better to do that straightforwardly and honestly, and not put up an elaborate wall of nominations and nominating bodies, as arises in this particular case.  While I say that, it is quite clear that the Seanad should be in existence.  This is a point which I recommend to Senators, on which we are all agreed.  In spite of the disabilities under which we started, the House has done considerably better than its keenest critics thought it would in the beginning.  We can say that much to our credit.  I think the House should not be in a position to prevent the Government of the day from carrying out its policy, but that it should be in a position to make the Government pause and to create delay.</P>
    <P>Someone spoke about the qualifications necessary for a Senator. Neither in this Seanad nor in the Seanad contemplated by the previous Constitution had we got any qualifications at all.  There was a beautiful phrase in the first Constitution about the service of people who had done honour to the nation, but it was found impossible to establish a criterion to decide that.  One can have selection boards for positions in experimental physics and modern languages or classics; but how we can find out which people have done honour to the nation, I do not know and no one else knows either.</P>
    <P>There is no possibility of doing it, and it is no qualification: it is only humbug to say so.  I have a feeling that a Second House is never going to have any great constitutional power, and that it would be foolish to look for any great power; but, in the absence of that power, it must have weight with its fellow-citizens and weight with the Government.  It must be a House containing people with certain public experience.  That should be political <Col N="1739" /> experience, in so far as people who take an interest in politics have the best experience.  People who are nonpolitical are rarely useful until such time as their political experience has aroused their interest in public affairs and made them competent to do the work that Parliament has to do.  It should be persuasive, it should have a certain public spirit and an ability to impress itself on the public.  It is in that way only, and not by constitutional power, that it would be able to effect its particular purpose.</P>
    <P>The fact that the whole scheme for the election of these 43 people contemplates that this House should be an echo of the Dáil is bad and should be changed.  From what we have heard to-day, I am afraid it is not possible to change it, or even to sit down and talk about changing it.  I think it should be changed, and that members here who are expected to be an echo of the Dáil find themselves, in the performance of their duties, in an irksome and objectionable position.  For my part, I had a good deal of Dáil experience, and naturally we all have our own particular points of view which arise from our experience and environment.  I had to change that point of view somewhat in this House, but one of the things I never would do is to put down the amendments put down in the Dáil and defeated there. It is a foolish procedure.</P>
    <P>We have, in fact, succeeded where the Dáil failed.  We have succeeded in convincing Ministers that certain changes should be made in Orders and Bills.  A notable example of that was the Bill dealing with compensation for damage to property by bombs and another example was in the Order with regard to compensation for personal injuries.  That was done by adopting in this House a different attitude from that adopted in the Dáil and by our not having the same relationship to one another here as Parties have in the Dáil.  I think that this House has been successful to a degree greater than expected by many people, because we have endeavoured to take a different attitude from that taken in the other House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> I would very much like to see an investigation of the matter by people with experience&mdash;and I think a joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad would be better than a Committee of the Seanad alone&mdash;but, in the circumstances in which there is objection to this being discussed at all, I do not believe that Senator Counihan would serve any good purpose, even if he could carry his motion by a small majority.  That there is need for this investigation, that it will be investigated, and that there will be a radical change, I am absolutely certain; and, to that extent, I feel that Senator Counihan will be justified.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words, as I have been a member of this House for a considerable time.  I would like, more or less, to echo what Senator Hayes has just said&mdash;that this House might be a lot better and might be a great deal worse than it is.  Echoing Senator Hayes, I think the House needs to have weight with the people and weight with the Government.  So far as weight with the Government goes, I should like to compare it with the House of Lords in England.  The House of Lords consists of a very large number of hereditary peers, hundreds of whom never have appeared in the House at all.  Those peers who do go there have large interests in the country, they are able men with a tradition of Government, and they are doing their duty to the country.  Where they get the weight with the Government is that, backing these hereditary legislators, there is brought in, from time to time, by the various Governments, as a reward either for Party work or for good work in the country, the very best brains in every type of business in that great country.  These men's brains are at the disposal of the Government&mdash;regardless of political considerations&mdash;whenever the Government calls on them, in committee work, to advise them on any project which the Government needs to undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe for one second that it is worth attempting to find a new means of electing this House, unless some means can be devised to bring into this House people to whom everybody in the country will look up, and whom <Col N="1741" /> the Government will call in&mdash;whether they sit on one political side or another &mdash;if they want advice on any matter of legislation which they propose to introduce. The ideas of electoral colleges, and so on, have almost always fallen down.  I agree with Senator Hayes that the House must be political, as one cannot imagine that any of us, with fixed ideas regarding the economy and the future of the State, will come into this House and wash out all the ideas we had up to the time we entered it. That would be quite impossible.  Anybody who says that any legislative Assembly is an advisory body with no backbone&mdash;and politics means some kind of backbone&mdash;is talking perfect nonsense.</P>
    <P>We tried several methods of electing this House, but the question is whether the last one was as satisfactory as some of the others have been.  I think that we still want, at the end of this debate, some really constructive suggestion which can be considered an improvement on systems already tried.  I do not want to throw cold water on Senator Counihan's idea, but I do feel that very serious consideration must be given to the matter before any change is made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate to which we have listened so far, some very interesting points were made, but it seems to me that so far in all this discussion, and even in Senator Counihan's advocacy of the reorganisation of the Second House, the fact that we have had a considerable amount of controversy for a number of years as to the constitution of the Second House has been ignored.  That is a controversy which has prevailed also in other countries.  As a result of that controversy here a commission was set up on which every section of the community was represented.  The most eminent people in the community were put on that commission and it sat for a considerable length of time examining every aspect of the question in the effort to find a satisfactory solution of this question.  We all know the result of that commission.  We know that there was a considerable amount of discussion there and that there was a <Col N="1742" /> considerable amount of disagreement manifested in coming to their conclusions so that it is somewhat foolish for us to say now that we can arrive at an ideal solution by adopting Senator Counihan's suggestion to set up a committee.  The Taoiseach and his Government as a result of the different points of view expressed by that commission decided that the best possible solution would be as a first step to set up a House on the basis of vocational corporative bodies&mdash;a panel system.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that when you set out to create anything you cannot make it a complete unit or devise a satisfactory working system for it straight off the reel.  You have to build up even a small business gradually.  I do not think the Government had any illusions as to the prospects of evolving an ideal vocational system out of which a Second House might be created straight away.  The original intention, as far as I can understand it, was to set up this assembly on the basis of a panel system.  People were nominated from existing bodies to the extent that such bodies were already organised, and these bodies have sent to this House very useful representatives. I do not think that Senator Hayes was completely justified in saying that this House was a fraud, and a hobo.</P>

      <P>There are people here representative of various bodies.  Even the mover of this motion professes to represent a vocational body known as the farmers or the cattle trade, a very virile body, and he would seriously challenge any statement that he was not a representative of that body.</P>

Everybody knows that.</P>

      <P>I am not denying that aspect of the matter but the fact is that Senators are representative of certain sectional interests in the country.  The Labour members of the Seanad represent Labour and strongly and sincerely represent it.  I am not talking about how we got here.  I am talking about the interest the Senator represents, an interest as vocational as any interest that will be represented in this House in the future.  I should like to straighten out this question in regard to representation of vocational bodies.  Every Irishman is a politician to his finger-tips; there is no use in denying that.  The man who says that he is no politician, that he has no political interests, is more in keeping with the character that Senator Hayes applied to this House&mdash;a fraud.  It is absolutely ridiculous for anybody to say that he has no political faith.  When I hear a person saying: &ldquo;I am a business man and I am no politician,&rdquo; I feel that that person is a damned hypocrite.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I shall have to examine my conscience.  To get back to the question of the election of a Second House, we shall always have to face in future questions as to the status, the prestige and the power of a Second House as against the First House.  It does not take a lot of imagination to realise that no two Houses of Parliament can have the same authority in any country.  Some body must be completely responsible for discipline and administration, and the power of control can only come from the people to one body.  That body, whether it be a First House or a Second House, is primarily responsible to the nation for discipline and the security of the citizens.  Then there comes the question of a Second <Col N="1744" /> House, and the authority which it should have.  Obviously, it cannot be elected by the same electorate, because if it were, it would have the same claim to power as the First House.  You, therefore, must get some other form of election to establish a Second House.  When this controversy was raised years ago, the charge was made that the Taoiseach and his Government wanted only one House. There is not one single line in any speech made by the Taoiseach in which he said he wanted only one House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not one single line.  The Senator cannot give me a quotation.  Obviously if some satistory means were not devised of creating a Second House, and if the people were not satisfied with the way in which it was constituted, it would be better in order to obviate controversy, to do with one House.  There has been a considerable amount of conference and a commission was set up, but agreement could not be found on the system.  This House has done remarkably well since it has been established, and it is my view&mdash;and I was a member of the old House&mdash;that there has been considerably more versatility about its actions and the speeches from all sides, and a greater sense of fair play, than there was in the previous House.  If that is so, and presumably it is going to be accepted, why should the members of the House not give it credit for a versatility that has already been demonstrated? Let us continue building on it; we are at least making progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that as time develops, and we get the results, good or bad, of this Vocational Commission, we might have some basis on which to work and to change some aspects of the system of election to the present House.  The ultimate ideal, I believe, of the present Government, and I hope also of the Opposition, is to establish a form of Second House where you will have all the different interests selected and elected by the vocational organisation, that will give it an aspect of independence of outlook and action, and enable it to criticise severely, in its <Col N="1745" /> own way, but from a different angle, the interests of the different vocations.</P>
    <P>If it is possible to get that idea we would be making considerable progress; but at the end we come back to the old position that no matter what system we have every man elected is elected to have a point of view of economics, and all economics are political. There are the economics of different vocations, but eventually all economics are political economics, and consequently people in this country are prone to make the mistake that if you are a politician or if you take a political point of view, you are merely something that is tainted, but they forget the fact that the very basis of the merits of a case are political economics. That is where the stupidity comes in, when people suggest that in discussions here there is no such thing as Party.  I am satisfied that this House, so far, has completely justified itself, that the proposals that Senator Counihan is putting before the House are not going to lead the House to what we all hope it will become&mdash;an independent body.  We have the basis here already of a vocational body and it is through our own efforts that we would be able to extend that basis to cover the whole House ultimately. I am certain that with patience and with a broader point of view from both sides of the House we would eventually develop it to the point where it would command the respect of the people and the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that I could not support this motion, and I have heard no argument put forward for it by the mover.  The motion itself does not mention any reason for placing it on the Order Paper at all.  I do not propose to follow the lines adopted by some of the other speakers in reference to the constitution of this Chamber, but I see no reason for the motion because I happen to be a member of the committee which was set up to inquire into the establishment of the Second House, and am familiar with the report of that body&mdash;the minority report if you like&mdash;which resulted in the House being established. The reasons I advance for refusing to support this motion are <Col N="1746" /> that, by virtue of my membership of that commission, I know the very large amount of work which had to be done, the extensive inquiries which had to be made into constitutions of all kinds throughout the world, and I fear that any committee set up in this House would not be able to address itself satisfactorily to that self-same task. In those circumstances I do not see the necessity for the motion.  I do not see that there is any possibility that if the committee were set up in any reasonable time it would bring forward any other set of proposals which would give a more advantageous Chamber than we have at the moment.  This Chamber may be in the initial stage of development; I presume it is.  It is not the completely constituted vocational Chamber that it may evolve into at some later time, and, as reference has been made to the Commission at present sitting, it might be just as well if we were to wait until such time as the report is to hand before we would set up a body of nine members of this Chamber to embark upon a very serious inquiry involving a lot of work, and which, ultimately, owing to the difficulties, might end in complete fatuity.</P>
      <P>The country may not be sufficiently advanced at the present time to get a completely vocational organisation which would produce the council of organisations referred to by Senator Fitzgerald.  All those things will come in time, and I think the best thing we could do would be to wait until the commission now inquiring into these matters would make its report.  If, thereafter, we think there is a necessity to inquire further, then such inquiry could be made, but I doubt very much if nine members drawn from this Chamber, who probably would have to come from outlying parts of the country, and with transport difficulties, might find it hard to get here, would be able to overcome the difficulties which must necessarily arise.  These seem to me to be very grave reasons why this motion should not be accepted by this Chamber.</P>

      <P>The only object I had in putting down this motion was to try to have some commonsense suggestions made by practical members of this House as to the possibilities of establishing a selection committee. I think if that were done it would not entail all the trouble which it is supposed to entail.  Very many of the present members of this House have been elected through all the forms of election which we have seen since 1922, and with all that experience behind them, they could make very valuable suggestions and recommendations to the Government. But, from the attitude the Opposition adopted, as expressed by the leader, Senator Quirke, I do not think there is much use in continuing to present the proposal, or even in continuing the discussion.  The members of the Government Party in the House, as we call them, feel quite satisfied that they are secure in their re-election, no matter what happens, but there will possibly be a new set of county councillors coming in after a short time and they might not find their positions as secure as they imagine.  They might be as well off if they considered the whole question of nomination and election on a different basis.  Senator Quirke accuses me of attacking the House.  I did not attack the House.  It is because I have so much confidence in the personnel of the House and their judgment that I want them to set up a committee to consider the proposal and make recommendations to the Government for nominating and electing the Seanad.  That is not attacking the House&mdash;it is more of a compliment to the House, and it shows that I have absolute confidence in the judgment and commonsense of Senators.</P>

      <P>The principal complaint is that the majority of members of this House have no independence, and if the Government brought in a Bill to abolish the Seanad, members of the Party opposite would quietly walk in and vote for their own abolition as they did before.  That is why I want to create more independence among Senators.  The object of my motion was to give the Seanad continuity if Senators were elected for a number of years, as in the case of the first Seanad, instead of waiting for a general election and being entirely dependent on the will of the particular Party to get re-elected.  From the attitude of the majority of the House, there is no necessity to continue the discussion, and I beg leave to withdraw the motion.</P>
      <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 3 p.m. July 22nd, 1942.</P>
