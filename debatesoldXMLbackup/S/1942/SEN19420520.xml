      <P>I have received notice from Senator The McGillycuddy of the Reeks that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House this evening, he will direct attention to the quality and condition of turf for which public transport is at present, as the Senator will, I understand, submit, being wastefully utilised.  I am accepting that notice.  The matter will be raised on the conclusion of to-day's business, but not later than 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>With regard to business on to-day's Order Paper, item No. 8, in the name of Senator Douglas, is of a certain amount of immediate interest and urgency.  Might I suggest that we should fix a time for taking it, to suit the Minister for Industry and Commerce; that is to say, that we should begin Senator The McGillycuddy of the Reeks' Motion, and No. 7, and adjourn that at, say, 7 o'clock for the purpose of taking No. 8, and then finish the motion later on, if that is agreeable to Senator The McGillycuddy.</P>

    <Title>County Management (Amendment) Bill, 1942&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="1127" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the County Management Act, 1940, it is provided that the Act come into operation on a day to be fixed by the Minister.  It was intended that the local elections would be held before that day, and that the newly elected councils, acting in association with the newly appointed county managers, would inaugurate the county management system in all counties simultaneously.</P>
      <P>It has not been feasible to adopt that course, and the main purpose of the present Bill is to enable the County Management Act to be put into operation before the elections are held.  In order to do that, it becomes necessary to make special provision for the position of counties in which members of the county councils have been removed from office.  Accordingly, it is proposed, pending the restoration of these councils, to postpone the appointment of the first permanent manager, and instead, to retain the commissioners and empower them to act as managers in their respective counties until such time as full effect can be given to the provisions of the Principal Act.  This is provided for in Sections 5, 6 and 7 of the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other amendments which it is thought opportune to make in the Principal Act are contained in Sections 3 and 4.  Section 3 of the Bill will enable a statutory body, other than a pier or harbour authority, or vocational education committee, at least one half of the members of which are required to be appointed by two or more rating authorities, to be brought within the definition of the joint body and, therefore, within the scope of the managerial system.  New statutory bodies may be created in the future, and it may be thought desirable to apply the scheme to such bodies, and, indeed, to some existing bodies as well. Section 4 of the Bill makes a change in the procedure for the selection of the first permanent county manager.  Under the Act of 1940, the Local Appointments Commissioners, in selecting the first managers, are required to give a preference, firstly to the county secretary in his own county and, secondly, to the secretary of the board of health. <Col N="1128" /> It is proposed that a commissioner acting for a county council or board of health should be considered for appointment after the county secretary in the county in which he is acting, and, in other counties, after the secretary of the board of health.</P>
    <P>The effect of Section 4 on the relevant provisions in the Principal Act will be more readily apprehended if the order in which the Local Appointments Commissioners will consider the several officers to whom I have referred is borne in mind.  So far as counties in which the county councillors are functioning, and which are not grouped with other counties are concerned, the order will be: first, the secretary of the county council; second, the secretary of the board of health; third, the commissioner or commissioners of suspended county councils or boards of health; fourth, secretaries of other county councils and, fifth, secretaries of other boards of health.  In counties in which the county council is suspended&mdash;except in Dublin County which is placed in a special position by reason of certain provisions of the Principal Act&mdash; first, in order of preference, will be the secretary of the county council; second, the commissioner of the suspended county council or board of health; third, the secretary of the board of health; fourth, the other existing commissioners for county councils or boards of health, that is commissioners acting outside the particular county under consideration; fifth, the secretaries of other county councils and, sixth, secretaries of other boards of health.</P>
    <P>In counties in which the members of the county council have been removed, the selection of the permanent manager will, as I have already indicated, be deferred until it has been decided to reconstitute the county council on an elective basis.  In the case of a county in which the county councillors are still in office, but which, under the Principal Act, is grouped with another county in which the council is suspended, the Minister will appoint a person to act temporarily as county manager until the suspended county <Col N="1129" /> council has been reconstituted, and the appointment of the first permanent manager for both counties in the group has been made.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 4 has been inserted in the Bill in view of the postponement of the first appointment in certain counties, and is intended to preserve the priority given under the Principal Act to the officers who are county secretaries or secretaries of boards of health at the passing of the Act, provided that at the date of the appointment of the first permanent manager they hold office under any local authority.</P>
    <P>These interim arrangements involve a consequential provision with regard to assistant county managers.  If an assistant county manager is required to be appointed in a county other than Dublin, in which the council has been suspended, or in a county grouped with it, he will not take up office until the suspended council has been reconstituted.  In practice, the effect of this provision will be that an assistant county manager will not be appointed in the grouped counties of Tipperary North Riding and Tipperary South Riding, whilst a temporary manager is acting in such county council area.  The position in relation to these counties will be that we shall have in the case of North Riding, where the council has not been suspended, a temporary county manager, and, in the case of the South Riding, we shall have a commissioner acting also there as county manager.  In view of the fact that there will be two whole-time officials operating, it will not be necessary, in my view, to appoint an assistant county manager to administer one or other of these ridings as was the intention under the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>Dublin County is in a different position from other counties, inasmuch as, under the Principal Act, the Dublin City Manager is appointed to be the Dublin County Manager.  The provision of this Bill, accordingly, in regard to the order of priority in the appointment of county managers, does not apply to Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner appointed last September in place of the Dublin <Col N="1130" /> County Council and certain subsidiary bodies will discharge the duties of manager.  Because a certain order of priority has been settled in the Principal Act in regard to the manner in which the selection of the first permanent county managers ought to be made, it is not to be taken that we feel that the qualities which go to make a successful county manager are to be found solely amongst any particular class of officers.  When vacancies occur after the first managers have been appointed, or, in respect of such first appointments, should the prescribed preferences be exhausted before suitable persons are found to fill every vacancy available, it is not to be taken from what I have said that the field of selection will be limited to any class or group either in the service or in the community.  When the preferences have been exhausted in the making of the first selections, and when subsequent selections for posts as county managers come to be made, any officer can come forward as a candidate in whatever class or grade he may be, or any person, whether an officer of a local authority or not, may also offer himself as a candidate.  For the first managers, as the House is aware, preferences will be accorded to particular officers.  Whether those preferences should have been given is, of course, a subject on which opinions may differ, but it was removed from the field of discussion by the fact that the Oireachtas, in the Principal Act, granted them.  The decision to do so was taken, I believe, on two grounds. First, it was held that, in making this departure from the system of local government that had been in operation in the country for more than 40 years, we should endeavour to secure the active assistance of all those officers whose knowledge of their respective areas, of the institutions within them, of the officers with whom they would have to collaborate, and, above all, of the people amongst whom they live and whose affairs they would administer, would make them fit instruments to effect the transition from the old to the new system, provided that those officers, in character and ability, were suitable for appointment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1131" /> The second reason which determined the Oireachtas in its decision was that it was felt that, as a matter of fair play and equity, special consideration should be given to the position of county secretaries and secretaries of boards of health.  Hitherto the county secretary has been the chief executive officer of the county council and has had a certain responsibility for overseeing all the activities of the county council.  The advent of the manager must inevitably depress the status of the county secretaryship and, therefore, it was thought not to be unreasonable that the holder of such a secretaryship should be considered first and recommended for the new post if he were found to be suitable.  The secretary of the board of health is in an even more unenviable position, because he will suffer the abolition of his office, and, although he will merge in the county council staff, it is only fair that he, in his proper order, should be given special consideration for the new post of county manager.</P>
    <P>So far as the amendment which is proposed in Section 4 of this Bill is concerned, the position is that the commissioners to whom the section relates have been carrying out the work of local authorities for varying periods and have, in fact, though not in name, been acting as county managers.  They have, therefore, very special experience, which gives them, I think, in the public interest the right to be considered, with due regard to the position of the other officers to whom I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They are appointed by the Minister, as a rule, and they consist of officers of his Department who have special experience of the type of administration which they are called upon to perform.  I may say that the only difficulty we have had in regard to commissioners, when once we appoint them, is to get the people whose affairs they have administered to agree to their being transferred <Col N="1132" /> elsewhere and the local administration entrusted to other hands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct, and the Minister is perfectly prepared to stand over any appointment he has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will stand over anything.  That is no trouble to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the Minister has generally been supported on the stand he has taken whenever he has gone to the people on matters of this sort.  The main thing to be borne in mind in connection with all this is that the successful launching of county management will depend altogether on the character and ability of the first managers.  I think it goes <Col N="1133" /> without saying that they must be trained administrators, with a knowledge not only of the letter of the laws they have to administer but of the spirit of those laws.  They have to work within the limits set by the financial and legal framework of local government, and it will be the business of each to co-ordinate the activities of all the officers of the local authorities, so that the machine will work smoothly, efficiently, and without unnecessary friction.  As soon as this Bill is passed, and when the new county managers have been selected by the Local Appointments Commissioners, it is intended to put the Principal Act into operation, together with the two other Acts with which it is linked, that is to say the Public Assistance Act, 1939, and the Local Government Act, 1941, so far as the latter Act has not already been put into operation. Finally, I may say that the Bill does not make any fundamental alteration in the Principal Act.  It does not vary in any particular the powers conferred by the Principal Act on the council or on the manager, or impose any new duty or function on either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister looked rather mournful in making his rather elaborate explanation about this Bill. I thought it was only a machinery Bill, that it would only mean putting county managership in operation without having an election.  For a Bill which may be described as a machinery Bill, this measure has, certainly, interesting aspects.  It indicates a very considerable change of mind and of heart on the part of the Minister with regard to local bodies, their functions, their methods of functioning and their methods of management.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister much more vocal on a certain occasion than he was here this evening, when he protested for three days at odd intervals about the Greater Dublin Bill, which provided for the managerial system in the City of Dublin.  There was a great deal of talk about democracy, but the moment the Minister and his colleagues got into power&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>He was supported by the people in that attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1134" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and he got into power by objecting to the managerial system in Dublin.  He proceeded to give adult suffrage for local elections and then proceeded to make local bodies as political as they possibly could be, so that the local bodies that we have at the moment, the county councils and other bodies, are the creation of the Minister and his colleagues. It is no wonder that the Minister looks mournful, because he is engaged to-day in what one might describe as the final act of the murder of his own children in the county councils.  Altogether we have some seven county councils suppressed, and indications that more will be suppressed. I do not want to go into the merits of the dissolution of those bodies because I do not profess to be an authority on that subject, but there is one very interesting point about this Bill.  It is a point which perhaps we might consider in Committee; it is interesting to see that when the Minister appoints a commissioner, he gives that commissioner prior claim to appointment as county manager.</P>
      <P>I have nothing to say against these commissioners.  Some of them that I know of are admirable people, but in appointing these county commissioners the Minister is not restricted by any set of qualifications.  No doubt the managerial system will be an improvement, but it is adding something to the all-powerful Civil Service, adding something to the centralisation of authority and taking the ordinary people away from the work of local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been converted from the opinion that local bodies ought to be allowed to carry on to the opinion that they ought to have no power at all.  To my mind, the Minister who makes these decisions about local bodies is by no means free from sin.  When one thinks for a moment or two about the Local Government Department itself, one realises that it is by no means the most expeditious, the swiftest, or the most civil Department that we have.  It is by no means the most impartial or competent, and it has in itself done quite a considerable amount of jobbery within the past ten <Col N="1135" /> years.  However, this may provide better machinery for local bodies.  I think it is relevant to say, on a measure such as this, that while in the past 20 years there have been very great changes in the function of civil servants&mdash;in the function of the State itself and therefore, as a necessary result, in the function of civil servants &mdash;I do not think that anything has been done to overhaul the Civil Service to make it suitable to the new situation.</P>
    <P>I really rose to make one point concerning this House.  The local bodies are having the managerial system imposed on them, perhaps all for the best.  A number of these bodies have been abolished.  Seven county councils have been abolished and I think a corporation is at present threatened.  It is interesting to remember that the only power left in the hands of the dissolved county councillors is a power to participate in an election for the Seanad.  County councillors who, after inquiry, have been found to the satisfaction of the Minister not to be competent to carry out their ordinary business, have, under the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Act still power to take part in a Seanad election.  That power is given them under Section 37 of that Act.  That is a very remarkable power.  It might easily mean that, with an election this year or next year, the Seanad would be elected in part by a new Dáil and in part by county councils some of which were elected in 1934, and others of which had been dissolved&mdash;some of them, like the Waterford County Council, for quite a long time.</P>
    <P>That would appear on the face of it to be contrary to common sense. There is an old Irish proverb that says: &ldquo;Tar eis a tuigtear gach beart&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, it is only afterwards, you know what you have been doing, and that would seem to be the case in regard to what I might call the ludicrous provisions made for the election of this House when it works out that county councils that have been in operation eight or nine years, many of which have been dissolved, will still have power to elect members to this House.  That seems to me to be <Col N="1136" /> contrary to common sense, and it is a very good example of how different parts of Government policy work one against the other.  It also indicates, I think, how poorly planned were the provisions for election to this House.  I do not know whether the Minister has adverted to that point, but I think he ought to give it consideration.  I think that on the Committee Stage, we might have a few other points to make which would be relevant to that particular stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that he did not propose any fundamental change in the Principal Act, but it appears to me that this introduces such a change&mdash;that it is practically a new idea embodied in the Bill.  The Minister says that it is quite simple. It simply gives, he says, the commissioner his correct place in the ranks of those who might be appointed as manager.  First of all, he appoints him as manager.  He gives him the function of manager and he gives him the status of manager.  Then he puts him up against other officers, the C.E.O.'s, etc., of the various bodies because a pre-requisite of the appointment of a commissioner is that you must have the members of a county council removed from office.  They must be removed before the commissioner is appointed. Therefore, if the secretary of the county council is a candidate for the position of manager, you have all the atmosphere created&mdash;that he allowed all the mismanagement and all the mistakes and all the errors to creep in while he was chief executive officer of that council and that therefore the Commissioners who are to make the appointment ought to be duly impressed by the fact.  In other words, he is up against a superman selected by the Minister and sent down to settle the affairs.  That is a serious position, I think, for the secretary of a county council, or for secretaries of boards of health who have certain rights in respect of these positions. Consider the atmosphere that has been created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A commissioner is sent down to Clare to clear up the mess that has been allowed to accumulate.  Removal of a body from office is a prerequisite <Col N="1137" /> to the appointment of a commissioner. It is relevant to inquire why the members of a county council are removed from office.  If members of a county council are not removed from office, there can be no commissioner. Ergo, there cannot be a person with the right to go forward for the position of manager.  Sometimes, a county council is removed from office because it acquiesced in the action of the Local Government Department in erecting a county hospital at a cost of £80,000 to cater for the needs of a county having about 60,000 or 70,000 inhabitants, that county hospital being completed, even to the blinds on the windows, before arrangements were made for a sewerage scheme or water supply.  Because a county council makes itself vocal in respect of that mistake by the Local Government Department, is it to be removed from office?  Is it a reason for removal that, in the county concerned, the dangerously ill have to be carried 30 or 40 miles for a major operation, under present transport conditions, and will not be permitted to have the operation in a district hospital?  Is that a reason for the abolition of a county council and the appointment of a commissioner who will have the right to go forward for the position of manager?  Or is it a reason that the county council is responsible for a reduction in the rates of 5d. in the £?</P>
    <P>The Minister does not read a manual of manners or courtesy in abolishing county councils.  He sets up an inquiry which costs the ratepayers £500 or £600 and he allows the body whose conduct and management was inquired into to carry on for eight months after the inquiry.  He holds the inquiry in August and he abolishes the council by radio in March.  In between, he allows that council to carry on what he considers its mismanagement and he allows it to strike the rate for the county.  Then, he says on the radio: &ldquo;Out you go; you are not able to manage the county; I have a superman for that and that superman will be entitled to compete with your chief executive officers for the position of county manager.&rdquo;  Surely, it is justifiable to inquire if that is the administration the Local Government Department <Col N="1138" /> favours.  Do they want to force upon the people the erection of a hospital, costing £60,000 or £80,000, without arranging for a sewerage or water scheme?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he knew that, in places where commissioners were appointed, the people were anxious to get them back.  Did he take any cognisance of people protesting&mdash;without any attempt to organise a protest&mdash; against the dangerously ill being carried 30 or 40 miles when requiring immediate operation?  Did he ask the people what they thought of that?  If it is for voicing their opinions and the opinions of the people on these matters that county councils are removed from office, then the Minister and his colleagues and those of whom he is the political head should, on that reasoning, have a commissioner appointed in their places.  I am not dealing with the matter in the abstract.  The case I have made happened in respect of the County Council of Clare.  I challenge the Minister to say that anything I have said is not in accordance with the facts.  I challenge him to say that what I said in respect of the hospital is incorrect.  I challenge him to say that what I have said in respect of the carrying of patients to the hospital and of the reduction of rates is incorrect, or that I was incorrect in saying that the council was abolished over the radio.  I challenge him to test the feelings of the people of County Clare in respect of these things by whatever method he desires, and let the people decide.</P>
    <P>He has appointed a commissioner. Of the gentleman appointed I know nothing.  I am told that he is an amiable and capable man.  I do not want to say one word against him, personally or officially.  I know nothing about him but, from what I have heard, he is a capable officer.  The man whom he has appointed to take over will have the functions and duties of manager. In three or four years, when the new council is appointed, he is going to put this man up for the managership against other officials of the county who have given 20 or 30 years' service to the public.  He will say of these: &ldquo;You have allowed these mistakes and <Col N="1139" /> this mismanagement to occur.  By the abolition of the council I have created an atmosphere which is unfavourable to you.  I am going to put this man up in that atmosphere and see what effect it will have on the commissioners.&rdquo;  That is a local and national dictatorship.  The provisions of this Bill should not get the sanction of this House, and I protest against them as vigorously as I can.</P>

      <P>The point made by Senator Hayes with regard to voting for members of this House requires some attention.  The Minister has indicated that this Bill is largely intended to enable him to bring the Principal Act of 1940 into effect and to make certain changes necessitated by the fact that there cannot be an election. It seems to me that a Bill of that type should make some provision which would prevent ex-county councillors from voting for members of the Seanad.  I have seen a list of the bodies abolished.  I find that four of them were elected in 1928.  These gentlemen, although in the opinion of the Government not fit to function as a county council&mdash;I do not refer to them personally but rather as a body&mdash; have been able to take part in the Seanad elections.  If there is any further Seanad election before the local election they will be able to take part in it, although they were elected in 1928.</P>

My suggestion to the Minister is that only those people who are actually functioning as councillors should be able to vote.  I am drawing attention to four councils.  One was elected in 1928 and has been abolished. Another was abolished, having been elected in 1930, and another was elected in 1934.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to put the suggestion to the Minister.  I think it would not be wrong to put such a provision in the Bill which is not a Principal Act.  I think it would not be wrong to put in an amendment which would prevent these people from voting.  It would not prevent new councillors from exercising their function.  Therefore, I am not sure that it would be necessary to amend the Seanad Electoral Act.  I put the point to the Minister for what it is worth and I would ask him to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another point I wanted to ask the Minister about.  It is in regard to Section 3 of the Act.  He does not give the reasons for providing that a pier or harbour authority or <Col N="1141" /> vocational committee, which may be a joint body, should be excluded, but it seems obvious to me he does not want to be in the position of appointing managers to these bodies.  It has occurred to me that it is possible that a hospital might be included within the provisions of the Bill, if by any chance the board of a hospital had half of its members appointed by two or more rating authorities.  I would like to have put in an amendment excluding hospital boards, because although I am in general sympathy with the managerial system, I would not like to see it introduced into hospital boards in this way, if by any chance such a board came under the definition contained in Section 3 of the Bill.  I would like to have the boards of hospitals included in the exemptions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, I have no objection to the provisions of this Bill.  In fact, I think a very good case has been made for them especially having regard to the necessity for making every effort to get officers who will be familiar with the areas in which they will have to work and qualified, as far as possible, in the particular work and tasks they will have to undertake.  At the same time, I should like to know to what extent qualifications in the national language will be taken into account in the making of these appointments.  I do not mind at all the automatic, or almost automatic, appointment of existing county secretaries as county managers when the proposed Act is put into operation, but when this list, when this particular category, is exhausted, I think we should insist that the language shall be definitely a qualification for appointment to county managership.  If it should happen that no candidate from the other various categories&mdash;that is, outside the county secretaries&mdash;is qualified in the national language, then the vacancy in question should be thrown open to general competition. I believe the time has come when those of us who speak the Irish language as the language of our homes, and, to a very great extent, make it the language of our business and of our professions, should have the fullest freedom to use the language when <Col N="1142" /> we come to deal with responsible public officials.  It is hardly fair to expect an Irishman, especially at this hour of day, when he comes to deal with a responsible public official to wait until an interpreter is found, or, as generally happens, it is hardly fair that he should be referred to some junior member of the staff with whom he has to transact his business.  I think the matter a very important one.  It may be covered in the Principal Act to the extent that the Local Appointments Commissioners may have power to prescribe any conditions they think fit and they may not overlook the question of the language, but I hope the Minister will have something to say about it and reassure us on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it a matter for regret that a local authority should be suspended, but, such having been the case, I suppose we have got to put up with it and accept the situation. The principal point I see in this measure relates to the ingress of local officials into the service.  We have a central authority and a central Civil Service.  We have also a local government civil service.  This Bill initiates a transmission of officials from the central authority to the local authority. While the Civil Service is an immense organisation, the organisation of local officials is a small one in which there is no great opening for promotion.  I agree that the county secretary is given the first preference.  If he is not suitable, the secretary for the county board of health is selected.  Then comes the existing commissioner who is both authority and local official.  He is the boss and servant at the same time.  If he has been there for any period, he has had an opportunity of becoming quite conversant with the technique of local administration and of acquiring a knowledge of the district which he is supervising.  Unfortunately, he could put the county secretary, who, through no fault of his own had his local authority suspended, in an inferior position, as referred to already by Senator Hogan.  It may be argued that, if there were a good county secretary, his local authority would not have been suspended.  That may be true <Col N="1143" /> to some extent but, on the other hand, it may be entirely wrong. You may have the best county secretary whose county council was bad and he could not do anything to rectify it.  Therefore, the argument does not hold that the county secretary must be bad or the chief of any local authority must be bad because the local authority is bad. One might as well say that, if a county council is good, the county secretary must be good as well.  No aspersion should be cast upon a county secretary because the local authority was suspended.</P>
      <P>I wish to protest publicly against this invasion of local service by the central authority, without reciprocity. A local official cannot enter the Civil Service and have his local service recognised by the central authority. Whether that is applied in this case, or not, I do not know.  If it is not, there would be very few commissioners transferred or seconded from the central authority to act as commissioners. Very few of them would go forward for county management, if their service with the central authority did not count for pension purposes. This invasion of local authorities' service seems to be for no particular reason and caused through no fault of the local officials.  Whatever happens the governing body, county councils or corporation, the officials should not be included in any way in the suspension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When being transferred from the central Civil Service to take over a county council, a person must be well qualified to do the job. If an official of a local authority were put in the same position, he would be just as conversant with local authority administration and do the job just as well.  The person who is privileged by being transferred from the central authority as commissioner of a county is not exactly omnipotent, but is at least local authority and local official embodied in one.  A competent local official would do the job just as well but, by the transfer system, the central service is put on a plane above the local service.  The local officials do not get the chance.  There is a much lesser <Col N="1144" /> chance of promotion in the local service and, now that this invasion has occurred, it is very restricted.  If there were reciprocity, where an official of a local authority might enter the Civil Service&mdash;as sometimes they do&mdash;and have the local service recognised, there would be some argument to be put up; but here the Civil Service official is put in a privileged position in his right to permanent appointment.</P>
    <P>The other question of these suspended members still being qualified to act as electors for the Seanad seems to indicate a position which should not remain.  If an amendment cannot be inserted in this Bill&mdash;as I presume it cannot&mdash;some amendment should be made to the Seanad Electoral Act.</P>

      <P>I merely rise to support the Bill, if for no other reason than that it makes it possible to have the services retained of at least a few individuals who have given excellent service to this country.  I do not like to mention names, but I cannot help referring to Commissioner Meghen in Tipperary, South Riding, and Commissioner Moynihan in Kilkenny and Waterford.  The Minister's statement as to the popularity of the commissioners would be borne out in those areas.  Since they went there, they have administered the affairs of those councils without fear or favour, and the people for years past never have hesitated to express their appreciation of these men.  Senator Hayes referred to the Minister's change of heart, which, I take it, is the same thing as change of mind.</P>

Senator Hayes referred to the change of mind of the Minister and pointed out that, at one period, the Minister spoke against the managerial system, and now comes along and for no apparent reason changes all that.  Senator Hayes conveniently ignores the fact that it was necessary to appoint these managers in certain cases on account of the Blue-shirt organisation.  I am not suggesting that the Senator had anything to do with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator was not very far away from the point of organisation. Certain individuals attempted to set up a dictatorship in certain counties, and to counteract that the commissioners were appointed.  They did their job well and the country owes them a debt of gratitude.  Even those who took part foolishly in the campaign for no rates and no annuities &mdash;into which they were led by others&mdash; now realise they were on the wrong track and are now loudest in their praise of the individuals I thought it necessary to mention here&mdash;Commissioner Meghen and Commissioner Moynihan.</P>
      <P>I missed most of Senator Hogan's speech, unfortunately, as I was called away.  He referred to local dictatorship and national dictatorship.  I take it he was referring to the affairs of the Clare County Council, of which I know practically nothing.  I do not know anything that could be further away from dictatorship than the system of government we have here at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Senator Hogan, in his less political moments, will agree on that point also.  But, all through his speech, there runs a suggestion that this Bill is setting up a local dictatorship, although the whole object of the Bill is to prevent local dictatorships. If we are to have a dictatorship at all, or a semblance of dictatorship, surely it ought to be one over which the people as a whole have some control and not a series of little dictatorships in every parish of every county?  There has been talk here about shoving in <Col N="1146" /> county managers&mdash;you can use that expression if you like&mdash;and one would imagine that it was proposed to put them in by the score.</P>

Such things might be done by people who are not Ministers now, and that is why people who were Ministers are not Ministers any longer, and why people who were not Ministers are Ministers now.</P>

      <P>The County Management Bill, which this Bill seeks to amend had for its object the provision of a bulwark for democracy by saving it from some of the errors into which it had fallen.  In the new system, a great deal will depend on the qualifications of the new county managers.  The position is one of great importance. It is full of unheard-of possibilities for good deeds, so that it is imperative that we should have only first-class men.  If the commissioners who proved themselves in the Civil Service, have done such good work in the counties to which they were appointed, after the county councils had been suppressed, then it is in the interests of local government and the interests of us all that the system should be extended.  Local government comes home to us in a much more intimate way than central government and, if these men have proved their ability, <Col N="1147" /> I think it is a good idea to give them a further chance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported the Principal Act in all its earlier stages and I have no reason to change my mind. Of course, there was a great deal of discussion in Clare about the abolition of the council, and as far as I could gather, it was not really the abolition of the council that incensed the members of the council, but the method by which it was done.  They thought, at least, that there would be the courtesy of notice in a formal way instead of giving it over the wireless, which some of them did not hear at all.  In fact, one councillor very tersely said of the abolition of the council that Crippen, the famous murderer, was caught by wireless, and the Clare County Council was abolished by wireless.  So far as my opinion goes, I consider the managerial system is very efficient and quick working, particularly where it is assisted by the representatives of the people in the shape of an elected body.  The point raised by Senator Douglas regarding the election of the Seanad by non-existent councils seems to be a good one, but Senator Douglas did not suggest to whom he thought the voting should be delegated. Should the whole number of votes be delegated to the commissioner?</P>

When the Minister was naming the different people who would be eligible for service as county manager I did not hear him mentioning the chief executive officers of county committees of agriculture. Some of these officers are men with university degrees in agriculture, and I think they would be very useful as county managers.  I am, therefore, directing the Minister's attention to that question, and I would advise him to consider if these officers would not be very suitable men, because of the fact that their knowledge of agricultural problems would come in useful in the management of allotments and the taking over of farms from people who would not pay their rates.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a point or two on this Bill.  I was against the original Act, and I am still against the whole managerial system.  It would take a great deal to convince me that it is a wise system.  I feel that it is going to destroy something locally which we should try to build up and preserve.  Goodness knows, we see every day the necessity for better evidence of citizenship.  I think you are going out with this Bill to destroy all sense of responsibility and of civic duty among our people.  The House passed the other Bill, and it is now proposed to put this on top of it with certain qualifications.  I was rather interested in an apparent disclosure made by Senator Quirke that this Bill is going to apply to two individuals, and that it was apparently introduced to put those individuals in the position of becoming the first commissioners in the areas where they had been functioning for some time. Senator Quirke gives these gentlemen a very strong recommendation.  I do not know whether that would be accepted generally as a recommendation and I am wondering how much of it is political&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">

The approach which Senator Quirke made to the question presents the Bill in a different light to me, and certainly not in as satisfactory a light, nor with the same flavour as it had when it was introduced originally.</P>
      <P>That frankly is the impression he left upon my mind.  I want to say that I have a great deal of sympathy with the point of view expressed by Senator O'Donovan.  I think it is a perfectly sane and sensible and proper approach to this question.</P>

On the basis on which the Minister and his Department have been proceeding, under the Bill before the House now we could have a position created in which, before permanent managers are appointed in any county, every county council in the country could be abolished, and the Minister could have his own nominees in every county in a position of preference to be appointed as the first county managers over all the officials in the country.

      <P>The Minister is one judge; I am another.  There are many other people who have a different point of view.  We have here certain powers vested in local authorities. They are not all the stupid, dishonest group of individuals that the Minister, when it suits him, will attempt to make out; they are not an inefficient lot who must be got rid of. We have not reached the stage where we have an exemplary Minister or Ministry of Local Government, and we will never reach it, because human institutions will have their human failings. The Minister is not perfect now, nor will he or his successors or his Department be perfect in the future. There is any amount of complaint down the country about the inefficiency of <Col N="1151" /> the Ministry.  It may be because of its size, its unwieldiness, or because its activities have become so diversified in recent years.  In any case, no one in the country&mdash;neither the Minister's opponents nor his supporters&mdash;is prepared to put the Ministry of Local Government on a pedestal, and, when the Ministry decides that a county council must be abolished, a great many people question both the wisdom and the justice of that decision, and the methods by which inquiries are held.  My view is that, if local authorities are to be abolished in the future, the Minister ought to set up some more impartial method of determining the guilt or incompetence of those bodies than that to which we have been accustomed.</P>

      <P>I am not the least bit ashamed of my part then or now.  I am prepared to stand over it with as much conviction of the justice of what I did as the Minister has in regard to his past, and I sought less, and took less, and got less than the Minister did for his part.  We know the procedure up to date, but we are finding fault with it and, I think, rightly so.  I think that it demands and needs overhauling. We heard from Senator Hogan a statement of what has happened in his county recently.  The feeling I have about all this is that you cannot go on creating the impression in the minds of people elsewhere that the people in Dublin are doing things unjustly and unfairly, even if there were no other consideration than the fact that, in those days, if you are disturbing <Col N="1152" /> public confidence like that, you are disturbing the whole strength of your defensive position.  Definitely, you are, and if there are people who think to the contrary, they are making a great mistake.</P>
      <P>There is a necessity for a more impartial tribune to examine charges of incompetence or incapacity or corruption levelled against the local authorities before they are dissolved.  I think the Minister would be doing the greatest service to local authorities and to local government generally if he decided that somebody other than the judges were to be the accusers. That is the method we have now.  You have power in the Minister's hands to abolish a local authority, to send in a commissioner to administer the affairs of the area, and to put him on a level with the other people when the time comes to make a permanent appointment of county manager.  Who makes the appointment?  The Local Appointments Commissioners.  There is no use in saying that you can get out of the minds of the people of this country&mdash; and there are very good reasons why they should think so&mdash;that it is not the most efficient and the most competent person that is appointed, but that political considerations are weighed when those appointments are to be made.  If the secretary of a county council, who may have been a party to advising his council along certain lines and in the taking of certain decisions&mdash;he may have, in his judgment, done what he believed to be right, but that may not have harmonised with the views of the Ministry&mdash;is to be a candidate as against the other, I doubt very much whether that individual will be placed where he ought to be placed.  I think there is in this procedure reason for grave disquiet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that we are dealing with a Bill amending a County Management Bill.  That County Management Bill has made certain provisions with regard to the management of the affairs of local authorities and, with all respect, I think I am entitled to argue that this Bill, far from being of benefit to local administration, is bringing about a position in which in fact we will not have local administration at all.  It simply means that so far as getting local people to administer local affairs is concerned under this measure that will now cease to exist.  We are creating a situation <Col N="1155" /> in the country in which dictatorship will be absolute and complete.  So far as people having liberty and democratic rights&mdash;about which there has been all this talk&mdash;is concerned that will be absolutely finished.</P>
      <P>We are in the position where the powers who have their hands on the machine here will be strengthened down the country as well as here.  You are strengthening that machine gradually every time you make it possible for some one from the central machine to go down and take control from the local authorities.  That may be done from the point of view of the people in the centre of the capital, but from the point of view of the people who are down the country, it is definitely bad.</P>
      <P>It is very very bad, and it is going to create a situation where no man of character, no man who is disinterested, will come in and play his part, and become part of this all-powerful machine where the independent view and the independent man count for nothing, will not be listened to and in fact will not be tolerated.  I think that is very bad.  I think it has brought other nations down.  It is not the right way to proceed, because you are destroying the whole basis of citizenship. I say there is grave disquiet at the Minister's methods and the methods of his predecessor in respect of the removal of functions from local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe I am in order so far as the suspension of local authorities is concerned.  It is the practice of the Minister not only in this House but in the other House to dictate to the Chair and to say the remarks of particular speakers are not in order.  I resent that.  I have a perfect right to argue that this Bill <Col N="1156" /> makes it possible for the Minister to dissolve county councils.  There is a whole list of county councils which have been dissolved over a very considerable period, but apparently the Minister does not want that, or the methods of ordering their dissolution, discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I put this question. There was a local authority dissolved in Clare the other day.  Will the commissioner who is going to administer the affairs of the Clare County Council be in a position to go up against the secretary of the Clare County Council or Board of Health as a competitor for the permanent post of county manager or not?  If I could get an answer on that question, I think it would clear the air as to whether I am in order or not.  If that be true and the commissioner is enabled to take this post, I say the Minister has only to proceed to dissolve&mdash;for some reasons, which, to my mind, are not well stated and when they are stated are stated from one side and not from the other&mdash;a number of other local authorities.  I presume he would then have Senator Quirke to come along and tell us that they were dissolved because this Bill had special reference to them&mdash;that the Bill was introduced for the reason Senator Quirke says it is introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to follow Senator Baxter into all his reasons for opposing this Bill.  I want to say, and perhaps I am going to be out of order, too, that the original Bill was brought in because it was considered necessary in the interests of public business.  In the past few years, the business of local authorities has increased enormously.  Even years ago, I, as a member of a local body, found it almost impossible to complete an agenda at any meeting.  I have attended meetings of county councils which lasted for hours and hours, and which had to be terminated with the business uncompleted.  The result was that public business fell into arrears and could not possibly be effectively carried out.  A county manager or a county commissioner is on the job all the time and it is nonsense to say, as Senator Baxter has said, that democratic institutions are being destroyed. They are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The democratic principle remains all the time.  The permanent official to be appointed will act in the role of skilled adviser, more or less.  He is free to carry out essential business in the absence of the elected members of the public body, but that does not prevent <Col N="1158" /> the elected members from attending meetings and suggesting ways and means of carrying out certain essential works.  There is one criticism which I should like to make.  It would, I think, be a good idea if those individuals were not permanently appointed to any particular county, but were rather subject to removal from one county to another.  Mr. A., who is appointed to a certain county, may carry out his work very efficiently and effectively.  Mr. B., appointed to another county, may not be quite so effective.  It might be better if an exchange were made between these men. Mr. B. might be more effective in Mr. A's. county and Mr. A. might carry out the work in Mr. B's. county better than his predecessor did.  I throw out that suggestion for what it is worth. It is possible that men, permanently appointed in this fashion, might be tempted to &ldquo;slack.&rdquo;  A man might say that, being permanently appointed, he could take things easily.  He might not like to be transferred to another county and the possibility of that transfer might keep him up to the mark and he might do his work more efficiently.  That suggestion may not be very acceptable to the gentleman concerned, but it might provide a very effective check on careless management.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan2" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I missed portion of the discussion on this Bill, but it seems to me, from the part of it I have heard, that it had reference to the Principal Act.  I should like to remind the House that this question of the appointment of county managers has been in contemplation for a considerable time. A number of such appointments has already been approved by the Dáil and by this House.  Under present circumstances, it would be interesting for the House to know when the proposed appointments are likely to be made effective.  Transport facilities are bad and are getting much worse.  As a result, attendance at meetings of local bodies is becoming more difficult.  Because of transport difficulties, there is a prospect that some of these meetings will fall through for lack of a quorum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further result may be that it will not be possible to pay contractors, <Col N="1159" /> road workers and other persons in the employment of local authorities the money due to them.  In one way or another, local administration would be seriously prejudiced.  As I understand the legislation on the subject, the appointment of county managers would get over that difficulty and would be the only method of ensuring that payments to contractors, workers and others would not be held up, and that local administration would not be prejudiced.  I am afraid that that is the only solution of these difficulties and, when the Minister is replying, it would be of interest to all of us to get some information on the point to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question put by Senator Brennan, as soon as this Bill is through, assuming the House passes it, steps will be taken to get the Local Appointments Commissioners to proceed to the selection of county managers.  When these steps will be completed I cannot, of course, say.  That will depend on the machinery of the Local Appointments Commissioners. I agree with the Senator that one of the reasons which make it imperative that this Bill should be passed is the difficulty being experienced by members of local authorities in attending meetings of the local bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other points was raised on the Bill and, perhaps, I had better deal with them <i>seriatim.</i>  The point raised by Senator Hayes and Senator Douglas in relation to the Seanad electoral franchise is an important one. Yet, in connection with it, we have to remember that, if we were to decide that members of local authorities who had been removed from office would be automatically disqualified from membership of the Seanad electoral college, we should be held, perhaps, to be not merely disfranchising them as individuals, but also disfranchising the areas which they represent.  While it is true that local authorities have been dissolved, it is not to be assumed from that that they have been dissolved because of corruption, or that each and all of the members were unfit for office.  It merely means that, collectively, the members have not discharged <Col N="1160" /> the functions and duties of the local authority with proper efficiency and attention.  A man may be a failure as a member of a collective assembly, but, when it comes to a question of giving an individual opinion in relation to the choice of membership of this House, he may be as competent to give it as any member of this House.  Judging by some of the speeches we heard to-day, I think most of the members of the dissolved authorities would be even more competent to express an opinion of that sort than some members of this House.</P>
    <P>In regard to Section 3, Senator Douglas pointed out that we excluded pier and harbour authorities and vocational education committees from the terms of the section.  The reason is that pier and harbour authorities and vocational education committees do not come within the scope of local government at all.  Pier and harbour authorities are under the control of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and vocational education committees are under the control of the Minister for Education.  That does not apply to hospitals and other public institutions, such as drainage boards and development boards of one kind and another, which do fall within the framework of local government, as we know it, and would, therefore, be properly dealt with in the manner prescribed in Section 3 of the Bill if the necessity for such action were to arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">

      <P>The answer to Senator Douglas' question is that hospitals may be included?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because they are part of the local machinery. Senator O'Donovan suggested that the appointment of commissioners put local secretaries in an inferior position.  In so far as a local commissioner is able to give his whole-time attention to a local authority for whom he acts, perhaps it does.  But, so far as appointments to permanent county managerships go, this Bill does not put local secretaries into a position which is inferior to that of the commissioner acting on behalf of the members of the county council or board of health.  On the contrary, it preserves the existing right by which the county <Col N="1161" /> secretary has to be considered for appointment as county manager in priority to any other candidates for the post.</P>
      <P>In that regard, perhaps I might try to clear up a misapprehension which I think some Senators are under in regard to this question of priority. It is not the case that there will be competition for a particular post of county manager as between the county secretary and the commissioner.  These two officers will be considered in a certain order.  The county secretary comes first.  He is considered and if he is suitable according to the standards which have been laid down by the Local Appointments Commission as being applicable to the post then he will be appointed and no consideration will be given to the county commissioner at all.  This position will not hold that there will be before the Local Appointments Commission at one and the same time two candidates one of whom is the county secretary and the other of whom is the county commissioner acting for the local authority.</P>
      <P>There will only come before the Local Appointments Commission one at a time the persons who have been given priorities in this Bill and the Commissioners will consider these persons in the order which has been prescribed in the statute until they have found a person who is suitable.  They will consider the county secretary and if because of age or, perhaps, health or other reasons they decide he is not suitable for the county managership, then in general they will proceed to the secretary of the board of health. If he is not found suitable because of some defect or lack of qualification, only then will they consider a commissioner acting for a county council, if such commissioner chooses to be a candidate for a post.  The post may not be sufficiently attractive for many people who are administering the affairs of councils and they may decide not to go forward.  If the Local Appointments Commissioners do not find the county commissioner is suitable, they will then proceed to consider the secretaries of county councils other than the county council for which the appointment has to be made.</P>

    <P>If among the remnant of those who <Col N="1162" /> have not secured appointment in their own county there is no one found suitable, the commissioners will proceed to consider the residue, if I may say so, of the secretaries of the boards of health.  It is probable, I think, that if a county secretary or a secretary of a board of health does not secure appointment in his own county he is unlikely to secure appointment at all.  The post will then be thrown open to the best men available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I had just made that point.  The position may not be attractive enough for existing county commissioners.  There is no foundation for the suggestion which was made, I think, solely by Senator Baxter that, for some unworthy reason or another, the Minister for Local Government was trying to foist his creatures on local authorities and county councils as county managers.  I think I have shown, at any rate, that so far as the county secretaries are concerned, there is nothing in this Bill which in any way makes them inferior to county commissioners, or which in any way reduces their chances of appointment as county managers when they happen to be suitable for the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan also says in this connection that there should be reciprocity as between the Civil Service and the service of the local authorities. He said that when local officials enter the Government service, their past service as officers of local authorities is not counted for pensionable purposes in the Civil Service, and I think he implied as against that that members of the Civil Service transferred to the service of local authorities had their <Col N="1163" /> past service counted for pensionable purposes.  That is not the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I explain that the position as explained by the Minister is quite clear to me.  I was not objecting on that point at all.  I pointed out that in the case of the transfer to local authorities of central civil servants their service in the central Civil Service was not recognised. Personally I would be glad that they would leave the field to the local officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that as the law now stands any civil servant entering the service of local authorities will not have his service counted for pensionable purposes.  On the other hand, if the servant of a local authority enters the Civil Service and happens to have at the time of that entry more than ten years' service with the local authority, then that service can be considered for pensionable purposes.  At the moment at any rate, the servants of local authorities in regard to the question of pensionable service appear to have better treatment.  Senator Honan said so far as he could gather there was no very great criticism of the dissolution of the Clare County Council and the Clare local authority.  What was objected to was that they were dissolved by wireless. That is not the position.  The position in regard to local authorities is that the members are removed from office when the Minister makes an Order.  The making of this Order is communicated in the ordinary way to the Press Bureau for transmission to the Press and for the information of all the ratepayers under the jurisdiction of the local authority concerned. As a matter of course, when it goes to the Press Bureau, it is also sent to the editor of the news bulletin of Radio Eireann and the item is broadcast as a matter of news in which the ratepayers of the area concerned have a particular interest and not as a mode of announcing to the members of the county council or local authority that they are being removed from office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> In regard to notifying the members who have been removed from office, that is a matter which has been giving me some concern.  I should like, if I could, before the news has broken to the public, to give some prior intimation to the persons concerned that they are no longer members of the county council; but there is no way by which I can do it, for the reason that the moment the Order is made, removing such members from office, they lose all official status and the only person to whom this information can be communicated is the executive officer of the local authority, to whom it is communicated at the earliest possible moment.  I cannot write to a person who is no longer in office, saying that I have abolished him, and I do not think his resentment would be any the less if he heard it from me in a formal letter, than it is when he hears it from the secretary, of his county council or local authority.  Therefore, I hope it will be appreciated that it is not for lack of consideration of the members of the local authority concerned that I have not been able to find any way in which I can give them prior notice of what it is necessary to do.</P>

      <P>They were there the day previously, and on that day at least they did something.  If you consider the pertinent aspects of this matter, I think you will agree that there is no formal machinery provided to communicate with them.  The Minister must act strictly in accordance with the Act and cannot go outside it. The best and most expeditious way to communicate to everybody concerned the fact that the members of the local authority have been removed from office is the one that has been adopted now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see how some of the matters raised in this debate properly arise on this Bill.  There is no question of amending, extending, or interfering in any way with the power and duty which the Minister already has of ordering an investigation into the affairs of a local authority, and if, in his judgment &mdash; and only in his judgment &mdash; he thinks it necessary to do so, to remove the members of the authority from office and appoint a commissioner to administer its affairs. Some very extraordinary statements have been made here.  Senator Hogan has said we abolished the Clare County Council because a new hospital was built for which a water supply or sewerage scheme had not been provided, and that, because the Department had in some way failed to do its duty in this regard, we abolished the county council.  The Department is neither the sanitary authority nor the board of health for Clare, nor has it the immediate responsibility for providing Clare with those institutions necessary for the public health; but if the facts are as stated by Senator Hogan &mdash; to meet him on his own ground &mdash; and if the new county hospital was built at a cost of £80,000 or £90,000, without any proper provision for water supply or sewerage scheme, and if all the bodies concerned in the provision of such essential services for the hospital, after a number of years <Col N="1166" /> negotiating and being urged by the Department to discharge their duty and exercise their functions in that regard had failed to do so, surely if there were one thing which would justify the dissolution of all those bodies it was the very fact which Senator Hogan has brought to the notice of the Seanad.  I am not for a moment accepting that the Clare County Council or the Clare Board of Health was abolished for that reason. In fact, the grounds on which they were abolished were stated in my letter to the person who was appointed as commissioner, and those grounds are known to the people of Clare.  With a knowledge of the facts contained in that letter before them, Senator Honan &mdash;who is, I think, just as competent to voice the opinion of the people of Clare in this matter &mdash; has stated that there has been no criticism of the abolition of the Clare County Council or any of those bodies, but merely of the manner in which the announcement was made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Senator Honan said that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons for the abolition of the Clare local bodies were stated in my letter.  Anyone who reads the letters in question will have to admit that the grounds were coercive. The finances of the county council had got into such a state that the local bodies were living from hand to mouth, getting in the early part of the year moneys from week to week to enable them to carry on.  The rates were not being collected, and heavy arrears in regard to cottage rents were uncollected, so heavy indeed that the Department had to come to the definite decision that notwithstanding the fact that there is and was grave need for the erection of at least 500 additional cottages in Clare, that all building be stopped in Clare until the situation was cleared up.  I do not want to go into all the delays which have taken place in providing the necessary hospitals in the county, nor the delays which took place in extending the mental hospital, nor the <Col N="1167" /> absolute disregard of the regulations which the Department has made from time to time for the proper conduct of the mental hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that Clare has lost, and the people of Clare have lost, considerable sums by reason of the conditions which had been allowed to grow up there and, in any event, this country is in such a situation to-day that we cannot afford to have any more laxity, or any reluctance on the part of local authorities to carry out their manifest duties in regard to the administration of local affairs, and the whole system, so far as we are concerned, has got to be tightened up.</P>
      <P>I was going to say something about Senator Baxter, but I do not know whether it is worth while wasting time upon Senator Baxter or on what Senator Baxter says.  He tells us that there is grave disquiet throughout the country with the manner in which certain local authorities have been treated, and the manner in which the Minister is exercising his powers to dissolve such local bodies as fail to discharge their duties to the people who have elected them.  I do not know what means Senator Baxter has of sounding public opinion in this country. I do not know from what quarters, or in what way, this public disquiet has reached him, as he says.  If there is one person who has shown himself to be completely out of touch with public opinion in this country, it is Senator Baxter.  He has never, since the year 1927, been able to secure election in any constituency in this country, although he was a candidate in many of them.  He resides, I believe, in County Cavan.  What does he know about public opinion in County Dublin in relation to the abolition of Dublin County Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where has he heard any widespread disquiet in County Dublin about the abolition of the County Council?  Has he gone to the ratepayers, who find their rates in some cases reduced by 4/6 in the £ as compared with last year, under a commissioner who was <Col N="1168" /> appointed only six months ago?  Has he heard of any public disquiet from them?  Has he heard any suggestion that the commissioner appointed to administer the affairs of Dublin County has been influenced by political considerations or by any other consideration except the one I put before him and that was to clean up administration in that county, and to ensure that every officer did his work honestly and fairly by all the citizens?</P>
    <P>Has he heard any suggestion from the ratepayers of Dublin City that I acted wrongly in abolishing the board of assistance after the superintending officer swore that public moneys were being given out in the form of public assistance without any proper investigation being made into the circumstances of the applicant and that the only thing that really determined how this £280,000 of money taken from the people should be distributed was the statement made on the application form, which was accepted without any due investigation or inquiry.  That was sworn by one of the superintending relieving officers of the Dublin Board of Assistance, and does Senator Baxter think that in those circumstances I had any option, having read that sworn testimony, but to abolish the board which had permitted that state of affairs to go on?  Has he heard in the City of Dublin any expression of disquiet because that board has been dissolved, and because three whole-time people have been put in for the purpose of reorganising this whole system and trying to see whether they can find some machinery whereby people who are really in need of relief will be relieved, and whereby, also, people not in need of relief will not be permitted to live in idleness at the expense of the hard-working citizens of this city.</P>
    <P>I should like to say in that connection that I do not wish it to be apprehended that I hold the members of the Dublin Board of Assistance blameworthy, fully blameworthy, for all that has happened.  The fact of the matter is that we had a system adopted for parish relief, for the relief of individuals well-known to all members of the community in which they lived, <Col N="1169" /> where the circumstances were that every item came under the review of the people of the parish who were paying for them.  We have had that system expanded to meet the needs of a community of fully 500,000 people, and it is quite impossible, in my view, to apply the old principles of administration to the new set of circumstances, and I feel that it would be impossible for any body of voluntary individuals to have administered public assistance in the City of Dublin any more efficiently than the old board of assistance did.  But having come to that conclusion, what was I to do?  Was.  I to allow the existing out-of-date system to continue, a system under which, as I have said, the responsible officers of the board&mdash; I am not saying they did swear it was quite impossible &mdash; swore that there had been no proper supervision over the distribution of outdoor relief? Was I to allow that to continue, or was I to do as I did, put into office three competent persons, each of them peculiarly qualified, to deal with special aspects of this problem, ask them to take over the affairs of the Dublin Board of Assistance and see if they could not evolve a system which would stop the abuses which had grown up and which would prevent their emergence in future?</P>
    <P>These are the circumstances under which these public authorities have been abolished, and, without producing a scintilla of evidence, Senator Baxter, whose special position put him more out of touch with the public opinion of this country than most men here, comes along and says that the action of the Minister in dealing with these known abuses has been the occasion of grave disquiet in the public mind.  On the contrary, so far as one's personal post can prove it, the action which I have taken in abolishing not merely the Dublin bodies, but the other bodies, has met with general acceptance by the citizens.  I have received letters congratulating me on taking these actions, because as the writers of the letters tell me, they know from their knowledge of the position that the steps were fully warranted and were timely.  Even to-day, if Senator Baxter had been reading his <Col N="1170" /> newspaper, the <i>Irish Independent,</i> which carried an editorial yesterday couched in very much the same terms as he has spoken in to-day, he would see this morning leaded-out, a demand on the part of responsible citizens in one town of this country for a public inquiry, and for the abolition of the local authority, and it is a memorial which is signed by a considerable number of substantial ratepayers of all creeds and all classes and all sections of political opinion.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, the real trouble in relation to the appointment of commissioners in any county is first of all the difficulty of finding persons who are versed in local government law and have experience of local administration, and getting them to carry on.  The next difficulty is, when you have found such a person and have appointed him as commissioner, to try to discontinue his post, because the moment it appears that the commissioner's term of office is coming to an end representations are made from all quarters to continue him in office.  Our predecessors, I think, appointed commissioners in Kells and Trim and a number of other small towns, and we have had to continue them in office because the local people wanted them. Is that evidence of this widespread public disquiet to which Senator Baxter has referred?  As I have said, this Bill does not in any way propose to interfere with or expand or amend or curtail the present powers of the Minister to order a sworn inquiry, and, if necessary, on the evidence that that sworn inquiry elicits, to take whatever steps he may think fit to improve the administration of local government in the area covered by the inquiry. Perhaps I have been a little out of order and not strictly relevant, but the matters were raised and I think they had to be dealt with.</P>

      <P>This Bill is intended to give legal sanction to measures already taken by county councils to provide seeds and fertilisers on loan terms for persons who are unable to buy those for themselves under any other conditions.  Under the Bill, the county councils can exercise their powers in two ways.  They can sell seed on loan terms under Section 3, or give guarantees to seed merchants under Section 5.  The recipient is required to pay the loans after the harvest, and the Bill provides that, in addition to the ordinary power of recovering a debt, there is power to recover it by means of a rate assessed on the person who has failed to repay the advances made to him.  The present Bill is on the same lines as its predecessor, except that, under Section 6, the Exchequer will recoup the county councils one-half of any loss which may be sustained by them, up to an aggregate of £25,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a rather trifling way of dealing with such an important matter.  A provision of £500 or £600 for each county&mdash;it does not appear to be much more than that &mdash;is entirely insufficient.  While it is of benefit to people on valuations of £5 or £10, I think it is of very little use to people who own large tracts of land and who may not have sufficient capital to buy the necessary seeds, or, under the present tillage Order, to buy the machinery necessary to prepare their farms for cultivation.  I think that in certain instances the failure to grow a sufficient quantity of wheat this year arose from the fact that large landholders whose purses had become attenuated found it difficult to acquire the machinery necessary for cultivation of their land.  In whole districts in the grazing counties great losses were suffered by some of those people by reason of the fact that they had to wait upon their neighbours to till the land for them.  Not only had they to wait upon the person who owned the machinery, but they had to wait until the lands of several of their neighbours had been dealt with.  That often resulted in failure to sow the crop in time.  I know of cases where winter wheat was contemplated, but it was not possible to sow the wheat until the spring, too late in some cases for a successful crop.  I understand that in many cases this year spring wheat, which is uncertain of growth in any normal season, has been very uncertain, and in some places it is being ploughed up.  That has resulted, I think, from want of the necessary amount of capital on the part of the people who own the land.  During the past 12 months, as we know, the cattle trade was very adversely affected by happenings in this country, foot-and-mouth disease among other things, and the personal resources of people who <Col N="1173" /> held large tracts of land were exhausted.  I think something special should have been done this year in regard to such people.  The same thing is happening in connection with the reaping of the crop.  I know people who had acres and acres of wheat under good land, and the proceeds of the whole year's work have been lost through failure to procure machinery to reap and thresh those crops in time.</P>
      <P>This is a matter which has been cropping up for a number of years.  It has done useful work, but I think something supplementary should have been done in this season to enable people to comply with the tillage regulations. I think the amount provided for is insufficient, and that the scheme should be extended.  The question of security for the loans is one which causes much trouble.  The history of those loans redounds to the credit of those who got them.  The amount of arrears outstanding is insignificant.  It is a very small percentage of the whole, and the Government subsidy has been little called upon, so far as I know, to meet any losses on the part of county bodies. I think that the worry and humiliation of looking for sureties, which are sometimes difficult to get, is one drawback of the whole scheme.  I think the banks should step in in this matter and that the Government should, by some arrangements with the banks, obviate the necessity for this humiliating practice of begging for sureties.</P>
      <P>The banks in the different districts should have knowledge of the people who are responsible.  I remember in the old days, in some parts of Ireland, shopkeepers were the means of giving seeds and manures in the spring time and accepting the word of men of good standing, credit-worthy men in the locality, for payment in the harvest time.  There was no such thing as this security.  I can recognise well enough that it is necessary to have some form of security, but there are men who conducted their business for years and paid their way who could be accepted by the banks.  Negotiation through the banks would be much more satisfactory than through the county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this should be more a matter for Agriculture than for Local Government. <Col N="1174" /> I think Agriculture should really deal with these matters.  While it is closely allied to Local Government, it is more immediately connected with one feature of Government &mdash; Agriculture. I think the Minister for Agriculture should have charge of these operations and that the banks should be brought in to help the work.</P>

      <P>I think this Bill is a very useful piece of legislation and this amendment will help considerably in encouraging local authorities to give more credit.  I think a good credit scheme would help considerably to increase cereal production, particularly in the new tillage areas.  In the old tillage areas, people get their credit from their merchants, but in the new tillage areas, farmers have great difficulty in getting credit, because in fact there are no merchants there.  I believe that a credit scheme is particularly useful in these districts.</P>
      <P>I noticed along the railway line on the way to Dublin that there was a tractor ploughing up the grass land. If that is being done under the Compulsory Tillage Order it is wrong, because it is too late now to enable a return to be got from it.  It is only skimping the job and no crop will be produced for this year.  If that is being done under the Compulsory Tillage Order, it should be stopped.</P>

    <P>Senator Cummins referred to the fact that difficulty was experienced in getting sureties.  I do not know of any credit-worthy person who would find difficulty in getting two sureties to go bail for these loans.  In my district, no credit-worthy person has any difficulty in finding such sureties.  I agree with Senator Cummins that this provision <Col N="1175" /> of credit should be made by the banks, but when the banks are not doing it, I think it is well that it is being done in this way through the county councils.

      <P>I think Senator Cummins was under a misapprehension as to the purposes of this Bill.  It is a social measure, not a measure to assist agriculture as an industry or the production of crops or food for sale.  It is designed to assist mainly the subsistence farmer &mdash; the man who wants seeds and fertilisers for the production of food primarily for himself and his family.  This measure is brought in year after year with the definite intention of assisting the smaller man. What Senator Cummins and Senator O'Callaghan have said is quite correct. If this was a measure really for the development of agriculture, for the encouragement of agriculture as an industry, it would be brought in by the Minister for Agriculture, but I say again it is not on that basis it is planned.  In regard to this measure, we have got to bear the limitations of it and the limited purpose which it is intended to serve in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see that there is any great humiliation in asking a man who is going to ask his neighbours &mdash; because that is what it means when he goes to the county council &mdash; for the grants to purchase seeds and fertilisers, to bring along two friends who are prepared to vouch that if he does get the money to buy seeds and fertilisers, he will devote it to that purpose.  If you made it possible for people owning a portion of land to go to a county council asking a loan without any sort of guarantee whatsoever that the money will be properly used, and if they could get the money, I am afraid you would have many people availing of this Bill and a great many of them would not devote the money to the purpose for which it was intended.  I think it is inevitable that, in a scheme of this sort, the persons who take <Col N="1176" /> advantage of it should be required to bring along people who would be prepared to sponsor them as honest trustworthy men, and I think that there is no alternative to this in the schemes as they have been operated by most county councils up to the present &mdash; at least no alternative which would be any simpler.  Some county councils, I know, require that one of the guarantors shall be the merchant who is selling the seed, but, even so, they require a second person as security also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Schedule, when you say &ldquo;the maximum recoupment&rdquo;, is that an actual figure?  Has the Minister the actual figure the county councils will be entitled to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is based on this principle, that £25,000 is being allocated to the counties in proportion to the agricultural population, that is, the aggregate guarantee has been divided up over the county councils in proportion to the agricultural population in each particular county.  In the case of Cavan, it is based entirely on that, and also in the case of the others. That is the maximum recoupment which the Government will make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, while I agree that obviously in the poorer counties, where the population is high, you will probably have greater needs, but, on the other hand, in other instances, it might not be so.  You might have a county, two adjoining counties, for instance, where the density of population was approximately the same and where a much greater sum might have been spent for some particular reason&mdash;failure of the potato crop, for example &mdash; in one county in one particular season, as against the amount that would be necessary in the adjoining county.  With all these figures, it is difficult just to say which would be the fairer method, but it seems to me that the total amount which would be spent in any county, the amount which the <Col N="1177" /> Minister may make available, ought to be related to this fact more than to anything else, because there are likely to be greater losses.  In my county, we might make £2,000 or £3,000 available for the purposes of the scheme.  In Leitrim, they might make £3,000 available also.  In one county there might be much greater failure to repay than in another, and the ratepayers in a county where repayment was not made to an appreciable extent would have to carry a much greater burden.  Has that aspect of the matter been considered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It has.  This provision is rather experimental this year. Apart from that, this represents the maximum amount of recoupment of default and there has been nothing in our experience heretofore to suggest that in any county the amount to be recouped will reach these figures.  If experience shows that the figures are insufficient, the scheme can be reviewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, which is of no great importance, was decided upon some time ago but was only recently produced from the draftsman's office. The purpose of the Bill is to extend the borrowing powers of certain building societies and to put them in a position to avail of any guarantees which may be given under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1941.  That Act provided that banks could give financial accommodation to building societies in approved cases where the local authority was prepared to guarantee repayment.  The main purpose of this Bill is to increase the borrowing powers of building societies.  The Building Societies Act, 1894, provides that the total amount received on deposit or loan by the society must not at any <Col N="1178" /> time exceed two-thirds of the amount for the time being secured to the society by mortgages from its members. This Bill raises that ratio from two-thirds to three-fourths and, secondly, excludes from the operation of the limit so imposed any loans raised by the societies under guarantees provided for in the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1941.  The aim in making these changes in the law relating to building societies was to facilitate them in their operations and enable them to play a greater part in the rehousing activities upon which the Government were engaged. As Senators are aware, other causes have operated to curtail these activities and, consequently, it will not be possible for building societies to take advantage of the provisions of this measure until the conclusion of the emergency.</P>
      <P>The only other point with which the Bill deals is that of collateral security. In determining the amount of an advance which a society may make to a borrower, the society in some cases takes into account any satisfactory additional security, as well as the freehold or leasehold security offered.  There can be no objection to that practice, but its legality is in some doubt and advantage is being taken of the introduction of this Bill to remove that doubt.  I do not think that there can be any great controversy about the measure.  The alterations in the law relating to building societies which it makes are, if anything, overdue.  I think that they should have been made earlier.  When normal conditions are restored, they will permit these building societies to play a larger part in housing activities than it has been possible for them to play heretofore.</P>

      <P>The Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936, provided for the payment of subsidies to the company established under that Act for the operation of air transport services during a period of five years from the date of the passing of the Act.  That limitation of the period during which subsidies might be paid was imposed because of the absence of experience as to the financial results of the operation of air transport services here and the desirability of ensuring that the position could be reviewed by the Oireachtas after the passage of a reasonable period.</P>
      <P>That period has now elapsed, but it is still necessary to maintain subsidy-payments to the air transport companies. The normal development of air transport services here was considerably interrupted by the outbreak of war and it is not feasible to operate them on a paying basis.  The Act imposed a limit of £500,000 on the amount which might be expended on subsidies.  In practice, that limit has not nearly been reached because the developments contemplated in connection with transatlantic air services have not occurred.  Something less than £100,000 has been paid in subsidies to date.  It is, consequently, unnecessary to change the limit of the total amount in the Principal Act but it is desirable to extend the period during which subsidies may be paid.  That is the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other change &mdash; a slight change &mdash; effected by the Bill relates to the submission of subsidy orders to the Dáil.  As the Act stands, subsidies cannot be paid until either the Order has been approved of by resolution of Dáil Eireann or 21 sitting days have elapsed.  That provision has been a matter of some inconvenience both to the Department of Industry and Commerce and the air companies.  It is proposed now that the subsidies be paid when the Order is made without, of course, interfering with the power of the Oireachtas to annul any subsidy order.  When the emergency is over and the question of the development of civil air services on a larger scale arises it will, of course, be necessary <Col N="1180" /> to come again to the Oireachtas to explain the Government's programme in that regard.  But it is desirable that existing arrangements remain unchanged for the time being and, consequently, it is necessary to extend the period of the subsidy in the manner proposed in this Bill which I recommend to the House.</P>

      <P>That, in the opinion of the Seanad, further steps require to be taken to encourage an increased production of wheat; in particular, the House recommends that the minimum price of 50/- per barrel for millable wheat, which has been guaranteed for the coming season, be assured to wheat growers over a period of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion has been put down by Senator Crosbie, Senator McGee, and myself.  Unfortunately I heard from Senator Baxter too late to add his name to the movers of the motion. Thus, it has the support of four persons with an interest in agriculture.  As I have said, it has been in the hands of the Clerk for practically a month. We postponed the motion so that in no circumstances would we give the impression that we were trying to interfere with the national effort or to upset the farming community during this particular time of sowing.  The main object of the motion is to second the representations which have been made in the Dáil to the Government from both sides of the House in connection with the want of energy which they <Col N="1183" /> have displayed in this very grave emergency, and to ensure a measure of security for farmers who have been doing for years past, and are doing this year, their utmost to provide the essential food for our people.  It seems to me almost incredible that the machinery of a modern Government in an agricultural country like this, which has hitherto been practically untouched by the war, and whose main competitors have been practically eliminated, has not been able to save the country from being short of essential foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>What is the position?  We are short of bread for the people.  We have a very nebulous idea as to the amount of cereals we will get next year.  In a reply to a question addressed to the Minister in the Dáil, asking him whether he could state approximately the acreage of wheat, oats and barley which had been set in the country up to date, the Minister said that he was quite unable to do so.  So we really do not know where we are.  We know that our poultry industry has dwindled almost by some 2,000,000 head, and our pig production will soon be a thing of the past.  For the time being we have saved our brewery trade by a deal with a country whose people require our products and who are fighting a hard battle for themselves and, incidentally for us.  With a firm policy at the outset of the war two and a half years ago, putting aside political considerations, with a little study of past history and proper organisation of our country's main resources, we would have made ourselves not only absolutely self-sufficient but would have had a surplus to export and with which to make money.  Elsewhere, I have seen a good deal of personal abuse of the Minister and I deprecate it.  Clever, offensive verbiage may be all right for the crossroads, but it cuts no ice in &ldquo;higher&rdquo; debate.  In this matter the Minister himself is not entirely to blame; this unfortunate position is the collective responsibility of the Government and of the Taoiseach, in particular, as its Head. One and all, they must have been aware of the decline of our economy <Col N="1184" /> and collectively they should have taken adequate and drastic steps to settle it. The Minister is not quite without blame; he must bear his own part of it and that a very considerable part. He is the man most able to tell his colleagues the real situation, to warn them of a worsening outlook, to recommend appropriate remedies and to resign if his advice was not accepted. When we were last discussing this matter in the House, he hurriedly left us to tell the country that there was to be no increase in the price of wheat; only a few days before the price which we were then asking for was granted.  I do not wish to be offensive, but I must say that his attitude in regard to this crisis, when he could have shown himself to be a master man, the biggest man in the country is very difficult to understand and certainly does not make for confidence.</P>
    <P>Figures are rather apt to weary people, but I must give the House two simple statistics.  The first is that we require 2,700,000 sacks of flour to feed our people and, now that we are milling 100 per cent., it means that number of barrels of wheat.  The second is that in the year 1929, when we were feeding and exporting at a very high figure, we produced 1,800,000 cwts. of offals and we imported 470,000.  We mixed that with maize and fed pigs, poultry and cattle, to produce bacon, eggs, milk and butter.  Now, we should be growing barley and wheat in equal quantity to make that good, but as it is we have nothing at all in the shape of wheat offals and no steps whatever are being taken to produce them. There is very little wonder that we stand as we do, and that pigs, eggs, poultry and butter, instead of being lucrative export commodities, will very soon be things of the past, even in our own dietary.  The situation has been accentuated a good deal by the fact that no steps have been taken to provide an alternative to maize.</P>
    <P>I must say I find it extremely hard to blame those farmers who have fed wheat to their animals.  It is in the present situation rather like jailing a woman for stealing to feed her starving child for whom the State has made <Col N="1185" /> no provision.  The position which gave cause for these prosecutions should never have been allowed to arise.  The full responsibility for the want of essential animal and human food and the decline of our export trade rests not on the Minister individually but on the Government as a whole, whose business it is to see that people and animals are cared for.  The obvious course would have been in the beginning &mdash; though I know it is easy to be wise after the event &mdash; to put under cereals a sufficient acreage to meet all requirements without considering recourse to imports.  Instead, we have had a half-hearted policy of voluntary tillage, of advertisements to the country&mdash;&ldquo;Feed the people&rdquo;; &ldquo;Grow more wheat&rdquo;, and so on &mdash; and that policy has not been vigorously enforced. The result is that, so far as supplies of food are concerned, we are going steadily from bad to worse. Exemptions seem to be far too wide in their application.  The estimates made by inspectors of what is arable land or not err, particularly in the grass lands, very much on the side of leniency.</P>
    <P>I am aware of cases where after inspections have been undertaken action has been postponed until it has been too late to do any sowing for this season or no action has been taken at all.  No doubt there would be difficulties in taking this course which I am now going to propose to the Minister in a constructive manner.  I think that the difficulties, if they cannot all be overcome <i>in toto</i>, can be overcome in very great part.  What I suggest to him now in general terms is that when he leaves this House he goes to his officials and says: &ldquo;I want your proposals with a view to ensuring sufficient food to feed the whole of this country in the 1943 season.  I also want wheat offals, and oats to equal production and imports in 1929, and a barley programme to make good the maize which we used in the same year.  I want you to work generally on these lines.  You can envisage compulsory tillage up to your requirements to achieve the object in view, on all the 218,000 holdings in the country which are over £7 valuation, and you can give <Col N="1186" /> a bonus to all smaller holdings which contract to grow wheat and vegetables.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;First of all, I want you to work out the quota which must be allotted to each, in order to ensure a sufficiency of bread, and then add what is necessary to find the bran and pollard we require.  Then I would like you to go on to the oats, because the straw from the oats will, in very good part, make up for the hay which is lost after the first year of compulsory tillage and, what is more, will make up to a certain extent for the want of essentials in the country, owing to the fact that there will be more manure made through the tying up of animals in the winter. Finally, I want you to tell me where and how to get the barley I require. You naturally have to make considerable exemptions per bag for unsuitable land, but the existing easements on the good land must be tightened up to provide machinery and seed on loan, where it is really necessary.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Get out a scheme for a tillage committee in each county to carry out definite regulations with the assistance of the Gárdaí and L.S.F., and make those regulations as simple as you possibly can.&rdquo;  I think you should have somebody up here to whom the various county committees could apply to in difficulty, somebody who could give them an immediate answer and let them get on with the job.  I would say: &ldquo;I want you to draft an order for the Government to stop all further emigration of agricultural workers, and, finally, I want you to give me an estimate of what subsidies will be required to get this scheme into being. These proposals you must give me by the 15th June, and then, when I have looked them over, I propose to discuss them with a Committee of both Houses, before I put them into shape for the Government to sanction.  I do want you officials to bear in mind that a full provision of cereals with a margin to cover a bad season or additional requirements, is the first consideration for this country, and the second is the restablishment of our export trade even if we have got to give subsidies in very large measure.  But, before that, the stuff must be there and it <Col N="1187" /> has got to be brought up to the highest possible point.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This proposal sounds a rather lengthy one, but it is in general terms. It does imply that somebody grasps the nettle &mdash; and that quickly and firmly. So far as the food situation is concerned the nettle requires to be grasped very quickly and very firmly indeed.  That is the proposal I have to make.  As regards the second part of the amendment, it is going from the general to what I call the particular. If the Minister accepts my proposal and goes into it with his officials, there is very little need to say anything more.  If, on the other hand, he thinks the present situation is satisfactory, then we must press for the recognition of the effort which is being made by the majority of the farmers to meet the present emergency, an effort which would want to be continued, and ask that wheat growers be assured of a guaranteed price for so long as hostilities continue and for not less than three years thereafter.  This further period is to allow for readjustments in the event of post-war conditions calling for a change of economy.</P>
    <P>I have been prompted to put forward this proposal by the fact that the Minister appears to realise the importance of giving a guarantee of this nature, in so far as he told Senator Crosbie at a public meeting in Cork City that he was prepared to consider the matter.  As a matter of fact, we are asking no more than the security of the capital invested in what amounts to a new undertaking on a large scale, and only on terms similar to those which have been accorded broadcast to a very large number of industrial concerns which have been born, and have lived, and have died &mdash; some of them, not all of them &mdash; in this country during the last few years, and which the agricultural community have paid for <i>in toto.</i>  If the Government, on the other hand, are not disposed to give us this guarantee the implication is very clear, and that is that if hostilities were to cease and as soon as cheap wheat can be imported, as well as cheap maize, the farmer with increased <Col N="1188" /> tillage could be left high and dry with a large extent of uneconomic tillage and without the means, in the shape of money, to readjust his economy. However, there is very ample precedent for the necessity of this guarantee when we recollect the effect of the repeal of the Corn Production Act in 1919 after the last war.  The result was that many thousands of farmers were ruined &mdash; stuck in the banks for years afterwards &mdash; and quantities of good arable land, which could have gone back to grass, instead of being sown down was &ldquo;tumbled down&rdquo; to very poor pasture indeed.</P>
    <P>I have one word more to say for this motion.  We have advisedly used the word &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; as regards 50/- per barrel.  I say definitely that we are satisfied with it, at the present time, but we naturally reserve the right to press for an increase in price in proportion to the amount by which farm costings and the cost of living of the farmer may increase in the coming years.</P>

      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After the word &ldquo;recommends&rdquo; to insert the words:&mdash;&ldquo;the continuance of the Tillage Order amended by the inclusion of a clause providing for a compulsory area under wheat and on these conditions further recommends&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say that the reason I put down this amendment was because I desired to get the House to discuss certain aspects of the tillage problem. On the last occasion, when I put down a motion of a similar nature, someone suggested that it had been inspired.  I explained at the time that it had not, but, in case anybody is under a similar impression now, I should like to explain that no one saw this amendment until I handed it to the Clerk on Friday evening.  I think it is fairly clear that emergency conditions will exist even for some time after the war has finished, and it is important that <Col N="1189" /> this country should not be allowed to drift into the position which it occupied many years ago.  We should never allow the country to drift back to a non-tillage policy.  In the years that followed the last war, we saw the land gradually going out of tillage, probably to a large extent because tillage did not pay, but also because many people in the country have a distaste for tillage, to say the least of it.  The result was that about 1929 the best price which people could get for wheat was 13/- a barrel.  In 1931, I think, oats was imported here from Russia, and the price fell to about 6/- a barrel.  During those years, not only were we importing wheat from Canada and Australia, but we also imported it from Germany, and we went to Russia for oats.  During those years we called ourselves an agricultural nation, although we were importing probably half the agricultural products we required to feed ourselves.</P>
    <P>If this country is ever to become a really prosperous State we will have to put the agricultural community on its feet, and we can only do that by getting them back to the plough.  We have to create a situation in which the man on the land will get an economic price for what he produces.  When I refer to an economic price, I mean a price which will give him something for himself and his family after he has paid his costs of production and given a decent wage to his workers.  I would argue that tillage need not interfere with our cattle trade.  In fact, I could bring forward strong evidence to show that the more tillage we have the more cattle and the better cattle we will have.  Under the last Administration, there was an inquiry into derating, and various people from all parts of the country were invited to give evidence.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Baxter was a member of that commission.  Among the people who gave evidence before it was Mr. D.J. Cogan, who was a Member of Parliament for East Wicklow, a very successful business man and farmer, and a very successful producer of pedigree stock.  He is a man who probably knows as much about agriculture and the cattle trade as most people, and in his evidence <Col N="1190" /> before that commission he advocated that, instead of derating, we should give £1 for every acre tilled.  He based his whole idea on my present argument that the more land we have under tillage the more cattle and the better cattle we will have.  In a large portion of the south of Ireland at the present time you will find what is simply a grass industry.  The people send their milk to the creameries, and when they put in their cows in winter they simply throw them a bit of hay. The same applies in parts of other counties, where you would not see even a potato patch.  No country can prosper under those conditions.  We have to get the people back to tillage, and, if we are to give the prices which are suggested, we must keep our Tillage Orders in operation.</P>
    <P>In Leinster, the part of Ireland with which I am most familiar, we have to till fairly extensively, because it is necessary to house-feed our cattle in winter.  In my district I doubt if there was one man who had to plough an extra acre under the Compulsory Tillage Order, although most of them, I am glad to say, did so.  There was no obligation on them to do any extra tillage because they were already tilling the necessary amount.  I think that, if dairying is to prosper in the south, we will have to put it on that basis.  If we do not go back to the plough there is no use talking about keeping the people in the country. With regard to wheat, I am glad that on the last occasion the Seanad did not take the Minister's advice, but passed a motion in favour of a percentage of wheat being included in the area of tillage.  I argued at that time that I did not want to impose an undue burden on anybody.  I merely suggested that, in the case of a man who had to till 25 acres, a fifth or a sixth of that should be wheat.  We hear arguments about hilly ground and so on.  In my county, we have to contend with all those difficulties and we are able to overcome them.  If any district is found to be particularly unsuitable for wheat growing, arrangements could easily be made for its exemption.</P>
    <P>A man with ten acres of arable land <Col N="1191" /> would have to till only two and a half acres, and surely he could include a rood or half a rood of wheat.  If that does not happen, I am very doubtful that we will get the required amount of wheat this year, or anything like it.</P>
    <P>There are farmers who have gone out of their way to provide the country's requirements of wheat, because they believe that it is their duty to do so.  But there are others who, rather than plough their own land, went out and took the land of people who were not in a position to till it. These people had let their machinery go, and simply set their land, and the farmers to whom I have referred, who did not wish to plough up their own farms, took that land and tilled it merely for the purpose of fulfilling their obligations.  It will not produce anything like the same amount of wheat as their own land, but those people prefer to do that rather than take the chance of doing what they believe would be an injury to their own land.  One man whom I have in mind had land which would probably produce three barrels of wheat to every one barrel which myself or other people around me could produce.</P>
    <P>That spirit prevails all over the country.  From all parts of Ireland, I hear of people who have the type of land which has not been used for probably 50 or 60 years, and which has the necessary fertility to produce the wheat we require for our people.  A lot of those farmers are the very people who expect the younger men in the country to join the Defence Forces and, if necessary, to sacrifice their lives, but they themselves are not prepared to till their land.  I am sure Senator McGee and other people here will agree that wheat does not do the amount of harm that it is alleged to do the land, and that many people have grown wheat successfully and have their lands still in good fettle.  Some people, however, have the idea that a wheat crop injures their land, and they are determined to take no risk.</P>
    <P>I would even argue that even if it did the harm to the land that some people allege it does, it is the duty of these <Col N="1192" /> people to the country to grow wheat this year and next.  That is why I put down this amendment.  I am in favour of the motion, and I agree with a good deal of what Senator The McGillycuddy has said.  I agree with the provision of a proper price, because if you are to grow wheat or anything else, you will have to get an economic price in order to keep people in employment and to keep men on the land.  I realise that from the State point of view there are difficulties in providing money, but the position is that it has got to be done, and it has to be done in the years ahead.  I want to see that everyone has to toe the line in this matter, and that we will not have a position in which&mdash; as anyone who has been through the national movement will agree is often to be found &mdash; people will turn away, will turn their backs when they are required to do anything for the country, but will turn up when there is anything going.  I want to make these people toe the line and to do their duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator and I are very good friends, and there was a playful element behind this.  I accept in full measure the withdrawal he has made.  I cannot agree with him, fully at any rate, on the terms of this motion, and I think I should state, or try to state, perhaps, on what my opinion is based.  The present times are entirely <Col N="1193" /> abnormal, and I think it would be very unwise to make the present conditions a basis for future policy.  We cannot dissociate ourselves from the whole of the world movement.</P>
      <P>I think we should go so far, even in this small island, as to have regard to the Atlantic Charter, which in particular suggests that it is all these national barriers and artificial restrictions that are the root cause of the present world conflict, and if the world is ever to get back to a policy of sanity, it must aim at a much freer movement of goods and commodities between countries.  While this doctrine of self-sufficiency is very useful, and indeed very necessary, in time of war, if all countries continue to perpetuate it, we will find what we call the peace when it does come will only be a breathing space before the next war.  Working on that principle of access to raw materials and freedom of world trade, I feel that the future of the world and of this country will to a large extent be determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel it is a great mistake to commit ourselves to the future by any artificial conditions that prevail to-day. This high price of wheat necessary now imposes a very considerable burden on the taxpayer, and surely the time will come when we will try to relieve the burden of taxation and get back to a far greater degree of economic freedom and to conditions which are the basis of economic reality and not to conditions of scarcity.  I am fully in sympathy with Senator Byrne in the desire to encourage tillage in the country and that agriculture should always be our primary consideration, but let us be quite clear about this.  There is enormous scope in agriculture for improved technique, and the more you protect agriculture by means of artifice and artificial prices, the more you are diverting the urge which is necessary for these improved methods.  I do not mention this in any sense as a derogatory comparison between our country and others, but put yourself this question: if, by some occult process, you could substitute Dane for Irish, sex for sex on the land of this country, does anyone deny that there would <Col N="1194" /> be a transformation in agriculture in five years?</P>
    <P>We have to face that challenge.  The Danes have brought agricultural technique to a much higher plane than we have.  Until we realise that and improve our technique in the agricultural field and operate similar methods to the Danes, we can never hope to see agriculture in the healthy position it should be in.  There will always be the tendency to go crying to Governments for protection and prices, artificial aids of every kind.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I would ask the Government to do two things.  I would ask them when time is opportune&mdash; perhaps the present is not, although a great opportunity is being missed &mdash; to get scientific research on this whole question of agricultural costs.  The Minister knows that there was machinery for ascertaining the cost of production under his predecessor, that that was scrapped and has never been revived.  I cannot understand why any Government Department can expect to fix prices and to deal with the whole agricultural industry on an economic, scientific and methodical basis, unless it has accurate knowledge of the cost of production.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to have regard to the recommendation made many years ago by the first Commission on Agriculture appointed in this country, which was that there should be a certain number of economic demonstration farms.  Admittedly, it is important to have plant research and feeding experiments and the research of that kind which is carried on in the present agricultural schools, but I do think it should be possible for a farmer to go somewhere near where he lives and see a place that is run as a paying farm, where the balance sheet and figures are available.  That would be the best demonstration you could possibly have. The farmer might see that this demonstration farm was not a very grand place, that it was not very different from any farm he knew of near him, but that it was a paying farm.  You will find a far greater revival of interest in a demonstration of that kind as compared with plots which <Col N="1195" /> indicate what measures are being used on farm cultivation.</P>
    <P>I do hope the House will not take the lines I have gone on unsympathetically. As to the need for increased tillage, I do feel that it should be brought about by a natural economic means and not by the artificial policy of price subsidy.  I do not think that a proper agricultural economy will ever be evolved if we put a large financial burden for our primary foods on the backs of the taxpayers.</P>

My earliest recollection of public life is as a member of a farmers' organisation which came to Dublin.  There were some very prominent Guinness's shareholders at the meeting, and I think Senator Sir John Keane was there.  At the time, what was uppermost in our minds &mdash; correctly or incorrectly advised, as we might be &mdash;was that the great concern of Guinness was functioning beautifully and paying excellent dividends, while the barley-growers of Louth and of some of the southern counties were being starved.  We believed that the British authorities permitted a monopoly that choked and stifled every small brewery in Ireland.  When that was done, Guinness notified us that they were about to quit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a most cultured phrase but, to the ordinary agriculturist, it is a sickening delusion.  &ldquo;Money makes the mare go&rdquo; and it is very hard to get farmers to take on all the new technique that time prescribes when rates and taxes are taken from them whatever livelihood they possess. Somebody suggested that the farmers let the people down and Senator Sir John Keane suggested that, if we transplanted the Danes to Ireland, they would get more out of the farms and the farm labourers than we were getting. History shows that, whenever they have gone to foreign parts, in times of peace or war, the courage, determination and grit of the sons of our Irish farmers and farm labourers have been second to none, England not excluded.  If we look back over the history of the past 50 years &mdash; we do not need to read to learn it &mdash; we must admit that the farmers have had many knocks and the labourers, too.  Yet, they have maintained a great deal of which this nation has every right to be proud.  In these busy days, if you go down the country, you will find that, after hours of very hard work, the farmers and farm labourers are answering loyally every call that the Christian Church brings to them.  When I hear that the farmers &ldquo;let the country down&rdquo;, I look around and everywhere I see monuments to their Christian Church and faith.  Those are to be found in more churches than one <Col N="1197" /> but, principally, in the Catholic Church, showing that, out of their poor resources, they have never failed to contribute. Every parish bears that out. Every ship that ever left Ireland with emigrants carried a farmer's son or daughter who maintained that principle abroad.  They are people of whom we should be proud.  If the farmers are accused of &ldquo;letting the people down&rdquo; in this island home of ours in the past two years, it is because the farmers have found that there has been nothing for themselves for the past 50 years and that they themselves have been &ldquo;let down&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As regards wheat growing, I was considering in 1932 where I was going to stand.  Several of my friends around me at home and on my council and county committee were doing the same thing.  The wheat-growing campaign was inaugurated.  A committee was appointed and I examined the findings of that committee.  So far as they went, they appeared sound and sensible. Although I differed widely from the political Party responsible, I had no hesitation in saying that, so far as it went, it was a wise and prudent move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went into it so far as my moderate means would allow, and I do not think that any supporter of the Government went farther.  My reason was that I had been keeping balance sheets and, for years, I could see where I was slipping. In the scheme then placed before the country, I saw that the whole economy of the nation could be fairly adjusted as between the agricultural, or producing, community, on the one hand, and the urban, or consuming community, on the other hand. If wheat were a paying proposition, it appeared to me that it would maintain the farmer and would give the labourer something like a living wage. It was easy to balance it because it called for a sacrifice, on the one hand, to make up for the advantages the offer possessed.  I have seen it grow for a year or two and I found that when your land was fresh and vigorous and new, it gave a crop from which you could anticipate a fairly good return, one out of which you could make a <Col N="1198" /> living and which would permit your labourer to live and would be an encouragement to you.</P>
    <P>Time went on.  The year 1936 gave an exceedingly poor return in my part of the country.  I found that there were some costings coming in then that needed national investigation.  At that time it was felt by many of us that the agricultural industry should be looked after, particularly in relation to wheat growing, in exactly the same way as the Government looked after the various factories it had successfully established.  The Government should see that a decent livelihood is provided for the men working on the land and that there is a dividend to pay out to the owner of the land for the capital he had invested in it.  These circumstances lacking, as they have been, I do not know that it is quite right to blame any member of the community for not going into wheat growing or into tillage with the enthusiasm that the nation now, in this hour of crisis, expects, demands and prosecutes and persecutes farmers for not showing.</P>
    <P>My friend, Senator Sir John Keane, suggests we should not base our future economy on the present emergency. To some extent, he is right, but if exceptional steps require to be taken by any section of the community, why should they be sacrificed for other sections unless the taxpayer is expected to toe the line?  When, therefore, I hear of farmers evading and avoiding tillage, perhaps because their means do not warrant it, I think it should be made perfectly clear that it is expected that the taxpayers will recoup these people for the losses that they envisage and in some cases only too correctly envisage.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of last January 1 was fortunate enough to be one of a deputation which met the Minister and the Taoiseach.  The costs of production, as far as they could be obtained by me and others, were then minutely examined, and 50/- was suggested as the minimum price which would give some encouragement to the farmers and give anything like a reasonably increased acreage of tillage.  I myself furnished figures, and it was pointed out that <Col N="1199" /> since the inception of the present wheat-growing scheme, every possible obstacle was placed or came in the way of other branches of farming.  The economic war ruined the cattle trade and many in it.  Just when the economic war was over, the foot-and-mouth disease came along as a further curse. Despite the effect of all the platform propaganda that was then ruling in the land, nothing like the acreage required was ever attained.  It could not be hoped for after these eight or ten years if something drastic in the way of price encouragement was not immediately attempted.  Soon afterwards a price of 50/- was announced.  I think that anyone with his ear to the ground in the country will admit that the end justified the means.  A considerably increased acreage was immediately obtained. So far so good.  Generally speaking, the promise of a satisfactory result has some foundation.  I do not know what southern Ireland has had, but we have had some glorious rain, thank God, in my part of the country; but to state that the nation has reached the stage of independence, relying on its own produce alone, would be futile.  It is admitted that it has not.  It is hoped that a further effort will be made, but I am proud to be associated with Senator The McGillycuddy and Senator Crosbie.  I was particularly pleased to read Senator Crosbie made some suggestion to the Minister, and I hope that as a result of this, and of our motion tonight, some arrangement will be arrived at.

      <P>That Seanad Eireann is of opinion that the Emergency Powers (Importation of Fabrics) Order, 1942, should be revoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Importation of Fabrics Order was made on March 13th and its object according to a statement made in the Dáil by the Minister for Supplies was to secure that the fabrics available for this country from Great Britain should be taken by importers here in the manner most advantageous to this country under present circumstances. The Order was not made for the purpose of protecting any Irish industry, and it was not, I assume, the Minister's intention to reduce the total fabrics imported from Great Britain.  In his statements in the Dáil in reply to questions by Deputy Mulcahy, the Minister appeared to base his arguments in favour of the Order on two main assumptions, firstly, that all the fabrics covered by the Order were at the date of the Order restricted by the British Government as to the total quantity to be exported to Éire and, <Col N="1201" /> secondly, that this Order would secure that the total quantity available to us will be in the form of the cheapest or most suitable cloths.</P>
    <P>My reason for moving this motion is that I hope to be able to convince this House that the Minister's arguments were not based on facts &mdash; that he was quite wrong when he stated in the Dáil that artificial silk fabrics were restricted as to quantity when exported from the United Kingdom to Éire, and that the Order has already reduced the quantity of fabrics available for this country, thereby increasing unemployment.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear at the outset that I would be in favour of any steps which could be taken which could secure that such fabrics supplies as are available from Great Britain should be of types and quantities required for essential clothing at prices which the majority of our people can afford to pay, provided, of course, that nothing is done to prevent the total amount available from reaching this country.  It is because I am satisfied that the Importation of Fabrics Order has reduced and may further reduce the total quantity available without increasing the import total of cheaper fabrics that I believe this Order should be rescinded as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In order that Senators may understand the position, I propose to set out briefly the steps taken by the Minister in relation to this Order.  The Order itself prohibited after April 20th last the importation, except under licence, of all woven and knitted fabrics made of cotton, linen, wool, silk or artificial silk except floor coverings.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the Order was made&mdash; in or about March 20th &mdash; a circular, No. I.F.1, was issued by the Department of Supplies in which it was stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In order to facilitate the negotiation of transactions by importers, the Minister for Supplies gives notice that the grant of licences will be conditioned by considerations of type and price.  For the present, licences will be issued on application for the classes of goods set out hereunder <Col N="1202" /> provided the prices are within the limits shown.  Applications for licences for fabrics other than those set out below or for fabrics of the types set out below at prices higher than the maximum prices set out below will be considered and licences may or may not be granted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then followed in circular I.F.1 a list of classes of fabrics and maximum prices.  I criticised this circular in detail in the Seanad on March 24th and I need not now repeat what I said on that occasion.  The Minister for Supplies was not present.  I think I convinced the House that the prices in that circular showed only little knowledge of the actual prices at which goods could be obtained.  That my criticism was fully justified is shown by the fact that the Minister mended his hand, and in or about April 20th a new circular, No. I.F.5, was issued, replacing I.F.1.</P>
    <P>The preamble to the circular remained the same, but the maximum prices were in all but four cases very substantially increased.  The increases varied from 15 per cent. to as much as 87 per cent.  For instance, cotton flannelette and shirting were increased from 1/4 to 2/6 and art silk dress cloth from 3/6 to 5/-.  Practically one month had elapsed before the new circular was issued, and during that time no importer could buy fabrics from Great Britain with any certainty that he would be allowed to import them unless delivery could be guaranteed before April 20th or unless they came within the classes or prices contained in the first circular &mdash; a circular containing prices some of which were absurd and which was later withdrawn.  It is impossible to estimate what quantity of fabrics were lost to this country during that month, but to my knowledge some goods were offered during this period which had to be refused. Under present conditions it is quite impossible to guarantee delivery within one month, even if goods are finished and ready for despatch, which is rarely the case when orders are placed with manufacturers.</P>
    <P>After April 20th, importers here representing manufacturers, makers up <Col N="1203" /> of garments and the distributing trade, applied for licences for goods which they had on order which did not come within the classes or maximum prices in circular I.F.5 and which they had been unable to get sent to them in order to arrive before April 20th.  In many cases these licences were refused and the importers had no option but to ask the suppliers in Great Britain to cancel the orders.  As far as I can ascertain, licences were granted where the goods had been invoiced or were lying in the customs and in many other cases refused.  I do not know the quantity of goods which had to be cancelled and which were lost to Éire, but I fear the quantity was not inconsiderable.</P>
    <P>On the 13th May a notice appeared in the Press which showed that the Minister had again changed his mind. This notice did not alter the Order nor did it withdraw circular I.F.5, but it stated that import licences would be granted for the importation of fabrics without reference to type or price, where the goods arrived in this country before June 30th next.  This notice is an admission by the Minister for Supplies that his original date of April 20th was wrong, and also an admission that he was not justified in refusing licences to importers who had applied to him before this later notice appeared.</P>
    <P>This latest action of the Minister seems to me to be open to criticism, in that it gives a definite advantage to the importers who ignored his two circulars and went on ordering fabrics from Great Britain.  Importers who stopped placing orders for fabrics not covered by the Minister's circulars are in a much more unfavourable position, as they have now very little time in which to place orders and to get delivery. The time taken for goods in transit from Great Britain varies greatly, and six weeks and longer often elapse between the date of despatch and the date of delivery.</P>
    <P>I have stated briefly what has actually occurred under this Order so that the House may have knowledge of the facts.  I could easily criticise the circulars and notices issued by the <Col N="1204" /> Minister in greater detail, but I do not propose to do so now because it is the whole policy which I believe to be wrong and injurious to trade and employment at a time of exceptional difficulty for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The fabrics prohibited under this Order are those made wholly or mainly of cotton, linen, wool, silk or artificial silk and I propose to deal with these separately as the circumstances differ in each case.  I will take linen first.  Production of linen fabrics for civilian purposes ceased some time ago.  If, as I am informed, there are still some stocks of linen cloth which the British Government is allowing to come to Éire, I cannot think of any reason why it should not be allowed to be imported here.  The quantity is small and a refusal to take these goods cannot possibly result in increased imports of other fabrics.  It would mean simply a loss to this country.  To the best of my knowledge and belief the position with regard to real silk is almost identical with that of linen and I have not the slightest idea what the Minister expected to achieve by including linen and real silk fabrics in the Order.  The importance, however, of linen and real silk fabrics is not nearly as great as that of other fabrics covered by the Order.</P>
    <P>The action of the Minister with regard to artificial silk fabrics, which are of great importance, is incomprehensible to me.  He stated in the Dáil, in reply to a question, that exports of artificial silk fabrics from Great Britain to Éire were restricted as to total quantity.  Everyone in the trade knew that very large quantities of artificial silk fabrics had been imported this year from Great Britain&mdash;according to my information, at least three times those imported for a similar period in 1940&mdash; and the trade knew that British suppliers had stated as late as the end of April that there were no restrictions on exports of fabrics which were 100 per cent. artificial silk.  When the Minister made his statement in the Dáil I was amazed but I assumed that he had some secret information of which the trade in Great Britain and Éire was unaware.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> Accordingly, I took steps to ascertain the true position from a responsible authority in Great Britain and I was informed definitely on May 9th that there is not and has not been since the outbreak of the war any restriction on the export to Éire of fabrics which are 100 per cent. rayon.  In view of this undoubted fact, I would like to know on what grounds the Minister justifies his action in refusing licences for the import of artificial silk fabrics over 5/- per square yard.  He admitted in the Dáil that importers had been obliged to cancel orders for rayon piece goods for which delivery had been promised by United Kingdom exporters.</P>
    <P>According to information given to me by an undoubted authority in the United Kingdom, it is quite clear that as long as the present position continues the exclusion from Eire of certain kinds of rayon fabrics which are not now available will in all probability mean a reduction of the total quantity of exports of rayon fabrics to Eire.  For example, I am informed, prohibition on imports of rayon fabrics over 5/- per square yard or of rayon fabrics for curtains or upholstery could not be compensated by an increase in the quantity of cheaper rayon fabrics not available or likely to be available during the next few months.</P>
    <P>As long as artificial silk fabrics are unrestricted as to quantity in export from Great Britain, it will not help the poorer classes to prevent such better quality fabrics as are available from entering this country.  In fact, it will have a contrary effect as the total quantity will be less and the richer classes, unable to obtain the best quality, will buy whatever is available, with the result that less will be left for the poorer people.  It is ridiculous to my mind, for the Minister to state as he did in the Dáil that there is an inducement for importers to use the most expensive class of goods because on these they make the most profit.  Generally speaking, the retail trade is divided &mdash; some cater for the better class trade, and some for the poorer classes.  Each retailer will buy as far as he possibly can the <Col N="1206" /> goods his customers require.  A retailer catering for the lower class trade will buy the cheapest fabrics he can get, and if he is forced to buy fabrics at a high price the probability is that he will get a lower profit owing to the keen competition which still exists in the drapery trade.</P>
    <P>As long as there is no restriction in quantity on artificial silk fabrics exported from the United Kingdom there is, I suggest, no case for restricting their importation here and even if the Minister will not rescind the Order as a whole he should remove artificial silk fabrics from it unless and until restrictions on export are imposed in Great Britain, and until he is satisfied that any restrictions on imports which he may make will fit in with the export restrictions on the other side so as to secure that all fabrics available will be imported to this country. Before I leave the question of artificial silk fabrics I would like to say that the authorities in Great Britain have acted in a generous manner in allowing large quantities of art silk fabrics to come to this country.  The greatly increased import is, I believe, largely due to the shortage of cotton fabrics and it has been a great gain to us to be able to obtain these artificial silk fabrics to take the place of cotton fabrics which could not be obtained here or in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to fabrics made from cotton or partly from cotton and partly from artificial silk is quite different from that of artificial silk.  Owing to the shortage of cotton fabrics the British Government have considered it necessary to restrict the export of fabrics containing cotton, with the exception of curtain net.</P>
    <P>According to my information, this restriction operates in the following manner: Every United Kingdom manufacturer or supplier who exported cotton piece goods to Eire during the year 1940 is permitted to export, during a definite period, 20 per cent. of the quantity of cotton piece goods exported by him in 1940.  The present period is from April 1st to June 30th, 1942.  This does not provide any guarantee that <Col N="1207" /> Éire will receive a total of 20 per cent. of its 1940 imports of cotton piece goods, because some United Kingdom suppliers may not be in a position to export goods equal to their full export quota or may be unable to obtain orders for the only types of piece goods which they are able to offer.</P>
    <P>It will be readily understood that many British manufacturers have great difficulties to contend with as a result of war conditions, and if Éire buyers do not take whatever piece goods are available during the next few months, there is every danger that they may have to do without. This is inevitable under present circumstances. I, personally, made inquiries as to whether, if Éire buyers did not wish to take what cotton fabrics were offered by British suppliers, it would be possible to provide other fabrics so as to bring the total export to Éire up to 20 per cent. of the 1940 exports, and I was informed that under existing conditions this was not practicable.  The Minister stated in the Dáil that it was his intention to secure that such quantities as can be obtained will be secured in the form of cheaper cloths.  He did not give any indication as to how this was to be done.  My information is that it is quite impracticable as far as the next few months are concerned.</P>
    <P>It seems to me obvious that it is impracticable. If a British manufacturer has a 20 per cent. allocation given to him for export to Éire, he can only use that by sending out the goods which he makes.  It is useless to ask a manufacturer of curtain or furnishing material to send, say, shirtings or dress fabrics in place of furnishing cloth on order, if he does not make suiting or dress materials.  It is just as useless to ask a British wholesale house to send substitutes for orders cancelled unless they happen to have the substitutes in stock or coming round at an early date, which, under present conditions, is rarely the case.  I am, therefore, satisfied that what the Minister said was his intention is not possible of achievement immediately.</P>
    <P>If it were practicable, I would agree <Col N="1208" /> with the aim of the Minister.  If, as I am satisfied is the case, the Importation of Fabrics Order has reduced and may further reduce during the next few months the total cotton fabrics imported into this country, then I contend that it is bad policy and should be rectified as soon as possible.  It may be impossible to undo any harm that has been done, but further harm could be prevented by an immediate revocation of the Order.  A new Order could be made at a later date, if and when the Minister is satisfied that it is necessary, and when he is satisfied that it will fit in with arrangements made in Great Britain, so that no fabrics will be lost to this country which would otherwise have been available.</P>
    <P>Personally I do not believe that it will ever be necessary to restrict imports of cotton fabrics into this country.  It is well known in the trade that the British authorities are now organising production in Great Britain to ensure that the cotton fabrics produced will be utility cloths at the lowest practicable prices.  This British utility programme will not be in full swing, I am reliably informed, until September or October next at the earliest.  Once it is in full force the principal cotton fabrics available for Éire will be such portion of these utility cloths as the British authorities will permit to be exported to Éire.</P>
    <P>Turning to woollen fabrics, I am not as clear as to the details of the British restrictions on these fabrics as I am with regard to cotton and art silk fabrics of which I have a good deal of personal experience.  I do know, however, that there is a serious scarcity of these fabrics and that their export from Great Britain is definitely restricted. I also know that the restriction operates, as in cotton, by the allocation of certain quantities to British exporters for export to Éire.  I further know that the Importation of Fabrics Order has caused consternation amongst members of the men's tailoring trade here and amongst some garment manufacturers.</P>
    <P>I have seen letters to members of the tailoring trade from their United Kingdom suppliers showing that allocations <Col N="1209" /> have been made for exports to Éire for a period to October 4th next. The association representing this trade have issued a statement that they cannot obtain any woollen fabrics from the United Kingdom suitable for men's tailoring at 6/- per square yard or under, and if the cloth now offered them for the period to October 4th is not purchased it will certainly be lost to Éire.</P>
    <P>The statement issued by the Secretary of the Merchant Tailors' Association further states &mdash; I quote from the document issued by the association:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As most of the cloths produced in Ireland were made from English yarns of Australian wool, and as such yarns are now available only in small quantities, there is a great shortage of Irish material.  If merchant tailors cannot renew their stocks from either English or Irish sources, they can only keep their staffs, which are nearly all married men, employed as long as actual stocks last, which in many cases will be for a very short time only.  This Order should be suspended immediately, as time is a most important consideration.  Materials are short in England, and the quantities held by the wholesale firms there are being reduced every day.  If the materials are not allowed in at once, nothing will be available in a short time to Irish firms.  My association made representations to the Minister for Supplies on the 1st May, and by 'phone twice since then, stressing that time was a most important consideration.  Notwithstanding this, no intimation was received as to whether the goods available will be allowed into this country if ordered, until the notice appeared in Wednesday morning's Press stating that materials would be allowed in under licence, irrespective of price, until the 30th June.  This, in the opinion of my association, is very little use owing to delays in transit and the fact that the British export licences are operative until the 4th October.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked a specific question with reference to the tailoring trade on 30th April.  He admitted <Col N="1210" /> that he had refused licences for the import of woollen cloth over 6/- per square yard.  He said he could not state where woollen materials suitable for making suits for men could be obtained at the price of 6/- per square yard, but that importers had asked for licences for the importation of fabrics of this description in considerable quantities.  It is difficult to reconcile this statement of the Minister with the statement issued by the Merchant Tailors' Association.  I wonder how the Minister knows that the woollen cloths at or under 6/- per square yard for which licences were applied were cloths suitable for men's suits.</P>
    <P>There is no separate category in circular I.F.5 for woollen fabrics for men's wear, and I wonder if the Minister has confused woollen cloths for ladies' or children's wear (of which there is a quantity available under 6/- per square yard) with cloths for men's wear.  If not I cannot explain the discrepancy.  It seems, however, clear to me that woollen fabrics for men's wear should be excluded from the Order at least until October 4th, to enable the present allocations to be completed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also refused licences for woollen cloths over 11½ ounces per square yard in weight.  This may keep out the heavier cloths which would be desirable for winter wear.  I wonder why the Minister has done this. He has spent which time emphasising the shortage of fuel, and if we believe him, as I certainly do, we seem to be in for a hard time next winter.  Why then exclude heavier cloths if they can be obtained?</P>
    <P>The latest action of the Minister by way of mending his hand was the announcement on May 13th to which I have already referred stating that he will give licences without restriction of price or type if the goods arrive before June 30th.  I have been in touch with most of the classes of manufacturers and traders affected by the Order and I have not met one which regards this new announcement as satisfactory.  If the Minister had said he would give licences for goods despatched from the senders before a fixed date I could <Col N="1211" /> have understood it, though I would not have approved of June 30th.  You cannot deal with a British manufacturer or supplier on the basis of the dates goods may reach Éire.  They have no control over transit at any time, and they will not risk sending goods if there is any possible risk of their being returned to them.  Why should they, especially under present circumstances, when they can dispose of all their production with the greatest of ease?</P>
    <P>But apart altogether from the question of time taken in transit, the fact remains that British manufacturers will not accept any orders on the understanding that they will be cancelled if not ready on a given date. They say, and I am sure they are right, that while the war lasts it is impossible to estimate the time it may take to make and finish goods.  They may at any time have to act on orders of their own Government and concentrate on Government supplies, leaving over export orders until these are completed.</P>
    <P>Since the announcement appeared in the Press on May 13th a number of Irish importers have received communications from firms in Great Britain with whom they had placed orders. They have been informed by these United Kingdom exporters that they are not willing to forward the goods on order unless and until they receive a guarantee that the goods will be admitted into Éire at whatever date the goods arrive.  In some cases the reason for this action by British exporters is due to the fear of delays in transit but in other cases they say the goods are in making and they are not in a position to know when they will be ready.  This has created a serious situation and unless remedied at once may result in the loss of fabrics for this country.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Minister has failed to realise the undoubted fact that the greatest asset we have in the matter of supplies from Great Britain lies not in anything his Department can do but in personal contacts between our buyers and British <Col N="1212" /> exporters.  The British public has its mind on the war and I doubt if it cares whether or not we get fabrics.  It is due to the friendliness and goodwill between manufacturers and traders on both sides that supplies have been as good as they have been up to the present.  Government interference cuts across this personal contact and goodwill and should be avoided except where absolutely unavoidable.  It should be the function of the Department of Supplies to help Irish firms to get supplies not to get them for them except when the Irish traders have failed through the action of the British Government.</P>
    <P>I wonder does the Minister realise the extent of the resentment felt by British suppliers against the cancellation of orders caused by his action. Suppliers in Great Britain are working under extraordinary difficulties including shortage of raw material and reduced staffs.  The large majority of them are anxious to do their best for their old customers in this country and elsewhere.  It never occurred to them that anybody during the war would refuse to accept delivery of the very reduced quantities for which they had been able to accept orders in the case of cotton and woollen goods and they naturally resent the trouble of having to re-sell the goods elsewhere even though they can easily do so.  Now as a result of the Minister's action they are expressing doubt as to whether they should accept orders for Éire at all as the Irish Government may suddenly refuse to allow such orders to be executed when the goods are ready.</P>
    <P>A very considerable quantity of the supplies obtained by this country has been the result of visits of Irish buyers to Great Britain.  Most leading houses send over their buyers from time to time.  In the announcement made by the Minister in the Press of May 13th it is stated that buyers should not place orders for fabrics outside the class or price set out in circular No. I.F.5 without prior consultation with the Department of Supplies. This shows a complete failure to understand the position of Irish <Col N="1213" /> buyers.  I was not present in the Dáil but I am informed that in reply to a question the Minister said that if there was a consultation he would be able to give an answer as to whether goods should be bought or not, within a week.</P>
    <P>A buyer going to England does not know what he may be offered until he gets there.  How can he consult the Department?  If he telephoned, would he get an immediate answer?  I do not believe he would.  If he waits until he returns to Ireland, the goods he was offered may be gone.  This kind of announcement only aggravates a difficult position and if adhered to means the loss of supplies still available.</P>
    <P>On what basis has the Minister fixed June 30th?  If there is to be a date at all, it should be September 30th at the earliest.  And why insist on licences up to 30th June or whatever date is finally fixed?</P>
    <P>If all fabrics without regard to type or price will be admitted until June 30th, why require licences at all until after that date?  Licences use up paper, of which there is a scarcity &mdash;they take up the time of the overworked officials of the Minister's Department. The sum of 2/6 that the Minister charges for these is not likely to bring in revenue equal to the expenditure.</P>
    <P>Far more important, licences cause delay and expense to importers, which add to the cost of the goods.  They increase the work of customs officials and of the staff in the shipping offices.  In my opinion, licences should, during the emergency, only be required where it is absolutely necessary.  Whatever may be said for or against this Order, it is surely unnecessary to insist on licences until June 30th, as fabrics will be admitted until then without regard to class or price.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce he has removed a number of quotas because they served no useful purpose at present.  By this action he reduced substantially the issue of import licences.  Why not adopt a similar policy as Minister for Supplies?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> Most, if not all, of the confusion and harm done by this Order could have been avoided if the Minister had consulted experienced representatives of importers before he made this Order. I am not aware that he did so in any case.  There is a very general complaint against his Department that it consults after it has taken action, instead of before.  This complaint is fully justified in the case of the Importation of Fabrics Order.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to assume that manufacturers and importers are actuated by purely selfish motives, and have no regard for the welfare of the country as a whole.  If this is his view, he is quite wrong.  I am quite certain that importers generally would willingly co-operate with the Minister in an endeavour to secure that as far as practicable fabrics imported should be in the future those which the people most require.  But they cannot co-operate if they are not consulted.</P>
    <P>The situation is very serious.  It is the business of manufacturers and the drapery and allied trades to do their best to supply the people with essential clothing.  Irish manufacturers of various fabrics &mdash; I am chairman of one of the larger groups &mdash; are doing their best, but in most cases they cannot obtain raw materials to enable them to supply the normal demand, much less make up for what may be short from Great Britain.  They have, therefore, no desire to prevent imports of fabrics, especially as they know very well that the quantities which they can manufacture during the emergency added to the quantities which can be imported will not provide a total equal to the probable requirements of the country.</P>
    <P>Even in normal times, manufacturers of garments had to depend on imports of fabrics for a considerable portion of their necessary supplies.  Manufacturers of shirts, of men's and boys' readymades and of ladies' overalls, dresses and underwear, are all affected by the Order and are equally concerned with the distributing trade as to the possible loss of supplies.  This may be much more serious if the Minister does not change his policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> The drapery trade, of which I have a fair knowledge, sees its supplies both at home and from England gradually but steadily dwindling and it is fearful of serious unemployment in the coming winter and next year if the war continues.  The Federation of Irish Manufacturers has sent a resolution to the Minister criticising the Order and demanding its suspension.  The Drapers' Chamber of Trade has, I believe, taken similar action.</P>
    <P>It does not take much imagination to understand the resentment of manufacturers and distributors alike at any action by the Minister which may reduce the total supplies available.  The Minister must appreciate the seriousness of the position with regard to clothing.  What should he do?  In my considered opinion &mdash; formed after wide consultation with experienced persons &mdash;he should revoke this Order and immediately form a consultative committee of experienced representatives of manufacturers and distributors.  He should ask this committee to advise him how to achieve the aims he has in view.  An official of his Department, with representatives of this committee, should then proceed to Great Britain to endeavour to make its plans fit in with British production arrangements. I believe this could be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister would then be in a position to make a new Order to operate from a future date prohibiting the imports of fabrics outside certain types and prices, except under licence, without danger of the loss of any available supplies.  There should be no licences required for fabrics imported within the types and prices set out in the Order.  The Minister should announce that he will give licences for all fabrics actually ordered before a certain date which may arrive after the new Order is made and which do not come within the classes or prices set out but that, thereafter, he will issue no licences. This would enable buyers on this side and sellers in Great Britain to know exactly where they stand and there need not be any cancellations of orders actually placed.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that this would <Col N="1216" /> be a wise and practicable policy and I urge him seriously to consider it.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it very clear that while I have criticised the policy of the Minister with regard to this Order, I am not criticising any officials in his Department.  I have always received the utmost courtesy from officials in the Department of Supplies whom I have approached with regard to the working of this Order or other matters.  They have always listened attentively to representations I had to make and promised to convey my more important suggestions to the Minister. One sometimes hears rather bitter criticism of the Department, and it is for this reason that I wish to take this opportunity of paying a personal tribute to the patience and courtesy of the officials I have had to deal with. I do not envy them the job of carrying out a policy as unwise as I believe this Order to be at the present time.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I would like to call attention, though it is only indirectly related to this Order.  I would like to suggest that a small committee should be set up of officials of the Departments of Supplies, Finance, and Industry and Commerce for the purpose of recommending what steps should be taken to reduce customs delays at the North Wall for the period of the emergency.  This city has already been bombed &mdash; we all hope that it will not occur again, but we must admit that it is within the realms of possibility &mdash; and if the bombs which dropped on the North Strand area had dropped on the shipping companies' stores at the North Wall, a very great quantity of essential supplies might have been destroyed.</P>
    <P>It seems to me desirable that an effort should be made to see that the supplies in shipping stores at any one time be as small as possible.  If goods could be cleared more promptly, it would help this considerably.  If a committee such as I suggest were set up, importers or their representatives could inform the committee of the causes of delay, and it could then be considered how far certain formalities, however necessary in peace-time, might be dispensed with for the duration of the <Col N="1217" /> emergency.  For instance, it might be possible to modify the requirements as to certificates of origin, which are often lost in transit.  At a time when only a small portion of our goods comes from the United States, and the remainder from Great Britain, it seems to me that it would be a simple matter to accept a statement from the acceptor of the goods as to their British origin, and let the goods go through at once rather than rendering it necessary to write to Britain &mdash; as many of us have frequently to do &mdash; for a copy of the certificate.  My experience is that, at least, one out of seven or eight certificates goes astray.  I am not suggesting that the customs are responsible.  The fault may be with the shipping companies, or it may be due to pressure of work on the part of exporters on the other side.  What is highly desirable to insist on in peace-time may not be so desirable in wartime. Something might be done, if the Minister insists on maintaining this Order, to arrange for licences being kept at the customs.  At the moment, they have to be brought from the British and Irish to the London, Midland and Scottish, and then taken up and attached to the next invoice one wants to clear.  The result is that clearances of goods subject to these licences take two or three times as long as they might otherwise take.</P>
    <P>I do not put this proposal forward solely from the point of view of the convenience of the trade; I put it forward in the public interest.  In my opinion, the bulk of supplies at the North Wall is dangerously large on any given night, and it is worth while sacrificing some formalities to get the amount of goods reduced.  I hope the Minister will consider this suggestion. I also hope that the House will pass this motion, and that the Minister will agree to revoke the Order.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Senator Douglas put down this motion, because it is obvious that an attempt is being made to organise a ramp on the basis of the Order, and that that attempt can best be defeated by a clear statement <Col N="1218" /> as to the purpose of the Order, the method of its operation, and the reasons for making it.</P>
      <P>This Order provides for the restriction of imports, except under licence, of fabrics made of cotton, linen, wool, silk or artificial silk.  It was made because it was obvious that our home production of all fabrics of the kind to which the Order refers at the present rate of supply of raw materials in this year is unlikely to amount to more than 35 per cent. of the 1940 production, and because our imports of the fabrics of the same classes for a period of 12 months beginning about March last are not expected to amount to more than 25 per cent. of our imports of such fabrics in 1940.  In these circumstances it is obviously good national policy and a matter of first importance to ensure that the best use is made of the quotas available to us from Great Britain by limiting imports under these quotas to the fabrics of which this country is most in need, and by that I mean the fabrics of which the consumers are most in need, not the fabrics in which traders might find it most profitable to deal.</P>
      <P>I think that Senator Douglas said that the Order was based upon a misunderstanding of the facts.  The Senator has misunderstood most of the facts himself.  It may be no harm to give a more authentic history of the circumstances which led to the making of the Order and the developments which have occurred since.  The first fabrics upon the export from Britain of which restrictions were placed were cotton piece goods.  In August of last year, we investigated the possibilities of arranging that in the export licensing arrangements on the British side, goods of an essential type should be preferred to the luxury class.  The British Board of Trade was sympathetic to the idea of trying to confine the export to us of piece goods to essential goods.  A list of the goods which we deemed to be essential was requested by them and consultations were held with the trade.  I do not know where Senator Douglas got the idea that the Department of Supplies does not consult with the parties interested in matters of this kind.  The assertion was completely unfounded.</P>

      <P>Discussions were held with the representatives of the trade who were best able to give the advice which the Department required.  The whole question was discussed with the secretary of the British Cotton Board in December, 1941, and he suggested that we should regulate the imports of cotton piece goods so as to secure that our desire would be realised that the most essential types of goods would be imported.  It was indicated to him that steps to have that done had already been taken and that a licensing system would be introduced at an early date.  The Secretary of the British Cotton Board thought it was possible to arrange that our import licensing system should be wedded to the British export licensing system.  He agreed that if imports were left unrestricted mainly expensive and non-essential fabrics would be supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime restrictions were imposed on the export from Great Britain to this country of woven fabrics made of wool or rather the intention to impose such a restriction was announced.  It was also indicated that restriction would be imposed on the export of rayon goods to this country.  I then decided to make the Emergency Powers Order, to which this motion relates, controlling the importation of fabrics.  I felt that the position in respect of supplies from Great Britain might deteriorate still further.  It was, therefore, important that we should take steps to import the maximum quantities of essential goods while the opportunity to do so was available to us.  A list was drawn up of the fabrics which were regarded as essential for clothing.  To that list may be added certain other fabrics such as industrial cloths which were not of interest to the general trade, but for the importation of <Col N="1220" /> reasonable quantities of which import licences would be granted.  The danger was that the shortage of supplies in fabrics would be exploited both by the British exporters and the Irish importers to the detriment of the Irish consumers.  The shortage is such that there is temptation to importers to use the limited import facilities available to get in the most expensive classes of goods in order to keep up their turnover and to the British exporters whose profits on the home market have been seriously curtailed by the restrictions to make up by their export trade.</P>
    <P>We were advised by the Secretary of the Cotton Board in December last that he had already noticed a tendency to export the higher qualities of piece goods in preference to cheaper goods. Importers here have been advised by British merchants that they were not prepared to use up their quotas for the importation here of fabrics which yielded only small profits.  With the object of counteracting that tendency, it was decided that the grant of import licences would be conditioned not merely by considerations of the type of fabric but by considerations of the price.  When the Order was made, it was appreciated that difficulties would arise if importers had always to consult the Department about fabrics for which a licence was likely to be granted.  Senator Douglas has laboured that point.  I think that the course of action followed by the Department conforms closely to the course of action the Senator now recommends.  It was clear that if importers addressed themselves to the task of seeking supplies of the fabric which we considered most essential there would be a big volume of importations in relation to which the granting of licences would be almost automatic.</P>
    <P>With a view to making things easy for the importers and for the Department, it was decided to issue a circular setting out the types of fabric for which, it could be assumed, licences would be issued as a matter of course, if the landed prices were within the maximum prices shown.</P>
    <P>It was clearly stated in the circular, <Col N="1221" /> an extract from which Senator Douglas read here, that it was not to be inferred that licences would be issued only for those fabrics and that the object of the list was to facilitate importers in the negotiation of transactions in regard to the grant of import licences for which they might be in no doubt whatever.  After that circular was issued, representations were received from practically all the importing interests, to the effect that the prices published were too low and that it would be impossible to procure any considerable quantity of supplies within those price limits.  It was explained to those importers that there was no question of licences being limited to goods imported within those price limits, and that applications for licences to import fabrics outside those limits would also be considered.  It was represented, however, that unless the price limits were fixed at higher levels, importers would have to refer to the Department with such frequency that there was a serious danger of their losing supplies through not being able to come to a speedy decision when offers were made to them from Great Britain.  Since the purpose of the publication of the circular was to avoid this contingency, it was decided to increase the price limits in the majority of cases until experience had been gained of the actual prices at which goods were being landed in this country.  Accordingly, a revised circular was issued, as stated by Senator Douglas.</P>
    <P>Representations have also been made that fabrics outside the descriptions set forth in the circular should be admitted without question, but that suggestion could not be accepted except in the case of calico.  The prices set out in the revised circular were in many cases lower than those pressed for, but were so substantially in excess of the figures previously worked out that importers should have no insuperable difficulty in finding fabrics within those price limits.  The increases in prices removed a large proportion of the complaints made against the Order, but <Col N="1222" /> representations continued to be received from importers of classes of fabrics unsuitable for clothing, such as furnishing fabrics, and also from importers of high-priced fabrics suitable for clothing but not conforming to the Department's standards of essentiality, such as heavy tweeds and overcoating, the essentiality of which was not disputed, but supplies of which should, it is felt, be drawn from home production and not from importation at the expense of fabrics which are of a class not produced at home at all, or the home production of which was clearly inadequate for our essential needs.  It was indicated in all such cases that licences could not be issued except to the extent to which goods might actually arrive in this country in or about the 30th April.  It was represented also that there was a danger that there might be some complication in the arrangements on the British side for the grant of export facilities, which might result in a loss of part of our quotas if we neglected to import those fabrics which we regarded as not being most important from our point of view.  These representations were taken up with the British Board of Trade, and it was decided that, pending an indication from the British authorities that there was such a danger which could not be overcome on the British side, we should maintain our attitude, so as to make the importers give at least first preference to the goods which we regarded as most important.</P>
    <P>If information which we might receive from the British authorities tended to suggest that parts of our quotas were earmarked for expensive or non-essential fabrics and that these parts could not be replaced by types of fabrics we wished to import, the importers might then be permitted to take up the expensive or non-essential fabrics.  The risk that it might be too late then to get those fabrics was deemed to be negligible, in comparison with the risk that if imports generally were left unrestricted, importers would make no effort to secure the supplies of the moderately-priced serviceable fabrics suitable for clothing which we wanted.  Applications continued to be <Col N="1223" /> considered for fabrics outside the approved standard as to quality and price, and licences were granted in cases where the Department was satisfied that it was in the national interest to grant them.  For example, overcoating material, which was outside the classifications in the list, but importable at a moderate price, was licensed.  Licences were refused in cases where we were not satisfied that importation was desirable in the short state of supplies from Great Britain.</P>
    <P>It may be relevant to state that, in the period of three weeks from the date on which the Order commenced&mdash; the first licence was issued about April 20th &mdash; 730 licences were issued for the importation of 3,430,000 square yards of material; 35 licences were refused for the importation of 30,000 square yards of material.  Senator Douglas said it was impossible to estimate what quantity of fabrics was lost during the month by reason of the actions of the Department.  I do not know why Senator Douglas found it so difficult. I will give the estimate &mdash; not one yard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state the number of orders which were cancelled during that period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of all the traders in this country who desired to import fabrics during that period, 35 were refused licences for the importation of 30,000 square yards of cloth, against a permitted import under licences issued for 3,430,000 square yards.  This represented only 4.8 of the number of licences requested and the area of cloth involved in the refusals represented less than 1 per cent. of the area of cloth for which licences were sought. There are two inferences to be drawn from the very high percentage of the approved applications.  Either the price limits published were reasonably sufficient to cover almost the entire import trade, or the standards of type and price laid down influenced importers to make special efforts to secure supplies of materials within these specifications. The proper inference, probably, is that both of these two conditions obtained, <Col N="1224" /> and that there is a supply of fabrics available from Great Britain of the kinds and at the price of which we are prepared to approve and that if importers look for these goods they can get them.  It does not necessarily follow that all the goods covered by the licences issued will be received, but the importers have, at least, been able to place orders for them.</P>
      <P>As Senator Douglas said, representations were made by the Drapers' Chamber of Trade and by the Federation of Irish Manufacturers to the effect that considerable quantities of fabrics which had been on order for some time were now coming around in English warehouses and that it was only reasonable that they should be allowed to import these fabrics since it would take some time for British merchants who had not got the materials of which we approve in stock to have such materials specially made up for this market.  Although no evidence was forthcoming of the extent to which orders had already been placed for goods which were likely to materialise in the near future, it was felt that it would be only reasonable to extend the period of grace, already granted up to 30th April, to a later date, and the 30th June had been contemplated so as to enable goods which had been on order prior to the making of the Order, or for which orders had been placed whilst representations to the Department were <i>sub judice</i>, to be imported. The parties concerned were advised on the 5th of this month that such a concession would probably be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the precise form which the concession would take was under consideration, the Department had an opportunity of consulting the Secretary of the British Cotton Board, who was in Dublin.  He confirmed that in practice the British merchants supplied Irish customers out of stock, and availed of the Irish orders to secure facilities to replace in stock the quantities of material supplied against the orders. He noted that we were prepared to entertain applications for fabrics at prices or of types outside the published list, and he suggested that we should <Col N="1225" /> not be too rigid in the examination of applications for a couple of months in order that Irish importers might have the run of British warehouses.  He quite agreed with the object of the Order, and saw no reason why British merchants, advised of the type of goods for which there was an import preference here, should not use their market allocations to have these goods made up for export to this country.</P>
    <P>In the light of the information obtained from the Secretary of the Cotton Board in regard to cotton piece goods, which is assumed to be true also of the other fabrics, it was decided to extend the concession already contemplated so as to permit importation up to 30th June, irrespective of the date on which the goods had been ordered. Meanwhile, an announcement to that effect was made on the 13th of this month.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas made special reference to the question of rayon piece goods.  He stated that he had been informed by a reliable authority in the United Kingdom that no restrictions on the exportation of rayon piece goods to this country were in operation, and that we had been misinformed in that respect.  Senator Douglas's contacts with reliable authorities in the United Kingdom are, I believe, not always as helpful as he intends them to be.  The facts in regard to rayon piece goods are that in September last we were advised officially by the United Kingdom Trade Commissioner in Dublin that he had been asked by the Department of Overseas Trade in London to state that it had been found necessary as a short-time measure to check rayon production, and that this restriction would have the result of restricting exports of piece goods to the 1940 level. It was indicated that the check would not be operative until November or December, and probably would not affect exports to any marked extent before the new year.  It was added that it was hoped to establish a longer period on rayon production for exports later.</P>
    <P>Representations were made to the <Col N="1226" /> United Kingdom Trade Commissioner with the object of allowing the export to this country of piece goods, orders for which were placed and accepted before the date of the application of the check on production.  It was understood from the Secretary of the Cotton Board, which deals also with rayon exports, that the threatened restriction on exports of rayon had not yet been enforced but that the matter is under active examination at the moment.  The suggestion that because plentiful supplies of rayon piece goods are at present obtainable, there should be no restriction on the prices at which these goods are to be imported is unacceptable.  If restrictions are imposed by the British authorities on the exports of rayon, having regard to the fact that we have been officially notified of their intention to impose restrictions, even though they have not come into operation, there is no reason to assume that the quantities of such goods now being imported will not be counted against any quota subsequently allotted to this country. Furthermore, because of the shortage of cotton piece goods and woollen fabrics, rayon is being used more and more in substitution for these fabrics and it would be obviously undesirable that the plenitude of supplies should be exploited in favour of expensive fabrics such as would be suitable for dance frocks, furnishing, etc., instead of in favour of the more serviceable and utilitarian piece goods which are required as substitutes for cotton and woollen goods.  The fact that exports have not yet been rigorously controlled (though that control is understood to be imminent) should enable our importers to have free choice of rayon fabrics which they allege the restriction of exports prevents them from having in the case of cotton and woollen fabrics.  Those arguing against the Department are trying to argue two ways at once.  They tell us that restriction of supplies of cotton and woollen goods leaves no scope for the exercise of selection which the Department requires them to make, whilst in the same breath they argue that the freedom of supplies in the case of rayon goods makes <Col N="1227" /> it unwise to be selective there either. In fact, the price limits up to which we have been prepared to grant import licences for rayon goods have been more generously framed than for the cotton and woollen groups, and our limited experience in the operation of the Order has shown us that, so far as the types of rayon goods in which we are chiefly interested are concerned, the price limits have been such as to afford no reasonable grounds for complaint.</P>
    <P>The attitude which will be adopted towards applications for licences for the importation of fabrics, not conforming to the types and price limits announced, which may arrive after the 30th June is under consideration. Much will depend upon the reply which it is hoped to receive this month from the Board of Trade to the inquiry addressed to it.  If it is clear that the fabrics imported outside these price limits of a class we do not require, can, if sent back to the United Kingdom, be recredited against recorded exports of this country then we will certainly require them to be sent back.  If, on the other hand, it is clear that retention of these fabrics will not mean a diminution in total supplies, then a different decision will have to be made. The announcement that import licences will be granted without reference to price or type of fabrics arriving up to 30th June appears to have given rise to an impression that the Order has been suspended up to that date.  I want to make it clear that that is not the case.  It is intended to retain the licensing provisions of the Order.  The concession which has been announced will, broadly speaking, relate only to current orders or orders which had been placed for some time.  The retention of the import licensing requirements, even in those cases where importation will be permitted as a matter of course, is necessary in order that we may be in a position to know, by inspection of the exhausted licences, what quantities of goods have been imported and at what prices.</P>
    <P>Without that information we would <Col N="1228" /> be at a disadvantage in considering representations in regard to the availability of supplies.  The information will also enable us to see to what extent, if any, importers may take advantage of the concessions by importing goods at extravagant prices.</P>
    <P>This motion by Senator Douglas calls for the revocation of the Order.  I want the House to be quite clear as to what the Order does.  It provides the Minister for Supplies with the power to regulate the imports of fabrics.  The motion for the revocation of the Order is, therefore, a motion for the withdrawal from the Minister for Supplies of that power to regulate imports.  In other words, it is a motion that imports of fabrics should, for the present at least, be left free and uncontrolled. The proposition that it should be left to the discretion of importers to determine what cloths should be imported, and the implication that the Government has no responsibility for ensuring that the most important needs of the country are met, are untenable.  Textile fabrics serve many purposes, but the most important purpose, which it is the duty of the Government in the present emergency to see that they serve, is the clothing of the people. There is danger that the shortage in the total quantity of the fabrics obtainable from Great Britain might be exploited by exporters in Great Britain and by importers in this country with the object of keeping up their own profits.  The national interest, therefore, requires that the Government should take steps not merely to see that clothing fabrics are imported to the fullest extent possible but that the consumer is protected against exploitation.</P>
    <P>It is primarily those members of the consuming public who, because of restricted means, can purchase their clothing only as and when they require it, who must be protected against exploitation, and it is the duty of the Government to take steps to see that supplies of clothing are available for them at reasonable prices.  Unlike the better-off sections of the community, they have not been able to stock up <Col N="1229" /> their wardrobes and, not having had the means to buy clothing when cloth was plentiful, they must not now be left in the position of having to take whatever is offered to them, irrespective of the prices asked, without at least having the assurance that the Government has done what it could to try to secure cheaper and more suitable cloth for them.  The suggestion that the Order which gives the Minister power to take steps to this end should be revoked is a suggestion that those sections of the community should be left to the mercy of the traders concerned.</P>
    <P>We are aware that the British authorities look with disfavour on the exploitation of the shortage by British exporters, and we are advised that they would be anxious to take whatever steps are practicable to put an end to such exploitation.  It is true that any control exercised at this side could be only partially effective unless the co-operation of the British authorities is secured.  Every effort has been made to secure that co-operation to the full extent which the situation requires. In the meantime, the Government is determined to make importers think of the requirements of the majority of the community, rather than of those who can afford to pay high prices for clothes.  The fact that British houses dealing in multiple lines of fabrics cater for more markets than Ireland should be remembered.  If Irish traders are prepared to take whatever is offered to them, regardless of price, naturally the British merchant will make sure of his profits by giving them his dearest goods, but, if they show that they want cheap, serviceable fabrics, and insist on them, they can probably induce the British merchant to supply them, possibly at the expense of some other market where Government-dictated selectiveness in favour of low-priced goods is not enforced.</P>
    <P>Another point to be borne in mind is that freshly manufactured goods are constantly coming round in British warerooms, and that, if our ideas on type and price are made plain to the <Col N="1230" /> British merchants by forward ordering in accordance with the descriptions and price limits already announced, these merchants can arrange &mdash; as some British merchants who have been in touch with the Department have indicated that they will arrange &mdash; to have goods made up specially for this market in conformity with our standards.  But if importers do not do this, and merely carry on as they did prior to the introduction of the Order, they will get no higher ratio of cheap goods than they have been getting.  On the contrary, the ratio will grow steadily in favour of the dearer goods.</P>
    <P>I hope Senators will notice the fact that it is the price limits rather than the selection of fabrics which have provoked the first and most intense opposition to this Order.  I think that fact is too significant to be passed over without comment.  The reason the price limits have been challenged so hotly is not because fabrics cannot be bought at those prices, but because they put a brake on the growing tendency of importers to bid against each other in the British market on the principle that they must buy something whatever the price.  This idea, which one frequently hears voiced nowadays, that price is no longer a consideration, must be checked.  Uncontrolled competition for the dwindling supplies available in the British market creates a potential black market for those goods before ever they reach this country. Importers could, prior to the introduction of this Order pay anything they liked for fabrics, secure in the knowledge that, because of the shortage and because people must have clothing, the consumer would have to pay them whatever they liked to charge for the goods.  There are very few consumers who will endorse the traders' plea that there is still enough competition between and within the trades concerned to keep prices down.  I think there has been altogether too much theorising about the possible losses of supplies.</P>
    <P>There is no solid evidence that cheap cloths cannot be got in preference to dear cloths.  On the contrary we have <Col N="1231" /> found importers who set their minds to it able to get as much cheap cloth as they wanted.  There is no clear evidence that a choice cannot be exercised within the British export quotas for markets including this country.  On the contrary, the suggestion made to us from the British side that the shortage was being exploited shows that there is scope for selectiveness, and that that selectiveness is being exercised against the interests of the poorer people in order that traders' profits will be maintained and enhanced.  The worst that can befall as a result of our traders being compelled to look for the cheaper fabrics is that, where they fail to find them and go back to get the dearer fabrics which they passed over in their search, those fabrics will have gone to another market, as was suggested by Senator Douglas, but even if that loss were to be incurred it would be, in my opinion, a small price to pay for the knowledge that the British market had been combed for utilitarian cloths, and that all the cloth of that kind which could be got had been got.</P>
    <P>The importers of expensive fabrics have had their day for the past couple of years, particularly since the import quotas were suspended.  If there is any loss of these types of cloth, the country can bear it, because those who could afford them or are trading in them are very well stocked already.  The consumer who has his wardrobe full and still wants more can get it, and when all the expensive imported materials are gone there are Irish homespuns and other expensive home-produced tweeds to fall back on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I am just as anxious as Senator Douglas to ensure that there will be no avoidable loss of supplies and if it is clearly ascertained from the British authorities that there is a likelihood of appreciable loss of supplies because luxury materials are specially earmarked and must continue to be earmarked for this market, these luxury goods will be allowed in because obviously they will not be coming in at the expense of cheaper fabrics. But until then the Government will not be moved from its determination to secure the maximum quantities of cheap fabrics.  The agitation organised in that connection is, I think, based on selfish sectional interests and it has been supported by theoretical arguments about the dangers of attempting to be selective in our purchase of fabrics from the British market.  Even if it were necessary to lose 10 per cent. of supplies in order to make sure that the other 90 per cent. would come within the means of the great bulk of the people, the Government would face up to that loss.  The Order will certainly not be revoked when it is not even clear yet that that 10 per cent. loss need necessarily be suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1233" /> Senator Douglas stated that in his opinion it will never be necessary to restrict the imports of cotton fabrics. I was going to argue that this Order was necessary and should be retained even if we decided to abandon the price standards which we have set.  I already informed the House that the total quantity of cotton fabrics which we are likely to get in the course of this year is fixed and limited.  We have decided that we shall endeavour to secure that the total quantity of such fabrics imported will come within a certain price range, and even if we are to respond to the appeal of traders voiced by Senator Douglas to abandon that limitation, it would be necessary to maintain the Order for another purpose.</P>
    <P>For instance, cotton shoe linings are classed as cotton piece goods in the British export lists.  The boot and shoe manufacturers in this country, with a natural anxiety to lay in stocks while they are available, have applied for licences for considerable quantities and have requested the Department to make representations with a view to the granting of additional allocations to suppliers of boot and shoe linings in Great Britain.  I have informed the Boot and Shoe Federation that I am not prepared to make any such representations, and, further, that imports of cotton shoe linings cannot be permitted at a rate greater than 20 per cent. of imports in 1940 since any excess over that rate would be possible only at the expense of other clothing fabrics.  That limitation on cotton shoe lining imports can only be achieved by maintaining the import control of the type contemplated by the Order.  We have made special provisions for the importation of bandaging and other surgical materials.  A special allocation of these materials over and above the cotton piece goods allocation has been fixed by the British authorities, provided the goods are obtained through certain channels.  It is necessary by maintaining import control to secure that supplies of the same type of material are not imported through other channels at the expense of the cotton piece goods allocation.  It is necessary also in respect of this particular class of materials to ensure that <Col N="1234" /> such materials as are imported are not diverted for other use than that for which they were intended and special steps are being taken towards that end in the administration of the Order.</P>
    <P>I may sum up, therefore, the case for the Order in a very few words. The total quantity of fabrics of the kind to which the Order refers are either restricted at present, or we have been officially informed of the intention to restrict them, and perhaps to restrict them retrospectively.  The Government has decided that in such a case traders should be required to import only the cheaper classes of such fabrics.  We are satisfied that it is possible for such traders to obtain these cheap fabrics and that the restrictions which have been placed upon their activities in importing cloth in respect of class and price at which such cloths should not be imported need not involve any loss of supplies. It should be obvious that there would be no loss of supplies if the British authorities are willing to recredit against our allocation any cloths returned as unsuitable by us.  If they are not prepared to do that, then we will have to reconsider our attitude, but it will still be necessary to maintain the arrangement which will force our importers here to give first preference to the cheaper cloths and only to import luxury cloths where it has been made clear to the Department of Supplies that cheap cloths cannot be obtained.</P>
    <P>The Order was primarily made for the purpose of giving effect to that policy, but even if we had decided that that policy should be abandoned and that importers are to be allowed to exercise their own discretion in regard to the type and price of cloth to be imported, we would still have to have this Order in order to ensure that some control would be exercisable over the class of fabrics obtained, and to ensure that there would be some uniformity secured in the supply of raw materials to industries, but particularly to secure that abuses do not arise in respect of the misuse of fabrics specially allocated to this country for particular purposes <Col N="1235" /> by their diversion to other purposes. In the circumstances I have outlined, I think the case for the motion falls to the ground.</P>

      <P>I assume it will not be necessary for me to move the adjournment, as there may be some other Senator who will wish to speak on this the next day.  Although I cannot reply to the Minister now, I would not like it to be thought that the allegations made against the trade are in any way accepted, because I am satisfied that they are false and that they can be replied to when we meet again.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will have heard the terms of the motion which I put down on the adjournment to-night, and a good many Senators will have seen in the ante-room of the Dáil certain exhibits of what might be called turf by some people, and which, unfortunately, I was not, according to the rules, allowed to bring into the House and to show around.  Those Senators who are conversant with the process of producing turf would recognise them as being the top sod or the cleanings which are normally thrown into the trench before the sleán starts to turn out the turf. Two of those sods are no more than partly-dried grass, and the third is just the same, except that it is so wet that it is quite plain that that turf was never footed.  Unfortunately, it has been in this House since Thursday last, and was inadvertently put in the sun by the person in charge; otherwise it would be a great deal wetter than it is to-day.  The fourth one was got at Kingsbridge this morning, and it is a fair sample of some 50 per cent. of what is loaded into the waggons there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of it is a great deal worse, but I definitely admit that a great deal of the other 50 per cent. is a good deal better.  The fourth sod is very much <Col N="1236" /> the same as the first three.  It is all grass the same as the rest, but mixed into the grass are a few &ldquo;cipins&rdquo; which do not make it any better.  The first three sods are genuine samples of which I could have brought a whole basketful from several train loads of similar stuff which were standing at Mallow station on Thursday last.  Some humorist had put six sods of good black turf on the top of each waggon. It is immaterial where the waggons came from, or where they were going, or whether the stuff was national or contractors' turf, or was turf bought privately and was being transferred. I maintain that, in the present emergency, affecting transport, fuel for transport, and fuel for warming the people and cooking, this stuff should never have found itself on a Great Southern Railways waggon.  Moreover, in order to transport such a large quantity from the bogs, it is obvious that lorry transport must have been used.  Farmers' carts could not have done it.  Whether the consignment was national or contractors' property, or turf bought privately, to cut and transport useless stuff of this kind is a gross waste of national effort and money, and, under no circumstances, should it be offered to anybody as fuel.</P>
    <P>The process of waste in the production of this stuff is, roughly, as follows: You get large numbers of men to cut it and save it.  They are paid six days' wages and, from their wages, at very small cost, is deducted what is required for their food.  I understand that they are pressing for a higher ration than they are getting at present. Anybody can see in the coffee-room in the Dáil to-day that the ration starts with breakfast for which there are two big slices of bread and tea.  For lunch, there is a slice of beef, egg, six slices of bread and butter, and tea again. For dinner, there is a chop, turnips, eight big potatoes, and tea.  They are charged a small sum for that.  It is quite obvious that the cost of this food cannot entirely be taken out of the wages, and that some part of it must be borne by the public.  The turf is loaded and off-loaded at the railhead, and transported long distances at a <Col N="1237" /> time of great petrol shortage.  It is transported long distances by rail to the towns and cities, and then there are further off-loading and carrying processes before distribution starts.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is sold to the public, when it will neither cook nor warm at a price of 64/- per ton or, retail, 3d. for 12 sods.  That fuel is absolutely and utterly worthless and I submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that steps should be taken to prevent the transport from the bogs, under severe penalties, of this so-called turf.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to make arrangements to prevent anything like this happening in the future.  Many poor people in our cities and towns are having a hard time and every possible precaution should be taken to ensure that only turf which is fit for fuel is available for sale to the public.  The poor people have to take or leave what is given to them.  People with more money can pick and choose but these people cannot.  We should try to imagine the position of working-class families in the top flats of tenement houses with very little light.  They have a 1d.-in-the-slot meter operating for a few hours.  They have to contend with high prices and they have not a great deal of bread.  They have to depend on this kind of stuff to light their only fire.  It is difficult to imagine greater discomfort, to people accustomed to other conditions, during the coming winter.  And it is entirely unnecessary.  This is not an attack on any individual.  The Parliamentary Secretary has had, under very great difficulties, to start the whole of this turf campaign.  He is doing his best. He cannot, personally, check every loading himself, but I think his inspectorate definitely requires overhaul in the interests of the public and, particularly, of the poor, who cannot pick and choose.  Under no circumstances, should this stuff be allowed to leave the bog.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the main proposition of the Senator, I am <Col N="1238" /> in absolute and complete agreement. At the present moment, no transport should be used except in the most efficient manner.  The most scrupulous care should be taken, as a matter of high national responsibility, by everybody to see that whatever transport is available is efficiently used.  Therefore, from that point of view, there is no question regarding this matter.  The second thing I should like to say is that, so far from objecting to any complaint of this kind, I am looking for complaints and glad to get them.  Complaints of this kind may be enormously valuable, not from the point of view of dealing with the particular instances themselves, but from the point of view of getting at some condition which is bad and which, with the knowledge of some particular proved and traceable instance, can be stopped.  That is why I am very anxious to get complaints and to get complaints in a form in which they can be used in that manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the particular complaint.  It is a completely useless complaint from that point of view. The Senator said that I cannot be expected to check over every particular waggon.  Had he given me the number of the waggon, I would have checked it over, and I would have told where it came from, and I would have told him the history of that waggon, what happened to it and what proportion of that sort of stuff did in fact happen eventually to be in it.  In the absence of any such facts, it amounts to no more than that somebody has picked up half a dozen bad sods.  There are bad waggons.  We have had bad trains.  When we know a bad waggon and when we know a bad train, we know where they are coming from and we know who is sending them, and we know the history behind the putting of that bad stuff on the train.  We can deal with it and we can stop it.  It is just the same in relation to general complaints that all the turf people get is rubbish and they cannot burn it.  Those complaints are waste of time but when somebody comes and says: &ldquo;I bought from a certain merchant on a certain day so much stuff,&rdquo; then we can trace <Col N="1239" /> it back to the merchant and if necessary further back than the merchant. We can prevent that sort of thing, to the extent to which it is possible, getting out again.</P>
    <P>In the case of the complaints which we have received in Dublin, I have gone out of my way to go into them. Every complaint that has been brought to our knowledge has, in fact, been checked up and in every single case in which there was bad turf it has been replaced by the merchant.  In the process of these examinations we have found things that were much worse than the mere fact that someone was getting bad turf.  We found that merchants had said exactly as the Senator believed, that the customer must take what was offered to him and that he has got to put up with it and the customers were told that that was what the merchants were getting, and if they did not take it they would lose their licences.  In other words, we came across a condition which showed that in certain cases of merchandise there was the grossest misrepresentation and sabotage of this national effort because so far from merchants being compelled to take bad turf they were forbidden to take bad turf.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Senator for having made the complaint.  I think that anyone who makes a complaint in such a form that it can be traced back is performing a service.  I regret that in this particular case it cannot be traced back.  As to the sods of which the Senator spoke, I think they came through Mallow.  If they were national turf, and of that we have no evidence, they will have come from Kerry.  As far as we know, they were going to Cork or Waterford.  When the first supplies from Kerry started this year, some inferior turf came along.  That was stopped and the general body of the turf coming from Kerry was very good.</P>

      <P>What does the Senator know about it?  Let us have some reason in this matter.  If it was national turf and if it was in Mallow, as far as I know, it could only come from Kerry and the Senator says it did not come from Kerry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one section in Kerry providing bad turf and that was checked up.  If the Senator was in a position to tell me the number of the waggon, and if he said there were six waggons, I would have it checked up. I do not accept at all that there were six waggons.  If he had given me the number of the waggon, I would know where the waggons came from and no further waggons of that type would have come forward.  That is all I have to say on this matter.  We are very anxious to see that no bad turf does come along.  I am very anxious to ensure that no transport is misused in carrying stuff that ought not to be carried.</P>
      <P>There is one limitation in that matter which men who are not expert in the knowledge of turf may require to have explained.  It is possible that the fullest and most complete examination of consignments of turf coming into Dublin may show turf which is not completely saved, in other words, turf which is wetter than turf could be sent direct to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are circumstances in which that must be.  The limitation on the whole turf position as far as the big non-turf areas are concerned is transport, and transport when it is available must be used, must be used completely, even if it is used to bring turf <Col N="1241" /> which is not in a fully saved condition, but which will save itself in the dumps. Last year we did bring into the cities a certain amount of turf which was not completely saved.  Some of it was put into the dumps in a condition in which, having regard to the lack of experience as to what would happen in the case of such large quantities, we had some considerable doubt as to whether it would save itself.  All these dumps have been cut right through and examined.  Broadly speaking, a very high proportion of all the turf that came into the City of Dublin has saved itself there and is now dry turf.  It is in the light of the knowledge that that stuff will save itself that we will take the responsibility of carrying into the city such turf as will be available, even if it is not in condition for consumption, when we know it is of a quality to enable it to be saved under these circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question?  I gather from what he has said that national turf can only come from particular areas.  Is there some responsible officer, who is responsible for seeing that the turf is loaded?  Is there any system of inspection of the quality of the turf, apart from whether it is saved?  You can have a quality of turf that it may not be possible to save.  Is there a system of inspection of national turf before it is loaded?  It seems to me that there should be some inspection of the loading of national turf, and I would like to know whether there is some such inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a system of inspection of national turf, but that system of inspection is not as watertight, in my opinion, as it needs to be.</P>
      <P>It is an inspection system which will be intensified steadily until we are in a position to reach that ideal, that such turf will not go forward. In a great many cases, we could, as a matter of fact, rely on not getting bad turf without that inspection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

      <P>I did not say six waggons: there were three trains of the same quality.  While the people in this country do not make complaints, the complaints from one working woman or 40 working women in Dublin are not going to make an alteration. I was not at all impressed by the Parliamentary Secretary's reply because he turned on to Kerry.  My point is that, whether it is Kerry, Clare or anywhere else, that stuff never should have gone out of the bog and on to a waggon.  Since I raised this question, I have spoken to a great many other Senators and they have told me of the quantity of turf circulating around this city which is as bad and worse than what I have shown in the ante-room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said my complaint was useless because the particular waggon could not be traced. There are so many waggons of this stuff floating about, some of it all bad and some of it partly bad and partly good, that I am perfectly satisfied the complaint I have brought forward is quite sufficient to enable the Parliamentary Secretary to consider how he can tighten up this inspectorate and prevent this stuff coming out of the bog.  It should be thrown into the trench and only black turf brought out to the people.  We are not allowed to sell poitín; eggs are always graded <Col N="1243" /> before being sold; and there is always a very careful inspectorate about milk to make sure that it is not adulterated. In the same way, there should be protection for the public in regard to fuel to see that they do not get fuel of this kind.  I am perfectly satisfied that <Col N="1244" /> what I have brought forward is sufficient to make the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department consider how the very serious situation at the present time can be corrected.</P>
