      <P>The Minister for Education will now address the House in respect of matters pertaining to the Education Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I think I had better refer to the question of the proposed appointment of extern examiners for the secondary schools certificate examinations.  For several years past the secondary school inspectors have acted as advising examiners for most of the subjects of the certificate examination.  I am at present considering a proposal that extern advising examiners be appointed in future and that some of the university professors be invited to act in that capacity.  The appointment would be made by me and the persons so appointed would be assisted in the preparation of the examination papers by committees of inspectors.  Under such an arrangement, <Col N="1844" /> I would retain full authority and responsibility in the matter of the control of the examinations and there would be no question of transferring them to university control.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the present position is that the secondary inspectors are the examiners.  Originally, extern examiners acted, but, some time towards the closing stages of the old régime, a change was made; the inspectors became the examiners, and the system of appointing extern examiners was dropped.  I should, perhaps, explain that the old senior grade certificate of the intermediate board had been accepted by all the Irish universities, and some of the British universities in lieu of their matriculation.  It had also been accepted by several bodies, such as the Royal Veterinary College, London, and the General Medical Council, in lieu of their particular entrance examinations.  On the change to the present courses and certificate examinations in 1925, the various universities and examining bodies referred to were invited to place the leaving certificate on the list of recognised equivalents for their matriculation or other entrance examinations. The Irish universities and most of the other universities and examining bodies agreed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An arrangement was made at the time with the National University under which representatives of the university, nominated by the Seanad, would collaborate with representatives of the Department in drawing up the examination papers for the leaving certificate, and that arrangement has since been continued.  In 1940 discussions took place between the Department and the National University with a view to arranging for the co-ordination of the syllabuses of the leaving certificate pass and the matriculation examination.  A formal scheme of coordination was subsequently drawn up and adopted by the universities and myself.  This scheme provides for collaboration between representatives of the universities and my Department (a)  in the framing of the syllabuses for the various subjects of the leaving certificate pass courses and examination; (b) in the selection of the text-books to <Col N="1845" /> be prescribed for the various language courses of the leaving certificate, the rota of textbooks covering a period of three or four years to be selected; (c) in the setting of the question papers for the various subjects for the examination, and (d) in determining the standard of marking of the candidates' work and the basis of assignment of marks to the various questions set in the papers.</P>
    <P>Recommendations made under the foregoing arrangement are submitted to the Minister and the universities by their respective representatives.  In all matters relating to the leaving certificate courses and examination, the decision of the Minister is final.  The co-ordination of the courses has been completed in almost every detail and the courses for the leaving certificate and matriculation are now identical in content and, except in a few minor details, are expressed in similar terms. This unified arrangement has been welcomed by the schools, as it facilitates the organisation of the senior classes, and obviates the necessity for leaving certificate pupils, who desire also to be candidates for matriculation, having to study two sets of texts in their final year.</P>
    <P>I think it is clear, therefore, that there has been very close collaboration, particularly in recent years, between the university authorities and ourselves as regards the co-relation of the leaving certificate and the matriculation courses.  The university authorities have been consulted, not alone on the question of the syllabuses and the courses, but actually on the standard of marking and the assignment of marks to questions, and I think also the actual type of questions, if not the questions themselves, which are to be set, so that there is a very close degree of collaboration and the appointment, as advising examiners, of university professors or other persons of academic standing to act as extern examiners in some or all of the subjects in future years, is only a further step.  I have not the slightest doubt that once that arrangement comes into operation, all interests concerned will feel it is a distinct benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1846" /> It would be a great pity, however, if, through any misunderstanding, an agitation were allowed to be created which would give the impression that the examinations are being placed under the control of the university in some way.  That, of course, as Senator Tiemey has pointed out, is quite incorrect.  We have a degree of collaboration already and we are carrying it a step further, and, instead of having the present system of inspectors as advising examiners, which has been the practice for a considerable period, I think a trial should be given to the alternative system of having an extern examiner as advising examiner.  He will be assisted in his work, of course, by the usual assistant examiners in respect of the correction of papers. This system will require consultation, as I have said, with the representatives of the Department of Education, and so far as the certificate examinations are concerned, the final word will rest with the Minister.  With good will on the part of all concerned, I am quite sure that the system can be worked out without any upset or any fear or anxiety on the part of managers or teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister make it clear that the system of appointing assistant examiners for the leaving certificate examination will remain exactly as it is at present and that the revising examiner will have no power over it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  The assistant examiners are generally secondary teachers and it has already been explained to their representatives that there is no intention of interfering with them.  If it is necessary, however, I should like to say, in reply to Senator Hayes, that there is no intention whatever of interfering with the present system of appointment of these assistant examiners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to school buildings, the point I should like to emphasise to the Seanad is that our national school system is organised on a parish basis. There is the parish unit and this organisation of primary education is in accordance with the religious sentiments <Col N="1847" /> of the Irish people.  It has been described even quite recently by an Irish Bishop as being not very far from the ideal, so far as Irish Catholic principles are concerned.  The State is responsible for the payment of the teachers and it makes generous grants towards the building, improvement, heating and cleaning of the schools, but on the people of the parish, which is the unit of the whole system, devolves the primary duty of providing the funds necessary for the maintenance, repair, heating and cleaning of the schools and towards the cost of reconstruction of existing buildings and the erection of new school buildings when required locally.</P>
    <P>May I say that this local interest and activity in regard to our schools is most valuable not alone from the point of view of our educational administration but from the point of view of the rural areas themselves?  Instead of having everything centralised, as some speakers would seem to desire, we have this very valuable system of the parish unit and parish organisation and we have also the system of local contribution. This system has worked fairly satisfactorily.  It may not have been perfect, but I think the chief parties concerned, the representatives of the Church and the State, have reasonable grounds for satisfaction in the accord which has always characterised it over a very long period.  We understand each other's point of view and it is unique&mdash;I am not sure that it is altogether unique, but it is certainly rather unique&mdash;that we should have State and Church collaborating in this most valuable way in primary education, and I think it would be a great pity if anything were done, or were even urged, which might suggest that some other system would be better.  I personally feel that the future progress of education in this country is bound up with this system, that we have to take it as the basis and that any attempt to introduce any other system will simply create chaos.</P>
    <P>There is a deep interest generally by school managers, as well as, of course, by teachers, in the maintenance of school buildings, and it is really remarkable <Col N="1848" /> that in a good many cases those managers who seem to have the heaviest burdens thrown upon them, in connection with the building of new churches, for example, are often quite outstanding in the amount of work they do in the provision of new school buildings. There is that excellent spirit among managers, and I think credit must be given to those managers who show their interest in that way.  We have also unfortunately the other type of case in which little or no interest is shown in the appearance or the maintenance of the schools, or in the provision of new schools, where these may be required.  We have all read and heard of cases in which the maintenance of school buildings has been utterly neglected&mdash;windows broken, roofs damaged and walls cracked&mdash;and from my point of view and that of the Minister for Finance, the important consideration in that respect is that a small amount of expenditure in the beginning would obviate very considerable expenditure later on.  The schools are our own and are established for the education of our children.  Our children spend a great many years of their lives in them, and we ought to try to make them as comfortable and as hygienic as possible, and I would ask Senators interested in this matter to use their local influence to assist managers to get the work done where it is clear that an effort should be made to improve school buildings.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that the responsibility for the provision of new school buildings is on the manager, in the first instance.  He must take the necessary steps&mdash;he must make an application to the office and he must fill up a form.  The actual arrangement of the plans, the site and so on is a matter for the Board of Works, but I do everything I can to expedite the work and to facilitate managers.  What I do not understand is that while there are good managers, already perhaps rather heavily burdened, carrying out this work of looking after their schools in a very satisfactory manner and willing to make the necessary local contribution, which I do not think is onerous&mdash;we have a certain amount of discretion but the <Col N="1849" /> more we give in a particular case the less we can give in some other case&mdash; why we should have it suggested that we should make the entire 100 per cent. of the cost available in those other cases where, for all I know, no effort has been made locally to make any contribution?</P>
    <P>There is provision for necessitous cases such as poor parishes in congested areas.  We give them extra grants but generally we expect in towns or in comfortably circumstanced rural parishes, a contribution of one-third. If there is other work going on in the parish, if, say, work has been carried out there in the recent past or if there are some other reasons, allowance is made for that.  I do not believe in haggling about this matter.  I have more respect for the representation that is made to me: &ldquo;I am prepared to make this contribution; I want to go ahead with the work and I am in a hurry to proceed with it&rdquo; than where it is suggested that because of a very small amount of money, perhaps something less than £50, the work cannot be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>We are either going to work the system properly or you are going to have demands made, as were made here yesterday, that all the expenditure in connection with school buildings should be made a national charge. I believe that the principle of the local contribution is most valuable.  I know it is rather bound up with the idea of the parish unit and I am fairly confident that in future we shall have the co-operation of the Church authorities very fully in this matter.  We may have isolated cases, of course, that are not satisfactory, but I think that the general disposition is to do everything that is possible.  At the same time, we must make allowance for our circumstances here and perhaps, occasionally, we look for too high standards in these matters.  If Senator Baxter, for example, would acquaint me with the names of the schools which he said would be condemned as byres under the public health regulations, I should be glad to have them.  I do not think it right that these statements should be made if they cannot be substantiated. There may be such schools, <Col N="1850" /> but if there are, as Senator Johnston pointed out, the public health authorities can take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>The position as regards our future plans, according to the figures I possess, which are not up to date, is that about 600 new schools will be required of which 300 may be regarded as being in the very urgent category. Since the year 1932 we expended more than £2,500,000 on school buildings. During that period 334 new schools were erected, 162 schools enlarged and 2,216 schools improved.  It seems clear, therefore, if we assume that the programme which has been carried out in recent years is to be doubled or trebled, that it is going to take a number of years.  Even with improved machinery, greater co-operation and more finances available, it is going to take at least ten years to see a solution of that question, in my opinion.  I have no doubt, as I have said, that the Church authorities will co-operate in any long-term programme of that kind. The Government is at present considering the question of plans for postwar circumstances and, although no final decision has been reached in this particular matter, I think I am pretty safe in saying that nothing less than a ten-year plan will clear up the situation as regards insanitary and unsuitable schools which is really our problem in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I need scarcely go into the details of the position.  In County Cavan there are 15 schools which have been classified by inspectors as unsuitable.  Seven of them are in the very urgent category. In two of these cases we have made grants but I do not know whether in existing circumstances we shall be able to go ahead.  There are difficulties in a few other cases.  In other cases we do not propose to proceed in view of the emergency conditions. There are, perhaps, eight other schools which might be attended to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said earlier that 600 new schools were required altogether but he said that these figures were not up to date.  I should like to know when they were up to date.  What is the Minister's most <Col N="1851" /> recent information as to the number of schools really requiring rebuilding or reconstruction and what is the amount of capital involved in the whole plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital will run into millions.  These are figures which I have had prepared in the office recently.  They are based on estimates supplied by the inspectors, perhaps a year ago or two years ago. I could not say that they represent the situation since the emergency.  Every year adds to the list, if schools are not properly maintained and of course the danger in a period like this is that we may have a recurrence of what happened in the last war when on account of the cost of getting repairs and improvements done, the matter was neglected.  For that reason I am glad it has been referred to.  All we can do until the emergency is over, and for some period after, is to try to maintain the schools as best we can and to carry out urgent repairs.  Owing to the scarcity of cement, and the scarcity previously of steel and the difficulty of getting timber, it will be almost impossible to carry on the work though we have our programme made out on the same basis as in previous years.  I have not an exact estimate of what the cost is likely to be.</P>
      <P>It would be mostly rural schools, I dare say, that would be involved, and seeing that it cost over £2,000,000 to erect 334, it will cost £4,000,000 after the war, perhaps more, to erect 600 schools.  The unit per head is up to £30 in the case of schools which are provided with the latest equipment including, perhaps, a hall.  In rural areas you might get the figure as low as £20 per unit.  I do not know what the position will be after the war.  All I know is that there is no reason why plans should not now be made&mdash;and they will be made&mdash;for a long-term programme, covering this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the main question that was raised, the question of the report issued by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation Committee of Inquiry, I think it is rather notable that the points made in that report were not stressed here yesterday with any degree of conviction.  Neither, I think, was <Col N="1852" /> there a great deal of substance in the arguments that were made about having a formal inquiry into this whole matter of teaching through Irish in the schools.  I think perhaps Senators are not familiar with the story of the situation. There have already been two conferences which examined this question. The first, as Senator O'Connell has pointed out, was called by the teachers themselves in 1920.  The second, which had the advantage of having the intervening years' experience, was called in 1925, and the present programme was issued in 1926. The conference which suggested that programme was composed of representatives of all phases of Irish life, and it is very remarkable that they unanimously agreed that the policy of teaching through Irish, and gradually extending the teaching through Irish, first through all the standards, and then through all the schools, should be adopted.  The report and programme are available, and those who are interested will see, if they read the preliminary matter, that the main recommendation of the first conference of 1920, that instruction through Irish should be given in the schools as far as possible, was adopted. I do not know whether I should read to the House some extracts from the notes and from the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all accepted, I think.  The Minister may take it that we accept that programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme is accepted?  Well, if it is accepted, I do not quite see where the necessity for an inquiry arises.  If we accept the programme, then we carry out the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the argument that this demand for an inquiry is based on the fact that the teachers have the best knowledge of this subject <Col N="1853" /> is very defective.  In the first place, it is not entirely an educational question. In my view, at any rate, there is a very big national question involved.  In the second place, are the teachers the only persons qualified to give an opinion on this?  It is suggested that the advisers whom I have are not as well acquainted with the situation as the teachers.  I stated, on account of the stress that has been laid on infant training, that it was notable that no woman teacher was on this committee of inquiry set up by the teachers.  I think that the report bears traces, in a great part of it, of having been put together by a person or persons not familiar with the actual conditions in the infant schools, certainly not familiar with the day-to-day circumstances of those schools.  It is suggested that the inspectors are in the same position.  The inspectors may not, in some cases, have actually taught in infant schools, but it is their business to visit the infant schools, and, if it is suggested to me that an inspector could not have a better idea of the work of the schools than a teacher, I say that is nonsense. Why have inspectors at all?  The very first thing an inspector does is to estimate the general level of efficiency of the teachers in his area. He has to collate the work of the different schools, and estimate what schools are efficient and what ones are not.  He has an opportunity of seeing the methods of the teachers.</P>
      <P>Those inspectors are all men of long experience.  They have grown up with this programme, and have seen it working in all kinds of schools.  Surely they are in a position to advise me? Besides, as regards the argument that they are anonymous or that they are bureaucrats, there is no compulsion on inspectors; there is nothing to prevent their giving their views.  I have frequently discussed this question with them, and have also issued official instructions to discourage teachers who are not capable of giving instruction through Irish from doing so.  I have done that over and over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point, and that is whether the approach that was made to this matter was the one which was likely to bear fruit in the way of <Col N="1854" /> benefiting our national aim of restoring the Irish language and improving our methods.  Generally, if it is felt that a certain situation in connection with education demands attention, the organised interests concerned approach the Minister.  It was acknowledged by Senator O'Connell yesterday that the Minister was always there to meet them.  I must say that I have had frequent meetings with the members of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, and similarly with the representatives of the other branches of education.  In some branches of education, at any rate, it is recognised that, if a matter requires to be examined or if it is considered that some situation exists which should be brought to the notice of the Minister, then an approach can be very easily made to the Minister.  He can be found on the telephone.  It should not be necessary to write a leading article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> or to pass resolutions or to have congress discussions to let him know that a certain situation exists.</P>
    <P>All that is necessary is to ring me up on the telephone.  I am always available for interview.  The Dublin City Branch of the National Teachers' Organisation first raised this question at a private meeting.  As far as I know, I may have got a copy of the resolution.  I doubt if I did.  I have heard very little about this officially. The meeting was described as a private meeting.  An account of it was supplied to the newspapers and appeared with the appropriate headings that one would expect when this matter receives public attention from some of these organs.  It was published in this way, that a physical and mental strain, amounting almost to a criminal act&mdash; the word criminal was introduced&mdash; was imposed on such children. This was the heading: &ldquo;Dublin children under a constant strain, particularly younger children.&rdquo;  That was the gist of the resolution, I understand, and subsequently that was certainly the thesis put forward at the Teachers' Congress.  I do not know whether Senators think that an inquiry based on a thesis of that kind should be accepted as an honest and careful inquiry into this matter.  I do not <Col N="1855" /> know whether, if they examined the questionnaire carefully, and the information given to us, they will feel that we could give the same value to this report, as could be given to the opinions of a small body of persons who were familiar with the work of the schools, who would be called in and be available to have their opinions tested by having the opinions of other people put against them; and furthermore, by visits to schools, actual examinations, questioning of teachers and so on.</P>
    <P>With all that a very large proportion of the teachers of infants seem to believe that the Irish language cannot be revived unless the present policy is maintained.  It must be borne in mind that a considerable number of these teachers are a very long time in the service.  They are highly efficient teachers.  The average service, I think, of the 422 highly efficient teachers who answered the questionnaire about the teaching of infants was 19 years.  That would suggest that some of them had very long service, and while that would be very valuable in one way, there would be the question whether they would be as skilful in carrying out this programme as the younger type of teachers, say the native Irish teachers, who were trained more recently.  In any case the opinions of the teachers, good and bad, highly efficient and efficient, are lumped together in this report and certain deductions are made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct the Minister, and to say that no statement sent in by a teacher who was not rated efficient was taken into account in formulating the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if rated efficient he may not be particularly interested in this matter, except to the extent of answering the questionnaire.  He may not have the necessary linguistic equipment, for example, to make a success of this work in his school.  That would seem to be indicated by the fact that so many hundreds of teachers embarked on this policy against official instructions, according to themselves, <Col N="1856" /> and presumably gave it up.  Therefore, they were not successful teachers in the ordinary sense.  It is also admitted that the older teachers did not further this policy of teaching through Irish.  You have frequently the case in our schools where children are admirably taught in the lower standards by young teachers who are properly qualified in Irish, and then, as they progress to the higher standards, and come under older teachers, not so highly qualified, whatever good effects and good results there may have been in teaching through Irish are, more or less, set at naught because instruction has to start in English.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition it will be suggested that pressure was being put on the teachers.  I want to say that I think it is the duty of inspectors to put before teachers the national policy in this matter, and to endeavour to get them to carry it out to the best of their ability, but certainly not to the point of inflicting a strain on the children, or creating conditions of repression or anything of that nature.  I doubt very much if inspectors were guilty of that. As against the point which Senator O'Connell mentioned yesterday&mdash;he did not say that he had very many cases of that type&mdash;he quoted a case where inspectors had asked a teacher to continue teaching in Irish, as I understood it, when the teacher felt it was not in the educational interests of the children to do so.  All teachers who were over 30 years' of age in 1922 were freed from the necessity to acquire qualifications in Irish and, so far as my experience goes, very few teachers, if any, have been threatened with a reduction in their rating solely on the ground of Irish.  I think I am safe in saying that in practically all cases&mdash; there may have been a few exceptions&mdash; there was in question the teacher's general efficiency before his rating could be reduced.  I should like to make it clear that, in my opinion, the teachers have been treated with every consideration by the inspectors.  We were aware of the difficulties of the situation.  We know that school buildings are not always as good as they should be; we know that the equipment is not as good as it could be; we know <Col N="1857" /> that all the teachers have not got the qualifications in Irish to carry out this programme and, on the other hand, are not asked to do so.  We have a very large number of assistant mistresses who were brought in under the old régime and they were a considerable improvement, but it is very doubtful if we could get the same results from them in carrying out this programme as from highly trained teachers who have been coming out of the training colleges in recent years.  In any case we must remember that in the small rural schools each teacher has three or four classes to attend to.  If it is said that these circumstances are not taken into consideration, I say that the first instruction given to inspectors is that all adverse circumstances operating against teachers must be taken into consideration and the second point, generally, is the standard in the area.</P>
    <P>We know that the small rural schools have these difficulties, and the programme conference, which laid down the programme, had specifically in mind rural schools, and the main object of their recommendations was to institute a programme which should suit the varying circumstances of different types of schools, and at the same time would, by slow but gradual and steady progress, attain to the ideal we had in mind.  An approach was not made to me.  This question was raised in a manner that, in my opinion, was not good for education, and was, certainly, not good for the Irish language movement, whether it was so intended or not.  It is suggested that there was great surprise at the way I dealt with this report.  Until a short time before the event, we were not aware whether or not the teachers proposed to publish this report.  They had a fair idea from the inspectors of my attitude. I was not anxious to give an opportunity to those despicable writers in the daily Press who say that the Minister for Education and the National Teachers' Organisation were at loggerheads.  That would surely have been a situation that would have made joyful the hearts of the scribblers, but it would not have been good for the Irish language, and I do not think that it would have been good <Col N="1858" /> for education.  While holding my own opinions very strongly, I have taken up the attitude with regard to this report that it is my duty to explain the position of the Department of Education, set out the weaknesses which I see in the statements made in the report, and explain to the country why I do not think it is worthy of such a consideration as its advocates would claim for it.</P>
    <P>We have had all kinds of statements made on this subject, including the well-known statement which is made periodically in debates and discussions on education and I suppose will always be made by persons who, oftentimes, are not intimate with the actual work of our schools&mdash;the statement that our standards of education are deteriorating. That statement was made by two Senators yesterday.  Take the case of arithmetic, with which a great deal of this report is taken up.  Dr. Starkie, speaking in 1911, referred to this question. He thought we had not enough subjects in the curriculum in the primary schools.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the opinion of Mr. Dale, the absence of these subjects&mdash;singing, drawing, object lessons and physical drill&mdash;from the Irish curriculum was an important cause of the difference in efficiency between Irish and English schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We all know that a great many subjects were brought in and that the results system was abolished.  He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Such accuracy as the children attained, by the solution of endless sums, mostly on cards, was gained at the expense of intelligent accuracy. I myself have seen in a school in the Claddagh, Galway, unhappy children who, as the teacher told me, had nothing to eat but cockles and periwinkles, engaged in immense calculations of the effects upon their pockets of an investment of £50,000 or £100,000 in consols at 95, as they happily were in the second year of the reign of his late Majesty, Edward VII.  It is often said that accuracy in arithmetic has declined in the last ten years; this may be so, if what is meant is mechanical accuracy, which <Col N="1859" /> is the result of practice, and can be acquired by any bank clerk in three months; but the reasons for the processes are far better understood than they were, and the children, while less skilled in the calculations proper to the money market, know much more about shop bills and the simple mental calculations that they employ in the course of their daily lives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Quite recently, under serious protest from the teachers, the inspectors succeeded in carrying their view that certain arithmetical textbooks, which continued these bad, old faults of huge sums and examples not related to the child's ordinary life, should be struck off the list.  We have for years been trying to have it accepted in the schools that a simpler type of problem should be given, that big figures and calculation for the sake of calculation should be omitted and that the examples should be based on the things with which the child is familiar. I do not know whether we have succeeded in that or not.</P>
    <P>Even at that time, there were complaints that the standard of education was deteriorating and there are still complaints on that score not only here but elsewhere.  A great many things are impinging on the children of the present day which were not present 25 or 30 years ago and we have to make allowance for these.  If there is deterioration, it is remarkable that it should always be argued by critics that that deterioration is due to the teaching of Irish.  I was glad that Senator Campbell gave his personal experience. If Senators will read the English newspapers, they will see complaints regarding the educational standards of candidates entering industry. Quite recently, I saw a complaint in the <i>Times</i> educational supplement that candidates were unable to read or write to the satisfaction of their employers.  These isolated examples could be collected and a case made upon them.  The theory that any deterioration here is due to the introduction of the Irish programme will have to be substantiated and more evidence will have to be brought forward to support it than <Col N="1860" /> has, so far, been adduced.  My belief is that, if Irish does not go ahead as a medium of instruction in the schools, then, English, which is its enemy, if one may put it that way, will maintain its position.  The tables are taught in Irish.  It is admitted in this report that they can be taught, at least, as well in Irish as in English.  Teachers are satisfied that the results are good. Are you then going to continue the rest of the work in English?  When Senator Tierney talks about other subjects being taught through Irish, with bad results to Irish education, he ought really give some study to this subject.  Up to the fourth standard, the only subjects are reading, writing and arithmetic.</P>

      <P>The three R's are the only subjects required in the first three standards above the infants' standard, save that the girls begin needlework at Standard 3 and that there is singing in all standards.  Only 6.3 per cent. of the schools in our English-speaking areas are doing all their work through Irish.  21.9 per cent. of the remaining schools are doing the work of the infants' classes through Irish.  Outside these two classes only 2.67 per cent. are doing the work through Irish up to the third standard inclusive, and it does not seem that a very great amount of work is being done through Irish in the higher standards.  In the third standard, since English is taught through English and Irish through Irish apart from singing&mdash;which Senator Tierney <Col N="1861" /> thinks should be admitted&mdash;there remains only the question of arithmetic. Experienced teachers who have carried out this programme from the beginning have always taken arithmetic as the subject easiest to teach through Irish.  They have been very successful. I have often asked them why they selected arithmetic and they have always said that they believed it was the easiest subject to deal with&mdash;much easier, for example, than history, and probably much easier than physics or chemistry, which have special technical terms.  Therefore, it is not correct to say that in the Dublin slums we are forcing the teaching of other subjects through Irish on the children.</P>
      <P>I would ask Senators, if they are sufficiently interested, to visit those infant schools in the Dublin slums and form their own conclusions as to whether there exist conditions of boredom, repression, and so on, not to speak of mental and physical strain, which, it is alleged, have grave reactions, on the children's health, I presume.  Let them go to the school in which the only one of this committee of inquiry who, as far as I believe, has had experience of infant teaching, works, and see whether infants in the school bear out the extraordinary statements made in this report.  Let them go to the convent schools in Dublin and see whether there are conditions of repression, whether results are being obtained or not.</P>
      <P>I have been in some of those schools &mdash;not to-day nor yesterday, but a good many years ago&mdash;in back streets in Dublin and I have been agreeably surprised&mdash;in fact, astonished would be the more correct term&mdash;at the results obtained in them.  I have been in rural schools, not alone in Kerry and Mayo but in County Dublin and elsewhere, and I have seen this programme being carried out and that its results have been successful.  There is very little reference in this report to the successful results&mdash;in fact, it is suggested that you cannot have successful results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Page 61 of the report, dealing with the direct method, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Evidence that this method is bound to produce the required aim easily and successfully, is deduced from the results which have been achieved in the Ring Fosterage School, the all-Irish primary schools in town and country, and in Pearse's school at St. Enda's.  To deduce a general conclusion from such instances is illogical.  Methods which may be a success in such schools cannot be expected to have the same results in schools in the heart of city slums, or in two-teacher schools in English-speaking rural districts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My answer is that, in some of those schools, at any rate, the methods have been successful.  It continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In Ring, and in St. Enda's to a lesser extent, the children hear nothing but Irish spoken, both inside and outside the classroom, while the pupils of the all-Irish national schools are in the main drawn from homes where, if the parents are not Irish-speakers, they have a very definite sympathy for the language, and the children are given every facility and encouragement to become fluent speakers of it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It then goes on to say that these opportunities are not available to the vast majority of primary school children.  I say they should go to these schools in <Col N="1863" /> Dublin, and see whether it is possible for children in infant classes to acquire a foundation in Irish, even though they may be coming from English-speaking and poor homes in a slum area.  If anybody wishes, he may deny that that is the case, but I have seen it myself and I know that there are schools in Dublin that the inspectors regard as very highly efficient in the teaching of Irish.  I do not know whether you could describe them as in slum areas or not, but certainly they are in areas that Senators do not visit very often.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That only applies to some Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>On page 27 of the report, it is denied that such children ever can acquire the power to think in any other language but English.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The sum of these phrases is being constantly increased by their out-of-school environment, and it is a fairly correct assertion that children drawn from an English-speaking home and living in an all-English-speaking environment will never acquire the power to think otherwise than in the language of their home and of their natural environment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is merely a general statement which is uncorroborated.  I believe it is entirely inaccurate.  I believe that the report itself, even in the section dealing with the infant, or in the section dealing with needlework, does not corroborate that.  The National Programme Conference reported on the gradual extension of Irish, as a medium of instruction through the schools, as being the only way to utilise the agency of the schools for the revival of Irish to the fullest possible extent.  The Department of Education, having issued instructions accordingly, recommended that certain subjects&mdash;the practical subjects, for example&mdash;should first be taken up, if the teachers wished to see whether teaching through Irish could be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On page 54 the report states, in regard to needlework, that 142 of the <Col N="1864" /> teachers, out of 206, held that the content of the present programme can be effectively covered if Irish is the medium of instruction.  Thirty-two held the contrary view.  The report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Although needlework is a comparatively &lsquo;silent&rsquo; lesson, it is to most children a pleasant subject, a welcome break from the heavier and more engrossing subjects of the daily round.  Many of the processes are already familiar from home experience, and the mind of the child is peaceful and at ease.  The slight effort that is necessary to the full understanding of the instructions given will not produce any undue strain.  And as time goes on, and phrases become familiar by constant use, there is instant understanding, and the absorption of a vocabulary that, however small it may be, is at once translated into service, and becomes a living, thinking part of the store of ideas in Irish.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The teacher says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Thus &lsquo;Cuir snáth &rsquo;sa tsnáthaid' will be a more natural expression than &lsquo;Put a thread in the needle&rsquo; on account of early familiarity with the phrase used in school.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then it is suggested in the end&mdash;perhaps the teacher remembered that she was not speaking as an individual teacher, giving her opinion on this matter, but rather as a member of the Teachers' Organisation, which had laid down a certain thesis, which I have read to the House, in connection with this matter, and that that thesis could not be forgotten.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time that the Minister has referred to this thesis.  Will he quote the reference or the authority for that statement? There is nothing about that in the report, and the persons responsible for that report say that the thesis, which the Minister suggests was the basis of the report, was not the basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement I have read out was made by the proposer of the resolution at the Teachers' Congress <Col N="1865" /> where this inquiry was set up. It got the fullest possible publicity in the Press, as we know, before and after, and previous to that, as I have said, the Dublin teachers, of whom he was, apparently, the representative, had also expressed themselves in somewhat similar terms.  She says, in the final paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;But it must be borne in mind that here, perhaps, more than in other subjects....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>although, actually, one would imagine, less than in other subjects, on account of the nature of the subject:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;. . . it is necessary for the teacher to have a good conversational knowledge of Irish.  A textbook on, say, History will supply the teacher with a suitable vocabulary in which to present his lesson, but the simple conversational tone of a good lesson in needlework, simple though it be, is full of pitfalls. On that account many teachers, having little opportunity for ordinary Irish conversation, will prefer to conduct the lessons in English.  A teacher should be free to do so, since, after all, it is a practical, not a language lesson.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This report refers in one place to the fact that the child has been practising English for six years before it reaches the national school, which does not seem to indicate a great acquaintance with the ways of infants.  We find the following on page 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It must be remembered that the educative process, particularly in so far as language and power of speech expression are concerned, begins in the home.  That process has been going on for almost six years before the child enters the school.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>And then we have a theory built up on that.  The actual fact is that in the case of infants their store of words is very, very limited.  When they first come to school they have only a handful of words, and the object of the infant school is to provide them with occupation.  If you see a group of individuals, small children, playing or doing some work, you will generally find <Col N="1866" /> each child doing it as an individual, and you will find a silent atmosphere. It will not be always silent, but there is no proof that at that stage the child is able, as this report would suggest, to have ideas and to have its imagination and desires expressed in some grasp of language.  It is suggested by some educationists, whose opinions have been borrowed for this report, that up to the seventh year the child only thinks in concrete, visual, terms, and it is certainly stressed that no formal instruction or lessons ought to be given before the age of six, and perhaps later&mdash;perhaps six and a half or seven.</P>
    <P>The programme in the infant classes is one of language training, and language training only, and if the child is to be given the foundation to enable him to use Irish in after-life, to follow courses of instruction through Irish, if he should so desire, the infant school seems to be the proper place to give the child the necessary foundation. Those who are interested in their own children will know that it has been found that between the ages of four and eight a second language can be taught successfully to a child.</P>
    <P>That is the principle upon which this idea of teaching infants is largely based, and I maintain that if you have conditions which approximate&mdash;they may be only an approximation&mdash;to the conditions of the home, where the children are happy, as they should be, where they are not coerced, where the instruction given to them is concrete, they can get the necessary foundation of Irish in the infant schools, which will enable them to continue later on if they should wish to receive instruction through Irish, but, as I have said elsewhere, there is no reference in this report to the many activities, all occupational, which are recommended for the children in the infant schools under the present programme, and one gets the impression that somebody is forcing the children, doing the unnatural thing of repressing the child, preventing him from speaking, that the eagle eye of the teacher is on him, and so on.  I suggest that that, as I have said already, is an entirely false <Col N="1867" /> impression to give of the conditions in the infant schools.  If there are infant schools of that kind, then I suggest that, to put it very broadly, the teacher does not know his job, and that if these conditions of boredom and unintelligibility exist, it is due to indifferent or poor teaching.</P>
    <P>If you want to have success under this programme, you expect naturally, that the teacher is a person of understanding, one who understands children, who will treat them as separate individuals, who will make allowances for their different little personalities, and so on, and who will bring them along gradually, letting them speak as freely as they wish, and, as opportunity offers and as she is working on a regular fixed plan, substituting the Irish word for the English word until such time as she enables the little infant to build up a vocabulary in Irish and accustom himself to working and spending his time in an atmosphere where Irish is the language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

      <P>We are told that the school is an unreal and artificial world, that the child suffers from boredom, repression and so on.  Perhaps I had better read the paragraph on page 19:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The great bulk of evidence supports the view that a smooth and easy educative process imposing comparatively little strain on the child, and making his life in school a <Col N="1868" /> happy one, is extremely difficult in a language other than his home language...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not admit that at all.  Under proper conditions, I think his life can be quite as happy and is as happy in an Irish-speaking as in an English-speaking school atmosphere:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...even with the brighter pupils, and next to impossible with those of average or slow mentality.  The average child comes to school already equipped with a vocabulary sufficient to express in simple language the experiences of his everyday life....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the extent of his vocabulary? It is very limited indeed.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He is suddenly transferred into a new and unnatural world.  The simplest expressions of the teacher or of the more advanced pupils are quite unintelligible to him.  Even when after a week or so he overcomes his natural shyness and the impulse to speak is strong within him, his sensitive mind tells him that the mode of speech which he uses so freely in his home and with his playmates out of school is out of place in this new and strange world.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is an entirely mythical conception. There is nothing to prevent such a child from speaking if he wishes.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Should he be brave enough on occasions to speak his own language, he quickly realises that he has placed himself outside the pale.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder are the teachers in infant schools who sent in their views to this committee prepared to be classed as people who allow little children when they first come to school to be put into a pale?  I should imagine, if they are worthy of being infant teachers at all, that they would realise that the small infant on first coming to school needs every encouragement and assistance, and that the teacher would take the natural precaution of seeing that no such artificial barrier is set up.  No matter what is done, of course, the child will have a certain feeling of novelty and, as is said here, puzzledom.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For him the school-room is <Col N="1869" /> largely a place to repress his desire to speak.  As time passes he masters some simple phrases, rhymes, etc., most of which are possibly intelligible to him but altogether inadequate to enable him to discuss those things which are nearest to his heart and about which he is anxious to speak.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the subject that an infant from five to seven years would want to discuss and about which he is anxious to speak?</P>

It is much more likely that he wants to do something, unless he is in some little trouble or other about which he wants to speak to the teacher.  Generally he is quite satisfied if he is given some occupation, and that is the purpose of an infant school.</P>
      <P>The report goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Time and again he is &lsquo;harangued&rsquo; but does not understand, or, at best, has but an imperfect idea of what he is asked to say.  Life is different at home or out of doors where he can converse, explain and say what is in his mind.  Yet he must be attentive for the eagle eye of the teacher is ever upon him.  To a certain extent life in school for him is a life of repression, confusion and unhappiness.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>All this boredom, repression and so on would not exist, apparently, if Irish were to be swept out of the infant school.  I wonder does anybody believe that if that were the case we would have perfect conditions in the infant schools and these conditions, which it is implied exist where Irish is being used for training infants, would no longer exist?

      <P>&ldquo;This limited command of language is even a greater hindrance to progress when a sound grasp is sought to be given of numerical processes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why not the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies?  Numerical processes have nothing whatever to do with infants; they are not on the programme. It is doubtful if the person who penned these words knows what the actual programme is.  Language training is all that is taught and ideas of location and number and other things ancillary to language training such as are necessary to enable a child to build up a vocabulary.  There is no formal instruction in subjects, no formal lesson, and there can be no <Col N="1872" /> question of numerical processes.  If Senators doubt that, I ask them to refer to the actual programme.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;The teacher is restricted and hampered in his effort to explain <Col N="1873" /> these processes by the necessity for keeping his language within the ambit of the child's limited knowledge of the language.  In addition, when the home language is the language of instruction, the child has to concentrate only on the numerical or arithmetical process.  To introduce one difficulty at a time is a sound teaching principle.  When the school language is used, he has to divide his efforts at concentration.  Moreover, when dealing with the arithmetical problems, he has also to consider the language form in which his reply has to be couched.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Formal teaching in arithmetic does not begin until the child has reached the senior infant standard, at least, and, as I have said, any ideas of number that are given are entirely subordinate to the language training that goes on.  There is no such thing as teaching of numerical processes, certainly no such thing as arithmetical problems, in the school and, of course, if one has the impression that these things are to be done then one is not familiar with the programme and one is likely to create the situation where some of the symptoms that I have been reading out, of boredom, repression, and so on, are likely to exist.  But, I <Col N="1874" /> maintain, if the programme and the notes are studied carefully and if the teacher knows her work, that these conditions simply cannot exist, that there is no undue pressure on teachers, that, as a whole, infant teachers are understanding women, often mothers of families themselves, and it would be very strange indeed if they allowed these conditions of strain to exist.</P>
      <P>As far as even the City of Dublin is concerned, I do not believe that the situation even in the poorest schools, is as described in this report.  I intend to examine the matter, but I do not believe that my investigations will show anything other than a confirmation of my view that you have just as happy children in the Dublin slum schools as anywhere else and that you will find in these schools children who have a surprisingly good knowledge of Irish and who are able to talk quite freely with visitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter, as I have said, has been examined by two successive programme conferences.  We met the teachers again in 1934, and we discussed whether further reductions could be made in the programme in order to make further room for Irish and, if possible, extend the use of Irish as a medium of instruction more rapidly than has been the case.  When it is suggested that perhaps I made use of some expression which might lead people to believe that I admitted a certain damage to education, I would like to explain that in the 1920 commission, the programme which was then in operation was reduced considerably: drawing, rural science, nature study, domestic economy and hygiene as obligatory subjects were eliminated; the programmes in history and geography were reduced and they were combined into one subject; singing and drill were lessened.  Side by side with that, the requirement of one hour a day as the minimum time for the teaching of Irish and the introduction of Irish as a medium of instruction in the English-speaking areas came along. We then had the second commission, which emphasised the necessity for going slowly in this matter, which warned teachers that they should be carefully prepared if they were to <Col N="1875" /> undertake teaching of other subjects through Irish.  They felt that the advance had perhaps been rather too rapid, and their general idea seems to have been to go slow in the matter; but they confirmed the main recommendation, as I have said.</P>
    <P>In order to lighten the task of the teachers, the 1925 conference recommended that the programme in history and geography should be further lightened, the programme in mathematics lessened, and alternative lower courses in both English and Irish included for teachers who were weak in either of these languages.  On the other hand, the second commission recommended that rural science or nature study should be restored to the list of obligatory subjects, though it left drawing and domestic economy optional.  You had the position then that rural science or nature study was put back, against the wishes of the teachers, though there was some further reduction in history and geography and mathematics.</P>
    <P>In 1934 we met the teachers and we again lessened the number of subjects by making rural science or nature study optional in all schools, by making mathematics optional in certain national schools in which they had been obligatory in the 1926 programme, with the result that, since 1934, all two-teacher schools and all three-teacher mixed schools are free to omit mathematics; while in three-teacher boys' national schools, either algebra or geometry can be dropped; that is to say, mathematics as a whole remains obligatory only in national schools with four teachers or over&mdash;there are about 500 schools of this type&mdash;algebra and geometry are optional in all classes taught by women teachers; mathematics really remains obligatory as a whole in only about 250 national schools, that is to say, about 5 per cent. of the national schools, so that in 95 per cent. of the national schools, the full programme in mathematics is not being taught, to make room for Irish, and in 80 per cent. of the schools, arithmetic only&mdash;no algebra or geometry&mdash;is being taught.  These changes were made in order to encourage <Col N="1876" /> the greater use of Irish and the result has been that we have further demands now that an inquiry should again be held.  I doubt if the other subjects on the programme can be reduced further at present.  I doubt very much if the inspectors would consent to any further reduction, and if they had been left to themselves, I doubt very much if they would have considered it wise to make all the reductions we made in 1934, but I feel strongly that there is a great burden on our national school teachers and that we ought to reduce the other subjects, firstly, to the minimum number of obligatory subjects and then reduce these to the absolute minimum of content, in order that every facility possible and all the time possible might be given to the development of Irish. I fail to see how an inquiry can reduce the burden further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, as I said elsewhere, that this matter of teaching through Irish has been stressed by successive conferences.  It is true that the mere fact that it has been stressed and advocated as the national policy up to the present does not prevent us from making a change, but I think I have shown the Seanad that some of the arguments adduced &mdash;and I could go further into the matter, but I do not wish to detain the House unreasonably&mdash;are certainly not convincing.  I think there is not sufficient acquaintance with actual conditions in infants' schools, for example, to enable us to say that, as the report would have it, the programme there has been a failure. Obviously, the reason the conferences recommended the use of Irish as the medium of instruction was that they felt that Irish taught merely as a school subject, would never hold out any promise of attaining the position in which it would again be the spoken language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who signed that report themselves went to school under the <Col N="1877" /> old system.  They were taught Irish for an hour a day or perhaps for some lesser period.  They had experience between the setting up of an Irish Government and 1926 to enable them to know whether teaching through Irish was necessary for this extension of the language in the schools which national policy decreed was necessary. They recommended in favour of it and I venture to say that they had very good reason.  Why are we such good speakers of English?  Is it because we learned English as a school subject for an hour a day?  It is because our whole schooling was through the medium of English.  We are quite familiar with all the subjects; we are quite fluent and able to express ourselves, and, having attained that degree of fluency in English through the machinery of the primary schools, we are not likely ever to forget it, and I do not see how we are ever to substitute at a later stage in life some other language for our elementary and personal needs.  In addition, Irish is the national language of this country. The programme intended that it should occupy its natural place, and when I say &ldquo;its natural place,&rdquo; I mean the predominant place, an unquestioned place of predominance in the primary school.  If we are to have English as the medium of instruction in the infants' schools, then we cannot have both English and Irish in the first place.  Irish must be in the first place and where it is not in the first place, let us examine why that is so and let us achieve the position in which it will be in the first place.</P>
    <P>Do these Senators who seem to think that teaching through Irish is wrong, or that our present infant programme is wrong, seriously believe that if we were to go back to Irish merely as a school subject and if we were to go back to English as the medium of instruction in the infants schools, we are likely to attain the aim we have set before us?  The position then will be that English will be the language of the school.  It is, unfortunately, the language of the school in too many cases already, in spite of all the work done and all the thought given to this matter.  At least, let the child understand, <Col N="1878" /> while in that formative period of life, that Irish is the language which he is intended later on to speak and through which he is to carry on his ordinary life activities.  Let him see it and let it be impressed upon his mind, through having Irish the language of the school, and let him be placed in the position so to use Irish afterwards.  A child has perhaps 14 or 15 waking hours, and, as I have said before, and it is a point I want to emphasise, four or five hours are spent in receiving secular instruction in our primary schools.  The remainder of the period, ten, 11 or 12 hours, is spent in a completely English-speaking environment, and, for all I know, a hostile environment&mdash;certainly it is hostile to the extent that the child must feel that Irish does not count for very much outside the school.  He sees an entirely different world and he is his natural self during that period, and the impact of English upon him everywhere is very serious.</P>
    <P>We are expecting the schools, through gradually extending the use of Irish in all standards and subjects, to become completely Irish-speaking in time, and therefore to counteract the English-speaking environment in which the child spends his out-of-school hours. The odds against Irish are very great when, as I have said already, in addition to the English-speaking environment outside, the child's amusements, such as the cinema, the wireless, the newspapers, the &ldquo;comics,&rdquo; and all the rest of it are further anglicising agencies.</P>
    <P>I maintain that the struggle is rather unequal and very serious even for the school which is able to do all its work through Irish, or aiming at so doing it; but what chance would a school have which would revert to the policy of teaching Irish merely as a subject for an hour a day?  Will the children in that school ever believe&mdash;how could they believe&mdash;that Irish is going to become the spoken language of this country, that it is going to become prominent in the outside world and eventually predominate?  I think the odds against Irish in such a case would be very great indeed, and that it would be almost impossible to attain the aim we seek to attain.</P>

      <P>After searching for two hours for some light on matters educational and getting only complete darkness, and being driven almost to the point of despair, I am not in the mood to hold the House or the Minister for any unreasonable length on the points I desire to raise, important indeed as I regard them.</P>
      <P>Naturally, one is tempted, at a time like this, to discuss our whole general policy on agriculture.  Indeed, regret has been expressed on a previous occasion here that we have discussed agriculture rather in compartments and we have never availed of an opportunity to look at the whole structure of the industry and see how we could co-ordinate all our activities towards achieving some end that would raise the general level of agriculture to a higher plane and thus give more satisfaction. The Minister is always very courteous to the Seanad and is always available to discuss problems raised from his angle&mdash;I will make him this concession&mdash;in a judicial manner, in a manner that is satisfactory to those of us whose point of view may not frequently coincide with his.  I should like to hear from him to-day his views as to the future.  I understand he has a deputation to meet later and, in those circumstances, I will be as brief as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago the Minister who has just left the Chamber gave some indication to the Dáil that the Government had in view the making of preparations with regard to post-war planning for agriculture.  I think the Minister for Agriculture gave some indication at a later date that that was in mind.  I put a question on the subject recently to the Minister for Finance when he was here, and the Minister's reply gave me the impression that some such step was being taken by the Government, and that <Col N="1880" /> the machinery which they proposed to utilise for the purpose of considering post-war agricultural problems and plans for that period was the Department of Agriculture.  Whatever the conditions look like in the world to-day, and however obscure the immediate future, the obligation is on us to examine our position as closely as we can, and see what is the wisest course to adopt and the best use that we can make of our land in the future, so as to make the country richer and more comfortable than it is and than it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>Obviously, we have very urgent problems in relation to our food supplies during the emergency period. The figures which the Taoiseach gave regarding our tillage efforts this year were very illuminating; indeed, they were remarkable.  In my view, the tendency towards a reduction in the area under root crops is a danger signal.  The situation demands immediate examination, and a great deal of concentrated thought and effort, if we are not going to find ourselves considerably cramped in providing those products which are so requisite for our needs during the emergency.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister the last evening we had him here how he regarded the position from the point of view of land fertility and our ability to provide ourselves with those crops essential to the maintenance of the human population and also the stock population. He gave rough figures as to what the Department accepts as being the possible area from which we can draw for the production of crops.  I am not prepared to accept that as being anything like an accurate measure of our potentialities at the moment.  I fear that the reduction in the area under roots is indicative of a situation that, unless we face it, will have serious reactions.</P>
    <P>Some representative at the meeting of the Beet Growers' Association yesterday put my point of view into words when he said that the reduction in the area under beet this year is, with a great many of our small farmers, due to the fact that they are finding it very difficult to provide enough manure to produce even their <Col N="1881" /> potato crop.  This matter is bound up with our cattle stocks and our ability to provide far greater quantities of farmyard manure than we have ever contemplated.  We have there a very urgent problem.  I do not know what possibilities there are of adding to our store of fertility during the coming year so as to provide a greater area for growing roots next year.  What consideration has the Department given to that matter?  I regret that Senator Parkinson is not here.  He seems to have something in mind which he thinks will possibly add to our stocks of artificial manures.  I do not know what he can do about the importation of phosphates or nitrogenous manures.  I do not know what plans the Minister may have in mind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter does seem to be bound up with the question on which I want the Minister's opinion. Its consideration is a very important matter just now.  I think our ability to provide ourselves with increased stocks of manures for the coming season is the most imperative consideration ahead.  Perhaps it is my imagination on which I am drawing, but I do not know whether we could not devise some scheme to add to our store of farmyard manure or at least our store of fertilisers, which could be utilised for the production of a greater root crop next year.</P>
      <P>To the extent by which our root crop declines one year after another, our fertility is dissipated, and we are likely to have a decline in the growing of certain grains which are absolutely essential. I am not going to dwell at any greater length on that matter now but there is another question on which I should like to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from the period of the emergency, we must look to the future and we must do that now.  I always held the view that the decision of the Minister to discontinue the work of the Agricultural Commission was a <Col N="1882" /> mistake.  The commission might have been good or bad, very inefficient or reasonably efficient, but I am convinced that some body should be in existence in these days looking into our problems for the future, particularly our agricultural problems, and mapping out a scheme that will fit into the possible post-war world.  The war may end in one or two or three different ways.  We cannot know how it will end but we know the difficulties we have experienced during this period in providing ourselves with, so to speak, a complete food ration.  I do not know whether these difficulties are going to be lessened for us during 1943 but our pig population has so considerably declined that bacon supplies are very hard to procure at the moment.  In my opinion that situation is not going to improve a great deal for a considerable period.  We are passing now through the season, when, as we all know, the demand for bacon is very limited but as we go into the harvest and the beginning of the winter months, everybody in the country will be demanding and expecting at least as much pig meats as they are consuming at the moment.  Whether we shall be able to meet these demands or not I do not know.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks with more optimism than I confess I can feel about the matter.  The truth is that we have not been able to provide ourselves with anything like sufficient food for 1941-42.  There is no use in saying that we did not make a good effort.  I think we made a very remarkable effort in all the circumstances. How much better is the situation going to be in 1942-43?  The area under roots has declined.  We do not know yet what the yield will be.  As to the potato crop, it is difficult to estimate what the yield will be but I should say that if we have 60 per cent. of last year's crop we shall be very lucky.  One can see hundreds of fields in which the crop as compared with last year is in a very backward state. On my way to this House from my home, I see dozens of fields in which probably as far as growth is concerned, there are only two-thirds of last year's crop.  What the yields may <Col N="1883" /> be from the plants that are at present growing is something that one cannot calculate.  We have that position now with regard to the difficulty in providing ourselves with sufficient wheat for flour and feeding for animals, apart from cattle.  We should be examining now what commodities we shall have when the war passes for the purposes of exchange, in a world where money probably will cease to exist or in which at least it will not have very much value, when the only things which will enable us to procure essential commodities from other countries will be goods which other people want and cannot produce themselves.</P>
    <P>In my view, we should be studying our position, not only from the point of view of getting the maximum production from our fields, but with a view to getting collaboration between the various Ministries to ascertain what essential commodities we shall require after the war.  When the emergency came, we discovered that there were a great many things that we could never manufacture here, no matter what effort we made, unless the raw materials for them were imported.  We had to pay for these raw materials by exporting other products.  When the war is over and people resume normal life, we shall come back to the position when we shall want raw materials and many other commodities which can be manufactured for us only by people outside.  When we reach that stage, we shall require to have native commodities for export purposes.  I do not know whether we shall go back to conditions under which London was the clearinghouse for many of the main commodities we required.  Although timber came mainly from Norway, we bought through London.  The same thing happened in the case of tea.  Whether we shall revert to that position, or whether we are going to produce certain commodities which we can utilise for the purposes of exchange to import essential commodities direct, I do not know, but that is part of our problem in the post-war period.</P>
    <P>We ought to take cognisance now of the fact that other countries are <Col N="1884" /> studying their post-war agriculture. They have some sort of organisation in England at the moment, a sort of joint council on which there are representatives of the United States and Canada. The purpose of that body is to study how agricultural activities in these various countries can be co-ordinated so as to give the best returns to the world in the shape of food and, presumably, the best return to the agriculturists in these various countries. A body like that must have reactions on our agricultural policy here, and we must keep ourselves and our public informed about them.  We may have to make a very considerable change in the type of agricultural activity which we have pursued in the past.  External conditions may force this on us; I do not know.  On the whole, we have demonstrated, and our fathers before us have demonstrated, what our soil is capable of producing, but I think it is not enough to say that in future we are just going to grow all the wheat we require, and to do just what we have been doing.  We want to do something more than that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to raise at this point any controversy about the possibilities of wheat production.  I should imagine that by the time the war is over we shall have debilitated our soil considerably and it may not be possible for us to produce some of the things, certainly for some period after the war, that we would be capable of producing on well-cared soil.  All that should be carefully studied and I feel that the Minister should tell us what is in his mind about it.  I have said before that I regard agriculture as being in the same category as education.  Neither agriculture, education, nor indeed the industry of this country, should be the playthings of politics.  If the nation is going to be built up on a strong foundation, a small community such as ours can only achieve that by pooling our wisdom and trying to discover some common stand which we can take.  I feel myself that agriculture in this country is hindered and hampered by the fact that our Minister for Agriculture is, as was his predecessor, the representative of a Party.  I think the old conception of the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1885" /> being responsible to the whole Dáil was much more satisfactory.  I say quite frankly that the Department of Agriculture can never display that initiative which is essential to success and progress while the Head of the Government is a political Head, and members of the Opposition are watching to see how the Department's staffs have failed so that they can come back upon the Minister.  That is our scheme at the moment, and I think it is not a proper scheme.  I think some day we will change it entirely, because we will come to realise that agricultural policies cannot and should not be changed with every change of Party Government.  Agricultural policies must be worked out over a long period, and must be related not only to our internal needs but to the activities of other nations.</P>
    <P>No one in this country has more respect for members of the staff of the Minister's Department than I have.  I have known many of them for a great many years, and I recognise their capacity in their respective spheres of operation.  At the same time, if the Minister tells me that he is having this matter inquired into, that his Department are examining it and will produce something in the nature of plans for post-war agriculture, I say quite frankly that they are not the people to do it.  I am quite convinced that no body of civil servants in this country can produce or be expected to produce plans for a post-war policy relating to their Department.  While some of those officials may be rather dictatorial in times like these in dealing with certain individuals and certain groups, I think on the other hand that matters of policy must be determined by the commonsense of the citizens, pooled with whatever information experts can make available to them.  When the Minister speaks about groups of experts studying post-war agricultural policy, I hope he will not make the mistake of leaving that matter to what he would regard as experts in his Department.  I have heard criticism of the worth of the bargains that have been made by representatives of the Minister's Department in regard to the price paid by Britain for our meat and live stock.  I <Col N="1886" /> am satisfied that those people did their best, but my view is that it would be much better to send over a group of the people who have the goods to sell. It would be much better to send over members of the business community and let them do the bargaining.  The necessary machinery could then be devised by the Ministry.</P>
    <P>We ought to be clear in our minds as to the best method of utilising our land.  I am one of the people who are quite convinced that we have not been making the best use of our land.  Even our maximum yields have been nothing like what it is possible to get under good management.  When I speak about good management, I mean not alone farm management but the management of marketing and all the rest of it.  All those things are inextricably bound up with our farming policy for the future.  It is very interesting to hear the comments of Canadian, American and even some British experts about the future.  Their view is that the greatest possibilities lie in a much more widespread adoption of the co-operative ideal and methods in relation to the production and marketing of agricultural produce in the future.  I am not alone in thinking that we ought to be doing more than we are doing.  I am not blaming the Minister because more has not been done.  I know that all the members of the Ministry have their hands full.  I know that theirs is a full-time job.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister ought to draw upon whatever knowledge and experience and competence he can collect in order to produce some policy over which the nation can stand in the future, something that will be representative of the most informed opinion we can get.  If he is to have the advice of experts they should be people who can be looked upon as being really expert, so that the policy which will be embarked upon will not be that of the officials of his Department but that of a representative body which will be accepted as being representative and competent.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to give us some light on this matter.  He should not <Col N="1887" /> merely tell us that this matter is being given consideration, and that something will be done, goodness knows when.  I think it would be disastrous for us to evade responsibility in this matter.  If we wait too long, we will not be able to adjust our production to the kind of conditions which will face us in the post-war world.  I know quite well that it may be very difficult indeed to do the things we want to do in order to provide ourselves with the essentials we require now, and at the same time be ready to adjust ourselves to post-war conditions.  I want to have the position examined in order to see how far we can do both at the same time.  I think our internal position with regard to production is rather grave.  I am definitely alarmed by the drop in our area under root crops this year, and I am satisfied that that comes mainly, if not entirely, from our incapacity to provide greater fertility in the land. There is no use in telling me that you can go out and plough up a green field and grow potatoes or beet or turnips or mangolds there.  You might find some fields in Meath or Limerick where you could do that and get a crop, but that is not the kind of farming that I should like to see pursued, because there are inevitable consequences of that awaiting not only the individual farmer who owns the land but the nation which permits that sort of farming policy to be carried on. There are other matters which I should like to deal with, but I do not propose introducing them now.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter has been dealing with the future, and partly with the immediate present.  I take it that the war is not going to go on for ever, and I want to deal rather with this year and next year.  I feel it is high time that the public were informed to some extent of the steps being taken to tighten up the inspection of land and the exemption of certain lands from the arable category.  I think there is every indication that, as a result of the drought and the lack of artificial manures, there will be a big drop in the production of cereal crops this <Col N="1888" /> year, and that a very considerable additional area of tillage will be necessary next year in order to produce the food we require.  Senator Baxter has been suggesting that we should now prepare to deliver the goods in quantity at the end of the war in order to keep up our export trade.  The Taoiseach gave us some figures the other day which are quite simple.  For human food we require about 2,700,000 barrels of wheat.  He estimated that we have 585,000 acres of wheat.  With five barrels to the acre &mdash;under Departmental supervision six barrels was the figure in the last experiment but, throughout the whole country, I do not think you will get more than an average of five barrels this year, according to what instructors and other officials of the Department say&mdash;that acreage should produce about 3,500,000 barrels.  You have to take off that about 500,000 barrels&mdash; 485,000 barrels&mdash;for seed.  Then, there will be a further wastage in respect of various kinds of stuff which do not reach the miller.  That would give you finally about 2,200,000 barrels of wheat &mdash;500,000 barrels short of what we require for human consumption in the coming year.  The public ought to be clear as to that.  The Taoiseach is rightly pleased with what the farmers have done to meet the needs of the national emergency but, though the number who have not carried out their duty is infinitesimal, there is still this enormous margin to be bridged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me go a step further and allow the Minister an average of six barrels to the acre.  We have to make the two deductions which I have mentioned and the remainder will give us enough for human consumption and no more.  Prewar, we imported and grew additional stuff for animal food.  It is on the animal foods on which one can fatten animals economically and quickly that our export trade depends.  What Senator Baxter says is important as regards our post-war planning.  To get what we want, we would require 1,500,000 more acres under tillage. That would amount, roughly, to an additional 25 per cent. of tillage.  I suggest that the Minister should go as far as possible not only to get the <Col N="1889" /> 100,000 acres which the Taoiseach suggested but more, because the Taoiseach is reported to have said that the nature of the situation could not be foreseen.  It is quite possible that we could not import the 500,000 barrels of wheat that we shall require.  After the war, our export trade will be the only thing which will keep up our standard of living.  That all depends on the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>As regards the immediate present, it is desirable that we should know now what regulations are contemplated with a view to ensuring that every possible grain of wheat gets to the millers.  There will be tremendous transport difficulties and transport will have to be spread over a considerable period.  I think, however, that we should be informed as to the position now, so that we can make arrangements. There are two ways of looking at this matter.  It might be possible to arrange for local distribution at the expense of rationing&mdash;that is to say, that the man who buys wheat locally from a registered buyer will be prevented from getting flour in any shape from any source.  That would save an enormous amount of transport, and subsidies in respect of milling costs. On the other hand, you would not know the total amount of wheat which had been grown.  In any event, there would be the wastage of which I have spoken. If there are to be regulations, we should like to have them as soon as possible.  We should like to know whether we are to be allowed to keep as much wheat as we want for ourselves and whether we are to be allowed to sell our wheat to labourers and neighbours who require it and who can get it milled locally.  So far as agriculture is concerned, I have nothing more to say.  I understand that the question of artificial manures will be dealt with by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-morrow morning.</P>

      <P>This question of artificial manures is very important. It will be terribly difficult to find enough farmyard manure not only to maintain the root crop area we have at present, but to increase it in the coming year.  The reduction in yield to which I referred is attributable to the want of artificial manures, particularly in the case of wheat.  We have not had that little pinch of artificials at the right time to bring the wheat on as it should have been brought on. I should like to know whether the difficulty of providing manures to anything like the extent which we imported them before the war is entirely insuperable.  Unfortunately, Senator Parkinson is not present at the moment, but he gave me some notes. Without going deeply into them, I understand that, as regards phosphates, the trouble is want of sulphuric acid.  I understand that there is a European process&mdash;European nations are in the same difficulty as regards sulphuric acid as we are&mdash; based on the fusion of rock phosphate with silica.  That should be quite possible in this country, and we should like to know, as farmers, whether the Minister can hold out any hope of our getting artificial manures on a scale approaching that required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">

      <P>Everybody is interested in agricultural production.  Urbanities are more interested in this question than those residing in rural areas because they have greater opportunities of providing themselves with the necessaries of life.  My particular interest is the procuring of artificial manures, because Clare is the only place where the raw material for phosphates is produced at the present time.  It is being produced in considerable quantities as a great individual effort on the part of the owner, or owners, of the quarry but, considering the national need for phosphates <Col N="1891" /> and artificial manures, I think that this matter should be dealt with as a national rather than an individual problem, and that the Government should take appropriate steps to acquire these mines for the purpose of producing artificial manures in much greater quantities than at present.  So far, we have been merely scratching the soil. With plenty of capital and the necessary machinery&mdash;a difficult proposition at the moment&mdash;the production of phosphates at the Doolin mines could be considerably increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a short conversation with Senator Parkinson yesterday but I do not want to forestall his bright ideas. He contends that a substitute for sulphate is obtainable in large quantities in Cork.  If you have that in Cork and the raw material for the phosphates in Clare, I do not see why it is not possible to bring both to the same spot and produce phosphates on a very big scale.  I have in mind a very suitable site for a factory for such an enterprise.  There is a port at Clarecastle, only 25 miles from the mines, which could be used by boats of 500 tons.  For the saving of transport by rail in the near future, both the raw materials and the manufactured article could be sent by boat around the coast.  That would be a very economic method of dealing with the matter.  Before making the soup, one has to kill the hare.  Therefore, we must see that it is possible to produce these phosphates by the use of the raw material in Clare and the silica which is, I understand, obtainable in great quantities around the coast of Cork.  That is a matter which deserves the very best attention of the appropriate Minister and of the Government and I draw their attention to it.  The present owner of the mines is a man of great national spirit.  He has been probing at this mining business for 25 years.  Probably, he had spent every penny he ever earned on it long before this outcry for artificial manures arose.  Being a good Irishman and of high national spirit, I think he would give every cooperation to, and facilitate, the Government if they thought it possible <Col N="1892" /> still further to increase the production of these phosphates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject of artificial manures is an important one but I do not think it is one in respect of which we can lay the blame on the Minister.  Artificial manures are rationed by the merchants.  I should like to know from the Minister if that is done on the instructions of his Department.  The merchants refuse to give artificial manures to anybody who had not been getting them during the past two years.  I do not think that that is quite fair.  People are doing a great deal of tillage at present and, though I do not think that the artificial manures which are being produced are very good, a number of people would like to have portion of what is going.  It is hardly fair that merchants should stick to the customers they were supplying with artificial manures for the past two years and to refuse to give any to any other farmer.</P>
      <P>Senator The McGillycuddy said that he did not expect more than five barrels of wheat to the acre this year.  I completely disagree with that statement. There is no use in being always pessimistic.  From my observation, going through the country, the wheat and corn crops are better than I have seen them for several years.  All the indications are that we shall have a bountiful harvest, for which we should thank God.  There is no use in being always pessimistic and denying God's goodness. If we get favourable weather, there is every prospect of a bountiful harvest this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our bacon and butter have completely disappeared from the British market and I am afraid that, in a short time, our beef will be very scarce.  I do not say that they will disappear off the market because we produce more than we could consume under any conditions here; but it certainly will disappear off the British market so far as the stall-feeding system is concerned. That is due to the uneconomic price which the British Food Controller is offering for our agricultural produce. The object I had in rising was to impress upon the Minister&mdash;I know that <Col N="1893" /> he cannot do a great deal and that his Department is pressing the matter as much as possible&mdash;the importance of losing no opportunity of explaining to the British Food Controller the necessity for raising the price of our beef cattle and particularly stall-fed cattle. It is most essential to us, from the point of view of obtaining a supply of farmyard manure, and even from the British point of view, that we should have stall-feeding.  The price of stall-fed cattle is not economic compared with the price paid for cattle for beef in November.  The Minister should lose no opportunity of forcing the hand of the British Food Controller so that we may get an economic price for our beef.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Industry and Commerce which has to do with the scarcity of bee-hive essentials.  It is very important that every effort should be made to secure the essentials for producing honey.  At present, these essentials are not available.  I know several cases where valuable swarms of bees have had to be allowed to go off because there was no use in keeping them. They went, perhaps, to the woods and died.  The Minister for Agriculture should make representations to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if he is responsible, with a view to securing bee-hive essentials for the farmers.  This is a farmer's problem, whether it comes within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Agriculture or not.</P>

      <P>The subject of post-war reconstruction has been stressed from many quarters and we have been reminded of the need for some effort in that direction.  The difficulty I see is that no prophet has yet arisen to tell us how the war is going to finish.  Until such a person comes along and we know what matters will be like at the end of the war, it will be very difficult to arrange for post-war reconstruction.  The Government's present tillage policy should be carried on and developed, as that is the best course to pursue at the moment.  The difficulty is mainly due <Col N="1894" /> to the shortage of artificial manures. If anything can be done to make them more plentiful, it would be a very great help to the tillage policy.</P>
      <P>I have discussed privately with the Minister the question of having the sludge deposits at the four beet factories distributed amongst the farming community.  It is a very useful manure and would be very helpful in tillage operations.  I hope the Minister will be able to do something to have those deposits distributed during the next few years.  At Mallow beet factory there is a lorry standing idle, as there is no petrol available for it.  If petrol were available, the lorry could be used to distribute the sludge to the local farmers.  Also, there is no railway siding running in where the sludge deposits are accumulated.  One would be very useful there, in order to send the sludge by rail to distant parts of the beet-growing areas.</P>

      <P>Lime takes the impurities out of beet, which consist of manurial ingredients which are very useful.  In addition to lime, there are manurial deposits as well.  Experts believe that this sludge lime and silicate by-products make a very good fertiliser. I am not speaking from personal experience in that matter, but I have personal experience in the value of sludge and think that it is much underrated by the people of the country.  The Minister would be doing a service to the tillage policy and to agriculture generally if he could help to have that sludge distributed during the next couple of years.  I know he has taken steps already in this connection and that he has been trying to do something, but I would urge him to try again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1895" /> Senator Counihan was very cheerful about the wheat crop, and I am glad to say that my views are in line with his.  I think the early wheat crop is doing very well and that we may look forward to the harvest season with optimism.  Though last year's crop was not good, this year's will exceed last year's easily.  Senator Baxter referred to the reduction in the root crop areas. I notice that the reduction in potatoes is less than 1 per cent., and that is a very small matter.  It is difficult to assess the yield.  It may not be as good as last year, but last year there was an excess.  As far as potatoes are concerned, I think we will be all right.</P>
    <P>There has been a serious decline in beet growing.  That may be due to many causes, but I believe that, with the accumulated stocks of sugar that we have, and with the sugar from the present year's crop, we will have enough to tide over until the 1943 crop comes in.  I am very much concerned about the 1943 crop, and I would like to impress on the Minister the necessity to make conditions such as would encourage the growing of a very full acreage in the 1943 season.  The factories are able to handle about 15,000 acres each, or possibly 17,000 or 18,000 at a stretch.  Last year we had 73,000 acres.  This year the acreage is back to 52,000.  If we could get back to the 1941 acreage again, it would be much more satisfactory.  The question of price is a big factor and there will be differences of opinion always about it.  The beet growers' representatives are not selfish, nor are they anxious to feather their own nests at the expense of the community in general.  They are anxious to see a sufficient acreage grown, and that people should be paid reasonably for growing it.  Unless there is a good price, there is no hope that the full acreage will be grown. There are several difficulties about it, and I am not going to stress them here, but an attractive price will bring a full acreage, and a full acreage is very important from the community point of view.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether forestry comes under the Minister's jurisdiction <Col N="1896" /> or not.  Reafforestation should be pushed ahead as quickly as possible. Everywhere throughout the country, trees are being felled, legally or illegally.  I know that the Forestry Department require two, four, or perhaps ten, trees to be planted when one is cut down, according to their discretion. It is well that the trees are there to be felled in the present emergency, but forestry needs more attention than it appears to be getting. The reafforestation of the country is very important, and this should be attended to now, when huge quantities of timber are being felled for firewood and other purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Baxter has raised the question of post-war planning, I would like to say a few words regarding it.  There was a good deal of talk about it in the Dáil, on some of the Estimates in connection with agriculture, and it entered into the realm of speculation as to what we should produce after the war and what we should not produce.  We have certain qualities here in soil and climate; so we should go back to first principles and build up on the basis of what we can produce best.  We are fortunate in having the particular soil and climate that we have, because the things we produce, in my view at any rate, are the things that will be necessary after the war.  We can produce these things, in my opinion, better than any other country, provided we pay attention to the matter.  We have the best live stock in the world.  If you take our cattle, our horses, and so on, we have the best in the world, and we can produce the best butter and the best bacon in the world.  All these things, in my view, will be required, and it is really the only thing that we can do. If God gives a person a gift, I think the right idea would be to develop that gift to the fullest extent.  As I say, we have these things and we should not let them go.  It will be very hard to resurrect, say, our butter trade or our pigs and bacon industry after the war if we do not prepare for it now, and I believe that we should subsidise these things, not only for the sake of providing food for our own people, but also <Col N="1897" /> subsidise it on a large-scale basis so that we will have these things to export after the war, because there is certain to be, not alone in England, but all over Europe, a great shortage of these essential commodities, and in any consideration of post-war planning it is along that line that we should be thinking.  To do that, there should be a bold, forward policy.  We are spending £10,000,000 a year on our Army.  I think it would not be too much at all to have what one might call a five years' plan for agriculture and spend £10,000,000 a year on it, no matter how we get or where we get it, so as to build up our country.  If there is one case where money does not matter, I think this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there has been too much insistence on the &ldquo;grow wheat&rdquo; policy in this country as a national policy&mdash;I mean as a long-term or all-time national policy.  I read in, I think, the <i>Farmers' Gazette</i> last week where Professor McCaffrey said that wheat-growing in this country will never really be a success&mdash;that is, that farmers would grow wheat from their liking for the crop rather than because of the fact that it commanded a high price &mdash;until they are provided with a proper variety of spring wheat.  That was the first bit of realism that I saw, all through this &ldquo;grow more wheat&rdquo; policy.  We have to grow wheat now. There is no doubt about that, and we will have to grow it for some years after the emergency.  We have to grow wheat to provide food for ourselves, no matter what it costs, but I think that it was wrong altogether to make it a national policy.  I was reading in, I think, the journal of the Department of Agriculture&mdash;in either the last number or the previous one&mdash;where, when we did grow wheat in the last century, we grew it largely for export.  We grew it then, but the average price then, I think, for about 20 years was in or about 40/- a barrel.  Now if the price was 40/- a barrel at that time, I wonder what it would be now.  If you compare the price of money then with what it is now, I think it would be about £5 a barrel.  I remember that I was always interested in that.  I used to look at the old ridges in the fields <Col N="1898" /> that were overgrown with grass, and I was told that they were a result of the time when the people grew wheat, flax, and things like that, which were abandoned afterwards, naturally, when the people went away.  I inquired from the old people, and they told me that when wheat went below 50/- a barrel it was no longer economic to grow it.  That was a good many years ago and, as I said, the first bit of realism about the whole thing was what Professor McCaffrey said at the Albert Agricultural College a short while ago, but because we do not make a national policy of growing wheat, it does not follow that we should not have tillage.  My idea is that we should have between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 acres of tillage, and that we should try to provide our own food, and especially food for our live stock.  I am speaking now about post-war or normal times, when we could afford to buy in wheat, and that would not interfere with our own tillage in any way because we could devote what we tilled to the feeding of live stock and the production of butter, eggs, and so on.</P>
    <P>Now, of course, the whole danger about all these things in this country&mdash; growing wheat, and so on&mdash;is that you will have agriculture industrialised, and that would increase the flight from the land to a far greater extent than is happening now.  You have that happening at present in England. You have a huge industrialisation of agriculture there, just because they are caught off the wrong leg, as it were, and they have had to rush millions into agriculture now in order to try to provide food for themselves. Those of us who remember the last war will remember that the very same thing happened.  They rushed into agriculture and spent millions on it, and they said that, of course, when the war was over they would never again let agriculture down and would always keep it up, but actually more land had gone back into brake and fern at the beginning of this war than at the beginning of the 1914-18 war. The whole reason for that was that over a long period of years they neglected their agriculture and then, when they were caught out, they had <Col N="1899" /> to shove millions into it to try to resurrect it.  There is a danger that that might happen in this country, and in connection with these compulsory powers of emergency tillage, as I call it, we should think not alone of growing wheat, but should think of combining all the different aspects of agriculture, such as the provision of butter, eggs, and all live stock.  To my mind, that will be our big danger.</P>
    <P>There has been some talk about fertilisers and the possibilities of their production here.  It is a good thing that we should be thinking about that, but if we are realists we must remember that we shall have to buy and import artificial manures for the next ten years, at any rate, and because we shall have to do that I think it would be more appropriate for us to try to barter the things we have in exchange for the importation of artificial fertilisers.  We can produce some artificials of our own, and in that connection I believe that there is a blood fertiliser on the market which is especially good for root crops, including beet, and that it contains a certain amount of nitrogen.</P>
    <P>I understand that it is scarce, and I wonder if any provision could be made to have more of that blood fertiliser produced.  Of course, it comes back again to the question that, if that is found to be worth while, it would be necessary to have our live stock again so as to produce the blood fertiliser. If we could combine and concentrate on the three or four things that we can produce better than any other country in the world, I think we could face the future and the question of post-war planning with greater confidence.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter's policy is apparently to let the dead rest. However, once anything like that continues to be a live matter there is no harm in referring to it, and whenever anybody takes that particular line in this House I hope that I or somebody else will reply to it.  I was amazed to hear Senator Doyle above all people take that line.  He says that there was too much insistence on the grow-more-wheat policy as a long-term policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will even grant that.  I think Senator Doyle is alone here in his view on that particular matter.  Were it not for the fact that we got in a few shiploads of wheat, I think Senator Doyle and everybody else would be satisfied that there was not half enough of the grow-more-wheat policy, whether as a long term or a short-term policy.  Were it not for the fact that the drive was made for the growing of wheat we would now be in a far different position from that in which we find ourselves.  Not alone would our people be hungry, but the country, perhaps would be forced into taking sides in this war, which would be a disaster that would throw this country back hundreds of years.  Notwithstanding the fact that I disagree 100 per cent. with Senator Doyle, I think it is a good thing that he or somebody like him should make a statement of that kind, if for no other reason than that the statement will have the same effect as the pebble in the stream, merely to show the strength of the current it is attempting to impede.  The people of the country, regardless of any political affiliations, have taken the line that the growing of wheat is the only sane policy for the country at present and the fact that Senator Doyle takes the attitude of the person who said: &ldquo;They are all out of step but our Johnny,&rdquo; is a good thing.</P>

      <P>I believe that considerable progress has been made in the growing of wheat and I agree largely <Col N="1901" /> with Senator O'Callaghan that the wheat crop this year will surpass our expectations of a few months ago.  In order to prove his theory, Senator Doyle, so to speak, points out the fields all over the country which were used for the growing of wheat in the old days.  Fortunately, he also pointed out, whether intentionally or not, that the fact that these fields were in a bad condition now was due to the fact that they were let-out without grass seeds. If that were done now or 100 years ago or in 100 years time, the result would be the same, because you cannot expect to have good grass unless you sow it.  That has nothing whatever to do with the growing of wheat.  It is no argument&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Doyle says that there is serious danger in growing &ldquo;things like wheat.&rdquo;  If we cannot grow &ldquo;things like wheat,&rdquo; and cannot continue to grow more things like wheat, the sooner we make up our minds to give up doing anything else the better. The people of the country are depending on the farmers and have depended on the farmers.  The farmers have not let them down so far, and I do not believe that they have any intention of letting them down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDoyle" hpid="Dr. Doyle Dr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I said we will have to grow wheat during the emergency and for some years afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As I say, I am glad that this matter has come up for discussion.  Without trying to score a point over Senator Baxter or any of the other speakers, with the possible exception of Senator Doyle, I think I am right in saying that the whole trend of this debate has gone to prove <Col N="1902" /> that the representatives of the people here have come to the conclusion that a policy of self-sufficiency is the only policy for the country.  Senator Baxter says that the diminution in the acreage under roots is a danger signal.  While I agree with him that it would be a disaster if that tendency continued and the acreage under roots continued to decrease, I am not inclined to agree with him that it is a very serious matter at present.  I think that may be attributed to the fact that a definite appeal was made by all Parties to people to grow wheat, and that where a man had an idea of growing an acre or two acres of turnips, when he came to the point of tilling the field he said to himself: &ldquo;If there is any danger of a shortage of wheat, perhaps I might as well put the whole field under wheat instead of putting in a couple of acres of turnips.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I believe farmers largely took that attitude and that, while there may be other reasons, it need not be regarded as what Senator Baxter calls a danger signal.  I believe it is also a fact that many farmers who have gone into the production of wheat and oats were not in a position during the past year or two years to go into the production of root crops at the same time because they had not the equipment or the farmyard manure.  I believe that they all realised the necessity for farmyard manure and, because of that, to the best of their ability they are adopting the policy of feeding stock in houses and producing farmyard manure and utilising their own straw.  Rather than having a continuation of the decline of the acreage under root crops, I believe we will have an increase in the acreage under root crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am 100 per cent. with Senator Baxter that we should have post-war planning and I am also 100 per cent. with him as to the importance of post-war planning in agriculture.  I believe it is of the very greatest importance, and I feel sure that the Minister for Agriculture also has his eye on that particular matter.  With regard to post-war planning, I believe that any committee set up to go into that matter should regard the question of agricultural transport as one of the most <Col N="1903" /> important matters.  I have stressed here on a good many occasions the necessity for retaining at least a considerable proportion of agricultural transport, and in fact other transport, for horses.  I feel that even those who did not agree with me when I stressed that some years ago will now agree with me as a result of their experience since the war.  When we were faced with war conditions, we found before the war had got well under way at all that our supplies of fuel for mechanical transport began to get scarce.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to fuel for mechanical transport is perhaps worse than we had anticipated.  I think, rather than bemoan our shortcomings, we should benefit by experience and make sure that in future we will not have a recurrence of what has happened during this period of emergency.</P>
    <P>All kinds of arguments can be put up and it will be pointed out that horses could not travel on the modern roads.  In any programme of post-war planning, rather than adopt the idea that horses cannot travel on the modern roads, the trend should be to make the modern roads suitable for horse transport.  We have roughly 450,000 horses in this country at the present time.  We have had that number over the past 40 or 50 years. It may have fluctuated to the extent of a few thousand horses in some years but it has not deviated very much from that point.  As has been pointed out by other speakers, we are perhaps the greatest horse-breeding country in the world.  I believe it is only right that we should continue to produce horses and that in any post-war planning the fact should not be overlooked that misfits in the production even of hunters will work satisfactorily on the land.  To my mind, it is insane to allow the transport of this country to go into the hands of people outside. That is what has been happening here. We have allowed our horses all over the country to go idle; we have allowed our men to go idle and at the same time we have imported tractors and mechanical transport and we have <Col N="1904" /> paid the people of other countries to supply the spare parts, fuel, tyres and everything else.  It would be just as sane for us to depend for our imports of wheat on foreign shipping.  To my mind there is no difference.</P>
    <P>If the policy of depending on foreign shipping for our imports of wheat has startled us during this period of emergency, it is a good thing, and as a result of the fright we have had, we may make provision against such a thing happening again.  I know that the tendency is, and will be&mdash;and perhaps it is the natural tendency &mdash; for people to say that you cannot put back the hands of the clock, and that when the war is over we must go back again to tractors and motor-cars, and all the rest of it.  I know very well that nothing that I will say will have the effect of eliminating motor transport or mechanical transport altogether, and I would not go so far as to say that that should be done, but I would say that we should put ourselves in the position that we will not be totally dependent or almost totally dependent on mechanical transport so long as that mechanical transport is dependent on outside supplies for its maintenance.</P>
    <P>Unless we say that this war is a war to end war, we must provide for the future.  My belief is that if this war had not come for another ten or 20 years we would find ourselves at the end of that period in the position that our mechanical transport had failed for lack of fuel oil or spare parts, or tyres or something else, and we would not have sufficient men in the country capable of tackling a pair of horses and putting them to work.  The same thing would apply to horse machinery, equipment and everything else.  Therefore, in any post-war planning, we should ensure that the transport, at least as far as agriculture is concerned, will be, to the greatest possible extent, horse transport.  If that is done, it will mean that we will have a market for agricultural produce; we will have employment for the saddlers, the carpenters, the wheelwrights, the blacksmiths, and various other people, which did not exist under the previous methods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1905" /> I was surprised that Senator Counihan referred to the cattle industry without making any reference to the canning industry.  I think it would be well if the Minister would let us have some idea as to what the future of the canning industry may be.  I believe the tendency is to buy foods in a more or less prepared condition, cooked foods, and in post-war planning particular attention should be given to that development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>That, I understand, is the position at the present time but it may be possible to make provision for the continuance and development of the canning industry, not only in connection with meat but in connection with fruit, vegetables and so on.  The question of artificial manures was stressed by Senator Baxter, Senator O'Callaghan and others.  I believe that much can be done without going into what might be called the actual production of what we understood by artificial manures.  I was glad to hear Senator O'Callaghan refer to the waste products at the beet factories. I have seen these piles of stuff there and often wondered why it was not utilised to a far greater extent by the farmers.  I went to the trouble of finding out the results where it had been used and I found they were very satisfactory. The difficulty, to my mind, is the question of transport.  Perhaps, if something could be done along the lines suggested by Senator O'Callaghan, it could be manufactured into something more easily handled. The difficulty at present is to find some way of handling it.  It is more or less in the form of mud; even the stuff that has been there a considerable time still retains the moisture and is very difficult to handle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results where it was used&mdash;of course, it can only be used within a reasonable distance of the factory &mdash; were very satisfactory.  The material is composed largely of lime and largely of the tare from the beet, that is, the stuff that is washed off from the roots <Col N="1906" /> of the beet, which must contain a lot of the best of the manure which adheres to the plant when it is growing. That stuff remains around each of the factories.  If that were utilised, I believe it would not go a very long way towards supplying our requirements or making up for the shortage of artificial manures.  I do not know how many tons would be at the factories, but I doubt very much if it would replace very many thousands of tons of artificial manures, but it would go some way.</P>
    <P>I believe much could be done if the people would only get back to the system that obtained 100 years ago or 50 years ago or even a shorter time ago.  I remember, when I was growing up, the efforts that were made in every farm in the country to produce farmyard manure.  Fences were cleaned down, furze was cut and put down in the farmyard and straw was put over it.  Nothing of that kind is done now. The gaps and the gateways were all covered in with waste material which was walked over by the stock and in that way very valuable manure was manufactured.  If that sort of thing were encouraged, a good deal could be done to make up for the loss of the artificial manures that we cannot obtain at the present time.</P>
    <P>I think everybody is in favour of doing all that can be done for the production of such artificial manures as can be produced here.  In addition to that, there should be far greater encouragement given to farmers to utilise the produce of their own farms. Notwithstanding all the lectures and propaganda, you will find people burning some of the most valuable stuff.  I met a man who proposed burning straw.  He said: &ldquo;What else can I do with it?&rdquo;  There is great need for propaganda in that connection.  It is somebody's job, not alone to tell the farmers these things, but to keep on telling them, and to explain that material of that kind is invaluable and, if they keep burning it, they will eventually get to the stage when they will not be able to grow any crops.</P>
    <P>As regards utilising horses as a means of transport, something should <Col N="1907" /> be done in that connection also.  You will find some people saying that horses cannot be used on the roads at the present time.  Others will tell you that they can be used, but the only way in which they can be properly used is to fit them with rubber shoes.  We all know that very soon rubber shoes will be a thing of the past.  The time is opportune for some statement on that subject by a recognised authority.  I do not claim to be an authority, but I may say I have used horses consistently for years &mdash; I have never given up driving horses and ponies &mdash; and I have never used rubber shoes, and yet never knew of a horse or pony to fall.</P>

      <P>I do not know that I am lucky.  I am not much of a believer in luck.  Prudence is far more important than luck and, if you take the necessary steps, you can prevent a lot of the disasters that are laid out for people who drive horses or ponies along the roads.  It is important that the Minister should get an expert, such as a veterinary surgeon or some other person thoroughly conversant with horses, to give advice to the people.  I believe a lot could be done if horses were properly shod.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>There you are coming against a greater difficulty.  There are persons driving horses at the moment who, although their fathers and grandfathers were accustomed to driving horses, do not know over which end of the horse the bridle should go.  I think it is essential for people using horses to ascertain the proper way to shoe a horse.  I believe that rubber shoes are bound to have a disastrous effect on the horse's hooves.  The hooves will become contracted and disease of the hoof may ruin many a good horse.  If horses are shod in such a way that the frog will rest on the ground, you can trot that horse on any street in Dublin without any danger of a fall.  If horses are properly shod you <Col N="1908" /> will cut down the quantity of iron required for shoeing and, more important still, you will allow the horse to travel in the way he was intended to travel &mdash; that is, to allow the frog to come in contact with the road.  That will prevent the animal slipping and prevent disease.</P>
      <P>With regard to the post-war planning scheme referred to by Senator Baxter, the Senator mentioned that the Minister is handicapped because he is connected with a Party Government and that various difficulties exist because of that.  He stated also that there must not be a change of policy with each change of Government.  Most people agree that it would be disastrous if you were to change agricultural policy with every change of Government. Once the people are satisfied that you have the right agricultural policy, there is no danger that even in the distant future they will be anxious for a change in that policy.  Unless we can remove international boundaries and seas which have existed since the Ice Age, the only sane policy for our country will be the policy of producing, as far as we can, the requirements of our people, whether during an emergency period or during a period of peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter said that the proposed committee should not be composed of civil servants.  I agree with the Senator.  I do not believe it would be a good thing if a committee of that kind were composed solely of civil servants.  But it would be equally foolish to set up a committee without the help of certain civil servants who have at their disposal numerous statistics relating to various parts of the country and who would be in a position to give assistance which could not be given by other persons.  The fact that a man happens to be a civil servant does not mean that his individuality has been absorbed by the service. I believe that a man who is the son of a farmer and who enters the Civil Service continues to have some connection with the farm, and, if he happens to be in a position in the Department of Agriculture and thus kept in touch with the agricultural industry, he would be invaluable on such <Col N="1909" /> a committee as that proposed to deal with post-war planning.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle said the growing of wheat as a long-term policy would tend to increase the flight from the land.  I do not think it is necessary for anybody to reply to such a statement.  If you continue to increase the acreage under wheat and other crops while people are leaving the country we may eventually arrive at the delightful stage when we can all live at the seaside and work charms to produce the crops.  Of course, that cannot be done. The greater the production of wheat and other crops, the greater will be the employment in rural areas and there will be a greater tendency for the people to drift from the towns and cities back to the land.  At present, there is a tendency in that direction. I believe that people have become land minded and that their eyes have turned from other countries to their own country.  They realise, as a result of the emergency, that the only way they can expect relief when they feel hungry is through what is produced by our own agriculturists.  Every encouragement should be given to the farmers to produce the necessaries of life for our people in this emergency and they should be given to understand that not alone will it be the policy of this Government to encourage and allow them to work the machinery which they have now set in motion, but that for many years to come a similar policy will prevail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad Senator O'Callaghan mentioned the by-products of the beet factories.  I understand those by-products are being used with great success by Mr. James Haverty, a member of the Beet Growers' Association in County Galway.  I understand the factory delivers these by-products free of ordinary costs, but the person to whom delivery is made is responsible for the cost of transport. I think that is very reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to artificial manures, we have all seen in the papers advertisements offering sulphate of ammonia and other artificial manures during the season at very exorbitant prices.  I know of one or two cases of merchants <Col N="1910" /> taking in some of the emergency artificial manures and selling out a mixture at very high prices.  I am not quarrelling so much with the prices, because I believe that, if people run the risk of taking stuff across the Border, they are entitled to fair compensation, and that while they are doing themselves a good service, they are also performing a good national service.  What I should like to know, however, is whether there is sufficient supervision or inspection to ensure that the article which a person buys is the type of article he expects to buy.  Is this material analysed and inspected as it should be?  When a person ventures to pay £25 a ton for what he expects is a special manure, does he really get that special manure?</P>
    <P>Another point to which I want to draw the Minister's attention is that, going through the country, one sees manure heaps in the farmyards of country houses which are composed mainly of dried matter, and I suggest that if the Department gave a grant for the erection of proper manure dumps which would preserve the liquid condition of the manure when taken from the stables, it would be a great advantage.  It would help towards the cleaniness of the farmyard and would provide much better material than the semi-dry hay or straw which is available under present conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>A very large number of points have been raised, and I feel it would be rather unfair to those faithful members who remained to see the debate out that I should keep them too long. However, some very interesting points have been raised with which I want to deal.  The big matter which Senator Baxter raised was that of post-war planning.  We have been considering this matter for some time in the Department, and have given a good deal of thought to it, and to the question of how to approach it, as it were, in the beginning.  I suppose the first point we should have to consider is that of having the land in the best possible condition for increased production, if we can have increased production when the war is over.  Towards that end, <Col N="1911" /> we decided, at the beginning of the war, not to continue the scheme of reclamation and drainage, and so on, but, on considering the matter further and looking to what we thought would be post-war conditions, we thought it might be well to have whatever secondary land there is improved somewhat under this scheme of reclamation and drainage.</P>
      <P>The next point that would strike one is that which we hear so much talked about at present &mdash; the fertility of the soil.  That is a matter which we have been considering.  We have had under consideration various proposals, firstly, for the preservation of the fertility of the land as far as possible.  During the war, of course, that is not feasible, if we are to produce the food we require, without a supply of artificials while the war lasts, but we have been considering how to preserve that fertility as far as possible, and, in addition, to see whether we could have some scheme of improving the fertility of the soil immediately the war is over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point one must think of in relation to production is markets because there is not much use in asking a farmer to produce an article unless he can sell it, and can sell it at a remunerative price.  That brings us into very big questions which can scarcely be decided by my Department alone.  Big questions will arise in that respect &mdash; they have been touched on in this debate &mdash; in regard to what we must import when the war is over, what we shall pay for those imports and whether it will be necessary to have certain agricultural exports, at least, to pay for those necessary imports.  Coming away from these matters which might be dealt with by my Department on the supposition that certain imports will be necessary, we then have the question of home needs &mdash; whether we should supply all these needs and whether or not we should grow all the wheat and other commodities which we require when the war is over.  There is then the question of whether we should go in for a big export, and, if so, in what particular lines and where is there <Col N="1912" /> likely to be a remunerative return for what exports we might have.</P>
    <P>These are all very big questions. There is a good deal of conjecture about the future and I suppose that, on the whole, anybody considering these matters would only have to use his best judgment as to what the position will be.  He may be wrong, and if he is wrong in his judgment, his recommendations also will be wrong. Then such questions as the method of production, marketing and so on &mdash;&mdash; co-operation, for instance &mdash; will have to be considered, with a view to seeing whether we should develop co-operation more fully than we have developed it, or whether in certain lines of production some sort of State organisation is not preferable.  In respect of sugar production, we have a State organisation, if you like to call it such, for dealing with beet, and butter production is practically entirely co-operative. These are two very good and now well-established systems, and it is easy for anybody to look at the working of co-operation in the butter industry and the working of a State institution in relation to beet, and to see which is the better for application to any other commodity which we might have under consideration.</P>
    <P>We might, for instance, consider bacon and ask whether it is advisable to convert the present system of bacon-marketing either to a co-operative system or a State system, such as we have in the case of beet.  These are matters which would have to be considered. I do not know, at the moment anyhow, what the answer would be.  There is also the other point that the Department or a State organisation has had to take over control of the export of certain commodities. It is a matter for consideration whether that should not continue when the war is over, or whether that control should be dropped and export be allowed to go back to the old system of freedom to the exporter.  Take, as an example, eggs.  They are all exported now through one organisation, and there is a good deal of advantage in that control by one organisation, but there may be, at the same time, certain disadvantages. <Col N="1913" /> There is always the disadvantage in these schemes that an enterprising person may be able to do better than the general body but, on the other hand, there is more likelihood of having a higher level all around by having an organisation of this kind. These are matters to be considered.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter wants to know how far we have got with the consideration of these matters.  I say we have been considering the various aspects of the questions I have enumerated here, but I think if we want to get down to what people expect in the way of post-war planning, we should have to find an answer to all these questions I have just put.  What is the best way to deal with them?  We have been dealing with them in the Department and we have gone some distance in the consideration of some of them.  Others we have only put down on paper as things thought of but not yet decided.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with some speakers, particularly Senator Baxter and Senator Quirke, that the officers of the Department would not be the best body to carry out this work.  I think myself they would be the best body, but there are two objections to that. The first objection is that it is not easy to find a mature and able man in a Department such as mine to deal with everything that comes up, and if I were to pick out one or two of them for a job like that, it would be hard to find substitutes for them to carry on the current work of the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I said such a body should not be composed altogether of officers of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The second objection is that evidently they would not be acceptable to most people.  I take it that Senator Baxter and Senator Quirke are voicing only the opinions of people generally, that civil servants alone &mdash; taking Senator Quirke's qualification &mdash; are not the best to deal with matters like this.  However, I did decide a short time ago&mdash;I am only in the process of asking certain people whether they would be willing to act <Col N="1914" />&mdash; to set up a very small committee to deal with this matter.  That will be practically an exclusively expert committee. I do not think it would be advisable to get the Agricultural Commission which was composed of 27 or 28 persons&mdash;a number of them farmers, a number of them economists, and a number of official people like professors &mdash; to do this particular job. It is not so easy, in fact it would be impossible, to get a large body like that to deal with it, because I think whoever is to deal with it will have to meet often and give a great deal of thought to it.  They will have to go very minutely into statistics and returns of various kinds.  They will have to study the subject very deeply.  I think on the whole the best type of body to deal with it, from every point of view, would be a small committee, a very technical committee.  That is the line upon which I have decided and, as I say, I have only so far got to the point of asking certain people if they would be prepared to take on this particular task.  It will be a difficult task because they will have to give a great deal of time to it.  I think, too, it will be a rather unenviable task because it is not very easy to present a report that will convince everybody that it contains the best solution that can be arrived at.  I think, however, we shall get people willing to undertake the job.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of fertilisers various points were raised and I should like to disabuse some Senators' minds of opinions expressed here.  This is not a question of a shortage of sulphuric acid.  I think perhaps the best way to approach this question is to say, first of all, that we are not going to have much imported raw phosphates.  We got none or practically none, last year. If the wheat crop turns out to be as good as we hope, we shall have enough wheat for our own requirements.  In that way, we shall be somewhat better off as regards shipping.  If we do not require any shipping for wheat, it may be possible to get some allocation of shipping accommodation for raw phosphates.  The question then is to get the raw phosphates.  Senators know where they can be got &mdash; Africa. Africa is a very hard place to get at, at the moment.  There are various difficulties with regard to permits from belligerents before we can get in there.  There are other difficulties, too. If these difficulties can be overcome, if in the first place we have enough wheat for our own requirements and can spare shipping and if, in the second place, we can overcome the external difficulties we are up against, we hope to import some raw phosphates but the quantity will not be large.  A quantity of 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000 tons is a fairly big proposition considering the amount of shipping <Col N="1916" /> we have at our disposal but it is very small in proportion to the amount of phosphates we want in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy The McGillycuddy">
      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we would need at least 150,000 tons.  In addition we have got native phosphates.  There are three difficulties in regard to native phosphates &mdash; the speed at which the raw material can be mined or quarried as the case may be, transport and sulphuric acid.  I believe the real controlling factor is transport.  In other words, we could I believe get as much phosphate as the transport companies are able to carry.  The transport companies can only take a certain amount away from the native mines or quarries. We have a certain amount of pyrites in the country to make sulphuric acid.  We can, if necessary, get all the native pyrites required.  They are not as effective as the imported variety but still they will do and we can get enough to carry on.  Therefore, the real controlling factor is transport as far as native phosphates are concerned.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question?  Can he tell us whether the necessary explosives are available for the mines, and whether every effort is being made to release those explosives to the mines in order to secure as great an output as possible? I have some reason to suppose that there has been difficulty not in obtaining explosives from outside but in releasing to the mines the explosives that are in the country.</P>

      <P>I have not heard that they are held up for want of explosives, but I am glad that Senator Robinson has raised that point, because I should like to inquire into it. Of course, those things change from day to day.  At the moment, it would appear anyway that transport is our difficulty; we could get a little more if the transport were improved.  Taking the most optimistic view of the whole thing&mdash;getting what we can out of our native mines, importing what we can with the shipping at our command, and <Col N="1917" /> getting all this raw material manufactured into superphosphates &mdash; we will still have very little more than we had in this present year.  We will have something more, but not a great deal. Of course, as every Senator knows, that is entirely inadequate for our needs.</P>

      <P>Clover seeds, of course, are very scarce, but I suppose something could be done by way of fertilisation of the land for wheat by putting in clover or some other leguminous crop and ploughing it in for wheat.  A question was raised by Senator Dr. Doyle with regard to blood and bone manure.  I have seen the analysis of this particular manure to which Dr. Doyle referred and it is very good. At the price at which it was sold, it is very good value compared with other manures at the moment.  Of course, <Col N="1918" /> the supply is very limited, and there is no chance, so far as I can see, of increasing it.  I agree with Senator Quirke that we ought not to draw any deductions from one year's root crop.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one compound made for the 1942 crop.  We got a compound manure made by the fertiliser manufacturers here, and they included in it all the nitrogen and potash available in the country.  That was sold as a compound manure.  The retail merchant could sell only to a farmer who had purchased manure from him in 1941.  Under an Order made by me, he could sell to that farmer a certain proportion of the 1941 supply.  I was pressed to make that Order by many farmers who were afraid they would not get their fair share of what was there.  I think we would have had very bitter complaints from some farmers if they got none at all while perhaps they saw their neighbours getting as much as ever.</P>
      <P>The retailer would naturally be inclined to give a fair supply to his good customers, while perhaps not giving so much to the man who was a bit slow about paying, so we thought it advisable to make that Order so as to ensure a fair distribution.  We did not see how we could deal with the farmer who had not purchased any manures in 1941, but there was a clause put into the Order to the effect that the merchant could ask the Minister for Agriculture for a permit to sell to such a person.  I cannot remember that very many applications were made under that clause.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a good case were put up for a farmer who had not purchased any manures last year, and wanted to get some this year, the application would certainly be considered.  I was about to say that I do not like to see deductions drawn from one year's figures.  The fact that the root crop <Col N="1919" /> went down somewhat this year may be due to one cause or another, so we had better wait for another year before we come to the conclusion that there is going to be a continual decline in the root crop.  I may say that I myself was quite prepared for a big drop in the beet acreage, because I did not see how the people who used to grow a large number of acres in the past, with artificial manures, could continue to grow that acreage.  It was only natural to expect that they would have to come down to the smaller number of acres which could be grown with farmyard manure.  On the other hand, mangolds and turnips were usually grown, I take it, with farmyard manure, and it is not so easy to see why there should be a decline there, but, as I say, it is better not to pay too much attention to one year's figures.  For instance, there was a very poor yield of wheat last year, and many people were inclined to take it for granted that the yield would be down from year to year on account of the scarcity of fertilisers and so on, but it would now appear that certain Senators anyway believe that there will be a bigger yield of wheat per acre this year than there was last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not given any opinion on the yield so far.  We come, then, to this question of bacon, which was raised by a number of speakers. At the beginning of the war I remember discussing this matter &mdash; I am not sure whether it was in the Department or whether it was discussed publicly, but I think it probably was discussed publicly &mdash; and thinking that, if the war <Col N="1920" /> went on, and all imports of grain and imports of artificial manures were shut down, it was inevitable that we should have to turn over to the production of human food, particularly, of course, to the growing of wheat; that that would mean less grain for animals, and that the number of animals would have to be reduced.  At the beginning of the war, for instance, I remember reading a report that in England they had provided for the total destruction of the pigs and poultry of the country if necessary, and it did look as if even here we might have to go some distance in that direction.  I do not think we should be too surprised or even too disappointed at the reduction in the number of pigs in the country.  We did want at the beginning of the war, in order to replace all the wheat and maize, and so on, that was coming in, another 1,000,000 acres under grain.  Of course, we have not got that 1,000,000 acres yet, although we have done very well, I believe, in all the circumstances, in going up to at least three-fourths if not four-fifths of the 1,000,000 acres this year.  It looks, anyway, as if we had reached the point of growing enough grain for human food.  If we can add to that a little more, we may be able to get back to the number of animals we had when the war commenced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether the Department has any policy with regard to increasing the number of ducks even if we must reduce the number of hens?  Ducks do not eat anything which would be needed for human food; they can live on what they forage for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one great trouble about ducks now, and that is that we have not an export market for duck eggs.  We had a market up to about 12 months ago, but that has stopped. They are very good, of course, for home food, but there is no export market.  The result is that the price of the duck egg is very much more lower than that of the hen egg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is, although ducks eat a good lot too.  With regard to the point raised by Senator Dr. Doyle that it may be too late when the war is over to get back to full butter and bacon production, and that we should try to do it now, that matter requires some consideration too.  First of all, I do not think that our creamery butter production is very much lower; at least, I should put it this way, that the number of cows is not very much lower, but apparently what is happening is that the cows are not fed so well as they were before the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister the figures for June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got them with me.  The number of cows as compared with last year is down by only about 2,000 or 3,000.  If those figures are correct &mdash; and as I have said before, both here and in the Dáil, although they may not be exactly correct down to one cow those figures are comparatively correct taking one year with the other &mdash; we may take it that there is a slight reduction in the number of cows, but not nearly enough to account for the reduction in the output of butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can only conclude, seeing that the cows are there, that they are not so well fed.  The difficulty I want to put before Senator Doyle is this: How can we keep more cows and more pigs? How are we to feed them?  We have 700,000 or 800,000 acres less for grazing. We have still the same number of cattle, almost as many sheep, as many horses, and we are grazing as many animals as when the war commenced, but we have 700,000 or 800,000 acres less to graze them on. That is the difficulty.  Senator Doyle said that we could deal with it by giving a large subsidy.  It is true that we could give encouragement, but no matter what encouragement we give how could farmers keep more cattle? I do not think they could do it.  If we were in a position to import artificial manures we could say to farmers: &ldquo;Your land is not carrying as many animals as it should carry if properly treated.&rdquo;  We might then encourage <Col N="1922" /> farmers to bring in artificial manures to increase the grazing capacity.  We are held up there and we cannot do it.  I am afraid we cannot do very much in the way of increasing the number of cows.  In fact, we might be better off if we had somewhat fewer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

I cannot say whether there are better cows going out this year than in 1937 and 1938.  I do not know of any reason to assume that that is so, or that the cream of our cows are going out now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Doyle says that we ought to get back to keeping the normal number of sows and boars and, if necessary, subsidise the export of bacon, so that the farmer would have a return and keep in production until the war is over.  I do not think we <Col N="1923" /> have the feeding to do that.  The reduction in the number of pigs is entirely due to feeding.  Anybody who examines certain charts showing the number of sows and the number of fat pigs as well as the price of feeding pigs and store pigs, will have to come to the conclusion that it is entirely a matter of feeding.  If the feeding position improves, as it may this year, provided that the yield of oats and barley is good, then we may be in a position to get a greater pig production than we have had for some time past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered that. It is a big question.  As to Senator Robinson's point, the amount done under the farm improvement scheme is as much as could really be expected. In fact, we had to refuse a certain number of applications, first, because we had exceeded the amount of money voted, but we have made that the basis of getting more, and, in the second place, because the work was more than the staff we had could deal with.  I doubt if it is necessary to give a larger grant.  Evidently the scheme is very popular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  I think it would have been very hard to give priority to anybody in that particular line.  One Senator made the point that the officials of my Department were not the best people to bargain with Great Britain in the various negotiations about the export of agricultural commodities, and that we should send exporters.  I do not agree with that.  The object of an exporter, if he were a selfish man&mdash;and we have always to be careful to see that he is not selfish&mdash;would be to get a volume of exports near the margin.  Probably the great majority would do the best they could for the farmers, but an exporter told me once that it did not matter to him what the price was as long as his margin remained; whether it went up or down it did not make any difference to him.  In case exporters took a selfish view, it is better that officials should do the negotiating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Invariably they bring members of the trade with them who are present at the negotiations.  In some of these lines men in the trade have practically dropped going across to Britain as they said that they could not do very much to help.  We are anxious that they should accompany the officials on these negotiations.  Senator The McGillycuddy mentioned that the Taoiseach gave some figures.  I am not sure if I followed the Senator correctly, but he misunderstood what was said.  The Taoiseach said that he was taking it that we would get five barrels to the acre delivered to the mills.  That has been the experience <Col N="1925" /> for years.  From 1933 our experience has been that about five barrels are delivered to the mills.  That was after the farmers got back what they required for seed, for sale for seed, and what they required for their own households, as well as whatever wastage occurred.  I do not know of any reason why there should be less than five barrels this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy The McGillycuddy">
      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Five barrels to the acre would provide what we need now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Questions were asked about the regulations regarding wheat.  Growers can only sell to millers or millers' agents or sell for seed. That is all that they can dispose of. They cannot dispose of it to anybody else.  Growers can keep for themselves one barrel for each member of the household and for men working with them.  They are entitled to keep a barrel for every person in the household. I agree with Senator Counihan that stall-fed cattle will disappear at present prices.  As the Senator said, it is the comparative price of stall-fed and store cattle that is going to kill that trade.  We have tried to make the British Minister of Food see that point, but we have not succeeded in impressing him so far.  We intend to press that point again for the coming year, because I feel there has to be an improved price for stall-fed cattle between March and May, as farmers who intend to stall-feed would want to know that by the end of next month.  I suppose they should know sooner in order to have turnips sown. We will use the usual pressure, but I do not know whether or not we are going to succeed.  We can, at least, show by the figures that we were right in our contention, that that trade is disappearing, and in that way we may have some influence with those concerned. With regard to bees' fittings, there was a great scarcity of wax, but I was told by some exporters that they expected more wax this month.  As it is getting late now, there is not much use in putting foundations in the crates and sections.  It was my experience <Col N="1926" /> that there was a fair supply of crates and frames, and that the only things scarce early in the year were the foundations.</P>

      <P>No.  I hope we will have it next year.  A consignment is expected next month.  As a result of a talk with Senator O'Callaghan and his colleagues I raised the question of lime at beet factories with the beet company and they informed me that they had discussions with the transport companies and that it is under consideration; it is too early yet to say with what success, but the matter will not be lost sight of. Senator Doyle raised a point about 40/- being paid for wheat in the last century.  It is hardly fair to compare that 40/- with 50/- now and, at the same time, to compare the value of money.  Senators will at least have to allow for progress in the elimination of labour as far as the wheat crop is concerned.  At that time wheat was sown by hand, covered with a shovel and reaped with a reaping-hook, but things are different now.  We could hardly take it as fair to compare 40/- then with 50/- now.  It was advocated by Senator Doyle that when the war is over we should have a large-scale tillage policy with no preference for wheat.  I do not see any great objection to that but a price must be fixed for wheat.  Otherwise I do not see how such a project would operate. If a price for wheat is not fixed naturally the price would go down to the level of imported wheat, and that would mean that wheat would be out of control.  I do not see how we could have a large-scale tillage policy unless we agreed also to stop the imports of wheat or maize or, at least, to control wheat or maize or both.  That will mean having dearer wheat here.  It is assumed that the foreign stuff would be much cheaper than what we could grow.  Otherwise, we would not want any regulations for having stuff here for our animals dearer than we could import it.  If we do export pigs it will be held by some that we are in competition with countries that have cheap feeding-stuffs for producing bacon and <Col N="1927" /> eggs.  I am just mentioning the things said to me during the last ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator The McGillycuddy said that, if we are to get our full requirements next year in wheat, we may need a larger percentage of tillage.  That has to be considered, but I think we have almost reached the limit.  It is extremely difficult for certain farmers to till more than 25 per cent., especially if they are doing the proper rotation, and if, in addition to that 25 per cent., they have 8 or 9 per cent. on their first crop meadow, that brings their tillage, as computed in the last war, up to 33 per cent.</P>
      <P>There are two things troubling me more than an increased area.  The first is with regard to wheat.  It has been advocated from various quarters that we should have compulsory wheat growing.  That suggestion does not come, by any means, from cranks or people of that kind not in the business themselves, but has come to me more from farmers growing their own quota and who say that, while they are growing probably more than would be necessary if everybody grew wheat, their neighbours are getting away with the refusal to grow it.  We must consider whether we should have compulsory wheat growing or not&mdash;that is, a certain percentage under wheat, subject to a right of appeal in the case of certain types of land.</P>
      <P>The second thing troubling me is the continuous cropping by certain farmers.  They never tilled before, and they have probably the best land in the country.  They have tilled the very worst part of it, and they mean to go on growing there until the war is over. That is not obeying the spirit of the law, though it may be obeying the letter.  It is a very bad spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They look upon wheat as an &ldquo;untouchable&rdquo; crop, and they try to save as much of their farms as possible from that contagion.  We cannot rule out the possibility that the area <Col N="1929" /> must be increased to more than 25 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The exemptions are very few.  There are certain exemptions, in the case of sports fields, for instance. That includes golf courses, but in the beginning of the war I was strongly urged to exempt such places in view of the very good employment given.  The total amount we would get, if all the exempted land were tilled, would not be more than 100 or 200 acres altogether. It was held that, if we had tilled those places, some of them would find it impossible to carry on, and the loss in employment would be very serious.</P>

    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy The McGillycuddy">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any such portion, tillage is insisted on.  In fact, some of the golf courses have tilled all the available land, outside the course, and in that way are practically complying with the Order as if they were not exempt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another exempted class is the stud farms.  In the last war, a case was made for these stud farms, and we seem to have adopted it this time on the same argument.  In the case of a high-class stud farm for horses&mdash;and in some cases, for cattle and sheep&mdash;they must have a large amount of grass land as pasture and for the young horses to run on.  We allow ten acres for every brood mare actually bred on the stud farm, but we make no allowance for young horses or yearlings.  Only the ten acres are exempt.  On a stud farm of 100 acres, with two brood mares, we allow 20 acres off, and the rest is subject to the tillage Order.  There is no stud farm entirely exempt.  The <Col N="1930" /> only other exemption I can recollect is the accommodation parks, as on the north side of the city, for cattle coming to the market and to the abattoir.  It is hard to see how these cattle could be dealt with unless the parks are there.  I do not know the total amount of land concerned in these exemptions, but it would be a very small amount. If Senators are interested, I could get the total acreage, but the amount of extra tillage that would be obtained if there were no exemptions would not be appreciable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy The McGillycuddy">
      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another type of exemption, where the inspector visits the land and schedules so much as arable and the remainder as not being arable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we leave out whatever is exempted, the inspector's opinion must be taken on the land itself.  He visits the farm and gives his opinion as to the amount of arable land on it.  I can see no other way of doing it.  We cannot go on the valuation basis.  I had a certain farm in County Clare investigated.  The valuation was very high and, no doubt, it was very good fattening land for cattle; but the report I got was that there was not a perch in it where there was not a rock coming up through the surface and that it could not be used for tillage, though it was very good for grazing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy The McGillycuddy">
      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Land that is too wet for tillage would be exempt also, as well as mountain land.  I feel we have to take the inspector's opinion.  I got some complaints last year of this nature, and sent four senior inspectors of the Department to visit every inspector on tillage work.  They spent a day or two with each tillage inspector and, taking some farms at random, asked the inspector to bring them out to those farms.  They saw the tillage inspector's report as to what he had classed as arable land on each farm.  The report I received was that, while they would not agree in all cases with the tillage inspector, <Col N="1931" /> and while they would have put a few acres more into the arable capacity in some cases and a few acres less in other cases, on the whole the inspectors were doing their duty as reasonably as could be expected.  They are practically in a judicial position in such cases, and they are doing their best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand.  Senator Quirke raised a point about tractors as against horses and said, quite truthfully, that fuel for tractors is dependent on shipping and is, to some extent, the same as bringing in wheat, if we have to work the land for the wheat.  That is quite true.  It is, undoubtedly, a dangerous form of power, as far as we are concerned here, but I am afraid that there is no administration or no law that could stop that sort of change-over, to some extent at least, from the horse to the tractor.  I think, however, that when the war is over we should do everything we can to discourage it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the future of the canning industry, before the war started there was some canning done here.  Waterford, for instance, was doing it for the home market before the war, but they never could compete on the foreign market.  As far as I know&mdash;I am not exactly sure&mdash;they were not able to compete on the foreign market at all until the war commenced.  Since the war began, of course, our canning industry is doing well, but when the war is over it is very hard to say what the position of that industry will be.  I have taken a note of Senator Quirke's point about the shoeing of horses and will try to <Col N="1932" /> get some expert opinion on that.  If the expert opinion is likely to prove useful to farmers, I shall try to get it broadcast for their information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I see.  There is some supervision of artificial manures that are for sale.  We have some inspectors, but the number is very small&mdash;only two, I think&mdash;to go around the whole country.  These inspectors take samples, and there is an Act governing the matter of analysis, and so on, and where-ever they think that anything is wrong they apply the Act.  I have also taken a note of Senator Hawkins' suggestion as to a grant for liquid manure tanks; but unfortunately another difficulty has arisen in that connection in the last few days, and that is the scarcity of cement.  On the whole, therefore, I do not think that in the circumstances we could advocate a grant at the moment.  I think, Sir, those were the only points that were made.  I am grateful to the Senators for raising the particular points they did raise.  Some of them were really very useful, and, in conclusion, I should like to assure the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes could he tell us something as to the position in regard to binder twine?  Farmers are very much concerned about statements made by distributors of binder twine, to the effect that they can get only 50 per cent. of the amount they got last year.  It must be remembered that we are tilling 25 per cent. this year, more than last year, and if that is the position in regard to binder twine, it is a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position about binder twine, as I think I said before, both here and in the Dáil, is that with great care and, in fact, more than care &mdash;generosity, as it were, between one farmer and another, where, if one had a little over, he would share with one who had less&mdash;we should have enough, <Col N="1933" /> but it is terribly hard to distribute it when the supply is so very tight. Supplies were issued by a certain number of importers, and also by Irish Ropes, Limited, who were manufacturing the twine, and the result was that some retailers got about 100 per cent. of what they got last year&mdash;in fact, it is alleged that some of them got a little more than 100 per cent.&mdash;while others got as low as 25 per cent., for a start off, but I think that under the arrangement for distribution that we have now&mdash;we had them in the Department up to recently and will have them again in a day or two&mdash;every trader, by now, should have at least 75 per cent. of what he had last year&mdash;at any rate, if he has not 75 per cent., there is some mistake and we should like to hear from him.  That will mean that, by now, the position should be that everybody has 100 per cent., with the exception of certain traders who have only 75 per cent., and an attempt will be made to deal with those.  I do not know if we will really have enough to bring those up to the 100 per cent. also.</P>

      <P>Well, both are dealing with it.  Another point is that I understand that that twine is given out by weight.  There is a greater length in it, for the weight, this year than last year, and on that account it should go farther.  I was just concluding on the other point.  I was going to say that I hope to have this small commission &mdash;or perhaps I should call it a committee&mdash;for planning set up soon, and I am sure the members of it would be very glad, as I would be glad, if any Senator would send along suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been concerned for some time as to the eventual effect of the very large number of young men and women who have been permitted to go to various places overseas during this emergency.  These young people have been allowed to go overseas during the last two years. Now, at first sight it may seem to be the obvious solution or remedy, at a time when there is not full employment for them in our industry or our agriculture, and of course it relieves the Government from paying very considerable benefits in unemployment.  It relieves the country from the possibility of unrest, due to unemployment, and the country also benefits by the very considerable remittances which a great number of these people send home to their families in this country. It seems to me, however, that the exodus has gone a good deal further than is desirable or necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear in the Dáil of the turf production board complaining that there is insufficient labour and that the turf workers are holding a pistol at the head of the Turf Controller and actually drawing, for a very short day, plus food, a very much higher wage, in proportion, than what the farm labourer, who makes a contract with the farmer, draws for a seven-day week, plus extra time at night, naturally.  At the same time, we see an advertisement in the paper from the Minister for Agriculture, stating that a considerable number of farmers are going to be short of labour during the coming harvest and asking them to report their shortages and, at the same time, to tell him what arrangements they can make for food and accommodation during the harvest.  We all know that very few, except big farmers, have any extra decent accommodation to put men into.  The farming system is dependent on two factors.  There is, first of all, the <Col N="1935" /> farmer and, secondly, the labourers living in and between the farms who can get to their work on a bicycle and can go to their own homes for their meals.  It would be a very serious thing if we were still to allow these foreign agents to come into this country to clear those people out. While that is the situation here, I fear that that part of the machinery of production will finally break down altogether.</P>
    <P>If this emigration goes on it may have very serious repercussions, indeed.  At the end of the war it may lead to the repatriation of a lot of those boys and girls.  That will be necessary because the allied nations fighting now will want to get their service personnel back into the ranks of labour.  Otherwise, the latter will get restless.  In order to place them in employment, the natural thing to do will be to send our emigrants home. When the latter come back the problem of dealing with them will be a vast one.  They have been accustomed, while away, to spending money very freely.  A great many of them have been able to take holidays on which they spend a good part of their savings. When they return, if they are offered very much lower wages than they have been accustomed to, they will become discontented and dissatisfied. That may lead to unrest.  It may lead to all sorts of trouble when the war is over.  I think I have said enough to make it possible for the House to realise that there is an immediate aspect as well as a future aspect to this problem.  I am sure Senators are anxious to know what view the Government take of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to take a note of the situation regarding the proposal to replace the Barrels and the Conisberg lightships with whistling buoys.  This has already been done in the case of the Barrels lightship.  It is also proposed to remove the Conisberg lightship and replace it with a whistling buoy.  This proposal is regarded with the gravest concern by the Waterford and Cork Harbour Commissioners, and by the <Col N="1936" /> owners of ships going to Waterford and Cork.  The masters of those ships consider that, even with these light vessels there at the present time, they are running very considerable risks, and do not consider that the replacement of the vessels with whistling buoys is going to give them anything like adequate protection.  I would be glad if the Minister for Finance would point this out to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, so that that Department might make representations to the Irish Lights Commissioners.  The masters of those vessels say that a whistling buoy will not work in very calm or foggy weather, and that in stormy weather, when they come downwind on the whistling buoy, they will not hear it until they are on top of it. There are only a few cable lengths between where it is proposed to put this buoy and the mine-fields, and there is only one and a half miles on the other side to the Conisberg rock, so that the Minister can appreciate that the passage for these vessels is a very narrow and perilous one.  The proposal to replace with buoys is being made, apparently, because of the risk that the lightships' crews run from drifting mines.  It has been suggested that if the crew were armed, even with a rifle, they could sink or explode any of these mines that come adrift before they could make contact with their ship.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the Minister is aware that there is a constant flow of young men from the country.  For months and weeks I have seen them go from Galway.  The number of girls going across is very greatly on the increase.  Some of the girls from Galway have left situations to go across.  I think they complied with the regulations to a certain extent by leaving these and registering at the labour exchange, but they were lured by the promise of high wages.  I think £3 10/- per week was offered to girls in service.  I do not know whether any inquiry was made as to the conditions under which these girls would work or the dangers to which they might be exposed and what is to become of them when the war ends and they come back to us.  These are <Col N="1938" /> very grave matters and they certainly deserve the consideration of the Government.</P>

He suggests that the Irish news should be given first and that included in it there should be such items as the cattle market report, reports as to the price of eggs and similar announcements and, in addition to that, the racing news and the greyhound news that is usually given at the end.  All the Irish news should be given first and then let them talk about Benghazi, Mersa Matruh and those other places at the end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only a few questions to put to the Minister.  First of all, I should like to have a statement from him as to the Government's intentions with reference to family allowances for agricultural workers with children under 15 years of age.  The Seanad passed a resolution some months ago requesting the Government <Col N="1939" /> to put such a scheme into operation either by introducing legislalation or by an Emergency Powers Order, but we have had no intimation since as to what the Government intend to do in the matter.  I do not want to recapitulate the arguments that we used on that occasion, but I think they were convincing because the House passed that resolution unanimously. Therefore, I should like to know if the Government have considered the matter and what they intend doing.</P>
      <P>I should also like to ask the Minister if he has examined the recommendations of the conference which he so very kindly set up to consider the question of credit facilities for farmers. Personally I am very grateful to him for calling that conference.  I do not want to refer to the discussions which took place, as I understand they are confidential, at least for the present. But I would be glad if the Minister would say at what time he proposes to put the recommendations of that conference into operation and if he will consider putting them into operation before the time comes for the letting of land which is generally about the 1st October, as he might consider giving advances to those farmers who have not sufficient credit to stock their own lands.  If it is to be done at all, I think it should be done fairly quickly.  I think it should be done in the course of the next couple of months.  As the Minister understands, the time for making provision for tillage and grazing is in the early autumn.  I know it is not an easy matter to arrange, particularly with Civil Service Departments.  But, if it is to be done at all, it should be done within the next two or three months.  Therefore, I request the Minister, if he intends to do it, to do it before that time; otherwise there will be another year wasted.</P>

      <P>On a similar Vote, which is to be accounted for by the Minister for Finance, the question of the Irish Tourist Board arises.  The report of the discussion on the Estimate for this particular board in the Dáil was quite a short one, but it <Col N="1940" /> amounted to this: that the board was functioning; that owing to want of funds in the present time of stringency, they were not actually carrying out any works, but that they were contemplating several very considerable schemes.  That is all very well and we would be very glad if they went forward with them when the money is available.  But what we all felt and recommended to the Minister for Industry and Commerce when the Bill was going through the House was that the first thing we should do would be to urge, and to help by grants or loans or instructions, hotel proprietors throughout the country to modernise their hotels and keep them on the same standard as the smaller hotels on the continent or the road-houses all over England and Scotland to which the hikers go.  That is what tourists expect and what our people from Dublin and other cities expect when they go to country districts.</P>
      <P>I come from a big tourist area and in the biggest town there, which is an actual tourist centre, there is not what I would call one really modern hotel. There is one in Tralee which is absolutely first-class, but that is due entirely to the personal efforts of the proprietor without any help from the Tourist Board.  The remainder are what you would call second-class so far as modernity is concerned, which is what the young people who want to take their holidays in this country are looking for.  I know there are other Senators who have the same ideas and the same experience.  I do hope that some influence will be directed on the people who run this Tourist Board&mdash;I understand there is quite a considerable number of them&mdash;and persuade them to work on these lines rather than on the more grandiose schemes which they are contemplating for the future.  Let them be ready when the war is over so that people can go to these hotels and get what they expect.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Vote itself, can the Minister give us any indication as to how this £6,500 which is shown for 1942-3 is proposed to be spent?  Is it for salaries and directors' fees, or is it for grants-in-aid to various hotel keepers who want to improve their hotels?</P>

I would have something to say on that, but I have been informed, I do not know how authentically, that individual coupons will be used in the near future in regard to tea and sugar as in the case of drapery goods.

      <P>I would like to associate myself with what was said just now by Senator The McGillycuddy. About 50 years ago the hotels in France &mdash;apart from those that were hotels de luxe and meant for moneyed tourists&mdash;were of a very low quality, and a philanthropic body styled The Touring Club of France took the matter in hand and provided all the smaller hotels with proper modern sanitary equipment and adornment of the type that would make a stay in the hotel a source of pleasure.  They made the allowance in this fashion: they defrayed half the cost themselves out of their own funds, and permitted the hotel proprietors to pay by instalments for the remaining half of the expenditure. In a very little while France became an ideal place for lower middle-class tourists, and particularly for the French people themselves.  It is that type of thing, the making&mdash;I hate to use <i>clichés</i> but it comes to my lips&mdash;of a home away from home, a place where it is pleasant to be, a place which is a pleasant centre to stay at, from which to survey and enjoy a country place that counts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of food. I remember one of our fellow-citizens, a lady critic, incurred great odium by <Col N="1942" /> saying what I am about to say&mdash;that cookery, especially in hotels that are not of the highest flight, is anything but what it ought to be.  A few years ago in connection with this very praiseworthy attempt to establish tourism as one of our national industries, to exploit all the advantages of the beautiful country, in a country where there are historical things and artistic things as well as beautiful scenery, one of the drawbacks was the fact that cookery was bad.  Therefore, a committee of hotel managers and proprietors was set up to visit the Continent. Of course, they went to Switzerland, which is the university for all hotel proprietors, and before they left I prophesied in a public writing that I should announce the report they would make without going there, without waiting for their return. I found they were unacquainted with my sarcasm and they actually made the identical report: we have nothing to learn.  We had so much to learn that they had nothing to learn.  Things have remained, I venture to say, though it is not at all a popular thing to say, pretty much what they were 30 or 25 years ago.</P>
    <P>In or about 1927, as a politician, going through different centres in the country, I had a very ample opportunity for testing the qualities and characters of the hotels.  I remember the late Senator Colonel Moore and I arrived one evening at a hotel and we apologised for being late&mdash;it was after the usual time for dinner&mdash;and we were assured most courteously that it really did not matter.  And it did not matter, for the dinner supplied was tea, eggs and bacon; the following morning, breakfast was tea, bacon and eggs; luncheon was eggs, bacon and tea, and dinner, tea, bacon and eggs.  That seemed to be exhaustive of the culinary resources of the hotel or the skill of the kitchen.  In another midland hotel I found there was something peculiar about what was served and discovered we were having liquid eggs from China and Chinese bacon.  That &mdash; in Ireland which is supposed to be the place of all places for supplying good and wholesome, and above all, fresh food.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>It was under the last régime, no doubt, but surely we are not going to fasten on the then President Cosgrave, amongst other things, that he was responsible for Chinese eggs arriving in barrels.  But the fact is this, as the Senator who spoke on this has pointed out, that instead of ambitious projects of superb hotels, we could serve the main purpose of the setting up of the Tourist Board very much better by looking to our own natives as the tourists who will stay in the hotels that are to be equipped.  We want to make Ireland a playground for Irish people in their times of leisure rather than to attract the foreigner and it is for our own people that it is so desirable to have that type of nice, middle-class, pleasantly-equipped hotel.  It seems to me that the work of setting up these and encouraging the setting up of them could be done now without waiting for world peace.  In fact, it would be easier to pray for world peace if one's holidays were spent in an agreeable situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point with regard to the tourist question.  I may be egotistic enough to mention myself. There is one thing that I have most at heart and that is the union of Ireland, the disappearance of the Border, and it seems such a happy thing that, owing to the inability of our fellow-countrymen in the Six Counties to take their holidays outside the island, they came here, descended in hordes on the southern counties.  It is lamentable that anything should happen that would provoke a reaction in their minds that have been made favourable to union with the Twenty-Six Counties by their experiences here.  I have met and spoken with a great many of my Ulster compatriots during the past few weeks who were here as tourists.  They regretted that they were not under the benignant system of government which we have the good fortune to enjoy. Then some Civil Service mind advises a scheme of souring and embittering those people by descending on them at the Border as they returned with their purchases from this part of the <Col N="1944" /> country.  Girls' lipsticks, lipstick equipment, cosmetics of various sorts for their friends, are seized, and the whole thing is treated like one of those operatic scenes in which the brigands fall upon the party, only there was no delightful music to accompany it on this occasion.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that no matter what may be the economic aspects of it, the side of policy and the side of patriotism which presents itself to me is in favour of turning the blind eye to all those things rather than to make an enormity of them on the part of tourists.  I know we have soured the minds of a great many people who were turning to look upon this as a blissful land, whose Government they would like to live under.  It seems a petty point, but very often in history big things have turned upon very small events.  There was a stage in the French Revolution when all might have been well, when the mob from Paris that had assailed Versailles had been moved to change their whole attitude towards the system of government, and a voice from the crowd shouted: &ldquo;To Paris!&rdquo; and the King and Queen were brought to Paris and then there followed the reign of terror.  There are innumerable instances of that sort.  It may seem, perhaps, to some of us that we are making mountains out of molehills, but I think anything that tends to turn the current of the Six County mind against us when it had begun to run in our favour, is a political blunder.</P>

      <P>I would like to add some of my own personal experiences. I frequently receive visits from friends and relations in the North and they never come down without bringing a liberal supply of tea, with the result that the tea ration in my family is very much higher than that common to the rest of the country.  That is very kind of them and, up to some time ago, I was able to return the compliment by sending a dozen or two of eggs, or lettuce or tomatoes, in the opposite direction, but under a recent order of our customs authorities we are prohibited from sending anything like that out now, so that no matter what these people are kind enough to bring, one cannot return the compliment in kind.</P>

      <P>The way in which this debate has been arranged has certain advantages, but it might tend to deprive us of an opportunity of thanking God that we can once more discuss an Appropriation Bill in an atmosphere of peace.  I do so now, and the atmosphere of peace is emphasised by the fact that we are able to discuss the possibilities of tourism. I am very glad that this was done.  I do not know what are the prospects of the big luxury hotels for the future; that will depend largely on the kind of world we are going to have.  But there is a great opportunity for the modest, middle-class hotel being made a model of comfort and of welcome.  It seems to me that when the Tourist Board was set up a great mistake was made by not including on it a competent woman.  There should have been a woman appointed, because it is a woman's job.  At least one of the five should have been a woman and there were a lot of women who were eligible and from whom a good selection could have been made.  We understand that women will be employed by the Tourist Board, but the direction of policy is for the board and the direction of policy needs the advice of a woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, we should endeavour to make our modest, middle-class hotels models for all Europe.  We have the best food in the world and it is a great mistake if we do not cook it in the proper way.  When I say that, I do not think we should be imitating French cookery or anything of that kind, which is largely a matter of disguising the inferior qualities of the article.  Irish food has its own flavour, and the whole art of Irish cooking is to make the most of the natural flavour.  That is an art that is not beyond any intelligent person's acquisition.  The training of girls in their proper sphere would ensure that it would be done.  In addition to that, it would be quite possible, I think, to have a system of apprenticeship.  There are certain hotels in Ireland, family hotels with no great pretensions about them, and they are models.  I could name some of them that are familiar to most members of this House.  If there was a system of apprenticeship to these <Col N="1946" /> hotels, where the traditional methods could be learned and carried on, that would help a great deal.</P>
    <P>The Government, in their social policy, have sponsored compulsory holidays with pay and that has led to a large increase in tourist traffic among our own people.  It is very important that they should find in the areas where they go places for their reception that will not fleece them, that will charge them a reasonable amount, give them good clean beds, good proper food and a welcome.  In those places there will be a welcome for their children and they will be encouraged to come again.  We do not need much Government help for that; it is a matter of stirring up people and educating the women and it is a great shame for us if we neglect the opportunity that is given us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>This talk of tourism is rather interesting.  Anybody who has ever travelled in Europe has had it brought home to him very forcibly what a great advantage the tourist traffic is to European countries.  These countries take it very seriously and regard it as a regular professional business. In a hotel abroad I remember meeting one of the staff and she informed us that her people were large hotel proprietors in Switzerland.  They were very well-to-do people.  She had travelled in Italy, Germany, America and England.  She went to those countries to learn in the various hotels what the people wanted, what sort of food the English or the Germans or Americans required, and she learned all their languages.  That girl went back to Switzerland and took control of her father's hotel.  She was able to meet tourists from different countries on their own level.  She knew what they liked, she knew what food they needed and how to speak to them, and she made a success of the business.  I do not know if that idea ever occurred to a hotel proprietor in this country. People elsewhere take tourist traffic very seriously and make a commercial success of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we are dealing with tourists, there is one class that the Tourist <Col N="1947" /> Board would do well to cater for.  I am thinking of the tourists amongst our own people.  There are many fairly well-to-do people in the country who do not like to go to noisy seaside resorts, where there is probably a noisy show of some sort on and in which people assemble in considerable numbers. They are people who want quiet places and who would prefer to go to some very remote seaside place where there are very few people, and, going along our coasts, one notices very many nice bays and inlets of the sea which provide safe bathing and safe beaches for children to play on but which are absolutely deserted.  I wonder if it ever occurred to any of the people there to build small bungalows in these places which could be let to families at a reasonable rent?  There are people all over the country who would jump at the chance of getting such places, and one often thinks it a pity that all these beautiful beaches should be neglected when people, who dislike crowds and noise, are crowded into certain well-known seaside resorts. Perhaps the Tourist Board would see its way to finance local farmers or small villagers to erect such bungalows. I think they would be a paying proposition and would certainly be of great advantage to many of our own people who want places to which they can go for the summer months.</P>

      <P>Many of us who come from tourist areas must regret that more money is not being put at the disposal of the Tourist Board.  A number of speakers have already dealt with the hotel problem, and I believe that the board has already undertaken some work in which they propose to utilise the Construction Corps in the development of some of our tourist and holiday resorts.  I hope nothing will happen to prevent them or handicap them in this work.  No objection will be raised to the utilisation of the Construction Corps for this type of work, because it is work of national importance, and it will be very good for the particular places in which the work is carried out and for the country as a whole if our holiday resorts <Col N="1948" /> are developed and made attractive for tourists, that is, for our own people and for people from across the water and from foreign countries, when things become normal again.</P>
      <P>I think the Government should consider getting the board to go into immediate action and placing money at their disposal for carrying out necessary works in the various holiday centres.  It is essential that we should have good hotels and good food, but I think that that matter can safely be left to the hotel proprietors, who, if they see that visitors are coming and that there is a reasonable prospect of their making some money out of it as a business proposition, will probably develop on their own.  It is a different matter when you come to consider the holiday centre.  In such places, you must have proper sewerage and proper sanitary accommodation, and I suggest that some few hundred pounds should be expended to make Salthill in County Galway what it really should be.  It is really too great an expenditure to expect the corporation or the local authorities there to undertake, and it is more or less one of the tasks which should be carried out by the Tourist Board.  I know that investigations have been carried out and that the Tourist Board has plans for carrying out work in a number of centres.  The work has already been undertaken in some cases, with the utilisation in those places in which labour is not available of the Construction Corps and I hope their efforts in that direction will meet with every success.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Appropriation Bill was not the subject of very adverse criticism and that the time occupied was not particularly occupied in criticism of the subjects for which I, as Minister for Finance, am directly responsible &mdash; not, of course, that I should object to such criticism, but it leaves me in the position in which I am not obliged to take up the time of the House very long, and probably the House will not object to that.  There were a few points raised which only very indirectly affect me in my capacity as Minister for Finance.  Other points <Col N="1949" /> raised dealt directly with the Department of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and these matters I shall have the attention of the Ministers concerned called to, and possibly other opportunities will arise for getting answers from the respective Ministers.</P>
      <P>I heard the other day that Senator McGee was interested in the news bulletins of Radio Eireann.  I talked to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs about the matter and he explained to me that the news bulletins are prepared by experienced journalists.  The matter of arrangement is left in the hands of these journalists who decide the arrangement of the bulletins on the basis of the news value of the different items.  They do give first place to important Irish news, but they insist that news value must remain the test, if the bulletins are to hold the interest of our listeners.  Many official announcements, they say, are of very limited interest and should not be given preference over news of much wider interest and value.  If Senator McGee is interested in the matter further, no doubt he will have further opportunities of dealing with it when he will be able to get a direct answer from the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Irish Tourist Board comes only very indirectly under my Department. I am responsible for a Grant-in-Aid of £6,500 in the Estimates for this year. That Grant-in-Aid is issued on the recommendation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the board in respect of the administration and other expenses of the board.  That is in answer to Senator The McGillycuddy who asked what this £6,000 in the Book of Estimates was for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matters raised about tourism and the operations of the Tourist Board would, of course, be matters that should properly be dealt with by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am glad to say, however, that my experience &mdash; perhaps it is not as wide, and I do not suppose it is quite as long, as that of Senator Magennis &mdash; has not been exactly of the unhappy nature that the Senator described.  In the last 20 or 25 years, <Col N="1950" /> I think I have not come across any hotel in any part of Ireland in which I have stayed that was obliged to ring the changes on bacon and eggs in the manner which the Senator so graphically described.  I am of the impression that the hotels in Ireland, certainly in the last 20 years, have improved very considerably.  I can call to mind hotels in which I was happy to stay in the last 20 years in Kerry &mdash; the subject was first raised by Senator The McGillycuddy. Almost all parts of County Kerry is studded with excellent hotels. The same remark applies to Donegal and Galway as far as my experience has gone and I have not always gone to luxurious hotels &mdash; I did not always have the money, not that I have very much now.  I have gone to all sorts of hotels.  I have not been always lucky, I admit.  In some cases, the beds have not been as comfortable as one would like but, on the whole, I think there has been a very big improvement in the comfort of hotels and even in the cooking and food generally in any parts of Ireland I have visited.  I have visited almost all parts &mdash; North, South, East and West, not so much in the North, perhaps, with the exception of Donegal. I have visited County Clare frequently and there are innumerable good hotels in Clare besides in other counties in the South.</P>
    <P>In the midlands generally the hotels are not comparable with those in some of the counties I have mentioned, but the towns there perhaps are not such great tourist centres.  On the whole, my impression is that there has been a very big improvement in our hotels in recent years, but I do not want to suggest that there is not some room for further improvement.  I quite agree with those who urge that the standards of our hotels should be raised.  Despite the report made by hotel keepers who visited Switzerland, which was referred to by the Senator, I think there is plenty of room for improvement, if we compare our hotels with hotels as we know them in France, Germany, and Switzerland.  I hope the Tourist Board will carry on its good work and encourage hotels to improve their conditions, and at the same time keep their charges moderate.</P>
    <P>Senator The McGillycuddy also <Col N="1951" /> raised the question of emigration. That is mainly a problem, on the administration side at any rate, which is the concern of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is a problem that has grown in recent years, for reasons of which we are all aware, and the Government has given a good deal of attention to it.  It is not easy to find a solution.  If young men and women are not to be permitted under any conditions to leave the country, well then what are we going to do with them?  We have got to provide for them, and even if they are provided for, the attraction of the much higher remuneration which they are offered elsewhere is bound to be a source of inducement to them to go elsewhere. Probably Senators know, as I do, that some young men and women were able to get round the regulations.  The regulations, as I understand them, make it difficult, or are supposed to make it difficult, if not impossible, for young persons under 22 years of age, or other persons who are in employment, to get permits to leave the country.  However it is managed, I have had some cases of young men and women whose ages I am inclined to think were under 22, who were able to leave the country I certainly know of a number, not a great number, who were in employment and left that employment, regular employment, employment in which there was no doubt they would be retained, to go abroad and take advantage of the higher remuneration.  That is a problem which I know is giving the Minister for Industry and Commerce a good deal of trouble.  He and his Department, in fact the Government as a whole, have given a good deal of time to its consideration.  A variety of aspects connected with the matter is still under consideration.</P>
    <P>Senator Crosbie raised the question of lightships and buoys.  I am not able to give him any information on that matter but I shall call the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the remarks of the Senator.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan wants to know what we are doing about family allowances. It is seven or eight months <Col N="1952" /> since I set up an inter-Departmental committee to consider that matter. Their report is almost complete. If the holiday season had not intervened, I probably would have it within the next week or two but I shall have it before the end of September.  It will then be considered by me and, later, by the Government.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily.  I do not know definitely yet; I have to see the report.  I do not know what it will be like.  Another matter raised by Senator Counihan was the question of agricultural credit.  Something has been done since the Senator raised that subject here before.  Since I made a promise that I would set up a committee or some body to have it examined, it was examined by a number of people, of whom the Senator himself was one.  I have not got the report of the body which examined that subject. I have got some interim reports, two or three, but the recommendations arising out of the decisions that were come to I have not yet got and I have not, therefore, considered them.  Some steps, I think, will have to be taken to make credit more easy for agriculturists. What these steps will be I am not able to say.  I shall try to have the matter considered with as much speed as possible.</P>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot answer Senator Lynch in regard to coupons.  I do not know what the position is.  I think I read a newspaper report a week or a fortnight ago that sugar was to be rationed and that coupons would be available for that purpose.  I do not remember seeing any reference to tea but if the Senator would call the Minister's attention to the matter he might be able to get an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Magennis also raised a question about raids on people returning to the North, and about the fact of their being relieved of goods like cosmetics and butter.  I think Senator Johnston also referred to the question of inability to export eggs.  I do not know if Senators remember many discussions which took place in the Dáil this spring, and even into the <Col N="1953" /> summer, with regard to the shortage of butter in the Twenty-Six Counties. There was a great shortage of butter. The quantity permitted to be exported last year was very small, but, notwithstanding that, there was a shortage, and there was a determination that there should be no more butter exported.  After all, charity begins at home, and, regret it though we may, we have to regard this State as ending at the boundary, and we have first to look after the interests of our own people within that boundary.  If there is to be a shortage of butter, we will have to keep all the butter we have for our own people first.  That may seem unpatriotic and uncharitable to some, but I think if Senators would remember the strong feeling that was expressed on this subject in the Dáil by Deputies of all Parties during the last few months they would realise that the Government is obliged to see that no butter is exported, certainly that no butter is illegally exported.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he remembers that one of the great pieces of architecture in Rouen, in the Cathedral there, is called the Butter Tower, because the cost of it was met by the good citizens of Rouen depriving themselves of butter in order to raise the money? I suggest that the national policy with regard to the recovery of the lost Six Counties is worth the sacrifice of a few pounds of butter.</P>

I would not object to the ladies getting the cosmetics; not that so many of them need them, naturally, but, if they have a taste for them, and their men folk have the same taste, they can get all they like to take away with them. If they are taking them in big quantities, however, I, as Minister for Finance, would like them to pay a good deal for what they take away.</P>

      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a measure intended to strengthen the law governing the prevention of the exportation of goods subject to export prohibition, and, to that end, it extends the powers conferred by the existing Customs Acts.  During the present emergency, certain points of importance and difficulty, arising out of the administration of export prohibitions, have manifested themselves, and these are now resolved in the Bill.  They relate to certain doubts as to powers of search of the person, and also as to the meaning of various statutory references to the expression &ldquo;prohibited goods&rdquo;.  Provision is also made for dealing with certain offences such as the rescue of goods, the rescue of offenders from <Col N="1955" /> official custody, and the obstruction of officers in the exercise of their duties. Some doubt has been expressed as to whether proceedings for recovery of penalties for offences against the Customs Acts generally can, in certain circumstances, be taken by the Attorney-General, and advantage has been taken of the Bill to clarify the position in that respect.  That is the whole purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill, Sir, to which I suppose we must agree, is a Bill further to strengthen the strongest body in the country, the Revenue Commissioners. We sometimes talk about the growth of a totalitarian State. Even before the emergency, the Revenue Commissioners had astounding power, and the circumstances of the emergency mean that that power must be increased, but it is well that, when we are doing it, we should know what we are doing.  We are putting out of the power of judges, and out of the power even of Ministers, the control of the Revenue Commissioners. We can only hope that they will exercise that power rationally.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter very much.  What I had in mind was that I would say very little on the sections on this Stage, because, if I had to do so, I could only do it by dealing in detail with each section and, to a large extent, would have to repeat that on the subsequent Stages.  If there was to be an interval I would naturally be prepared to do that, because there might be some question of amendment or something of that sort.  I am going on that assumption, and if it is necessary to get any further explanation I suppose we can have it.  Senators who have copies of the Bill can see by glancing at the marginal notes the various points dealt with.  The Long Title makes it clear that it has two purposes, first to extend the time during which the Emergency Powers Act lasts, and secondly, to amend and extend the scope of the Bill in regard to these powers.  With regard to the extension of time, as Senators know, the Emergency Act was current only for one year.  It is due to terminate after a year unless extended this year.  It was first passed on September 3rd, 1939, and has been extended on two occasions since, to bring it to the 2nd September.  It is one of the series that will extend the time of operation during which the Act will be in existence until September 2nd, 1943.  Of course it can be brought to a conclusion at any time by an Order of the Government. <Col N="1957" /> That is as regards the extension of time.  I do not think I have to say anything further on that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the extension of the scope, there are two or three matters of some importance.  The first is a minor one, extending the definition of &ldquo;subsidiary instrument&rdquo;.  The definition in the Principal Act is somewhat extended so as to include the addition to what was before of a scheme or direction in writing.  I now come to the more important ones.  The first is that dealt with in Section 6, which relates to Section 2 of the Principal Act. I am afraid if they were to understand that Senators would have to refer to the Principal Act.  The point is that in Section (2) 1 there are general omnibus powers given and, in the next sub-section, there are particular powers set out, going a long distance.  These were set out by way of illustration and in the enumeration there are certain restrictions occasionally mentioned.  For instance, in one of them we have the provision &ldquo;otherwise than in Irish currency&rdquo;. That has reference to the powers of the Minister for Finance to require our citizens who may have dollar balances to register and, indeed, in another matter to sell to the Minister for Finance.  There is the reference &ldquo;otherwise than Irish currency&rdquo;.  It might possibly be held that Irish currency was excluded by that particular phrase and that the general powers could not apply.  We are making it quite clear that the general powers are, in fact, general and not in any way to be subtracted from by reason of any interpretation given as a result of special study of the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who refers to the debates in the Dáil when the Emergency Powers Act was first passed will see that it was made clear that these powers should be general.  This removes any possibility of doubt and says that not merely are they to be regarded in full generality in the future, but that there is retrospective effect.  In Section 7 there is power to make retrospective amendment of certain Orders.  That would be for the purpose of validating certain things that might have been done in the past. <Col N="1958" /> That retrospective power does not extend to the making of an offence something which was not an offence at the time; it cannot be retrospective to the extent of causing something to be an infringement of the law which in fact at the time was not.  That is deliberately excluded.</P>
    <P>So many of these Orders have been made that it is possible that some technicality might not be observed. There might be actions in the courts the effect of which would be to hold up the operation of the Order and thereby defeat the general intention.  As an example, the Minister for Supplies made an Order with reference to rationing.  He amended that Order.  It was obvious that the amendment should refer back to the beginning. Otherwise, there would be considerable difficulty.  To be effective, it was necessary that it should have retrospective effect.  It is intended by Section 7 to make that possible.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the question of penalties.  The greater part of the debate in the Dáil had reference to this section.  If Senators refer to the Principal Act, they will find that sub-section (6) of Section 5 was divided into two parts.  There were penalties for offences on summary conviction and for offences on indictment.  Maximum penalties of various amounts were mentioned.  We are getting rid of that sub-section (6) and are putting in sub-sections (6) and (6A).  The structure of these might be regarded, at first, as confusing, but it will be easily understood if Senators remember that, in addition to the first sub-divisions in respect of convictions on indictment and summary convictions, a further sub-division is now introduced.  Limits are imposed on penalties in the way of specified maximum amounts.  In the new sub-section minimum penalties are indicated.  To see the structure, Senators would have to read sub-paragraph (a) with (6A).</P>

      <P>In the original Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, in the Bill.  (6) (a) (i) has to be taken with (6A).  We are increasing the maximum penalties <Col N="1959" /> permissible over and above those prescribed in the original sub-section (6), which is going out.  Sub-section (6) is being re-enacted, with higher maxima than were in the original Act.  In (6A) you are asked to agree to allow the Government, by Order, to fix minimum penalties.  There are certain restrictions with regard to these minimum penalties. We can deal in detail with them when we come to the sections.  By Order, a definite penalty may be prescribed&mdash;say, £80&mdash;as a minimum amount.  But if the penalty could be reckoned in accordance with units of some kind, then that might be done. Suppose a person failed to till a certain number of acres, a penalty of so much per acre could be prescribed. That is an example of how penalties with reference to units might be prescribed. I do not think that you could deal with an offence in relation to lbs. of tea in the same way so easily.  It is possible, therefore, to have two classes of minimum penalties.</P>
      <P>Section 9 deals with continuing offences.  This is a particular type of offence which could arise in this way: if something has to be done by a specified date under a penalty, it is quite clear that you cannot comply with the law when the date has passed.  Still, the act required may be of such a kind that it should be done even when the date has passed.  For example, the Minister for Finance directs that foreign money and dollar balances must be registered by a certain date. The date passes.  If the person has not complied with the law before the date in question, the Minister will still want these moneys to be registered even after the prescribed date.  This section provides that an offence of such a kind shall be a continuing offence.  In the case of land, it might be impossible to sow if you had not sown by a certain time.  That is excluded from the continuing offence.  Finally, we have this power of delegation.  It was felt that, possibly &mdash; there was a doubt about it &mdash; the way in which this power of delegation was expressed in the Principal Act was not sufficiently wide to cover all the things that had to be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In Section 10.  This extends the power of delegation.  It is put in the widest possible form. Formerly, I think the form was some what like this: &ldquo;under this or any other Act or under any emergency Order.&rdquo;  Because of the phrase used, it was thought that some question might be raised as to whether there was power to delegate under an Order under any other Act.  This provision is merely to make assurance doubly sure.</P>
      <P>I have gone over in outline the matters dealt with in the Bill.  I am making no case for them at the moment.  I do not think that any question will be raised as to the advisability of extending the time.  I do not think that any question will be raised with regard to the extension of powers, except, perhaps, with regard to the retrospective powers.  I do not think that any question will be raised as to the general powers being interpreted as general.  That was, clearly, the intention when the original Bill was passed.  It was not the intention that the enumeration of a number of particular items should detract from the generality of the main clause.</P>
      <P>The matter about which there may be a difference of opinion is the power of retrospective amendment.  Even in that case, it should be quite clear that you cannot create an offence, or make some act an infringement of the law, when it was not so at the time it was done.  Probably the main discussion in this House, as in Dáil Eireann, will centre around the advisability or otherwise of minimum penalties.  All I need say about that at this stage is that it seemed to the Ministers responsible for safeguarding the community in regard to supplies that the seriousness of the position was not appreciated in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dáil Eireann I read some instances of cases where trifling fines were imposed for what appeared to be very serious offences.  When we come to the Committee Stage, I can give a long list of such offences, and I can give examples of the penalties inflicted. <Col N="1961" /> We feel that the publication in the Press of these very trifling fines would have the effect of making the public regard the situation as not being so serious as it is.  We feel that the only way by which we can hope to obtain uniformity is for the Executive to indicate the seriousness of the crime committed against the community by specifying the minimum fine.  This would be done in certain cases only, and would not be done in a general way.  There are restrictions to the Government's power in fixing these minima.  I will refrain at this stage from going further into points which may be raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Taoiseach's first point &mdash; that, before we enter on this discussion, we might agree to take all stages of this Bill to-day &mdash; may I say we have been very accommodating and very reasonable with regard to Bills, and discussions on the various stages, but I think it is unreasonable to ask anybody to state, before the Second Reading has been taken, when the Committee Stage will be taken.  In our experience, it has occurred &mdash; in the case, for instance, of the Bill for the Institute of Advanced Studies &mdash; that, when the Second Stage was concluded here, certain amendments appeared to be necessary.  The Bill before us to-day is manifestly one which the Seanad must pass through all stages before we rise.  I would be prepared to give every reasonable facility&mdash;so would we all&mdash;but it is rather unreasonable to ask us to consider this Bill now, when the Dáil has risen.  Not only is it a continuing Bill, but it contains very important additional powers, over and above those contained in the Principal Act.  If we make any amendments which are accepted by this House, the Dáil must meet again.  I think the Government could have arranged this in such a way that we would have got this Bill last week, and that another Bill, which we will not consider until September, could have been postponed in the Dáil. However, that is something over which we have no control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as this Bill ensures the continuance of the Emergency Powers Act, <Col N="1962" /> 1939, I think we are bound to accept it.  On the acceptance of the continuance of that particular Act, there would arise for discussion the manner in which the Government have exercised the enormous powers entrusted to them unanimously by both Houses at the beginning of the emergency.  I do not intend to enter into a discussion on that point now, beyond saying that, if we delay to make it, an extremely good case could be put up to the effect that the Government have been ill-advised and precipitous and not particularly sensible in the way in which certain of those powers were used.  For example, the Government made, in the well-known Order No. 83, a particular regulation to ensure that wages and dividends would not rise.  When considering that particular Order here, it was pointed out that, even if the principle were accepted &mdash; and some people would not accept even that &mdash; there were certain wage levels which should not be kept stationary when prices were rising.  That idea was put forward and argued here at some length and was accepted by the Minister responsible, who amended the Order so as to provide that people on certain wage levels could get an increase.  He also took power to amend the Order generally.  That showed that sufficient consideration had not been given to the matter.</P>
    <P>I think it is quite sound to say that wages never should have been stabilised, unless there was reasonable rationing and effective control of prices.  What has been done to control prices has not been effective at all. In spite of the argument made in this House that rationing should be introduced, it was undertaken too late, and even then &mdash; as was proved by the Minister's own amendments to his Orders &mdash; it was taken without sufficient consultation with people who could have shown the Minister the correct way to do it.  We might spend a great deal of time on that particular point, but I do not propose to delay the House at the moment on it.</P>
    <P>The main feature of this Bill is, not that it continues the powers of the Principal Act, but that it provides retrospective powers and minimum <Col N="1963" /> penalties.  We can deal with minimum penalties on the Committee Stage, but there is something to be said about the principle on the Second Stage.  The provision of minimum penalties is part of a delusion that drastic provisions in Acts of Parliament can take the place of effective administration of the law.  Experience shows that that is not so.  If it is true that the penalties imposed on offenders under the Principal Act were not sufficiently great, the remedy does not lie in inserting minimum penalties in this Bill, but rather in increasing the rate of detection of offenders.  In other words, drastic penalties in Orders or Acts are no substitute for the effective detection of offenders.</P>
    <P>I wonder against whom precisely these particular penalties are directed. It should be made clear that this Bill provides that the Government or a Minister can make an Order, making certain things an offence and that the Order can prescribe a minimum penalty to be imposed on a person detected and convicted of that offence.  The court before whom he is taken has no power to consider the special circumstances of the case, but is obliged to inflict the minimum penalty prescribed by the Order. Things which are not now an offence at all may become an offence, and minimum penalties may be prescribed for them.  I wonder against what class of persons this provision is directed. Apparently, when one considers the figures given in the other House, it is not directed against the farmers.  The number of farmers who have not complied with the tillage Order is something like two per 1,000.  That is a very small percentage, if one allows for what one may call &ldquo;mental defectives&rdquo;. Apparently, almost 100 per cent. of the farmers obey the law. Anyhow, they cannot escape.  The one person in the country who cannot escape is the farmer who does not comply with the tillage Order, and anyone who has experience of administration or of any part of life at all, indeed, will know that it is very difficult to measure every case by the <Col N="1964" /> same rod.  You have different circumstances in different cases, and the courts are used to taking into consideration the special circumstances. It seems to me that the only people, hitherto contemplated by Orders, who have not been sufficiently punished, perhaps, are people engaged in the black market.  If, however, a really large-scale culprit should be brought before the courts, I am confident that adequate punishment would not be refused.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself, as a whole, as I think the Taoiseach explained, is really an attempt by the civil servant to stop up every crack, and to fill up every hole so that nobody is ever going to escape from him, either retrospectively or prospectively.  It is a typical attempt to make sure of getting everybody in every particular way.  Now, remember that one of the real symbols of freedom, one of the really effective things to make freedom real in any community, is this power of the courts to interfere between the citizen and the Executive, and the Government in this particular Bill, are taking away that power from the courts.  In effect, an Order is going to be made by a civil servant &mdash; because these are Orders that are made in various places for various Departments &mdash;who is going to prescribe what the offence is, and what the penalty is, and the only suggestion for an appeal is that you can appeal to the Minister. In effect, however, it is not an appeal to the Minister at all, but again to an official.  Now, I must not be taken as being opposed to officials.  I have had a long experience of their efficiency, conscientiousness and zeal, but, naturally, the point of view of the civil servant, of the competent civil servant, is that he is right, and he is impatient of any delay, even by the Dáil or the Seanad.  Nobody is more familiar than I am with that point of view on the part of the civil servant.  He wants to know why cannot the Dáil or the Seanad get through all the business in one day without all this objection and discussion, when he has spent, perhaps, days and nights of hard work hammering the thing out.  He does not want his well-meant schemes to be interfered with.  Now, he will make the Order, <Col N="1965" /> prescribe the penalty, and again when somebody is convicted, he will be the person to discuss and decide whether or not the penalty ought to be imposed.</P>
    <P>Now, this particular provision of a minimum penalty and an appeal to the Minister is not the same as the appeal to the Minister that exists, and is well known, in the case, let us say, of death sentences, where you can make an appeal and where the sentence can be reviewed, and the President advised to remit the penalty.  I have been sometimes asked by people how that is done. Some people are simple enough to think that the Minister for Justice, out of his own head, and without consulting anybody, decides whether or not a person will be hanged.</P>
    <P>That is not so, of course.  The matter is discussed with the members of the Government on principles that have been laid down for a long period, and it gets the special attention of the Minister for Justice, in the first place, and, if necessary, of every member of the Government, in the second place. This particular kind of thing, however, cannot get that consideration.  It may be said that there is an appeal to the Minister but, in effect, there will be a great many cases where there will be no appeal to the Minister at all.</P>
    <P>Apart from the general principles I have stated, all this thing of the contravention of regulations, carrying a minimum penalty, which may be remitted by a Minister, is bound to lead to all kinds of allegations of influence and wire-pulling and there will be dissatisfaction.  It is bound to lead &mdash;and we all know it &mdash; to political exaggeration, and there will be such questions as whether a particular man &mdash;let us say, Pat Murphy &mdash; got off because he had a good case or merely because he was a supporter of Fianna Fáil.  It is going to be said, no matter how good a case he had, that he got off because he was a supporter of Fianna Fáil, and that is going to be widely believed, or if he is not a supporter of a Fianna Fáil Government it will be said that he is a supporter of some other Government, it really does not matter which.  The whole idea <Col N="1966" /> that the court must impose a penalty and that then you can come along and appeal to the Minister and get the penalty reduced, is a very bad idea.  I was wondering to which particular Minister the appeal lies.  When a particular penalty is imposed in an Order by the Minister for Supplies, for example, does the appeal lie to the Minister for Supplies or to the Minister for Justice?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice? That, of course, would be a better scheme.  That is to say, if one Minister would deal with all the appeals, it would approach to a regular procedure, but if the appeal were to come back to the Minister whose dictates had been themselves contravened, that would be a very bad thing. Although the Taoiseach says that the appeal is to the Minister for Justice, I wonder would that Minister have to consult with the Department concerned in every case?  I think, at any rate, that there is no analogy with the discretion hitherto exercised by the Government in the case of the death penalty.  I hold that it is a bad thing, that it is bound to bring uneasiness, that it is bad practice and bad law, and, I think, that it is going to be ineffective for its purpose.  I do not think there is any necessity to make minimum penalties compulsory on the courts.  There are other schemes besides that.  The discretion should be left to the courts.  As far as I am concerned &mdash; and I make no secret about it &mdash;I think I would rather be tried by an eccentric district justice in open court than by a extremely competent and conscientious civil servant <i>in camera.</i>  I know that there are eccentric district justices, just as I know that there are very competent and conscientious civil servants, but I hold that the practice of leaving discretion to the courts is all-important, and if the Taoiseach finds the present courts ineffective, he has another remedy, and that is to try offenders in the black market before the military courts, if necessary.  There again, I would <Col N="1967" /> rather be tried by a military officer or a group of military officers openly than by this method of dealing with the matter by a civil servant.  This is a bad procedure altogether.  There are several remedies besides the one suggested here.  I know, of course, that when people go to great trouble to do something and then find that very small penalties are imposed, they take this as the simplest solution.  It may very well be a rather lazy solution, such as we often find, and I do suggest to the Taoiseach that he is badly advised in adopting this minimum penalty and taking away the discretion of the courts, that it will not be effective, and that if the discretion were left with the courts more detection would be achieved and it would be far better.</P>
      <P>There is another point to which I should like to refer.  I put down no amendment on this matter because the Taoiseach was very adamant on it in the other House and, besides, we are getting the Bill very late.  I do appeal to him, however, not on the political question at all but from the point of view of good government and, above all, impressing the ordinary citizen that he is getting good government, to let this thing go.  Of course, it will be said that people who are opposed to minimum penalties are in favour of the black market.  How anybody living here and trying to rear a family could be in favour of the black market, I do not know.  I am in favour of the most drastic penalties for offences in connection with the black market, but I have an uncomfortable feeling, when I see some small shopkeeper getting a month in jail for a comparatively small infraction of the law, that there must be some people making a very good living out of this thing, who are not detected at all, and I do not like to see that, but I do not think that minimum penalties will go a step towards detecting these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point.  In the Principal Act there is provision, in Section 2, for the making of Emergency Orders by the Government. There is, subsequently, provision, in <Col N="1968" /> Section 9, for laying all these Emergency Orders before each House of the Oireachtas, and a provision that if either House of the Oireachtas annuls the Order, it shall have no further validity.  Now, it was not adverted to in the beginning that there was also power for the Government to transfer to a Minister the power to make an Order, so that we have the peculiar situation now that an Order made by the Government may be annulled by a resolution of either House of the Oireachtas, but an Order made by a Minister cannot be so annulled.</P>
    <P>It can be discussed.  You can put down a motion saying that the Order ought to be revoked, but there is no legal power whatever in a resolution passed either by this House or the other.  That, I think, is an anomalous state of affairs which should not be allowed to continue.  I think we should have this particular Bill amended so as to provide that Orders made by the Government, or by a Minister, may be annulled.  As a matter of fact, certain Orders made by a Minister are of greater importance, and go deeper into the lives of the ordinary citizens, than Orders made by the Government itself.</P>
    <P>These are the two main points that I have to make.  We can discuss them in some detail on Committee, but I do suggest that the Taoiseach should take some other method&mdash;and there are several other methods besides the minimum penalty suggested here &mdash; of accomplishing what he has in mind.  I am going to vote for the Second Reading if there is a division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is no question but that we must accept the Second Reading of this Bill.  The Taoiseach explained that it was divided mainly into two parts: one, an extension of time for the existing law, and the other the making of certain extensions. I believe that at the bottom of his heart the Taoiseach dislikes this type of legislation as deeply as I do, but, whether we like it or not, we have accepted it during the emergency, so that nobody with any responsibility will suggest that you can suddenly end it.  Therefore, this House has no option but to pass the Second Reading <Col N="1969" /> of this Bill.  I desire to support what Senator Hayes said, that it is not fair to the Seanad, particularly a Seanad with limited powers, to bring a Bill of this character before us after the other House has adjourned.  That leaves us in a position which makes it almost impracticable for us to pass the amendments to it which we may think necessary though, obviously, they must be of a more or less minor character in so far as we cannot adjust the main position of the Act.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that because this has happened time after time.  The tendency has grown up that we find ourselves in the position at the end of July with important measures of this kind coming before us.  Senators can hardly have any heart in discussing them in detail, because it is felt that it is almost impracticable to amend them. I am not blaming the Taoiseach for that in connection with this Bill.  I have raised the matter here on previous occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Section 6 is concerned, I have endeavoured to understand it. Judging by what the Taoiseach said in introducing it, I was correct in my reading of it.  I have no difficulty in seeing the necessity for the section.  I agree with Senator Hayes in regard to the matters which are likely to be raised on the Committee Stage.  There is only one which I would like to refer to, partly because the Taoiseach referred to it, and that is the question of the powers proposed for the minimum penalty.  I agree largely, but not perhaps in all detail, with what Senator Hayes said, and I want to put a somewhat different point of view.  Let me take, for example, the clothes rationing Order.  I know sufficient about that Order to realise that I could not pass an examination in it.  I wonder is there a civil servant, a Minister, or a member of this House who could get 85 per cent. in an examination, at any given time, in the administering of that Order?  There are offences that could occur under it which would be a crime against the community, serious offences which would prevent the general effect of clothes rationing.  For those serious offences the new increased maximum penalty is, in my <Col N="1970" /> opinion, not one bit too high.  It is perfectly possible that a case could be made for providing that there should be a minimum penalty for these serious offences though, to tell the truth, for the kind of offences that I have in mind &mdash; offences against the community &mdash; the minimum proposed here is not enough.</P>
    <P>I want to ask Senators what is the general position of the 100,000 shop assistant who have to administer that Order?  I believe that the vast majority of them are trying to adminiter it conscientiously.  They have to deal with some Orders and amendments that have only appeared in the Press.  They are by reference.  I speak on this from experience.  We find the greatest difficulty in knowing exactly what an Order or an amendment means, and the greatest difficulty in getting alterations made in the original lists.  In that situation, though their intentions are the best in the world, you will find persons guilty of committing offences against an Order.  Now, that may or may not be the kind of Order in respect of which the Government want to impose the minimum penalty.  I suggest that rationing Orders are the kind of Orders in which minimum penalties might be necessary because they may be closely allied to what we call the black market, and may be the kind of Order under which it is necessary to deal drastically with the person who is making money for his own pocket at the expense of the community.  That is the sort of thing we want to get after, but, between that class of person, and the honest person who is trying to carry out an extremely difficult task, there is all the difference in the world, and the minimum penalty is going to apply to both.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the large number of Orders.  I have not attempted in the last year to read anything like all the Orders made, but I have read a very large number of them as carefully as I could, particularly those that affected my business or anything that I had to administer.  I must confess that it is almost impossible, no matter how conscientious you are, to understand them.  It is generally, <Col N="1971" /> though not always, a month, and sometimes two months, before you can get a copy of those Orders in print.  Members of the House may get them a little bit earlier, but the general public cannot buy them for a couple of months because they are not published in full, due to the shortage of paper.  A résumé of them is published in the Press, and it is on that that the law is to be carried out.  I am not complaining of that because I think it is, to a large extent, inevitable.  What I do complain of is that for some days before you can get a copy of the written Order you may be doing something which is really a serious offence under it.</P>
    <P>You see in the newspapers that the Minister has made a clothes rationing Order.  Certain headings are given. To any person who can read it is made plain that there are certain things that you can no longer do.  You cannot, without permission, as the case may be, or without coupons, as the case may be, purchase or sell large quantities of material.  Take the case of the man who deals in thousands of pounds worth of it.  Because he thinks he can get away with it, I would not, if I were a judge, let him off simply because he could not buy the Order.  I would place him in a different category from that of the person who could not have reasonably understood, from the newspapers, what the exact meaning of the Order was.</P>
    <P>I know that some of us who look with misgivings on the minimum penalty, because it does not seem to us that it can be administered justly, will be accused in the Press of favouring the black market.  It has been done.  I do not mind that.  It is our duty to try to put a point of view. My honest feeling is that the real difficulty the Government are dealing with is not the wish of the public to deal with serious offences, but that they are bringing a wrong principle into an Act just because they are not satisfied with the action of certain justices.  What is really wanted is an appreciation in the minds of the justices of the importance of the particular Orders in the interest of the <Col N="1972" /> community, without taking away what, to my mind, is the first essential in the administration of justice: a proper examination and judgment by the person who hears and who has to deal with the case.  There may be an inadvertent breach of the law.  There may be breaches of the law which are not morally wrong, which may be unintentional, which may be caused by misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>We all know that that occurs.  I do not suppose that there is a person in this House who has not been guilty of it at one time or another.  At the same time, there are breaches of the law which, in plain English, would be really offences against the whole community. Again, we must remember that Emergency Orders are Emergency Orders.  They are conceived very often &mdash; sometimes necessarily, but I think more often than is necessary &mdash; in secret.  They suddenly appear in the Press.  They are in a different category from a law which has been passed after a long debate in the Dáil and afterwards, possibly, a considerable debate in this House by which the public have every reason to be aware of them.</P>
    <P>I have to go away two or three times a year.  I am only out of this country for four or five days at a time.  I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that in the last year any time I have gone away I have had to read very carefully through the advertisement columns of the newspapers to see what Emergency Orders have been made that might affect my business, and always there were one or two. Why take an Emergency Order and put it in a different category as the ordinary law?  If possible, I think it should be the reverse.  I am not denying that it is desirable to find some method by which a serious offence under this and other law, particularly where that offence is a criminal one and is committed for private gain, should be dealt with adequately.</P>
    <P>My own personal opinion is that the public discussion in the Dáil, supported by the discussion in this House, if it gets any publicity, will go a considerable way towards awakening in the minds of the justices, who may not have realised the position, a realisation of <Col N="1973" /> the position.  But I do say definitely that if you provide for a fine of £100 or even £25, or any amount which is of any use at all as a minimum fine for a serious offence, and if you make that a minimum fine for a shop assistant who is honestly trying to carry out the clothing Order &mdash; which I challenge any Minister to go into a shop himself and administer accurately &mdash; you will have a definite feeling of injustice.  It is not good enough to say that some Departmental officials may remit that fine.  To my mind, there is nothing more unsatisfactory in dealing with offences of that kind than to say they are to be revised through a Government Department.</P>
    <P>I hope the time will come when we will be able to separate the State and Government from Party ideas, but we have not yet reached that here.  I do not suppose there are any Senators who do not find people coming to them thinking they can influence somebody to get them off, or to get this thing or that done.  Even though it is often a completely false idea, it is there in the minds of the people.  If this minimum penalty must remain, I urge the Government to consider whether the remission of fines should not be dealt with by some small committee of judges, or somebody apart from what appears to be the Government.  I know that the Department of Justice should not in the minds of the public appear just the same as Party Government, but I am afraid the fact is that it does. Nevertheless, the only person who can really judge whether a particular offence is really a criminal one, or whether it is inadvertent, is the person who has the circumstances put before him, who hears the evidence, and who has seen the persons concerned.  Anyone who has to deal with a staff, particularly of juniors, and knows the difficulties of business, knows very well that if you have seen the person and know the circumstances you often find that what looked like a heinous offence was in effect, in some cases, due to stupidity, or, in other cases, to a <i>bona fide</i> misunderstanding.  For that reason, in addition to other reasons, I am against minimum penalties.  It seems to me the position is this.  The <Col N="1974" /> case is that certain justices have not used their powers to impose sufficiently high fines.  To meet that you are providing for minimum penalties which may be inflicted on people guilty of a serious offence.  Is not the cure possibly worse than the disease?</P>
    <P>I do not propose to take advantage of this occasion, although I think it would be strictly in order, to refer to the general administration of the Emergency Powers Act and things which have been done under the Act. But there is one matter to which I should like to refer, because I do not think it has been referred to &mdash; not recently, at any rate.  I was under the impression that taxation would not be imposed by Emergency Orders.  If that has not been done, we have been getting extremely near it.  A short time ago it was decided by an Order made, I think, by the Minister for Supplies, or perhaps the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; the same person, anyway &mdash; providing that a certain type of manufacturer, no matter how small, must be registered and that a fee of £10 must be attached to the form.  It was not a printed form; it was a cyclostyled form.  The cost of producing that form and of registering and making an entry could not be anything like £10. Therefore, that charge of £10 was not an administrative charge to cover the cost.  I think half-a-crown or 5/- at the outside would be the most it could cost.  A bank has to pay only £1, I think, to be registered.</P>
    <P>A small manufacturer who came to me was very sore because he had to pay this £10.  I told him there was no way out of it.  He told me that he started with £5 capital but had several hundred pounds of capital at the moment.  He said it was a terrible impost.  I told him it was unjust and that I was amazed that an Emergency Order would be used for making a charge of as much as £10.  I admit that there are some large manufacturers, whose capital is in the neighbourhood of £50,000 or £100,000, who would not mind paying £10.  But it is applied all round.  My point is that it is a tax placed on manufacturers, large and small, in order to be registered at a time when they are <Col N="1975" /> in difficulties.  I think, in effect, it becomes taxation.  I would suggest that Emergency Orders ought not to be used for taxation; that any fees attached should be purely in the nature of a fee which would cover the actual expense of making the register. If it is afterwards desired to tax a particular type of manufacturer, it should be done in the Budget, done openly; it should be stated that the manufacturer has to pay so much a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that any time proposals have come before us for granting extra powers to the Government I have been prominent in proposing that those powers be given, because I have always felt that where there is responsibility there must be correlative power.  If we are going to hold the Government responsible for the well-being of this country and the administration of ordered society here it would be against justice if we demanded that they should produce results if we did not put the means in their hands.  Consequently, I nearly always supported the giving of extra powers to the Government and I propose to support the continuance of the ordinary Emergency Powers Act.  But I do want to point out a number of things.  Not only since the war, but even before the war, the operation of the Legislature as a legislative body was enormously encroached upon.  We have sanctioned that and we continued to sanction it but, in effect, the whole tendency has been, even before the present war began, to a movement towards totalitarian government.  I am not saying that I am always going to stand for the maximum of Parliamentary interference.  We have sat down under that.  As a matter of fact, although people have tended to consider the Legislature, the Executive and the judiciary as three entities, they are really three functions of government. In this Act the Government is really encroaching upon that other activity which is handed over to judges, namely, the judicial function. When you make any law which is of general application, we know that, naturally and inevitably, there will be <Col N="1976" /> certain cases in which, by reason of the peculiar circumstances, the application of that law would be against justice.  Not only jurists, but also moralists, recognising that, have seen that the solution lies, not in individual law, but in making a general law and having the judge, who is aware of all the surrounding circumstances, able to decide whether or not a penalty should be imposed and, if so, to relate the penalty to the offence in its particular circumstances, because the circumstances surrounding an act will condition both the malice of the act and its whole effect upon society.</P>
      <P>Here, what are we doing?  As far as I read this Section 8, the Government has been given practically an unlimited power for making Emergency Orders, declaring certain acts, or the non-fulfilment of the commands in those Orders, offences.  That power remains with the Government and the Government, to-day, to-morrow, or any future time, may bring in any new Emergency Order.  We are not aware what they are now and, although we are not aware as to what act or failure to act the Government may, in its wisdom, decide is an offence, as far as I read this Bill &mdash; it is rather difficult to follow, especially as the Taoiseach explained it &mdash;you really require to have this Bill and the previous Bill before you &mdash; we are giving the Government power to declare anything that it likes an offence and, without knowing what they are going to make an offence, we are saying that the minimum penalty shall be such a thing.  That seems to me really an outrage against ordinary intelligence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have instituted a judiciary and we are paying a judiciary for operating a certain function of government.  The Legislature is now coming along and saying in so many words: &ldquo;That function of government is not being operated appropriately, and we propose taking the power which naturally resides in the judiciary into the Executive or into an individual Minister or into a civil servant.&rdquo;  When you have in front of you a body of emergency decrees you can look at the acts that are prohibited and see what is proposed as a minimum penalty, and <Col N="1977" /> you can say: &ldquo;Yes; there is a ratio between the malice of that act or the defiance of that decree and the penalty that is there.&rdquo;  But now, in absolute darkness, as far as I read it, we do not know what Emergency Order is going to be brought out at any moment, but we are saying, no matter what it is, justice is exactly met by that penalty which is proposed there, irrespective of what the surrounding circumstances may be.  That does seem to me rather asking too much.</P>
    <P>I am quite ready to recognise that a whole number of rights that are properly regarded as rights that must be respected in normal circumstances have to be foregone during such a period as we have at the moment, a period of emergency, and I interpret a period of emergency as one in which the existence of society, in the technical meaning of the word &mdash; a perfect society &mdash; is itself in jeopardy.  It does seem to me extraordinary that we are going to say what is the appropriate punishment for a crime when we do not even know what the crime is going to be. That seems to me to be the major objection to this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one other point.  Even before what is called the present emergency, I think I am prepared to point out that members of the Government &mdash; I think, even the Taoiseach himself, though I do not want to say that because I may be doing him an injustice &mdash; made statements which clearly indicated that to own a factory or to own a shop is ownership very different from the ownership of land.  The implication has been that, strictly speaking, the ownership of all the land in this country is in the Government of this country and that, though you may call yourself the owner of a farm, your ownership is something very different from the ownership of any other commodity that you may possess.  That was implicit in Ministerial statements before the present emergency.  I recognise that, in the peculiar circumstances of the time, it is absolutely vital to us that the potential productivity of the soil of this country should be exploited for the very continued existence of our people and, in those circumstances, I do recognise that the <Col N="1978" /> true ownership, that is to say, decision as to the use that is to be made of the land and the dispensing of what is produced from the land by the farmer, is largely overridden.  At the same time, in view of the pronouncements of members of the Government, I am frankly suspicious that in exercising the powers, the unnamed powers, which we are giving the Government the right to take to themselves, the idea that they have a right to dictate to every farmer in this country exactly what he will do with his land may operate.  I recognise that they have the right to insist that the land shall be exploited in a way that will appropriately provide for the living of our people here, but I am suspicious of the Government there.  That is only a personal suspicion, based upon Ministerial statements.</P>
    <P>We are going to continue to pay our justices although, admittedly, they are not doing their job.  Obviously, if people are drawing pay out of national taxation and are not doing their job, then there should be a means of removing them from their office, and it may be that it would be right that certain people should be removed from office.  But there was a way of meeting that, and that is, within the law, asking the Legislature to agree to the removal of men from office.  But now we are taking from them the very purpose for which they exist, namely, to know the exact circumstances in which an offence was committed, to judge the offence in the light of those circumstances, to recognise that the general law may be inappropriate in its application in an individual case.  You are taking that from them and handing it over to a Minister.  I, personally, find that the most objectionable feature in this Bill.  I also do object to anything with retrospective effect.  It does seem to me, reading cases in the paper, that one of the reasons moving the Government was not so much that the justices refused to impose a sufficient penalty.  It seems to me that the Government, admittedly in this Bill, are trying to rectify bad draftsmanship in their previous Bill.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to something being clear to everybody as the intention. <Col N="1979" /> Frequently one has noticed from the statements of Ministers that they have made up their minds as to what the intention is in a certain drafting of our enactments and they are indignant when a qualified interpreter says that that is not the meaning.  There is great indignation when people fully qualified to interpret the meaning of an enactment decide that it does not mean what the Government want it to mean.  When that happens the Government have the remedy of amending their legislation so that it will be consistently clear that what they want it to mean is the true meaning.  One of the annoyances of the Government arises when a thing is drafted ineptly, under the idea that it made one thing clear, and it transpires that it left loopholes and that it did not convey the intention the Government meant, that the intention was not in the enactment as written down.  The Government are rather indignant and feel annoyed because those who interpret enactments or decrees do not know what was in the Government's mind and act in the strict literal meaning of what was to be done.</P>
    <P>I want to call the attention of the Seanad to the meaning one would place on certain sections.  It is set out here: &ldquo;Section 5 of the Principal Act is hereby amended in the following respects, that is to say ....  Every person who, being an Irish citizen or ordinarily resident in the State, commits or is deemed to have committed, whether within or without the State, an offence under the section ....&rdquo;  Looking up the section in the original Act, it seems to me that an offence is anything which is against any emergency order that may be made by the Government.  We know, or we do not know, these things, as the case may be.  We do not know, for instance, what emergency orders the Government may choose to make within the next few weeks.  We are saying that an Irish citizen, when he fails for one reason or another to obey an order to be made in the future, will be liable to this penalty, and that this penalty is the minimum that shall be imposed.  That seems to be quite ridiculous.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1980" /> You will notice in Section 8 it says: &ldquo;...Every person who, being an Irish citizen or ordinarily resident within the State.&rdquo;  I think you can easily have difficulties there.  The law deciding what makes us Irish citizens is so drafted that, if every other country had the same law, a number of people would be Irish citizens, and would be also citizens of another country. I am now addressing this interrogatively to the Taoiseach.  If a man is living in England or America, and is, within the meaning of our law, an Irish citizen, and is also within the meaning of British law a British citizen, or within the meaning of American law an American citizen, and that man does something in contravention of one of these enactments, surely, if we say he is an Irish citizen, and the American Government say he is an American citizen, he has a right to ask, when he is outside this country and in America, that the acts he performed should be governed and judged according to the law of the State in which he lives and of which he is a citizen.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Taoiseach what happens there.  Are we going to say, in respect of a citizen in America acting in strict accordance with the law of that country, that we will claim jurisdiction and the right to punish him?  If that is so, it seems to be rather ridiculous and the ridiculousness arises from the fact that we passed a Nationality Act which, if another country passed it, would mean that we and the other country were claiming one person as a citizen, and there are thousands of persons, Irish citizens, who are also citizens of other countries.  I should like to know if the Taoiseach and the draftsman have adverted to the full significance of that clause.  I consistently have agreed to give almost every power into the hands of the Government, but I think it is asking too much to say to us: &ldquo;I want you to agree that, no matter what we may in future declare to be an offence, justice is going to be met by the imposition of the minimum penalty that you are asked to agree to now.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want to emphasise a certain point made by <Col N="1981" /> Senator Douglas.  I refer to the difficulty of getting these Orders.  I have done a certain amount of research work on this matter &mdash; it amounted almost to that.  I found that I could not get the Orders as I required them. Naturally, in the banking business one must be in a position to know the effect of these Orders.  As a result of researches, we found out that some Orders can be got fairly promptly, in about seven or ten days.  As regards other Orders, it might be six weeks before the public would get them. Further, I discovered that the whole explanation of the delay is because the Orders have to be translated into the Irish language.  If the Orders are to appear in English, they can appear with reasonable promptness, but if they have to be translated into Irish they are held up for a considerable period, for about a month, or even longer.  Why should that be?  I do not know if there is great difficulty in finding words to make adequately clear the meaning of the English version.</P>
      <P>So far as I can see, the whole thing is entirely capricious.  When the Government are in a hurry, they dispense with the Irish translation.  Take, for instance, the rationing Order, where Irish was let go by the board. One would imagine that the rationing Order, which affects every citizen, is the one thing that would require to be in Irish, if we assume that there are numbers of people who do not know English.  If any Order should be bilingual, it is the rationing Order.  The Orders dealing with corsets, elastic or something of that description, have to be put into Irish for some reason that I cannot at the moment understand. One would think that because of the shortage of paper we might get all the Orders published in English first and, if the bilingual formula has to be satisfied, then the subsequent Order can come out later in both languages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Government are on dangerous ground in this Bill.  I know that if I were a judge I would not convict anybody of an offence under an Order that probably he had not seen and that was not published because the Irish version was not available.  I cannot <Col N="1982" /> help feeling that if that matter was challenged in the courts and a citizen declared: &ldquo;I cannot get this Order; I have seen something about it in a newspaper, but I do not know what the law is until I see the Order,&rdquo; it would be a valid defence.  I think the Government are running considerable risk because of the delays in publishing these Orders.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which I raised before.  I do not know if the Taoiseach has any knowledge of it. An Order was issued recently which made an Order and a direction, verbal or in writing, synonymous.  That, to my mind, has never been challenged. The Minister on the previous occasion said he did not think so, and we got no further with the matter.  I got no support in the House, but I am still very nervous about the whole position. I admit that, within the ambit of an Order, there must at some stage be directions, because it is not possible to have every specific act and method of carrying out the Order contained in the Order itself.  A general Order is given, but there must at some stage be by-laws and directions under which the Order is carried out, but there seems to be no definition as to the respective ambits of order <i>versus</i> direction. I can conceive to-morrow an official of some Department, under a pure direction, saying to me: &ldquo;Those railings in front of your house are going to be taken down, and I am doing it under a direction.&rdquo;  I believe that is possible to-day, and that is why I am anxious about this whole position. That is an illustration of the indefiniteness of the position.  Take the case of railings.  The Government wants to take railings down.  Is the removal of railings to be the subject of an Order or could it be done under a direction?  Reading these Orders as a layman, I hold that railings can now be taken down under a direction, and anybody may wake up in the morning to find an official taking his railings down and doing it under a direction which could not be challenged in this House.  These are serious matters and I ask the Taoiseach to give them consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the amending part of this Bill, I think it unwise at this stage of the emergency for the Government to take new powers.  A short while ago the head of a certain State in Europe took unto himself extra powers and his action was hailed with delight by his enemies who, so to speak, worked it to death on the wireless, on the ground that his taking new powers at that stage was a sign of weakness.  I think it was a sign of weakness and, while not by any means comparing the head of this State with the head of the State I refer to, I think it a sign of weakness on the part of the head of the present Government to sponsor the amendment part of this Bill in which he takes new powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The part of the Bill in which I am interested is that part in which the Government takes new powers in respect of non-compliance with the tillage Order.  I think there is some idea in the heads of the Taoiseach and other members of the Government that the farmers do not want to do their national duty.  I do not think they realise that the farmers are doing their national duty under great difficulties, and that the failure of a great many of these people to comply with the tillage Order is due to sheer inability, in that, for some reason or another, they were not prepared for it and had not got the implements or the capital.  I do not believe that any farmer in the country would not do his national duty.  I should be more satisfied if the Taoiseach would introduce an amendment to this Bill providing that the fines now imposed retrospectively and in the future for failure to comply with the tillage Order should be given to those people who have more than done their national duty.  There are many people in the country whose winter wheat failed and who took a chance in the first or second week of May on reseeding their land in wheat.  They might not have done that; they had their quota filled; but, because they knew that wheat and bread were necessary for the country, they reseeded their land with Diamante wheat.  I think the Taoiseach would <Col N="1984" /> be looking at the matter more objectively if he were to introduce an amendment providing that the fines collected from people who failed to do their duty in regard to tilling their land should be given to these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The only conclusion one can draw from the speeches made up to the present is that those people who have spoken are completely out of touch with the country, because we must all know that nothing created greater disrespect for the law and for Orders made by the Government than the small penalties inflicted by the justices, particularly in relation to non-compliance with the tillage Order. We all know that this country was in danger of starvation, and yet we saw men in responsible positions, men who are drawing good salaries from this State, when cases of men with large holdings of land&mdash;and they were all large holders of land&mdash;came before them in several districts, letting these men off with as small a penalty as a fine of 5/- or 10/- for not having tilled their quota, when that quota was ten, 15 or 20 acres.  On the other hand, we saw poor, struggling farmers in the same districts running into debt, gathering manure of every description and doing everything they possibly could, in an effort to help the country through the emergency, while these other farmers who failed to do their duty were allowed off with a small penalty by the justices, and almost knowing before being brought to court that, due to the leniency of the justices, these were the penalties that would be inflicted.  I say that as it is the duty of the Government to see that food and fuel are provided for the people, and equally distributed, when an Order is made, it is right that the people who do not comply with the Order should know the minimum penalty which will be inflicted on them for their failure to comply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that this is a new departure, that we are doing something here which was never done in normal times, but, as a matter of fact, under the licensing laws, a minimum penalty is laid down, and if a publican <Col N="1985" /> is brought before the court for an offence and the case against him is proved, the justice must endorse the licence, and three such endorsements mean the loss of that licence.  If we had such regulations in normal times, I think it only right that we should have them when we are up against the present position.  The people of the country are crying out for the making of this regulation, and the only grievance they have against the Government is that it was not made before this, and that fines were not inflicted.  It is very sad to think that those men who occupy the responsible positions of district justices did not realise, as did the smallest farmer, the seriousness of the position.  If they are now compelled by regulation to do certain things it is because they themselves refused to do these things voluntarily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire, any more than other Senators, to deny or withhold from the Government the powers they need under the Emergency Powers Act.  I have no desire to prevent their getting a continuance of these powers, but I think I would be wanting in my duty to the people I represent if I did not once again on their behalf protest against the iniquitous Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order and its successor Emergency Powers (No. 166) Order.  I think I would be right in saying that, if it was not definitely stated, it was at least understood, when the Emergency Powers Act was going through the two Houses in September, 1939, that it would not be used to lower the standard of living of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know how that understanding was observed when Order No. 83 was introduced.  One might not object to that Order, in fact it might have been accepted as inevitable under the emergency conditions in which we were living, if there had been any serious attempt to control prices.  I do not know whether circumstances throughout the country are similar to those existing in Dublin, but certainly the experience of ordinary workers in this city is that prices are not being effectively controlled.  In the price of a small article, costing, say, 1/-, one <Col N="1986" /> will find in shops in the same street a difference of 3d. or 4d.  That is a serious matter and so long, at least, as the Government insists on keeping Order No. 83 and the subsequent Order No. 166 in operation some definite steps should be taken to control prices.  I do not think that the greatest supporter of the Government will deny that a situation such as I have described exists.</P>
    <P>In so far as Order No. 83 is concerned, the workers whom I represent &mdash;they are a fairly considerable body; delegates representing over 160,000 workers met in congress last week&mdash; insist that this Order should be withdrawn altogether.  Order No. 166, while it permits an increase of 2/- for every ten points over 235 in the cost of living, is surrounded with such complicated machinery that it is almost impossible for anyone to embark upon the procedure necessary to secure this very small increase in wages.  Before a worker can get that paltry increase of 2/- for every advance of ten points over 235, he has to go through a complicated form of procedure.  The workers concerned must apply to the Department for a standard wages rate to be established.  Having done that, advertisements must be inserted in the newspapers and bodies interested, other than the body making the application, are asked to submit evidence showing why that application should or should not be granted.</P>
    <P>That having been accomplished and a standard wages rate having been fixed, before the bonus Order can be applied for, there must be agreement between the body making the application and the employers concerned. The employers must agree that the application is to be made and furthermore the workers are forbidden to go on strike to compel the employer to do that.  The workers must not use any duress or force to compel employers to join with them in making an application.</P>
    <P>Should the workers succeed in getting the employers' consent to making the application, the tribunal may recommend to the Minister an increase in accordance with the scale laid down in Order No. 166 but then the employer <Col N="1987" /> is not under any obligation to pay the increase and the workers may not take strike action to enforce the payment of the increase.  I think the whole complicated machinery contained in that Order is deliberately devised to deter workers from making an application.  If the Government wanted to make one decent Order, instead of setting up this complicated machinery, they might have made an Emergency Powers Order declaring that for every ten points increase over 235 in the cost of living figure, an increase of 2/- might automatically be granted to workers.  Tribunals are now being set up under this amending Order and the first tribunal meets next week.  I am unfortunately the workers' representative on that tribunal and I must say that I feel that any little reputation I have is going to be shattered when that tribunal meets because the procedure is so complicated that it will prove almost impossible to work.  I would appeal to the Taoiseach to see if some more simple machinery could not be devised to compensate lowly-paid workers for increases in the cost of living.  We have raised this matter so often&mdash;it was raised on Order No. 83 and again on Order No. 166&mdash;that it has become something in the nature of King Charles' head.  I do not wish to say anything further on the matter at this stage.</P>
    <P>So far as the Bill before us is concerned, I have no fixed views on Section 8, which amends Section 5 of the Principal Act.  I do say, however, that the full rigours of the law and the severest penalties that can be imposed should be inflicted on the racketeers who are battening on the miseries and the sufferings of the poor in this city. Some people seem to think that statements as to the conditions of the poor in this city are exaggerated, but I can tell Senators that the condition even of people in constant employment and with fixed wages is becoming more difficult day by day.  I suggest that any penalties that can be imposed are not too severe for offences of this character.  While I appreciate the point of view put forward by Senator Fitzgerald, I think that conditions are <Col N="1988" /> such as to warrant the severest penalties that can be imposed for these offences against the community, particularly offences against what I suppose is the poorest section of the community, the section which is least able to bear the impact of the present high prices and whose standard of living is becoming more depressed day by day owing to increases in the price of commodities.  I would therefore appeal to the Taoiseach to do whatever he can first of all to control prices effectively&mdash;everybody knows that they are not being controlled effectively at present&mdash;and secondly to consider the point of view I have put before him in regard to Order No. 83 and the subsequent Order No. 166.  He might consider whether some more simple machinery might not be devised whereby workers could obtain some recompense for increases in the cost of living other than is offered by the complicated machinery set out in the Order.</P>

      <P>My intervention will be a short one.  I think it is unfortunate that, in the Second House of the Legislature of a democratic State, the expression should be used that the Government is &ldquo;taking powers&rdquo;.  Senator Dr. Doyle used that expression more than once.  The Government is not taking powers.  The Government is asking us to give them powers, and these powers are necessary. In the experience of the Government and their advisers, and the experience of the people of this country, these powers are necessary for the purposes set forth in the Title to the Bill, namely, &ldquo;for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war&rdquo;. We are giving them these powers in this Bill.  It is necessary that Senators should understand the position, and it is to define that that I rose.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I am in a difficulty on the question of the Committee Stage, because I feel there will have to be a considerable amount of repetition on the points that have been raised.  The same points will come up again on the Committee Stage.  At the very start I want to say that I have <Col N="1989" /> no desire at all to rush the Seanad. If the Seanad wishes to postpone the Committee Stage, of course it is within its right in doing so.  I was not aware that the Seanad wanted this measure earlier.  As soon as it passed through the Dáil it could possibly have come along here the moment it was reprinted. It has been suggested that it is the practice to wait until this time and to bring a number of Bills before the Seanad when the Dáil has gone out of session.  That is not, I think, a fact.</P>
      <P>The position is that the Dáil has a certain number of Bills to deal with; it does not just put one Bill through and then begin another.  The result is that a number of measures are completed about the same time.  Just before the Dáil rises at vacation time, it is almost certain that there will be a number of measures which have just matured, and that those measures will come along to be dealt with by the Seanad.  There may be three; there may be four.  Everybody knows that in the Dáil we do not just get one measure through and then come along with another.  There are generally three or four measures coming together.  Then, at the end of the session, a number of them mature, because there is an attempt made in the Dáil to complete the business on which it has been engaged for some time. Therefore, it is only in the nature of things that, when the Dáil adjourns, there will be a number of measures which have just been completed at that particular time, and which will have to come to the Seanad after the Dáil has risen.  It is always understood that, if the Seanad puts forward any amendments, the Dáil will be brought back to consider those amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That a number of measures come along here at this time? That, I say, is in the nature of things. The Dáil has dealt with a number of measures.  It has not just dealt with one measure after another.  There are generally, perhaps, three or four measures being handled at the same <Col N="1990" /> time.  Naturally, an effort is made in the Dáil particularly before the long recess, to finish the work upon which it has been engaged.  Therefore, it is likely that there may be three or four or five measures which come to maturity at a certain date.</P>
      <P>Then the Dáil rises, and the Seanad has to deal with those particular measures.  There is no way out of it, I think, unless we were to try, before the Dáil adjourns, to get the measures coming one by one, and send them to the Seanad one by one according as they finish in the Dáil.  Although there is an effort made to do that, with the best intentions in the world I doubt if we could avoid having the Seanad meeting to deal with three or four measures after the Dáil has finished. In a case like that, if the Seanad amends those measures, the Dáil will meet to consider the amendments.  That has happened in the past.  I do not think the Seanad need feel under any compulsion to deal with the measures which come up at this time in any way differently from the measures which come up during the Dáil Session.  The Dáil will have to come back if the Seanad makes amendments upon which they are insisting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the various questions that were raised, it is rather difficult to pick out any specially large ones and deal with them, because, unfortunately, there was a number of smaller points, each of which, I think, requires to have a word or two said about it.  One of the speakers mentioned consultation beforehand in regard to rationing Orders.  I am going to take those matters in detail; I am not satisfied with having to do it in that way, but it is about the only way in which I can cover the various points.  That matter of consultation has been explained so often that it should be understood.  If a Budget is considered by the Government, it will not be said that we should consult in advance everybody who will be affected by it. If that were attempted, we know what would happen.  In the case of some of the Orders that have to be made, it is essential that there should be no opportunity given to people for taking action in advance which would be contrary <Col N="1991" /> to the general interest and would give an unfair advantage to some people.  But there is always consultation in general.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Clothes Rationing Order&mdash;that is the most recent one on which I have heard complaints&mdash; the Minister for Supplies, with all the information at his disposal, had satisfied himself that a certain thing had to be done.  He knew that there would have to be modifications; he announced in advance that certain modifications would have to be brought about, but he did what we do in the Dáil very often when we pass a resolution and afterwards amend it.  He made this Order, thereby preventing any action which might be against the general interest and in favour of individuals. After that, he wanted to have the fullest consultation.  A point arose in connection with that consultation.  I do not want to go into it, because it has been dealt with in public already.  The point was that a demand was made that the Minister himself, personally, should see a certain body.  There had been a request, I understand, that he should either see the body himself or appoint an officer of his Department to do so.  He had actually appointed an officer of the Department to see them.  Now, we must not be unreasonable about things like this.  It is not possible for a Minister like the Minister for Supplies to see everybody or to see every deputation that wants to meet him.  In regard to those matters every Minister must be allowed to decide for himself what is the best way in which to serve the public interest.  If I were asked to meet a deputation, and I thought that there were many details which had to be thrashed out, I might see them on general principles and say: &ldquo;Very well, we have to get this examined by the Department; I will see you again, or make up my mind when a more complete examination has been made.&rdquo;  That means three stages; I might see them myself and talk in general, then get a detailed examination made, and then perhaps meet them again to give my final decision. I might, on the other hand, try to cut <Col N="1992" /> out one of those stages, and have two instead of three; I might have the examination carried out first, and then meet them when I had all the facts before me.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister chose the second method, and I see no reason at all why that particular method should not have been accepted. However, I think it is not right to say that things are done without consultation. So far as consultation is possible&mdash;when I say &ldquo;possible&rdquo; I mean either physically possible or possible in view of the dangers that might attach to it in certain cases&mdash; there is consultation.</P>
    <P>With regard to this question of greater detection, what we want is more effective administration of the law rather than severe penalties.  I said in the Dáil&mdash;I was misunderstood there, and I hope I will not be misunderstood here in regard to it&mdash;that the certainty of detection is a more effective deterrent than would be a high penalty with the possibility of escaping detection.  Between the person who wants something so badly that he is prepared to pay a higher price for it, and the person who wants to sell that article at a high price, there is collusion.  It is extremely difficult to get the private citizen to take up the attitude: &ldquo;It would not be in the public interest that I should do this.  If somebody tries to overcharge me, it is in the public interest that I should inform the authorities about it.&rdquo;  We have not got to that stage yet, and consequently complete detection is almost impossible.  Therefore, we have to rely on the other; we have to say to the person who might be inclined to take a chance for the sake of private gain: &ldquo;Very well; you may get away with it, perhaps, but if you are caught the penalty will be sufficiently severe.&rdquo;  That will make him hesitate, at any rate, whereas, if the penalties are light, there is no deterrent, because the incentive to make money is there all the time. Their attitude is that they may get away with it, and, if they are caught, after all it is only a very small fine; so that you have no deterrent there.</P>
    <P>If there is not certainty of detection <Col N="1993" /> the only other thing is the certainty that if caught the fine will be substantial. The risk of a severe penalty is there.  It was suggested that we were acting as if we did not realise how much farmers had done, or that they were doing their duty.  I may say that this is not directed against defaulting community, even against defaulting farmers, as much as it is directed against those contravening Orders made by the Minister for Supplies.  The primary purpose, really, is to try to deal with those who are charging excessive and illegal prices for goods that are in short supply.  It is true that it can apply also to those who do not do their duty with regard to obeying minimum tillage Orders.  There is full appreciation of the work farmers are doing.  As one Senator pointed out, it is not very satisfactory for a man who has to struggle very hard to do his duty, to find somebody beside him who could have done his duty with much greater ease, and who has not done it, sneering at him for doing it.  It is really to make sure that those who obey the law will not be put into the position that their neighbours who just ignored the public need can sneer, rather than because of any suggestion at all that farmers did not do their duty, that there is such a provision.  It was suggested that if we could get after the large scale offenders it would be all right to have heavy fines.  The trouble is that very often we do not know who are the large scale or who are the small scale offenders. As Senator Fitzgerald seemed to infer we are not laying down minimum penalties in the Act.  We have certain maximum penalties.  We are laying it down that the minimum penalty cannot be over £100.  We are not specifying the minimum.  We are making it possible for the Order to set out certain specific minimum penalties.  There is a large range of penalties from the minimum to the maximum.</P>
    <P>We are only limiting, to a certain extent, the discretion of the judges.  In general we are not taking away the powers of the justices.  We are not taking away the power to make those who are guilty in greater degree than <Col N="1994" /> what we would say is the minimum offence, be punished accordingly. Talking about taking away the discretion of the justices, I agree with much that has been said about that, and I stated in the Dáil, and I can repeat now, that it was with very great reluctance indeed that we accepted this principle.  Most people will hardly believe it, but the independence of the judiciary is far greater here than in Britain, although a great deal of the principles of law upon which we act here have been taken from Britain. The fact is there is far greater independence of the judiciary here than in Britain.  Having had some experience on the Executive side I am wondering whether we are right in that.  If you take something from somewhere else, and do not take it completely, the success which may have attended it in the other place may have been missed. Ordinary magistrates corresponding to ours have not anything like the security of tenure that our justices have.  These magistrates also receive general directions.</P>

      <P>They do.  What were called &ldquo;removable&rdquo; magistrates can be removed.  That is one reason why they were called &ldquo;removables&rdquo; here in our past history.  The fact is that they are not at all as independent as our justices.  There is another practice which is common in Britain, that of trying to get uniformity by means of Home Office circulars.  We have no system like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe a Minister for Justice on some occasion&mdash;it happened prior to the coming into office of the present Government&mdash;sent out some circulars and they were resented, although in general terms and giving only general directions.  They were resented by the justices.  Generally, it is not possible <Col N="1995" /> for justices who have not got the community facts before them, as the Executive have, to appreciate the seriousness of some of the matters they have to deal with.  There was a suggestion that it might be a matter of one, two or three justices.  It was not. I gave examples in the Dáil from practically all counties, so it cannot be said that one or two people should be dealt with otherwise.  It was also suggested in the Dáil that State solicitors when bringing these cases before the courts should have pointed out the seriousness of the situation.  Questions were asked as to whether any attempt had been made to give State solicitors an appreciation of the situation, so that it might be put before the justices.  That was done.  I was asked about it in the Dáil, and I afterwards got a copy of the instructions that were sent out, and it was clear that they were to ask for the severest penalties in view of the community situation.  The district justices' work is quite different.  They have to do certain things and have not the task of looking after the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>In cases like this it was felt by the Government that the only way they could indicate the position was by having in some cases these minimum penalties.  I disliked having to do this so much that at one stage in the Dáil I was considering it.  Some Senator suggested that the publicity given and the discussions here in Parliament would be quite sufficient and that having gone so far we might possibly reconsider the position.</P>
    <P>I do not think that would be a wise course.  I considered that and came to the conclusion that it would not be a wise course.  At the same time, I believe that Ministers who have to deal with this will not resort to the method of imposing minimum penalties, or specifying minimum or definite penalties, unless they feel certain that that is absolutely essential.  I give the House this security, that we are not desirous at all of proceeding in that particular way unless we feel that it is necessary to do so at the present time.  There was a suggestion that this was government by civil servants.  That <Col N="1996" /> was raised in the Dáil.  Speaker after speaker in the Dáil referred to this as being government by civil servants.  No matter what form of government you have, considering the variety of things to be done and the amount of detail involved, a large portion of the detailed work will fall to be done by those who are classed as civil servants or Government officials.  It cannot be done otherwise.  It would be quite wrong to think that these Orders are made simply by civil servants.  What happens is: A civil servant dealing with a particular branch comes to the Minister and tells him that a certain thing has happened or, if the Minister observes the matter in the first instance, he consults the civil servant. They consider how they are going to deal with the situation.  Some general principles will, probably, be discussed and, then, the civil servant will be told to bring the Minister the heads of an Order that he thinks necessary. That is after the Minister has given his general assent.  The heads of the Order are brought to the Minister, who considers the matter again.  If it is a Ministerial Order which does not go to the Government, he may ask other advisers for their opinion.</P>
    <P>If it relates to a particular section, he may consult the head of the section in connection with it.  Before anything is done, there is always a great deal of discussion.  If it is an Order which comes to the Government, it goes around the various Departments whose views are taken upon it.  Although, in the nature of things, civil servants have a great deal to do with administration and with the details of proposals, it would be a mistake to think that Orders like these are made simply by civil servants.  Ministers have to apply their own minds to these matters.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this is a lazy way of dealing with the matter and that there is a number of other remedies.  I have not heard of any. A more thorough administration of the law has been recommended.  That is being attempted but the temptations are so many and the variety of things being done is so great that it <Col N="1997" /> is not reasonable to say there is another, and easy, remedy.  I agree that every effort should be made to secure detection and enforce the law to the fullest extent.  That can go on side by side with the efforts we are making in another direction.  I have not learned of any other remedy and this is a remedy which the Government have been very loth to adopt. Senator Concannon answered the point made by Senator Fitzgerald about the Government taking powers. Any powers the Government have got, they have got either through the Constitution or through Parliament.  In our system of government, the Executive is constantly under the supervision of Parliament, so that it is not right to say that the powers asked for are just taken.  With regard to a remark by Senator Fitzgerald about the attitude of the Government towards the ownership of land, I can only say that the attitude of the Government, of Parliament as expressed at the time, and of the people in so far as they deliberately approved of the Constitution, is contained very largely in the Constitution.  The main principles in regard to the right of private property, the duties of private property and the powers of the State in regard to the exercise of private ownership are set out in the Constitution and they are set out in the most authoritative way they could be set out.  It is not a question of hearsay or of some Minister saying this or that. The right to private property is recognised but the right to delimit for the common good the exercise of the right of private property lies with the State.</P>
    <P>Senator Campbell spoke of Orders Nos. 83 and 166.  I was glad he did not suggest that these Orders had been made, so to speak, behind the backs of Parliament.  The subject matter of these Orders has been discussed several times.  The two Houses had ample opportunity of discussion and, time after time, we have explained the principles behind them.  They are designed to safeguard the poorest section of the community because they are the section who would suffer most if you had this chasing of costs and prices. It was suggested that, while wages had <Col N="1998" /> been controlled, prices had not been controlled.  I do not think that that is true.  An effort has been made to control prices, but certain circumstances prevent that effort being effective in all cases.  We cannot control the price of raw materials or of other things which we get from outside, and the cost of these enters into the ultimate price.  In certain cases, it has not, therefore, been possible to keep prices down but, wherever possible, the effort has been made and made with considerable success.  Indirectly, there is a considerable limitation of the prices which might possibly be charged for agricultural produce. If the farmers all combined and said that they would hold the community to ransom until they got the price they wanted for wheat, you would have a very different price for bread from the price we have at present. Indirectly, in that way, we have tried to balance matters as regards the various sections and spread the burdens of the present situation as evenly as possible.  As we pointed out at the opening of the emergency, it is not possible by any method to lighten the effects of the present war.  The community, as a whole, must carry burdens. All the Government can do is try to distribute the burdens as fairly as possible.  Some of the lower scales of wages were not affected by these Orders.  Certain limits were fixed. The whole matter has received a great deal of public attention.  It is vain, however, to think that matters can be so arranged that no section of the community will have to carry a burden at the present time.</P>
    <P>We do not see any way in which we can save the community as a whole from having burdens.  All we can do is to try to the utmost of our power to distribute those burdens as best we can.  If we were to go into that whole matter we would have quite a debate all to itself.  I can only say that, in general, the attempt is made to see that no section will avoid having to bear a portion of the burden, and we try to adjust the burden so that the strong shoulders will carry the greater part of it.  It is not easy to operate it out evenly in all cases, but that is the <Col N="1999" /> principle behind any action taken by the Government.</P>

      <P>Will the same practice prevail under this Act as under the Finance Act, if, where a breach of the customs regulations were committed and a person were found guilty, the justice has the right to recommend a mitigation of the fine?  In this case, will the justice be entitled to send a recommendation to the Minister for Justice, if he thinks there are extenuating circumstances?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that that case has been mentioned.  In the existing law there are two or three examples of it&mdash;the Customs is one, the Fisheries is another, and the use of explosives is another&mdash;where there are certain minimum fines and certain ways in which appeals are made.  In this case, if a justice writes privately to the Minister for Justice about a particular case where there is hardship, or if the matter is otherwise brought to the Minister's notice, he will consider any extenuating circumstances.  One of the Senators found fault with this method of appeal.  I agree it is not the best way.  At present the Minister for Justice has the power to mitigate fines. When an appeal is made to him on some grounds, with regard to a particular case, he will try to get all the information he can about it.  He will get the file about the case from the State solicitor.  There are obvious objections to district justices publicly making appeals of the kind mentioned, but I need not go into that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a justice writes to the Minister privately about a particular case, the Minister will take it into consideration. The Minister also will get into touch with the Department concerned, to investigate the facts from their point of view.  In other words, he will get all the information he can, and will, or will not, then mitigate the punishment, whatever it may be.  He will, of course, also be in touch with the Attorney-General's Department.  He will have to decide whether there are extenuating circumstances or not. When the Legislature has sanctioned <Col N="2000" /> minimum penalties, he will&mdash;and quite properly so&mdash;be very slow to mitigate the fine, unless there is exceptional hardship.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to see that the Orders will be made available as quickly as possible.  It may be possible to have them cyclostyled and made available more quickly.  The desirability of that is understood, and though there are certain practical difficulties, every attempt will be made to overcome them.</P>

      <P>For the purpose of clarification, I would like to know exactly what this section may mean in certain circumstances.  There is power under the section to make retrospective amendments to a Government Order. If I commit a breach of the tillage regulations and have not been prosecuted up to the time that this Bill becomes an Act, and if I am not prosecuted then, am I to be subject to the minimum penalty prescribed under this Act?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In case the offence is one in respect of which any Order, made by virtue of the next following subsection, is in force at the time the offence is committed,...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Order must be in force, prescribing a minimum penalty, before the offence is committed.  If the Order were made immediately after this Act is passed, specifying an offence and prescribing a minimum penalty, and if the offence were committed after that, the person convicted would be liable to the <Col N="2001" /> minimum penalty.  In regard to tillage, ploughing, sowing and reaping are supposed to be done: you have to till, sow and gather, and it would not be sufficient to till the ground and not sow it, or to sow it and neglect to reap it.  I was particularly slow to deal with that point, as I do not know how much of the offence it would be possible to hold over after the making of the Order.  I take it, however, that the tillage Orders that are covered by this have been made already, and I do not know that there would be any amendments of these tillage Orders with respect to what you might call this tilling year&mdash;that is, until the harvest&mdash;but it might apply for the year after.</P>

There may not be such cases, but if there are I should like to know what the position is.  Some of these people may not yet have been brought to trial, and if they are brought to trial after this Act is passed, are they going to be subjected to the minimum penalty, or will they be in the position of those offenders who were brought to trial before this Bill became an Act?</P>

All I am anxious about is that the Seanad should know exactly what they are doing.

      <P>I think it is rather important to understand the whole position here.  Is it not intended to provide for retrospective Orders in general? What might happen, in effect, is that a newspaper announcement would be made saying that an Order had been made for the purpose of doing certain things, but it is found afterwards that, whereas the intention was in a certain direction and, probably, many people were carrying it out, the Order, in effect, did not deal with the matter specifically and, therefore, has to be made retrospective.  This, I understand, means that the new Order cannot involve anybody in the position that they have broken the law at a time when it was not the law, even though it was the practice.  Otherwise, if you are going to have, generally, Orders of a retrospective character, they would be unworkable and would only lead to chaos.</P>

Some of these people ploughed land that was unfit for tillage&mdash;unproductive land.  They sowed the land with a crop, say, of oats, but that crop was never reaped.  I know of particular cases this year, in my own county, where ground was ploughed, and something in the nature of seed was put over it to comply <Col N="2003" /> with the regulations, but no crop will be produced on that land.</P>

      <P>No, it is not like Monaghan, but there are people there just as in other counties who, to a great extent, are defying the tillage Order. I can quite understand people getting exemption because it is impossible for them to till, but there are some farmers in Monaghan who are out to defy the Order, to defy the Government, and to act in defiance of everything that we all recognise as being necessary if we are to provide food for the people at the present time, and I hope that such people will not be allowed to escape without being penalised.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Section 8, which imposes minimum penalties, I must say that I am quite unrepentant in my opposition to it. In the first place, taking the point that the Taoiseach himself made, I am wholeheartedly in favour of co-operation with the law and with the officers of the law on the part of citizens, but it seems to me that the imposition of the minimum penalty will reduce that co-operation, and there will be less likelihood of people helping the police if they know that if a person is found guilty, no matter what are the circumstances, a minimum penalty of a substantial nature must be imposed.  The Taoiseach explained quite clearly that this section gives power to the Government to make Orders prescribing minimum penalties, and we are told that these Orders will not be made except in extreme cases and except the Government is pushed very far on the matter. That, I think, is very satisfactory, but in spite of all the talk about farmers who do not till their land, this particular section cannot possibly be directed against them or be intended to be <Col N="2004" /> directed against them, because the number of farmers who are not complying with the tillage Order is very small, so small as to be insignificant, and so small as to render it rather foolish to be talking about the men who are not tilling their land laughing at the others who are tilling it.  The percentage of farmers over the whole State who are not tilling their land is so small, according to the figures that have been given, that there cannot be very much laughter and it cannot be hurting people very much.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is not being followed, and in any case the number is very small.  This is really directed against excessive prices.  The Taoiseach himself said that it is directed, not so much against the farmers who are defaulting, as against those contravening Orders made by the Minister for Supplies, and that the primary purpose of it is really to try to deal with those who are charging excessive and illegal prices for goods that are in short supply.  I was very much struck by the fact that the Taoiseach is rather repentant of the independence that the judiciary enjoy in this country.  Now, his analogy with the British, I think, is quite untrue and quite false, except with regard to a particular type of magistrate.  These district justices were appointed here, in our circumstances, to do a rather difficult job, and, on the whole, that system has worked out very well.  In spite of what we see now and again in the newspapers which give publicity to a particular type of statement, from what I can hear, all over the country, the system has worked out very well.  Being Irish, the district justices, perhaps, are too touchy about their dignity, and object, perhaps needlessly, to getting a circular about one thing or another, but I think it would be foolish, in our circumstances, to take power from the judiciary and hand it over to the Executive.  I think the very fact of our lack of experience of independence, which is only 20 years in existence, makes it more imperative for us than for other people that we <Col N="2005" /> should preserve that independence which, in spite of difficulties, has worked out pretty well.  The Taoiseach explained, in reply to a question by Senator Counihan, that the district justice would not have power, in open court, to say that he would recommend mitigation of a fine, as he does in other cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that at all.  I do not think I said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, the position is that in connection with the Revenue Acts, the district justice has power given to him specifically to recommend to the Revenue Commissioners a mitigation of the fine, and he frequently says in court that he imposes a minimum fine but will himself recommend mitigation.  That power is not positively given to him in this Bill. Perhaps he still has it, but I think the Taoiseach did say that what he hoped would happen would be that the district justice would communicate privately with the Minister for Justice, that the Minister would get all the relevant facts, and come to a decision. I do not want to delay the House, but it is quite obvious to all of us that no Minister can give personal attention to a great variety of cases, and that no civil servant, examining the file, can be in the position to do strict justice in the same way as the person who hears the case, listens to the evidence, and sees the witnesses.  The Taoiseach said that the Minister for Justice will have the file before him, but it is the prosecutor's file that he will have before him, and we all know it.  There is no use in pretending the reverse. The prosecutor will have more power with the Minister for Justice than the defence.  If the Minister for Justice consults the Department of Supplies or the Department of Agriculture, in effect he is consulting the prosecutor. The Taoiseach mentioned the Attorney-General's Department.  I do not know whether he had given any thought to that.  I do not think the Attorney-General's Department will come into it at all.  I think that if they prosecute that is an end of the matter for them. The whole procedure is heavily weighted against the offender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2006" /> Everyone who has had experience of administration, of examinations, or of administering any kind of regulations, such, for example, as the regulations of the Civil Service Commissioners, knows that it is very difficult to measure every case by the same measuring rod.  You have different circumstances arising in different cases.  It is much simpler for the person who tries the case to specify the penalty.  Let the State have the right of appeal to the Circuit Court judge if necessary, or have the case brought before a particular kind of court, such as a military court, but to pretend that it is a solution to have a minimum penalty and that there is any mitigation of that penalty to be got by appealing to the Minister, who, in all the circumstances, no matter how much goodwill he has, is more in the position of a prosecutor than a judge, is not fair.  Apart altogether from the question of fairness, I do not think that in the end, in our peculiar circumstances, it will work.</P>
    <P>I was very sorry indeed to hear from the Taoiseach that he has now doubts about the independence of the judiciary.  He is apt to feel that anything which interferes with his own political schemes is not only bad in practice but in principle.  That has been his theory all his life.  He believes in something until he finds that it does not suit his Party, and the moment he finds it does not suit his Party he says it is bad in principle. He did it notoriously in the case of the Seanad.  When the Seanad opposed him, he discovered a principle and argued it with great skill and very little knowledge&mdash;that there should be no Second House at all. Then he made another one nearer to his heart's desire, and here we are.  I was very sorry to hear him throwing cold water on this matter of the independence of the judiciary.  He has been in power for ten years.  He has made every single judicial appointment as a result of Party service, and still he is not satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intervene on the Second Reading as I preferred to wait until we came to this section.  I <Col N="2007" /> have not had the advantage of a legal training such as many of those who spoke on this Bill, particularly on this section, in the other House.  I have not had the experience of administrative work that Senator Hayes and others here had.  I can only approach this Bill and this particular section as a plain man in the street and look at it from the point of view of what exactly the reactions are likely to be. From what the Taoiseach said this evening, I regret that he has not been prepared up to now to differentiate between this method of dealing with farmers who transgress and those other people of whom we hear so much who are operating in the black market. I feel, definitely, that the two offences are not comparable.  The offence of the individual who, for some reason or other, does not till the requisite area of land is a sort of negative act on his part.  In a great many instances there are understandable reasons and, from the point of view of the administration of justice, justifiable reasons, why this may not be possible.  It is an entirely different situation from that of the individual who goes into the black market and charges outrageous prices to rich and poor alike.  In my view, they are not comparable.  If the Taoiseach had been prepared to separate these two offences, the approach to this particular section would have been somewhat different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards its reactions or effect on the individual farmer, I should like to say this.  The Taoiseach indicated that when an Order is made it may be that they will not specify this minimum penalty in the form in which we appear to have an indication in the Bill it will be applied.  He says it can apply to farmers.  Whether that is an indication that there is a feeling that applying it in this particular way to farmers may not be wise, I do not know.  But, if that be so, it is a welcome acknowledgment from the Taoiseach of the difficulty of the situation.  I put this to the Taoiseach.  Whatever may be said by individuals, everyone must admit that the farmers have done a magnificent job of work and the few who have not done what was required of them have not the least influence on <Col N="2008" /> other people.  It is indeed quite possible that the type of person to whom Senator Johnston alluded is a person whose example a decent farmer would be ashamed to follow.  It is quite possible that if some of these people advocated an increased area under tillage, we would all stand aghast and wonder what was behind it.  What can you think of the man who in a time like this ploughs up the worst land he has, and sows it with the worst seeds because he never means to reap it? Certainly the idea that we ought to make laws to deal with that sort of person and that the same laws should apply to decent people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I want to come to.  This is how it strikes me.  I have very little experience of offenders against the tillage Order.  I do not think I heard of one in my county and cannot speak with any direct knowledge. But my view about the problem which tillage inspectors are up against is this.  An inspector goes to a farm and finds a widow there whose husband died just before the spring when the work on the land should be done. We know the conditions that that woman has to face.  She may have a couple of hundred acres of land and the requisite area is not being tilled. Therefore she is liable to a penalty and must be brought to court.  What I feel about it is this.  You specify a minimum penalty and a tillage inspector visits that farm.  I know some of these inspectors.  They are sensible, practical men, farmers' sons, competent judges of land, very well acquainted with the farmer's capacity to do his job and the machinery a farmer must have to do it.  When such a man goes to a farm like that and hears the woman's story, he knows that it is quite impossible for that woman to comply with the law.  What I am afraid of is this: that, put up against a proposition like that, he will be disposed not to make a report in that case or to bring that woman before a court, when he knows that the woman will be fined the minimum penalty of £100.  He knows what she <Col N="2009" /> has got in the way of crops and stock and sees what the effect of a penalty like that will be so far as her future prospects are concerned.  I think that is a temptation.</P>
      <P>I think that is a very unsatisfactory position in which to put our inspectors. In view of the fact that the number of offenders is so small, it is not the way in which we ought to make our law. It does not make sensible law.  If we have law that cannot be applied it denotes very bad judgment on the part of the legislators or the executive.  It is very bad judgment on their part if they make a law the application of which causes cruelty.  What is the net result?  Suppose an offender is brought to court and is convicted and the penalty imposed, I frankly believe that the effect of that decision in the district court, despite the fact that all the circumstances were put before the justice, would be that the people of the country would be convinced that a great injustice had been done.  I do not know whether the district justice in such a case would be entitled to say that the circumstances of that case were very hard but that his hands were tied, and that he had no alternative to imposing the minimum penalty. Whether he said it or not, the people of the country would believe that an injustice had been caused.  That sort of thing is bad for the law.  In view of the immense efforts farmers have made and in view of the fact that there are so very few defaulters, and in view of the difficulties confronting defaulters, I question the wisdom and judgment of applying this to our farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we have got an increased area under tillage it is not because of the threat of the law.  It is much better that we should try to stir our people to do their duty for reasons other than fear of the law.  There are higher motives and there should be a higher aim than just mere fear of punishment. It would be better to cultivate in our people a spirit of patriotism and an abhorrence of the sort of Monaghan man who would go out and do the sort of thing that Senator Johnston told us had been done.  It is very unlike Monaghan.  Anyone who passes <Col N="2010" /> through Monaghan must know that the farmers of Monaghan are not following the example that Senator Johnston referred to.  What these few people do does not count.  If every other county in the country did 60 per cent. of what the farmers in Monaghan have done there would be no fear of a shortage as far as tillage is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is another point about getting compliance with the law from those engaged in black-market operations. I feel that the crime is not being detected to the extent and with the speed that it would be if the police had the administration rather than the Department of Supplies.  I know of offences that have been committed, and, as far as I understand, the Gárdaí are not in a position to bring prosecutions.  The prosecutions have to be brought by the Department of Supplies, and a very considerable time elapses before the prosecutions can be brought.  If people are overcharging or engaging in black-market operations, it seems to me that it would be much more satisfactory and much simpler to have power given to the Gárdaí to bring the prosecutions. In that way, offenders would be brought up before the court immediately after the offence was committed, but, as I understand it, weeks and weeks elapse before a representative of the Department of Supplies can get his hands on the offenders.  I think a great many of the offences that have been committed would have been stopped much more quickly if the law were being administered by the Gárdaí.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Taoiseach has to say to the point I make as to the justification for differentiating between the sort of offence that he contemplates the farmer who is not performing his tillage is guilty of, and the offence of which the other man who is operating on the black-market is guilty of.  My opinion, however, is the opinion expressed by Senator Hayes and others, that whatever mistakes district justices may have made&mdash;and on that I am not going to pass judgment&mdash;when all is said and done, I think there is no scheme better than the scheme that operates at the moment where the man hears the case <Col N="2011" /> in the area where the offence was committed, and hearing both sides of the case, comes to a decision.  I think that is the best method of all, and when you are departing from it I do not know that you are going to improve upon it.</P>
    <P>If the method by which it is intended to deal with offences in the future does not turn out in the eyes of the people to be more just than the method that has been employed up to now, the status of the administrators of the law will not be raised in the minds of our community.  That is the main essential. I recognise the difficulties that face the Government in the present circumstances but I do not know that rushing to extremes in the manner suggested and the imposition of this minimum penalty is going to help. Very likely it will mean great injustices in certain cases which, in my opinion, would do much more harm to the administration of justice than that an occasional defaulter should get away with it.</P>

      <P>There may be some objection to the section or some reason why the minimum penalty should not be imposed but, if there is, we have not heard it here.  I suggest, with all respect, that there is no sincerity whatever behind the statements made in connection with this section or behind the objection made to the minimum penalty.  Of course, it is no surprise to me or nothing new to the House to hear Senator Baxter setting himself up, like the highwayman in the songs long ago, as the protector of the widows and orphans in distress, but he says that because only 2 per cent. of the farmers have been offenders there is no need for this severe penalty. That theory may also be applied to any other crime.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Senator has made that correction because I was just coming to the point that if it was only two per 1,000 or two per <Col N="2012" /> 10,000 there would be the same reason why the penalties should be imposed. Fortunately for us, and fortunately for the country, the commission of certain crimes is very rare but, notwithstanding the fact that, perhaps, one person in 200,000 commits a certain crime, a certain penalty exists to meet that crime and nobody would suggest that the penalty should not be insisted upon.  I think if we are to be consistent, we must adopt the same attitude in this matter.  I see no reason whatever for the attitude of Senator Baxter that the penalty should not be insisted on because only 2 per cent. of the people might possibly come under the lash.  If he is right and if he is sincere in that statement it is only natural to assume that Senator Baxter believes that the other people will not be affected at all.  Therefore, his sympathy is wasted.</P>

      <P>I suggest that Senator Baxter should not adopt the attitude of a man who would make excuses for people who, in our present circumstances, would refuse to co-operate and to do what other farmers are eager to do morning, noon and night. Senator Baxter says the minimum penalty might appear as a great act of injustice.  It would perhaps appear as a great act of injustice if we can get people in public places such as this to suggest that it was a great act of injustice.  If they were to keep on talking like that, a certain number of people would begin to believe them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest there is no reason why the minimum penalty should not be imposed on the few people who would offend in this particular way.  Senator Baxter suggests, in the case of the widow, that when the inspector would come around and would know that a penalty was sure to be imposed, he would not be inclined to report the case.  I do not believe that that would happen.  I believe that if an inspector is sent out to make a report on conditions in a certain area, in 99 out of every 100 cases he will report exactly <Col N="2013" /> what he has observed and then it will be a matter for somebody else to deal with.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes was just as inconsistent. He said that because of the minimum penalty people will not co-operate; that they will not report cases because of the fear that the offenders may be too heavily penalised through this minimum penalty.  To use his own words, more or less, Senator Hayes, being an Irishman, will realise the reluctance of the people to report offences against this or any other Government.  Having been a member of a former Government, Senator Hayes will, no doubt, realise the difficulty of any Government in getting the whole hearted co-operation of people to the extent of the reporting of crimes even of a&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think the people to be considered in this case are the inspectors, and what should be taken into consideration is the attitude of the Department and, rather than try to cater for the soft-heartedness or the good nature of certain people who cannot see their way to co-operate for the general good, Senators should take into consideration the Department on which has been thrown the responsibility for this scheme.  They should consider the importance of maintaining the morale of those inspectors who have a very difficult task to perform and in respect of whom, if they did not feel that some result was going to come from their efforts, and that some action would follow on their reports, the natural tendency would be to become lax in their duty.</P>

      <P>I was somewhat puzzled by Senator Baxter's line of argument.  He claimed exemption from the minimum penalty for farmers on account of the possible hardship of the tillage Order.  But there are other offences, serious offences, which farmers may commit, such as black-market offences, withholding their produce, refusing to sell produce at the fixed price or feeding wheat to animals.  Surely the Senator does not <Col N="2014" /> suggest that offences of that kind should be overlooked?</P>

      <P>I spoke at some length on the Second Stage with reference to the minimum penalty and I do not propose to repeat my remarks, but there are certain specific considerations which I should like to add to what I then stated.  It seems to me that there is a good deal of misapprehension in connection with this section.  Unless I have completely misread it, it does not seem to me that the passage of this Bill will necessarily provide any minimum penalties.  What it will do is to give the Government power to provide minimum penalties for specific offences and to do so by means of emergency Orders.  I did not put down amendments, partly because I did not think it was any use, and partly because I am puzzled by the existence of Section 8.  I thought the Government had the power to do it, and, if they had provided an Order under the Emergency Powers Act with minimum penalties in it, it would never have occurred to me that under the previous Act they had not got the powers. I am doubtful at the present moment as to whether they have not got them.</P>
      <P>As regards the attitude taken by Senator Quirke, it seems to me that he is so enthusiastic for the application of minimum penalties in general that he cannot believe anyone who opposes them is perfectly sincere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to be one of those who are opposing them.  I do not mind whether or not Senator Quirke thinks I and others who have spoken here are sincere.  If I understand the position of the Taoiseach properly, I think the Government recognise that there are perfectly sincere arguments against, and genuine dangers in, the use of the minimum penalty.  I want to put it to the Taoiseach and the Government that they should not exercise the powers <Col N="2015" /> which they either are getting under Section 8, or which, as I think, they have already, until some time has elapsed and until they are quite satisfied that the justices cannot be persuaded to apply suitable penalties, having regard to the circumstances. There is no obligation to apply this to the tillage Order and it does not seem to me that it is very likely to be immediately applied to the tillage Order, judging by the debate in the Dáil and the remarks of the Taoiseach here.</P>
      <P>I do not see any reason why a circular and, preferably, a public circular, having regard to the views which have been expressed by all Parties, should not be sent to the justices, drawing their attention to the serious effect on the public of certain types of offences and to the necessity of imposing adequate penalties in cases where it is clear that those were offences of such a character that the persons committing them must be aware they were breaking the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter and Senator Quirke and others referred principally to tillage and they assumed that this would apply to tillage.  I do not know anything of the position with regard to tillage.  I naturally referred to matters I knew something about and I did so because my understanding was that it was mainly in connection with Orders affecting rationing that it might be proposed to apply these minimum penalties.  I know that there are offences in connection with rationing for which high penalties may be fully justified, but I equally know that in connection with the same rationing it is perfectly possible to break the law in a manner which is absolutely inadvertent and which has no moral offence in it at all.  You can get, in a rationing Order, offences of the most <Col N="2016" /> trifling character and, in the same Order, you can get offences to which you would have to apply maximum penalties because they might be offences of a serious character.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Government to try, as far as possible, to maintain the existing law by which a justice can distinguish between those two, and not to apply minimum penalties until they are satisfied that these public discussions, and possibly other steps they can take, including a circular sent as a public statement to justices, drawing their attention to the position, have not been effective.  I think if the Government acted in that way it would be very helpful.  I still think that such action, plus this discussion here, may tend to make the imposition of minimum penalties unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I hope, in spite of what Senator Quirke and others have said, that the Government will see that there is a sincere opposition, and that there are people who feel that it might be a mistake to apply the minimum penalty, particularly in such an extreme case as was mentioned by Senator Baxter, that of a widow who could not possibly hope to meet such a penalty.  Senator Quirke sees no reason why the minimum penalty should not be imposed in that case.  He is quite entitled to that view.  I can see very good reasons why it should not apply, but I am not concerned with that.  I am concerned that there should be some independent person who would be able to judge whether or not the same penalty should be applied there as in another case.</P>
