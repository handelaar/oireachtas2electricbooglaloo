      <P>In regard to the business to-day, I understand that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be engaged in the Dáil in connection with questions until almost 4 o'clock.  In the circumstances, he has requested that the House be agreeable to take item No. 2&mdash;the Censorship Motion&mdash;as the first business, interrupting the debate on that motion at 4 o'clock to take the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill.  That rearrangement will meet the convenience of the Minister, who has other engagements to fulfil this evening. When we conclude the Electricity Supply Bill, the debate on the Censorship Motion will be resumed.  If the House is agreeable to that suggestion, we will proceed accordingly.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That, in the opinion of Seanad Eireann, the Censorship of Publications Board appointed by the Minister for Justice under the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929, has ceased to retain public confidence, and that steps should be taken by the Minister to reconstitute the board.&mdash;(Senator Sir John Keane.)</P>

      <P>I do not desire to delay the House much further.  As a matter of fact, I had practically finished when we adjourned on the last occasion.  I desire to reiterate my remarks on a few matters.  Apart <Col N="278" /> altogether from any indecency in any of these books, the commercialising of vulgarity&mdash;as in the case of the book I referred to particularly&mdash;at 8/6 a copy is wrong, and members of this House or of any public body should not agree in any way with such a process. Again, Senator Tierney referred to the remarks in this book as being quite common in country homes, especially in Mayo.  We all hear vulgarity on the streets and in the countryside, but I object to the Senator's statement that such language was quite common at country firesides.  There are vulgar people who use it on the roadside or on the street, but to say that it is used in the presence of the womenfolk of a family at the fireside is not correct. That is my experience, and I think that Senator Goulding's remark was quite correct&mdash;that the person who behaved in such a manner would be thrown out from the fireside of any country home.</P>
      <P>Since our last meeting, I have seen references to the fact that we, the Irish people, by adopting this so-called high standard, or assumption of a higher standard than other peoples, would make ourselves ridiculous to the people of the world.  Every member here knows what the stage Irishman was and how the Irishman was depicted through the stage in other countries&mdash;&ldquo;Paddy with the pipe.&rdquo; We had enough of that.  Thank God, it is pretty well killed by now.  I prefer to have the Irish people depicted abroad as having a higher standard than other peoples, than to have them depicted as they were in the past by this stage Irishism.  I do not wish to prolong my speech beyond saying that I regard this as a very serious matter for any body of Irishmen and especially for members of this House who represent different vocations and sections of the community.  I think that we should demonstrate by our votes that we have the greatest confidence in the members of the Censorship Board in the magnificent work they are doing.  Although it does not come within this motion, if possible we should look for extended powers to enable the board to stop vulgarity as well as indecency.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to discuss the merits or demerits of the books mentioned by the mover of the motion because I think that has been done sufficiently.  My object in rising is to protest on behalf of the public, not on behalf of the House, at the introduction of such a motion at all. It is futile in every way.  The mover of the motion should have been well aware of the reception it would be given in this House.  My protest is based on the fact that most of us, or a good number of us, came very great distances to this House in the hope of participating in some useful work, but to come here after ten hours' travelling to listen to a comparative amount of thrash about &ldquo;tuppence ha penny&rdquo; writers and their books is wasting the time of the House and of those whom we represent.  I hope that it will not be repeated and that from this forward the committee charged with assessing the merits of motions of this kind will be more particular in not allowing motions calculated only to take up the time of the House and the country. If this is not done what should be an august House of responsible men will be turned into a House of ridicule.  I hope that this little protest will cause proposers of such motions to be more careful in future as to what they bring before the House.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my voice in opposition to the motion.  I am surprised that such a motion should have been brought forward.  In moving it Senator Sir John Keane quoted a certain book which has recently come under public notice, <i>The Tailor and Ansty.</i>  He read out certain passages in an effort to prove the Censorship Board was wrong in banning the book, but I think it was clear that the passages he quoted justified the banning of the book for all time.  Other books have been quoted here in support of the motion, but the quotations again showed that the Censorship Board acted perfectly properly in banning them.  I think that Senator Sir John Keane has made the best case for the existence of the Censorship Board, and has shown how necessary is its vigilance.  The passages he read from <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i> were clearly immoral.  What was <Col N="280" /> worse, they did not form part of the story at all but were simply tacked on for the sake of obscenity.  Clearly, the motive of the writer was to introduce those topics for the sake of gain, the basest of all motives, and that is the book which the Senator cited in support of his motion.  I was very surprised at that.  The point was also made that 1,600 books had been banned, and that it could be possible that the board was not right in all cases.  I cannot imagine any board, after reading the quotations cited by Senator Sir John Keane, failing to condemn the book containing them.  I dare say that a single passage would be quite sufficient to show the general trend of the book.  A great number of the books I heard about recommended the adoption of forbidden practices, and in that case there should be no hesitation in stopping their circulation.  I would like to deal with what I think is the real motive behind this opposition to the censorship.  I imagine that the basis of it is the defence of the liberty of the individual&mdash;the right of the individual to read whatever books he thinks fit, and the right of the author and printer to publish what they consider fit.  I need not remind the House that in any Christian or civilised community there is limit to the liberty of the individual. During the year I understand that the mover sponsored another motion relating to betting shops and their suppression. As a matter of fact, I think he was right in that, and I would be glad to support him, but I ask him if he thinks that betting shops would do more harm than the free dissemination of this evil literature which he favours?  Does the Senator think that the betting shops would cause more unhappy lives?</P>

      <P>I certainly do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>That is extraordinary, and it is not in accordance with the facts as seen in the outside world. The effects of the betting shops are comparatively restricted; the effects of evil literature are more widespread and terrible.  No individual, I say, can claim unbounded liberty to do what he likes.  If a journal or a book were to be published advocating the overthrow <Col N="281" /> of the Government by force or anything like that, I am sure the Senator would be the first to call for its suppression. I consider that such a book would not be more deadly than the books which this motion advocated. We must examine the idea disseminated through evil literature.  Is it not a crime as old as humanity itself?  I hold the Censorship Board is doing good work in endeavouring to suppress immoral publications.  Senator Sir John Keane argues that it does no harm to allow those books to be printed and circulated, because nobody need bother to buy or to read them, and that they will do no harm to the ordinary person. We must also consider that propaganda has been reduced to a science. We see to-day each of the belligerent countries sending out propaganda to the neutrals.  All the neutrals receive journals dealing with propaganda from the belligerent nations.  That is because they know that these things have an effect on people when they are reiterated often enough.  When that is the case with war propaganda, the effect must be still greater if you have evil literature harping all the time on obscenity.  It is not a question of <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i> or of any of these new books.  It is more than that.  We have not the exact figures but undoubtedly it is a fact that much evil literature has been imported in, not single books alone, but periodicals, weekly or otherwise, from England and foreign countries.  They have been coming in here for years and, through libraries, circulating to the most remote parts.  As Senator O Buachalla explained, I saw some that came before the committee set up to inquire into the matter.  We saw awful examples of the evil stuff that is being disseminated throughout the country. Is it the object of the mover of this motion to allow that to continue unchecked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator The McGillycuddy said that it was the duty of the minority in this respect to obey the laws of the majority, but I do not really see how it is a question of minority or majority. It is a question which is as old as humanity itself, and concerns every religion and every race.  I do not think there has been any difference up to the <Col N="282" /> present between any of the Christian Churches or any sections of the people on this question.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane has done good service to the country in raising it, because for the first time it will show the people what we are up against.  It is well that we should face it and see where we stand in this conflict. We know that conditions in the outside world are very bad at the moment.  In Europe, America and all countries there is an increasing tendency towards immorality and lawlessness. The literature from these countries portrays the lawlessness and degeneracy into which the masses of people there have sunk.  It is by such literature they are endeavouring to destroy the youth of this country, just as the youth of these other countries have been destroyed by evil literature.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this literature is clear.  To-day the Government have to meet another danger, that of foreign invasion.  Hundreds of thousands of our people are watching along the coast and are ready to lay down their lives to prevent invasion.  There is even a greater danger confronting us, the danger of this tide of immorality which is pervading the whole world.  It is the duty of the Government to defend the virtue of the Irish people against the immoral literature that threatened to overwhelm it.  If these modern ideas, as I call them, got a hold, the virtue of the whole Irish race would be in danger.  It is a grave question and we have to face it.  I do not doubt that there are many who will laugh at that statement, but jeers and sneers matter little where the souls of our people are at stake.  It is the duty of the Government not to do away with the censorship, but to extend its powers so that our country is made safe, as far as it is possible to make it.  The censorship must be maintained, but it needs to be strengthened.  I believe that the forces of order should be called in to help the censorship.  That is necessary if evil literature is to be stopped from permeating the whole country by various circulating libraries.  County council libraries see that the books are censored, but these other libraries are <Col N="283" /> free to do what they like.  Along with the Censorship Board, we should have the Civic Guards, and other agencies of the Government, to see that the circulation of the books, periodicals and journals I am referring to is stopped.  The true answer to the motion before the House would be to have censorship strengthened.</P>

      <P>My only object in rising is to refute the statement made by Senator Tierney when he said that discussions such as occurred in <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i> were general happenings at firesides in rural districts, and that such conversations should not shock anyone.  I am not very easily shocked, and what Senator Keane read out did not shock me, because I heard as bad. However, I have as good a knowledge of conversations in houses in the rural parts as anybody, and those conversations are not the statements in <i>The Tailor and Ansty.</i>  I have lived all my life in rural areas and I have visited houses in these areas, and I believe that if such statements as were mentioned were made, particularly if the women or the daughters of the house were present, the man who made them would be kicked out. I heard statements made in the hay-field and in the farmyard, but I never heard them when the women of the house were present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that I was not surprised to see this motion.  There has been a considerable amount of discussion in the Press about the banning of books by the Censorship Board.  I was prepared to hear a reasonably good case made for the motion by Senator Sir John Keane, but I must say that I was disappointed with the case he made.  He was honest enough to say that it was a book he would not like his own daughter to read.  If Senator Sir John Keane would not like his young daughter to read this book, why should he give an opportunity for its circulation in all the libraries and thereby enable the young daughter, perhaps, of his gardener or his butler to read it?  If that book had not been banned, it would have been circulating in all the lending libraries, and anybody could read it.  That statement of Senator Sir John Keane justifies in my opinion the action of the Censorship Board in banning the book.</P>
      <P>As regards the other books to which he referred, I have read none of them, nor have I read <i>The Tailor and Ansty.</i>  Senator Tierney advocated, in his speech, the changing of the law.  Senator Sir John Keane's complaint was that the Censorship Board was not complying with the law.  The best thing we could do would be to amend the law and bring it into conformity with the wishes of the people. I do not think that anybody wants such books as were mentioned by Senator Sir John Keane to be circulating in the libraries throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I shall be very pleased to record my vote against this motion.  In doing so, I feel that I shall be faithfully representing the views and wishes of the people I represent.  The motion asks us to subscribe to the declaration that the Censorship Board have lost the confidence <Col N="285" /> of the public.  We have no evidence of that.  If there is evidence, it has not come my way.  Since the motion was tabled, we have had plenty of evidence that the Censorship Board has gone up and up in the confidence of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>What evidence have we got as regards the public?  I quite agree that we have had evidence in this House, but where does the evidence concerning the public come from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent a certain section of the public in this House.  I have a certain amount of contact with the people I represent, and I have been careful to ascertain the views and wishes of those people during the past few weeks.  I find that there is 99 per cent. agreement amongst them regarding this motion. I find, too, that, since Senator Sir John Keane tabled this motion, he has lost caste in the country.  The people are asking what manner of man he is. I considered Senator Sir John Keane a very admirable member of this House, and I am sorry to see him losing caste as he, undoubtedly, has done in connection with this motion. The &ldquo;Tailor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ansty&rdquo; are supposed to belong to a remote district in the County Cork.  I understand that they are supposed to typify the people in that area as regards their sayings and feelings.  I know that locality fairly well and I resent very much, and the people of that locality resent very much, being put on the level of the &ldquo;Tailor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ansty.&rdquo; It is a pity that clever writers such as have been quoted in this House&mdash; no doubt, they are clever&mdash;do not stick more closely to the rules of decency.  They have a great opportunity to uplift the people but, judging by their books, they tend more to deprave the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator who seconded the motion&mdash;Senator The McGillycuddy&mdash; made the strongest case against the motion when he referred to the conditions that obtained at Port Said where there is no censorship, and to the effect of the bad state of morality there on the physical and mental <Col N="286" /> qualities of the people.  That argument by the Senator is the best argument we have had in this House against the motion and I congratulate him on it.  On my own behalf and on behalf of the people I represent, I congratulate the Censorship Board on the good work they have been doing. Were it not for this motion, their good work might never have been known. I hope that their good work will continue for many years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate but, after hearing Senator O'Donovan and Senator Honan, I felt that I had some responsibility for calling attention to the mentality that this motion has shown up.  Senator O'Donovan would give the Censorship Board more authority and more power.  I wonder would he allow them to extend their power into the economic field.  To what extent would he give them additional power and in what direction? That is a serious aspect of this question in a country which loves freedom. Then, we have Senator Honan introducing a super-censorship board.  He says that the committee responsible for allowing motions to appear on the Order Paper should have more power.</P>

He told us that it went back to a period before Moses and he talked that length, too.  In spite of all this talk, old Shakespeare was right.  I do not think that Senator Sir John Keane has made a case against the board at all.  His choice of books to bring before the House was unfortunate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I never heard such undiluted bilge as the Senator quoted from <i>The Tailor and Ansty.</i>  I have very considerable experience in connection with a mental hospital in this city.  In these asylums, one meets a large number of &ldquo;Tailors&rdquo; and &ldquo;Anstys&rdquo;.  There is a fertile field there for people who want to commercialise filth.  But the people there are under control.  Unfortunately, there is an odd one abroad and he is a source of wealth and profit to people who wish to dish up this sort of stuff. I should not like to be the means of spreading propaganda for that kind of stuff.  Senator Sir John Keane has done so.  That book is, I am sure, a best seller now, owing to the attention which it got in this House.  If it had not been for the attention given to it here, it would have been a &ldquo;flop&rdquo;.  I have never read it, although there are ways and means, as Senator Keane suggested, of getting these books.  That is all very well for hard-baked individuals like Senator Sir John Keane and myself.  We are beyond the age when that kind of thing could have any influence upon us.  But we have a responsibility to the young and immature mind.  We should not make that kind of filth available to the young people, at least until they have arrived at the age of maturity when they can appreciate, or otherwise, the value of these things.  We all know the desperate and terrible effect that a boy or girl, who is mentally affected in that way, can have in a school.  Parents dread them, but how much more disastrous can these books be if they remain easily available to young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To that extent, I think that the Seanad has done a useful thing, but I sincerely hope that the mentality advocated by Senators O'Donovan and Honan, and to some extent by Senator O'Callaghan, does not represent, to any great extent, the mind of this House on these matters.  We want to preserve what freedom we have.  We should not be prepared to hand over to any authority or body the power to curtail it.  Certainly, we do right in trying to prevent young people having easy access to the filth and bilge which <Col N="288" /> we had quoted in this House.  An astute writer or publisher can always make a book a best seller when action has been taken, such as has been taken in this House, calling attention to it.  A certain very well-known man who did not need publicity got tremendous publicity through the action of the Lord Chamberlain when he introduced the word &ldquo;bloody&rdquo; into one of his books and it was held up.  It gave him a great boost.</P>
    <P>To some extent the same thing applies here.  These books have got a notoriety that they would never have got were it not for this discussion.  To a certain extent I think that Senator Sir John Keane has done a service in bringing this motion to clear the air, and to let the censors know that there is a volume of opinion to check them from time to time.  Society is so organised that it is essential and necessary that we should have a censorship. Otherwise we would have these self-righteous people setting themselves up as censors.  We saw some of their activities.  We saw them going around throwing ink on screens and burning books and generally behaving as if they were the people who had the authority to say what we would read and what we would see on the screen. I do hope that the mentality represented in some of the speeches here does not represent any great volume of opinion throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent Senator Foran has said what I desired to say in intervening in the debate.  I think that Senator Sir John Keane's motion is one which does not do the job that he desires.  It seems to me that it is the wrong method for a person who is dissatisfied with the idea of censorship to endeavour to get a House of the Parliament to decide that a particular committee has acted wrongly.  It might be no harm to say that in the question of censorship there are three stages.  There has to be, first of all, agreement that there must be some kind of censorship.  Then there must be an Act of Parliament.  I had some difficulty in persuading an enthusisastic censor that the Board of Censorship were actually doing their job because he had seen in a country <Col N="289" /> town a book which, in his opinion, should have been banned.  I had to explain that the board can only act in accordance with the Act, and that it cannot act at its own sweet will.  There is a statutory definition and certain powers are given, and then you have to find your board, and that seems to me the most difficult of all things. Membership of the board is a difficult and highly unappetising job, and I entirely agree with what has been said by way of tribute to the people who have taken up that job, both on the present board and on the old one.  It is fair to say that every effort has been made by both Governments to get people to do that job who would do it right, but it is very difficult to get them.  I could not imagine myself being asked to do a more difficult thing than to go on to that board, although I have read a fair amount of literature, and a fair amount that would perhaps be censored if it were coming out now.</P>
      <P>There is bound to be a difference of opinion.  Any board is bound to act rather in accordance with what they conceive to be the spirit of the law than the letter of the law.  You cannot pass a law without using words like &ldquo;obscene&rdquo; or &ldquo;indecent&rdquo;, which naturally do not lend themselves to exact interpretation so that it is impossible to have a board which will not be accused by somebody either of being too strict or too lenient.  I would be the last person to prevent criticism of the board or of the whole idea of censorship, but it is impossible for us here&mdash;and I think that has been amply demonstrated by the debate&mdash; to decide, after the speech by Senator Sir John Keane giving certain extracts, and another speech giving further and, I think, worse extracts&mdash;it is impossible, I say, for us to make up our minds whether the board is right or wrong.  I think we should not be asked to do it at all.  I feel, also, that a member of the board should not take it as a personal offence if such a motion is introduced.  One of the Senators, I think, said that Senator Sir John Keane must have a perverted mind.</P>

      <P>On that point, may I intervene to say that when these <Col N="290" /> words were used the Chair did not very distinctly hear the Senator, but the impression gathered was that the words were used in a general sense? Having since had an opportunity of examining the Official Report and finding that they refer to Sir John Keane, I would now ask Senator O'Donovan to withdraw the words.</P>

      <P>When I used the words I was using them in a general sense, but I find in the Official Report, as published, I used the words so as to apply to Senator Sir John Keane, and in accordance with your ruling I withdraw them as far as Senator Sir John Keane is concerned.  I did not use the word &ldquo;perverted&rdquo; in the sense perhaps it would be found in a dictionary.</P>

      <P>I did not make that point with a view to provoking a withdrawal. I merely wanted to take it as an example of the particular mentality that we have had in this debate. The essence of this whole Parliamentary scheme is that people in a calm and decent way should be enabled to say what they think and have a debate which would not involve that kind of criticism.  We are not a judicial body and we cannot come to a determination in that sense.  I would not vote for this motion because I do not believe it is true, and certainly I have not any evidence from what has been said here that it is true.  There have been all kinds of extravagant statements. I know the country pretty well and I have heard a good deal of bad language in English and in the purest of pure Irish.  It has been said that certain remarks would not be made at an Irish fireside.  I think it is true to say that the conversation at an Irish fireside would not consist for the most part of extracts such as Senator Sir John Keane read out.  With regard to what has been said about women, there is an old Irish saying and perhaps some of my friends may remember it: &ldquo;Digh gach dighe drochbhean.&rdquo;  The worst of all bad things is a bad woman and it is generally true in Irish-speaking districts that when a woman has a bad tongue she has the worst tongue of all, so there may be some people who use that particular kind of <Col N="291" /> language.  But it is not correct, I think, to censor a book merely because one feels that it is not doing justice to a particular district or a particular class of person.  It must be obscene within the meaning of the Act. Whether that book is or not I am not able to say.  I have not read it and I have no intention of reading it.</P>
      <P>I should like to express agreement with the statement of the Minister for Justice that the Act has proved most valuable in keeping out a number of very objectionable periodicals.  The question of the censorship of books is a much more difficult question.  I should be very reluctant to give any added powers with regard to books. It is a strange thing that people who advocate liberty in one way are sometimes quite silent when rights of another kind are being trampled upon. It is also true that when people advocate, as Senator Foran suggests, more and more censorship, one never knows where they are going to stop. I remember when at a particular moment a very considerable class of people in the country thought that a public representative who held the particular views I hold should not be allowed to speak in the country at all. That was a particular kind of censorship to which a particular answer, and a very effective answer, was made.  I deprecate the suggestion that the only method by which the Irish people can be kept right is by putting more and more shackles upon them.  There is no doubt that there is a class of book which should not be allowed freely to circulate.  The trouble is to find a definition which will give you power to ban that particular kind of book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to remind Senator Sir John Keane that the word &ldquo;Rabelaisian&rdquo; as applied to what he read out is very much a misnomer.  I used to be very familiar with Rabelais, but the word &ldquo;Rabelaisian&rdquo; is used nowadays to express a meaning altogether vulgar.  Rabelais was a great writer, writing at a particular moment for a particular public, and he was something very much more than merely vulgar.  A great deal of what is now called &ldquo;Rabelaisian&rdquo; has no claims <Col N="292" /> whatever to be literature but is merely indecent.  As far as we are concerned, all our efforts to protect our young people may very well prove to be a failure because we are living at a moment when the world is growing every day smaller and smaller, and when this country is becoming less and less isolated from its immediate neighbour, England, and its much more remote neighbour, America.  If we want to protect our young people I think we shall have to take a great many more positive steps and not so many negative ones.  Since we cannot remove them from certain dangers, we shall have to aim at strengthening their minds, improving their education and turning their attention to occupations of a healthy character, improving their outlook culturally and religiously, and striving to equip them in such a manner as to make them immune from certain diseases when these diseases come their way.  I think on that basis we can do much more than simply by making regulations.</P>
    <P>There is at the moment in existence, or there was before the war, an international agreement with regard to certain publications of a pornographic or indecent character.  It may very well be that one of the results of this war&mdash;one never knows&mdash;will be an international agreement on censorship of some kind. It might not satisfy us but it would certainly go a certain distance.  I deprecate the attitude of the extremists who want to show that our young people have a different outlook from the young people of other days.  I can appreciate the point of view put forward by Senator The McGillycuddy, but I do not understand the view of Senator Sir John Keane, and of certain other people, that somehow or other we are in a new era, that the young people of to-day have a different point of view to that of their forebears, and that there is a difference with regard to indecency, obscenity and immorality. I think that obscenity and indecency in literature go back a very long way.  There is very little new under the sun.</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned, I think we should refuse to pass this motion. <Col N="293" /> For my part, I should like to refuse to vote on it because it invites me to do something which I am not competent to do&mdash;to declare that the Censorship Board has ceased to retain public confidence, or in the alternative, by another kind of vote, to say that the board retains public confidence.  As far as this debate is concerned, I think no proofs have been given and that, in the nature of things, no proofs could be given which would satisfy in that regard.  Having said so much, I feel that the most effective way to do something positive for our young people is to ensure that they are occupied under good conditions at proper wages and that they will get such an education as will enable them to use their leisure in a proper manner.  A person of that type is much less subject to the evil influences of any kind of publication than an idle person who has little or no education.</P>

      <P>I would be inclined to go a little further than the last speaker, Senator Hayes, in connection with this motion.  I, at least, would have the courage of my convictions, and if I could not vote for the motion I certainly would vote against it.  I, personally, felt very sorry for Senator Sir John Keane.  He has always been, in my view, an able debater.  As a general rule he spoke with common sense, but I think in this debate he has fared very badly.  I think the statements made by Senator Sir John Keane and other speakers who spoke in favour of the motion have been so competently dealt with by Senator Professor Magennis and others who spoke against the motion that it is entirely unnecessary for me to add anything. I was rather amused at the attack made on my friend and colleague, Senator Goulding, by Senator Tierney. While I am inclined to agree with Senator Tierney that Senator Goulding more or less exaggerated matters in his statement, I do say that there was a good deal in what Senator Goulding said.  Knowing the country as I do&mdash; and I claim to know rural Ireland as well as any other man in this House&mdash;I do say that the language quoted in this House during the discussion is not the language used by the people of rural <Col N="294" /> Ireland.  There may be exceptions. There are black sheep in every flock and there is a queer fellow in every parish, if you like.  There are more than a few queer fellows here in this Seanad, as we have found out as a result of this debate.  I have held pretty strong views as to the rights of women.  I believe that a woman should have the right to express whatever views she may hold, and I do know that there are women who can use very strong language, but most of the language quoted here in this House is not the kind of language used in the country by either men or women.  It is a borrowed language; the words are borrowed words.  They are words which are not used in ordinary conversation. If they were ever used in country districts, by the firesides of rural Ireland, I do not believe that they were ever used in the presence of women and children without being resented, and that resentment was very audibly expressed.</P>
      <P>I have long since passed the stage when I could be shocked by anything of that kind.  I can listen, and have listened, to strong language, as most other people in this House have done, and I am not a person to be shocked; but I believe there is every reason why people should be protected from that kind of thing.  As another Senator said a minute ago, if a man would not like his young daughter to read the books which were banned, there is no reason why he should like anyone else's daughter to read them.</P>

      <P>Or himself, either.  I am coming to that.  There are two kinds of people concerned.  For myself, I have seen too much of life to bother reading that book, and if I came across that sort of story, or found that sort of stuff in the first two or three pages, I would throw the book in the fire, which would be the right thing to do.  It is not that I would be shocked or horrified, but that I believe it is nonsense.  There are two stages at which people need protection, whether by the State or their own families: one stage is when <Col N="295" /> people are young, before they come to a certain age, when they need protection and direction, and the other stage is when they have gone past the age of common sense.  Some people are fools twice and some are fools all the time.  Some people are fools when they pass a certain age.  When you find an old man going to dances and making a fool of himself, that man needs a bit of advice and protection, someone to put the brakes on him, and some relation should advise him or have some nearer relation try to get some good of him.  In that way, it is quite reasonable that there should be some protection given to, and some brake put on, people of that sort.  We have Senator Keane rising up in wrath in this House at the very idea of anybody banning certain books, passages from which we have heard read out.  As I have said, I have long since passed the age of being shocked, but I can see that there is necessity to ban them.  I intend to vote against the motion and, if necessary, to force a division on it.</P>
      <P>I believe that Senator Keane is sincere and serious about his motion. There always will be people like that. Just as there always will be people in country districts of rural Ireland who use language they should not use, there always will be a small section of the people who think this kind of stuff is all right, that it is good enough for the people of this country and that the people should be allowed to read any kind of stuff, whether they are young or old, provided members of their own families do not read it.  I am not talking about Senator Keane now. They say that we should have freedom in connection with literature and divorce and various other things&mdash; except, possibly, national freedom. &ldquo;Out of evil cometh good,&rdquo; and we should be down on our knees, thanking God that this country is in such a position that we can spend practically three full days in discussing this kind of nonsense.  In the course of the debate, it was disclosed that the annual expenses of the Censorship Board were £15.</P>

Ninety-five or 99 per cent. of the people would not bother reading that kind of book, with the possible exception of a few young people who are a bit silly and a few old people who are also a bit silly I was very glad to hear people like Senators Tierney and Hayes and others, with whom I may disagree on a lot of things, say that they started to read the book and just threw it away.</P>

Someone might be sick and throw it aside until he felt a little better, when he might go back to it again, though I doubt it.  There always will be people who will advocate the turning loose of this kind of literature.  There always will be people who would like to see on the stage something which would not be tolerated by the average members of society.  There always will be people who want to read and see dirt for dirt's sake.  There always will be writers who will write dirt for dirt's sake.  However, to suggest that the ordinary rank and file of the people of this country have gone so far that they will appreciate that sort of stuff is a slander on the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have people here also who object to the weeds inspectors.  We have farmers, like Senators O'Callaghan and O'Dwyer, who will object to the weeds inspector, because he comes around at a busy time of the year and <Col N="297" /> says that the weeds should be cut.  But those people have common sense enough to know that such inspectors are necessary and that it is necessary to have regulations to prevent a man's neighbour from growing thistles and weeds which might blow into his fields. In the same way, Senator Keane may think that he may himself like to read that kind of book, or think it all right to read it, but he should have sufficient interest in his fellow-man, who does not want it and does not appreciate it, to protect him from having such seeds scattered broadcast over the land and getting into places where they are anything but welcome.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes's statement was, I think, entirely uncalled for in this debate&mdash;in connection with the type of censorship which would not allow a member of his Party to speak at all. I am not quite clear as to the point to which he was referring, but he probably referred to some member who was heckled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">

      <P>The Senator was probably referring to the time when de Valera was heckled with rifles at Ennis.  We ought to have passed that stage.  The only reply to Senator Hayes is that his Party, when in power, could not have any grievance about members of the Party being heckled.  Instead of heckling the Opposition, they threw them into jail and locked them up so that they could not speak at all.  The Senator should not be dragging that up, in face of another election.  After it, probably he will be more broadminded than he is now, and will have learned just another small lesson.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point I wish to raise, of which I have given notice to the Minister.  This is a section which remedies a legal difficulty by which, consequent upon a High Court judgment, it has been decided that the consent of the Minister for Local Government is necessary for the dismissal of officers transferred from local bodies to the Electricity Supply Board.  One person who took an action in the courts has got his salary, but this Bill proposes that in the case of others, the rights they had are being annulled.</P>
      <P>I want to draw attention to one particular case which seems to be entirely singular and about which the Minister might be able to give me some information. It is a case of a person employed by the Rathmines Urban Council who, on his transfer to the Electricity Supply Board, did not avail himself of the terms available.  Subsequent to his transfer, his position was found to be redundant and he got what he regarded as a small pension.  His pension was determined by Sealed Order of the Minister for Local Government, but it now appears that this officer should have been dismissed&mdash;using that word in a purely technical sense&mdash;instead of retired.  If he had taken an action in the High Courts he would have got considerable results on the basis of the case already decided.  I wonder if it is possible in that particular case, where a man thinks he has been dealt with rather harshly and feels that his present position is inadequate, to do anything.  He was compelled to sell his house in Dublin and to seek employment elsewhere.  His service had nothing wrong with it.  The board promised him two-thirds of his salary, but were not able to give it to him without the consent of the Minister for Local Government.  I do not think that the Bill needs amendment, but I want to draw the Minister's attention to this case on the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked into the case of which Senator Hayes was good <Col N="299" /> enough to give me notice.  I should say that the fact that a member of the board's staff who was dismissed has succeeded in getting, as a result of a court decision, payment of a sum of money which he was not believed to be entitled to and which he would never have got if the law officers of the Government had placed the same interpretation on the statute as the court subsequently placed on it, cannot be used as an argument to justify now improved treatment to the other transferred officers of local authorities who were employed by the board but subsequently retired from its service.</P>
      <P>The individual to whom Senator Hayes referred was employed by the Rathmines Urban Council as a collector of accounts at a salary of £200 a year, rising by annual increments to £375 plus bonus.  At the time he was transferred from the service of the Rathmines Urban Council to the Electricity Supply Board his salary amounted to £479 a year.  Subsequent to his transfer, he received an increase of 12½ per cent. mainly in consequence of an increase in his hours of duty.  When the re-organisation of the board's accounting system was effected in 1933, his office was abolished and he was retired.  He had altogether 15 years' service. Because his retirement was compulsory he had 50 per cent. of the pension calculated on his length of service added to the pension he would otherwise have secured, and through the operation of the cost-of-living bonus on that pension he is now in receipt of £320 15s. 10d. per year.  He appealed to the Minister for Local Government to have his pension increased to the maximum of two-thirds of the remuneration allowed in the 1925 Act but the Minister confirmed the pension fixed by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the salary at the date of his transfer, the length of his service and the pension he is now enjoying, I could not hold that he was in any way treated harshly.  On the contrary, we would regard his treatment as favourable.  Of course, officers of local authorities and other <Col N="300" /> statutory bodies have greater security of employment and more adequate provision made for maintenance on retirement than persons in normal commercial employment, but if we are to have regard to the standards prevailing in ordinary commercial employment, I think a person who has got from a position with a salary running from £200 to £375 plus bonus, who has had 15 years' of service, a pension of £320 a year, must be regarded as having done fairly well indeed.  There is no means test of any kind applicable to the pension.  There is nothing to prevent the individual from getting other remunerative employment and still enjoying that pension and I do not think I would be justified therefore in making any special provision in this Bill.</P>

      <P>For reasons which were unavoidable I was unable to be present during a considerable portion of this debate, and I suppose I must accept Senator Quirke's word for it, when he said it was three days' nonsense, but I do not at all accept the suggestion that <Col N="301" /> he can blame Senator Sir John Keane if he produces a motion and the Seanad spends time and money on what Senator Quirke regards as three days' nonsense.  Although I have heard some of the speeches, I do not propose to follow any of them.  It would, no doubt, give me a certain amount of personal satisfaction to give my views on the various matters introduced in this debate, but I do not honestly believe that I would serve any useful purpose in taking up the time of the House.  My only reason for rising at this stage is to put very briefly my own point of view, because I do not wish to give a silent vote on a matter debated at such length.  Such a vote might cause considerable misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>I opposed this particular Censorship Act when it was introduced.  I am still of the opinion that it is not the best way to deal with the problem of immoral or undesirable literature by means of a Minister of State with the advice of a small committee deciding what is to be regarded as indecent or immoral, suitable or unsuitable reading for the people.  I have still got that same inherent dislike of the State as the State making decisions as to what is to be regarded as immoral or what is to be regarded as indecent. On the whole, I am still unconvinced that you are reducing the amount of rubbishy reading by means of the present method as against a more open but definitely State-controlled method.  At the present time we all know that there is quite a lot of this stuff being produced, sometimes cheap sometimes at a high price.  Sometimes I see books which I could regard as only rubbish.  I do not claim any literary ability, but books have been published in regard to which I have wondered why anyone wrote them, unless it were for personal gain.  I cannot see any literary merit in them, and I think there would not be more than a few of them sold if it were not whispered around that in a couple of months they would be censored.  I know that is happening now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose you do not have the present Act: does that mean you do nothing? <Col N="302" /> There are few, if any, countries in the world that are prepared to leave the question of dealing with literature absolutely free.  Does anybody want&mdash;I certainly do not any more than any other member of the House&mdash;to see the sale of pornographic or indecent books on our stalls, and I doubt if there are many booksellers who would sell them. Internationally this problem has been dealt with.  It is a problem of allowing the maximum amount of freedom together with reasonable protection for the young and immature.  That is the problem, but I think it would be better to make a law dealing with it and let those who sell this literature or publish it run the risk of prosecution in the court at the instance of the Minister, which in the main, is the custom in England.</P>
    <P>The fact that I say that that would be a better and an easier method than our present one does not mean that it would be perfectly satisfactory.  It means that we would get at the worst type of books better than we are getting at them now if a bookseller was liable to be prosecuted in our courts for selling a book held to be indecent.  That, I agree, would not solve every problem for the booksellers. There are a good many people, though a small minority in the country, who are by no means satisfied that this particular censorship is, or can be, a success.  They would dislike less another method than the State saying what is to be regarded as indecent or not. Therefore the question as to whether this type of censorship or this type of dealing with literature is, or is not, desirable, is not a matter on which we can bandy words; in which someone accuses someone else of being narrow-minded, or some other person may accuse me of being immoral, because I do not like the system which the majority of the House considers should be applied here.  It is a case for frank discussion, a case for free argument and for a proper difference of opinion.</P>
    <P>My principal reason for speaking is that I could not support this motion for several reasons.  On my reading of the Act it seems to me that the question of public confidence in the <Col N="303" /> committee does not arise at all.  It is the Minister that censors the books, and the Act provides that he shall have an advisory committee.  The only person who has to have confidence in that committee is the Minister.  The public may or may not know the names of that committee.  They are not secret but the public generally do not know the names.  There is, therefore, no question of public responsibility in regard to this committee and it would be utterly absurd for us to say that the public have or have not confidence in this committee.</P>
    <P>If we were to pass a motion of this kind you would get the impression that all that was wrong at the present moment&mdash;assuming that there is something and I am not debating that&mdash; simply lay with the committee and that to remove this committee would mean that every person who had a book banned would be satisfied.  It is most unlikely that there would be any substantial difference if we changed the committee.  Any committee of five persons are bound to differ, and I cannot conceive any censorship committee which could not be accused by someone of sins of omission and by some other persons of sins of commission.  I have nothing but respect for people who give their time to this task&mdash;it seems to me an utterly impossible task &mdash;of dealing with books submitted to them, and giving an opinion as to whether these books do or do not cross the borderline.  I am not prepared to criticise the people who are prepared to give that great service.  This is an Act of Parliament, the law of the land, and they are carrying it out.  To attack the committee, to my mind, is a mistake.</P>
    <P>There has been a tendency to show too little faith in the common sense, in the reasonably high moral standard of our own people generally.  Senator Kehoe said that if you leave the young to themselves they would be all right, that youth left to itself was generally all right.  I am not prepared to go quite as far as Senator Kehoe did, but I think he has got the right end of the idea if he means that you cannot have <Col N="304" /> the State continually interfering with the youth and that if you leave them alone, as far as the State is concerned, they are more likely to go right than by interference.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes hit the nail on the head when he pointed out that it was not by prevention or simply by censorship that you make a strong healthy moral nation, one where you need not be afraid of immoral literature or of attempts to make money out of indecent books.  You are going to get that by inculcating parental responsibility in the first place; a good standdard of teaching, and the responsibility of the Churches.  I do not like the suggestion that morals, the true basis of which must be religion, can be set out in a standard to be judged by a Minister even with the advice of a committee.  Although I would like to see this Act changed, I am not quite satisfied that no Government of the present day could or ought to change it substantially. Senator Sir John Keane wants to know how we know that the public desires censorship by this committee. No one knows anything with any degree of certainty about the public, even after a general election, even much less before one.  I do not think I am guessing too much when I say that the overwhelming majority at the present moment are quite content that their literature should be censored by a committee and that we are simply fooling ourselves if we imagine a committee has not got public confidence.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to think, however, that there is a growing minority which is dissatisfied and which is becoming more vocal.  It is perfectly proper for it to do so, but do not let us imagine that that is the light in which the majority will view the Act or is likely to do so in a short time.  If I read it aright, it is an objection to the general principle of censorship and not an attack on a particular board.  I do not believe that the authors and others who are working for freedom in this connection at present would be the tiniest bit satisfied if the five names were changed for five other names. Consequently, this motion is not one <Col N="305" /> which, in my opinion, the Seanad ought to pass.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down, I should like to refer to two ways in which I think the Act might be amended without in any way cutting across what I conceive to be public opinion at the moment.  I think that the phrase that a book is banned because it is in its general tendency indecent and obscene ought to be deleted so far as the Minister's action is concerned.  All it means is that the Minister has banned or forbidden the circulation of the particular book under the powers given to him in the Act.  Why not say that and have done with it?  There has been evidence in this debate that, rightly or wrongly, certain books have been censored because of one or two passages which made their circulation undesirable.  When you make a list of these banned books and state in respect of each book that it is banned because it is indecent or obscene in its general tendency, you are doing what is absurd.  Why not say that the Minister has banned the book under the powers given to him by the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>That question of advertising a book ought not to be overlooked by those who are quite sure that the present method is the best method.  I now come to the second way in which I think the Act might be amended.  I am not speaking for anybody else in this connection, and I do not suppose that those in whose interest I make the suggestion will approve of it.  I am of opinion that the position of an Irish author, living and earning his livelihood in this country, is somewhat different from that of other authors, whether Irish or not, living and publishing their books outside the country.  I suggest that a special court of appeal for Irish authors should be established. It could be set up <i>ad hoc</i> and it would not often be required.  When I speak of an Irish author, I mean an author resident in Ireland.  If it is proposed to ban the work of such an author, he should be given an opportunity of <Col N="306" /> going before the appeal committee and making his case.  The intimation that it was proposed to ban his book would, of course, be given to him only under a promise of secrecy.  I know that there are certain objections to this procedure, but I think that the suggestion is one which should be considered. It is obvious to anybody who has looked through a list of Irish authors' books which have been banned that while, if there is censorship, some of them should be censored, there are others which are on the borderline.  For the reasons I have given, I cannot support the motion.</P>

      <P>I shall detain the House but briefly.  I rise solely because I do not wish to give a silent vote on this motion.  It is a motion which I cannot support either in its terms or in its general principle.  I think that I should be safe in saying that, in this House, at all events, and reasonably safe in saying that outside this House, there is general agreement that there should be some form of censorship.  I am not satisfied that the form the censorship takes is by any means ideal or workmanlike, but nothing I have heard from the mover of the motion or anybody who has supported him has satisfied me that there is any better method or means of censorship. Therefore, I shall feel constrained to vote against the motion if it be pressed to a division.  However, I do not consider that it is a motion which should be pressed to a division and I hope the House will not so insist. In conclusion, I must say that I resent any suggestions being made that Senator Sir John Keane was not entitled to bring, or was in any way wrong in bringing, such a motion before the House for discussion.</P>

      <P>During a period of over 20 years, it has been my lot, as a member of this House, to introduce several motions.  Heretofore, I felt, as the discussion proceeded, that I was not so happy or so optimistic as I was when I began.  In the case of this motion my feelings have been entirely different.  As the debate went on, I felt more and more satisfied, in spite of the castigation I received from <Col N="307" /> members of the House, that I was right in putting down this motion and that nothing said had weakened or shaken the fundamentals of my case. I shall come to that later, because there has been a lot of irrelevancy.</P>
      <P>With regard to the form of my motion, it is, I think, generally agreed that these motions are not really intended as logical propositions.  They are intended as a basis for discussion. If I had had more regard for logic, I would have said something to this effect: &ldquo;That the Censorship Board has lost the confidence of educated people who read modern books and value intellectual freedom.&rdquo;  Would that make any essential difference? Would I be likely to receive any more support from this House if the motion were in that form?  If it is the general wish of the House that I should alter the motion to that form, I am perfectly prepared to do so.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to admit that 90 percent. or, if you like, more of the people up and down the country do not read these books, and that they do not read anything probably but the daily paper or more probably the weekly paper. They do not know anything about these books and they care less.  They do not care anything about the Censorship Board but I do say that the views of educated people are important.  You cannot say that changes or public movements are brought about by the large inert masses.  They are brought about by the intellectual minority.  I do say that the minority, if you like, a small minority, are profoundly disturbed at the way in which this censorship is being operated.  That is all I claim.  I am quite prepared to modify the words of my motion in that sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a good deal said about the waste of time and long dreary debates that this motion has provoked but I do not see how I can be held to blame.  I only spoke for three quarters of an hour.  There must be a good deal of interest in it judging by the correspondence in the public Press and the number of Senators who wanted to speak.  I feel to that extent <Col N="308" /> that as a matter of public interest my motion has been justified.  Before I go on to deal with the more or less personal aspect of this case I would just like to make a reference to things said by certain speakers.  Senator Kehoe said that the standards of morality do not change.  Well, of course, you have got to be careful about what you mean by words.  Standards of right and wrong do not change but standards of reticence certainly change.  Things that people would say in general society in this present age would not have been said among the same sort of people 30 or 40 years ago.  If you want an example of that you have only got to take the example you have in the young people who in the old days wanted to have free talk&mdash;not necessarily bad behaviour&mdash;and they had to resort to chorus girls.  That was where they were free to express their feelings.  I do feel that there is much more candid expression among people, and even among the members of one family now; things that were not discussed in the same family between brother and sister are now discussed freely and frankly and I cannot believe we are any the worse for it. If you can show that as a result the behaviour is worse or the morals are worse there is a difference, but I do not believe that morally they are worse.</P>
    <P>I think the effect of having these things discussed freely and frankly is on the whole healthy.  That is my reply to those who say standards do not change.  Right and wrong remain the same, but certainly reticence and talk and frank discussion do change.  That is the only point I want to be clear about.  Then another Senator said that there is no demand for these books.  If there is no demand what is the object of preventing their circulation? There must be a demand for them.  One Senator said that the <i>Laws of Life</i> was selling like hot cakes, and that shows that some people do want to read it.  It was also said that world standards are not our standards. That has been the subject of correspondence in the Press and I do not propose to go into it.  I do not say that we are any worse than others, but I do not think we are necessarily <Col N="309" /> immeasurably better.  I think we have got our weaknesses.  We have all got different standards, but when I come to think of things I do see things that are open to criticism.  I do not think our standards of illegitimate birth or even infanticide are anything to be proud of, and I do not think our State licensed betting shops, where temptation is thrown in the path of people every day, are anything to be proud of.  I am prepared to say that they do more harm than literature.  If I was asked whether I would choose between the pre-censorship position and the present I would certainly say eliminate the betting shops and let the pre-censorship position with regard to books and literature continue.  Senator Fitzgerald rather puzzled me.  He admitted that he had not read <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i>, and said the book was grossly immoral.  I am sorry he is not here so that he could point out if I am not taking him up correctly. He said the book was thoroughly boring, and for that reason it was of no harm, that it should be censored.  I need hardly say a book cannot be censored because it is boring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, let that pass. I do feel I gave the Senator a platform for a very unfair attack on our visitors. I do really think it was not quite in good taste.  He said that we could bring over a second rate biologist and, owing to the flunkeyism of the people&mdash; that was the word he used; I will read the extract if Senators wish&mdash;they flocked to him.  Well, really, I do not think that was fair.  Personally I went to hear these visitors and found considerable widening of outlook, and altogether, I felt better and freer and more in touch with the real achievements going on in the world by reason of the visit.  Now I have to pass to what passed between Senator Magennis and myself.  It is, of course, unfortunate that what passed between us should have taken a personal turn, but I think it was inevitable.  As far as I was concerned I never made any personal <Col N="310" /> attack on Senator Magennis.  I attacked the board as I felt I was entitled to.  But as I attacked the board the Senator was quite within his rights in attacking me and treating me as an individual and castigating me to a very considerable extent.  I do not mind being castigated.  What I object to is being handled unfairly, and I will have to deal with what Senator Magennis said in some detail to show he has not been fair to me.  I am sorry to have to go into this matter in some detail, but you cannot deal with a matter like this in general terms.  You have got to get down to actual words. In column 61 the Senator says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The other two books...</P>
      <P>that is the books other than <i>The Tailor and Ansty, Land of Spices</i>, and <i>Laws of Life</i>,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;he did not deal with adequately, because, as I suspect, one of them he did not read or, if he read it, was unable to understand it.  But he saw enough of it to found a particularly venomous attack...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I ask you to note the words because they come from a man who is recognised as an authority on the meaning of words in the English language&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;on the Catholic Church in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I shall proceed to show how, and from where, he is briefed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are two matters, a venomous attack, and by whom I am briefed. Then he proceeds to say a lady from the Senator's county.  I think he will not deny that there was a suggestion that I was briefed by that lady.  Then when I interrupted, or before the interruption, he proceeded:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Senator was not above stealing that idea, or, rather, borrowing without acknowledging it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the charge, that I got this idea from Teresa Deevy.  I said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On a point of accuracy, I know nothing about this letter to which the Senator refers.  I could not acknowledge a thing about which I knew nothing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> I would ask you to note what follows. The Senator said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Well, then, the atmosphere of Waterford must be held guilty.  It must have created telepathic communication.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All I can say is it is pretty poor stuff for a professor in an argument.  The Senator went on to say in column 67:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The alleged reason was what? That the book is &lsquo;in its general tendency indecent&rsquo;.  What does the Senator say to that?  What does this conspiracy&mdash;this conspiracy against Irish morality&mdash;seek to make out?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Senator did not say what he had in mind when using this word &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo;. &ldquo;Conspiracy&rdquo; is certainly an ugly word.  I have not consulted a dictionary, but I think it means an association between two or more persons to carry out an illegal act.  I do not think anything I said showed that I was a party to any conspiracy.  I should like to say here and now that I acted solely on my own responsibility in putting down this motion.  I do not mean to say that when I had the idea I did not speak to other people about it, but nobody approached me to bring it forward.  I brought it forward entirely on my own responsibility, and as far as the charge of conspiracy is concerned, there is no foundation whatever for it.  The Senator further stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That we take our orders from the Church, that we are merely hirelings and tools of the Church, whose &lsquo;power&rsquo;, Senator Sir John Keane says, &lsquo;will be swept away&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I shall return to the record of my own speech later to show to what extent these charges are justified.  The Senator went on to refer to the letter to the <i>Irish Times</i>, and says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It declares sympathy for the lapsed Catholic, because the lapsed Catholic will not be allowed by other Catholics&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a new word on me&mdash;&ldquo;lapsed Catholic&rdquo;.  I think I understand <Col N="312" /> what it means.  The Senator continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is good enough to bring charges against men who are fulfilling a public duty, and who do not defend themselves.  This is the first opportunity that any member of the board has had, or taken, of explaining what this campaign of calumny means and what is its real purport.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Lest the House would be in any doubt as to what the Senator had in mind perhaps I should read what follows. Senator Professor Alton here intervened with these remarks:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would like to explain that unhappily I was not here for the earlier part of the debate.  It was not my fault, as I was detained elsewhere.  I did not hear these charges, and I hope that they were not made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Magennis replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Senator Sir John Keane made them.  I have read them out.  Senator the Provost of Trinity College did not hear them but Senator Sir John Keane said that there were hidden forces at work, and that they would be swept away.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even if I did say that there were hidden forces at work and that they would be swept away, where is there justification in that for the charge that I was accusing the board of being hirelings and tools of the clergy, that we wished to have its power swept away and that we had sympathy for the lapsed Catholic because the lapsed Catholic would not be allowed by other Catholies to get a living?  You have got these three main charges. The first is that I was in a conspiracy. I do not think I need deal further with that.  The second is that I was accusing the board of using their power to prevent lapsed Catholics from earning their living and the third charge is that I had accused the board of being the tools and the hirelings of the clergy.  I should like to go back on what I did say.  It is important to recall my speech because these charges are based on my remarks.  With regard to <i>Land of Spices</i>, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think one could make a pretty <Col N="313" /> good shot at proving <i>mala fides</i> in the case of <i>Land of Spices</i> but not in the case of <i>The Tailor and Ansty.</i>&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I say that these remarks do not justify the charges which the Senator made and which I have read out.  At the end of my speech I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not expect a favourable response.  I know too well the hidden forces at work in this matter and the dominating power of individual needs.  I shall not be a bit surprised and shall bear no one any ill will if I am told later on that I have been wallowing in literary garbage.  That will leave me perfectly unperturbed.  I want clean, fresh air on the facts of life.  I want a sense of proportion applied to human values and temptations and, if I read my history aright, I feel that, under this censorship continued in its present form, the seeds are being sown now of a movement, which, though we may not see it in our own time, will sweep away the authority that is striving to repress us in these matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is on that last sentence that the Senator seeks to justify the charge that I said that the power of the Church would be swept away.  I said that the seeds were being sown now of a movement by the Censorship Board which would sweep it away.  I never said for a moment that we, or that I, would sweep it away.  I am not so arrogant as all that.  I never made any suggestion that unfair treatment was being meted out to lapsed Catholics.  I had no grounds for making such a statement.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one remark as to the suggestion of <i>mala fides</i> because I feel that an explanation is due from me in this matter.  As I told the House, legal opinion was taken as to what extent decisions of the board could be challenged in the courts.  The opinion was that it would have to be shown that the board was not acting <i>bona fide</i> and that would be a very difficult matter indeed.  I went on to say that the board were working for 13 years and that no attempt had been made to do that yet.  No attempt has <Col N="314" /> been made because it is almost impossible to do it.  I said that if the board banned a certain book, on the ground that it was in its general tendency indecent, it might be held that the board had acted <i>mala fide.</i>  I made no suggestion of malice against the board.  Malice is a definite desire to harm the author of the book, but I made no suggestion of that kind.  I was speaking of the legal interpretation of the Act, and I suggested that acting outside the terms of the Act implied <i>mala fides.</i>  That is all I intended to suggest.  I never intended &mdash;and if the House got that impression I am quite prepared to withdraw it&mdash; to imply that the board was actuated by malice.  I merely intended to suggest that if a book cannot be brought within the terms of the Act, <i>bona fides</i> in banning it could not be sustained and <i>mala fides</i> applies.</P>
    <P>I admit an indiscretion, when I asked the Senator what had been the attitude of Dr. Fearon on the board.  Obviously, that was not a proper question.  I should have known that myself.  It was rather a mischievous question, and I am prepared to admit that it was mischievous.  I am very glad to hear that Dr. Fearon is a valuable member of the board, and I hope he will continue to be so, and that we will see examples of his restraining influence.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which perhaps the Senator would be prepared to deal with now.  I could not follow him very well and could not always catch everything said in the course of the debate.  The Senator said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am making a charge, but I am ready to withdraw it if the Senator asks me.  I thought he spoke with regard to Dr. Coffey as if he were ill through senility.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, I never referred to him in that sense.  I knew that Dr. Coffey was ill&mdash;he is an old gentleman&mdash;but the idea of senile decay never entered my mind.  If I had grasped it at the time, I would have asked the Senator to withdraw then.  He may wish to withdraw now&mdash;I do not mind what he does.</P>
    <P>I wish to restate the basis of my <Col N="315" /> case.  It is not a demand for the abolition of the principle of censorship.  I think it is all wrong, but that is only my private opinion.  Parliament has ordained that it shall prevail.  It is a pity that, when the Censorship Act was passed, the Act&mdash;of 1857, I think&mdash;was repealed, which enabled prosecutions to be brought against publishers and authors of obscene books.  The two Acts could have been enforced concurrently. I appreciate that we could not have prosecuted publishers outside the jurisdiction, but certainly we could have prosecuted Irish authors.  I am not at all certain that Irish authors would not have preferred prosecution &mdash;where the case would be made and they could defend themselves&mdash;than to be treated by their books being banned entirely without appeal.  If the Act had to be repealed, the power to prosecute might have been re-established.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised a good deal and have been told I was badly briefed because I brought forward the case of <i>The Tailor and Ansty.</i>  I was not trying to bring forward the books most favourable to my case, but a fair sample&mdash;three representative books in respect of which I think the board and the Minister acted wrongly. <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i> was one which was open to discretion on the part of the board.  In my opinion it was Rabelaisian, vulgar and coarse in passages, but it was not in general tendency indecent and, for that reason, it should not have been banned.  Senator Tierney supported me in that view.  I certainly admit that it was entirely within the board's province to deal with that book as they thought fit&mdash;the only thing.  I challenge in respect of that book is their judgment.  In the remarks that Senator Magennis made with regard to that book, I felt there was a further reason why he was not altogether, in his personal make-up, quite suited to the position he holds. He seems to lack entirely something most essential&mdash;a sense of humour.  In the end of that book, the Tailor goes to Heaven and finds it rather boring there.  He has a look around in the other place and is joined by St. Francis and a lot of kindred spirits. <Col N="316" /> I do not think it is blasphemous.  It reminds me of a story about Father Healy&mdash;I wonder if the Senator would call it blasphemous.  Father Healy was asked where he would like to rest in the hereafter, and said that, with regard to climate, he would rather prefer to go where he was entitled to go&mdash;up above&mdash;but as regards the company, he would be much happier below as, he said, most of his friends were Protestants.  Is that blasphemous?  It is making jokes about the hereafter, but I cannot see anything blasphemous in it.</P>
    <P>In regard to <i>Land of Spices</i>, I will have to ask the House to be indulgent. It is a book so outside any justifiable charge of indecency that my interpretation of <i>mala fide</i>&mdash;the limited interpretation&mdash;applies.  In banning that book the board, in my opinion, cannot have been acting <i>bona fide.</i>  If a jury of this House were empanelled, and free altogether from political obligations, and if the case were argued before them by counsel, they could not say that <i>Land of Spices</i> is, in general tendency, indecent. The only passage in it that deals with sex consists of two lines on page 155, where this nun is dreaming and looking back on the life her father lived.  She recalls the incident where, looking through a window, she saw her father embracing Etienne.  Etienne was a man.  That is the only passage regarding sex in the whole book.</P>
    <P>[<i>The Senator quoted from the book.</i>]</P>
    <P>The Senator says that makes&mdash;I do not like the word, but he used it and it has a good Old Testament flavour&mdash; sodomy the central theme of the book. I think he might have used something less strong.</P>

      <P>Let me be quite clear.  Quotation begins.</P>
      <P>[<i>The Senator quotes.</i>]</P>
      <P>Quotation ends, and my comment begins.  The Senator says that the motive of sodomy&mdash;which is in two lines&mdash;is the motive underlying the whole theme of the book and that the board was justified in banning it on that account.  The Senator gave his own paraphrase, but I want to read. Let me read to you the talks and reactions of this daughter to that sin. If she were always harping on the nasty side of it, I quite agree that she would be discussing sodomy and all the evils of unnatural vice and the board would have been justified in banning it.  But what are her thoughts, running through it?  I am stating them fairly when I say they are nearly all contained in the second chapter, which is headed &ldquo;Vocation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>[<i>The Senator quoted from the book.</i>]</P>
      <P>Here is another passage:&mdash;</P>
      <P>[<i>The Senator quoted.</i>]</P>
      <P>These extracts are rather long but I have to read them because it is on those sentiments the Senator justifies the banning of the book.  Presumably it is bad for general readers to read what I have been reading to you.</P>
      <P>[<i>The Senator quoted.</i>]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not really think that I need go on reading these passages.  That is the theme of the book.  Those are her thoughts as a result of that experience, and I say, with all emphasis, that nothing in sentiments of that kind is likely to do anything but good to readers, instead of being calculated to deprave or degrade, in the words of the Act.  As a result of the experience, her life was rather ennobled and it was one devoted entirely to her Church. She is ultimately to be head of the Order.  That is a book that has been banned because, as the Senator said, the Minister agreed that its central theme is sodomy.  Suppose that unfortunate girl had found instead of <Col N="318" /> sodomy&mdash;I hate the word&mdash;that her father was unfaithful, that instead of being a man it had been a woman&mdash;and I venture to say that anyone casually reading the book might easily think that Etienne was a woman&mdash; that he was an embezzler, a forger, a traitor to his country, is it suggested that the book would have then been banned?  Surely, if that is so, it is a strange proposition.</P>
    <P>In order to emphasise the enormity of this crime, the Senator had to say it was punishable in Scotland by death&mdash;and only in Scotland&mdash;up to 1857.  Are we to suggest that the ordinary people of the world do not know that such a thing as sodomy exists?  Was there not a play in Dublin some years ago, <i>The Green Bay Tree</i>, of which sodomy was made the central theme?</P>
    <P>The assumption is apparently that the words spoken there conveyed a suggestion of homosexuality, that that alone must condemn a book and that alone is justification for the banning of this book, which in fact tells of an experience leading to a very holy life. That is why I say this book should not have been banned.  The book was not in any way indecent in its general tendency.  It did not excite unnatural vice or tend to immorality; it did not tend to corrupt or deprave&mdash; quite the reverse.  I feel that however well-intentioned the board, however <i>bona fide</i> the action that they took in regard to this book, they might just as well have said that they would <i>bona fide</i> ban a dictionary which contained definitions of some words or even a treatise on mathematics with almost as much justification as for the banning of this book.</P>
    <P>I now pass to the <i>Laws of Life.</i>  I do not think the Senator in his defence of the banning of that book was altogether happy.  He gave a very long explanation of it, but the facts are perfectly simple.  I admit that the board did not know, at the time that they banned this edition of the book, that a later edition had the <i>permissu superiorum.</i>  I cannot help feeling that if the board had known that they would not have banned the book.  That <Col N="319" /> may be so, but here is a book that had the <i>permissu superiorum</i> of the Catholic Diocese of Westminster and which&mdash;unless I am contradicted&mdash;I can say is allowed to circulate freely among Catholics outside this country. I think at one time that the Senator said indirectly: &ldquo;Why should the board not exercise its independent judgment?&rdquo;&mdash;but I do not think the board stand on that.  However, the fact remains that the book has the <i>permissu superiorum</i> and the board do not deny that it circulates freely among Catholics.  Apparently then, they say it is not desirable that it should circulate freely among our people here.  This is the book which the Senator said should only be put into the hands of students or confessors. By what authority do they say that?  There is nothing in the Act to bear that out.</P>
    <P>Under the Act books can only be banned for two reasons.  One is that they are in their general tendency indecent and the other is that they advocate unnatural methods of contraception. It has not been suggested, I think, that this book is in its general tendency indecent.  Let us see what the Minister says in regard to this book.  I think his is a much more frank statement of the case than we had from the Senator.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to the <i>Laws of Life</i>, whether the board was technically and legally correct, whether the book was in its general tendency indecent may be open to question, but on the ground that it was calculated to do untold harm I am perfectly satisfied that it should be banned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I like that type of honest statement, but what is the legal authority for this? The Minister is not entitled, nor are the board entitled to say that because they are of the opinion that a book will do harm it should be banned in consequence. That book is not in its general tendency indecent, nor does it advocate unnatural means of contraception. It advocates the use of the <Col N="320" /> safe period, and I am informed that on occasions the Catholic Church allows the use of the safe period.</P>
    <P>I was hoping that the Senator would have thought better of what he said when he saw the record, but I am afraid he has not.  I cannot help feeling that he will be sorry when he sees himself on the record as saying that this book which had the <i>permissu superiorum</i> of the Catholic authorities in England and which, I contend, should not have been banned within the Act is, as he said, &ldquo;the fornicator's <i>vade-mecum</i> or, if you like, the harlot's handbook&rdquo;.  Surely there is no necessity to be dirty, because that is dirty, and he said it of a book approved by the Catholic Diocese of Westminster which circulates freely among Catholics in England.</P>
    <P>In regard to <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i>, I admit that there were grounds in that case for the board's judgment; grounds allowing its discretion, but in the case of <i>Land of Spices</i>, the board acted without legal authority, and that is the basis of my case.  With regard to this talk about the authority derived from Mount Sinai, I think that our modern Moses has new tablets which he is applying to our modern home.</P>
    <P>I pass on to certain questions I asked and which were unanswered by the Minister or the Senator.  I asked, for instance, why is there censorship only in English.  It is quite simple for young people, so disposed, with ample opportunities of modern education, to read French, and there are plenty of French books to be obtained in libraries which are more objectionable, if you like to call it objectionable&mdash; more daring I prefer to call it&mdash;than a large number of these books that were banned.  I asked have the censors read these books, but that question was conveniently ignored.  On that point, however, I recall the letter written by Lynn Doyle to the public Press shortly after his resignation; I can read it to you if you wish, but to paraphrase it he said: &ldquo;I could not go on with this. I could not consent to deal with a book in marked passages.  Once the passages <Col N="321" /> were marked I could not get the bias of this marking out of my mind. If I were to judge a book fairly I would have to get it and read it fully without any bias.&rdquo;  Because he would not be subject to the marked passages he resigned from the board, and I think he resigned also because he thought it was unfair to take a book after eight years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall read the letter which Lynn Doyle wrote on February 13, 1937, to the <i>Irish Times.</i> That is objective enough in all conscience. The heading is &ldquo;Lynn Doyle's Protest&rdquo;, and the introductory matter states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Lynn Doyle, author of <i>The Spirit of Ireland, Ballygullion</i>, and other works, has resigned his membership of the Free State Board of Book Censors.  In a letter to the Minister <Col N="323" /> for Justice, Lynn Doyle refrains from expressing any comment on the need or otherwise of censorship, but makes a strong criticism of the methods of officials who, receiving certain books from objectors, mark passages for the attention of members of the board.  There are grave dangers in the system, he says.  The wisdom of the State, he adds, would not be exalted by banning a book which had been in circulation for eight or even three years, after cultured and the more hardened readers had read it.  Lynn Doyle was a member of the board for five weeks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sorry to bore the House with all this matter, but blame the Senator for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have withdrawn &ldquo;because&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Because&rdquo; is banned. I am starting afresh, at the Senator's request.  This is the letter of Lynn Doyle:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir&mdash;I ask your leave to resign my position on the Censorship of Publications Board.  After examining books under the system for some five weeks, I have come to the conclusion that I could not, with fairness to the State or myself, go on acting on the board.  I raise no questions about the necessity of censorship, being concerned solely with the board as it must function under the Act by which it was created.  The books are sent to the Minister by private objectors in different parts of the country.  A permanent official marks, by writing folio numbers on a card, passages that he thinks come under the Act.  The marked books are then sent to the members of the board, in turn.  Now, the board is required to make recommendations according to the general tendency of the book.  It is nearly impossible to report on general tendency after reading the marked passages.  Even when one reads the book through afterwards, one is under the influence of the markings.  There is <Col N="324" /> another reason.  Here I speak for myself only.  It is so terribly easy to read merely the marked passages; so hard to wade through the whole book afterwards.  No doubt the other members painfully read all the books through.  But, alas, I am lazy and fallible; and some of the books made hard reading.  It is easier to be a &lsquo;bad&rsquo; writer than a good writer. After five weeks of censoring, I find myself sorely tempted to rely on the marked folios alone.  Surely, there are grave dangers in the system. Next comes the element of chance in the banning.  By the accident of its not encountering a critical eye, a book coming justly under the Act may circulate for years.  One book was presented for my attention which had circulated for eight years. But it might have been caught in the first month.  Other books have been. This does not seem even-handed justice.  Moreover, to ban a book of eight, or even three, years of age is to revive a harmful thing that has become happily moribund.  The venal author would rejoice; and why shouldn't he?  But the wisdom of our State would not be exalted thereby. Then, there is the effect on authors who have been, in these ways, not very fairly treated.  Either they emasculate to the damage of their art, or, in indignation and revolt, they set out deliberately to shock.  In either event, they suffer.  There is the question of punishment as between the Irish and the foreign author.  Perhaps, 5 per cent. of a foreign best-seller's sales is in Ireland.  Thirty or 40 per cent. of an Irish author's circulation may be in Ireland.  The disparity of punishment is obvious.  I admit that, in practice, the Irish censorship works out wonderfully well.  Between a book's issue and its banning, the more cultured and more hardened readers have read it.  The unsophisticated have not, in general, got to know about it.  But I do not think it is worthy of our State to trade on an Act whose excellence consists in its bad drafting.  These are some of the reasons that have caused me to think that I could not conscientiously <Col N="325" /> act on the board.  Nor did I feel that, influenced by them, I should attend a meeting.  A fortunate adjournment has given me the opportunity of avoiding this....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that I need read the remainder of the letter, but I shall do so if any Senator wishes.  I think I have given a fair version of it.  Lynn Doyle objected to serving on the board because he had to read marked passages.  The question I asked was: Do the censors read the books.  I have got no answer to that question and I leave it at that.</P>
    <P>There is one point upon which I must go back in connection with <i>Laws of Life.</i>  The Senator said I never adverted to the second edition, which, he told us, is substantially different from the first edition.  I ask the House to remember that all editions have been banned, whatever the difference is.  The Senator read certain extracts from the second edition to show that it was substantially different from the first edition but, unfortunately, the record does not give the extracts and I am unable to deal with them.  The book is in accord with Catholic approval because it has got the <i>permissu superiorum.</i>  But still the book is banned.  Surely that governs the whole position.  I know that the Senator has said that discretion should be used by good Catholics in the use of the safe period, that Catholics must not use the safe period in order to possess a motor car in preference to a child; presumably, they could use the safe period to get food in preference to living in starvation but not to have essential clothing or keep a fire going.  One's conscience must be pretty elastic to interpret those fine distinctions.  The point is that this book has been banned and the Catholics in other countries are allowed to read it but not here. There is one other point I want to make in connection with what the Senator said.  The Senator took up the point that the standards of obscenity are identical in this country and in England, which he calls my spiritual home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Permit me, Sir, the legal standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="326" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not deny it, but I do deny that the results are not different.  The legal standards that prevail here and prevail with the public prosecutor in England may be the same, but it comes to this: In regard to how many books has action been taken?  I venture to say that, while 1,500 books have been banned here, I doubt if 15 or even five of these books have been the subject of a prosecution in Great Britain.  That is the whole point.  Whatever the standards may be, the results are entirely different. I certainly have no objection, although I think it is the wrong approach, to the banning of 80 per cent. of these books.  I think there is no profit in reading them, but I do think that 20 per cent. of them are valuable literature, written by people of undoubted authority, and that they should have been allowed to be read by adults.  That reminds me that Senator Quirke and Senator Magennis have different views on this matter.  Senator Magennis denied that the banning was down to the level of schoolgirl innocence.  I said that it was down to schoolgirl safety&mdash;what cannot be read by a schoolgirl must not be read by an adult.  The Senator said that was ridiculous, but Senator Quirke said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If my daughter should not read a book, I do not see why you or I should either.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what is going on.  We are denied the right to read books because they might do harm to people with young and unformed minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not come to this matter without something constructive to offer.  I was taken to task because I said that the Minister would not be politically able to grant any concession or make any relaxation in this matter, and I was told I was making an unwarrantable charge and that, whether elections were in the offing or not, politicians always spoke the truth.  That may be all right to tell to students of moral philosophy, but it will not do to tell us&mdash;men of the world&mdash;that Government and Ministers always say what they think and that politicians never have regard to the occasion. Even if they are not politicians, people <Col N="327" /> have to have regard to the occasion. You must have regard to the occasion and to the effect of your public utterances. The Minister would be the last to suggest that it is unwarrantable when I say that he cannot say all that he feels in this matter.  Although he may feel that a case has been made, I do not expect him to say it now.  What I do suggest is that, when things have calmed down, this matter might be approached by means of an inquiry.</P>
    <P>I suggest that, instead of having individual censors, we should have a number of societies on a panel.  I have in mind the Universities, the Catholic Truth Society, the P.E.N. Club and, perhaps, the Royal Dublin Society and similar bodies.  Books could be referred to them and they should be asked to give their opinion as a body to the Minister on each book, as to whether it was within the terms of the Act.  The effect of that would be that the body would take responsibility which would have to be taken by an impersonal body.  They would, no doubt, get readers.  I can imagine that they would get Senator Counihan to read one book, me to read another, and perhaps Senator The McGillycuddy to read another.  You would get a much wider and more human outlook and you would get a certain number of young people to read books.  I think the young people's judgment is every bit as good as that of men who are more mature, as they are the embodiment of all wisdom.  That is my suggestion. I do not expect it to be received now, but I would ask the Minister to ponder on it in his leisure moments or to consider the re-enacting of the statute which enables prosecutions to be made against writers or publishers of obscene literature.  I have finished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Eireann is of opinion that the total cost of the erection, reconstruction and equipment of national schools should be borne by the State, and that the public health authorities should be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the school buildings and premises, including repairs, heating, lighting, cleaning and sanitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not by any means the first time on which the propositions contained in this motion have been publicly advanced, but I feel it is particularly appropriate that they should be put forward now, in view of the <Col N="331" /> attitude taken up by the Minister for Education when replying to Senator Baxter last July on the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill, but much more so because of something which has occurred here in this country within the last few months, and to which I shall have occasion to refer later on in the course of my remarks.  In Volume 26, No. 17, Column 1846 of the Seanad Debates, the Minister is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to school buildings, the point I should like to emphasise to the Seanad is that our national school system is organised on a parish basis.  There is the parish unit and this organisation of primary education is in accordance with the religious sentiments of the Irish people.  It has been described even quite recently by an Irish bishop as being not very far from the ideal, so far as Irish Catholic principles are concerned.  The State is responsible for the payment of the teachers and it makes generous grants towards the building, improvement, heating and cleaning of the schools, but on the people of the parish, which is the unit of the whole system, devolves the primary duty of providing the funds necessary for the maintenance, repair, heating and cleaning of the schools and towards the cost of reconstruction of existing buildings and the erection of new school buildings when required locally.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this passage, and indeed all through his speech on that occasion, the Minister spoke as if the present national school system were a homogeneous entity&mdash;something that could not be interfered with or altered in any way without doing violence to Catholic principles or to the religious sentiments of the Irish people.  I believe I am right in saying that this was the impression created by his speech.  It will be my task to show that such an impression is entirely erroneous.</P>
    <P>The Catholic Church, not alone in this country but in all countries, has always claimed and insisted on certain <Col N="332" /> prior fundamental rights in the control of education, and it has ever been exceedingly jealous of any interference with these rights.  No responsible person or body, in this country at least, will dispute or fail to acknowledge that claim.  But we must be certain as to what the claim actually is.  In many countries during the latter half of the last century&mdash;and indeed, I might say, down to the present day&mdash;controversy has raged over the question of religious control of schools and religious teaching in the schools, and there has been much bitterness and much contention as a result.  Happily, we in this country, or perhaps I should say in this part of the country, have been spared such controversy.  Many things have operated from time to time to cause dissension among our people, but through all our trials and troubles there has always been, among Catholics and Protestants alike, but one opinion on the question of religious education and its place in our educational system.  There is unanimous agreement among all our people that religious instruction, in accordance with the religious beliefs of the pupils and their parents, must be given in all primary schools.  Education is of the spirit&mdash;it has to do with the soul of man, the cultivation of the mind, the gradual drawing out and development of the child's God-given faculties.  It concerns itself with the human personality in the wide sense&mdash;the proper upbringing of the child and the training of his character as a Christian and a citizen.  All true teaching must be animated by that spirit.  It is in this spiritual field that the Church claims to have the fullest and most complete authority, and here it will brook no interference from any quarter, State or otherwise.</P>
    <P>When we talk of a school, we sometimes have in mind the material building&mdash;four walls of bricks and mortar&mdash; wherein education is being imparted. But the building and its surroundings are the accidentals and externals&mdash;the mere material adjuncts to the school proper.  We could have a school in the middle of a desert, in a tent or in an open park, in a ditch or beside a <Col N="333" /> hedge, as we had in our own country in years gone by.  We must, therefore, clearly distinguish between what might be called the religious, moral and spiritual side of education and the purely material side&mdash;the externals, the buildings in which education is imparted, the administrative machinery, and such like.  There is, I assert, no inseparable bond between these two sides, and I hope to show that no such inseparable bond is claimed to exist between them.</P>
    <P>Rev. Dr. Corcoran, S.J., the distinguished Professor of Education in the National University, in the course of his minority report as a member of the Vice-Regal Committee on Intermediate Education in 1918 made the following statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The most essential issue in the Catholic nature of Catholic schools is full Catholic control of the choice of teachers, retention of teachers and removal of teachers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Church claims, and none disputes its claim, that in order to ensure that not only religion, but the secular subjects as well, should be taught in the proper way&mdash;that all the teaching should be animated by the proper spirit and sentiments&mdash;it should have control over the teaching personnel&mdash; that it should have the right to select and appoint, and when necessary remove, the teachers.  That right has been fully conceded in the case of all primary schools under Catholic management in this country.  No responsible person or body, and least of all the teachers themselves, dispute or question that right.  Indeed the teachers would be among the first to oppose any attempt to take away that right from the managers.  I make that statement very deliberately and with full regard to my position as an official of the Teachers' Organisation of 26 years standing.  Addressing a teachers' congress in Belfast on April 22nd, 1930, Most Rev. Dr. Mageean, Lord Bishop of Down and Connor, spoke as follows&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What I say here about the impossibility of separating in practice the religious from the secular side is true of education in itself; it is not <Col N="334" /> necessarily true in the administration of education.  Let me make this point clear by an example.</P>
    <P>Questions dealing with the upkeep and repair of the school building, with sanitation, heating, lighting and cleansing of the school could be in the hands of a committee, subject to the education authority.  On the other hand, the determination of the religious programme to be taught in the school would fall within the province of the Church authority.</P>
    <P>The teacher is partly the concern of the State and partly the concern of the Church; for the addition to imparting knowledge the teacher plays a large part in the religious and moral development of the child.</P>
    <P>The situation could be met, I think, by the ecclesiastical authority appointing the teacher, subject to the proviso that the State has the right of insisting that the person appointed should have the proper academic qualifications or the approval of the education authority.</P>
    <P>Questions of text-books could be solved in the same way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here his Lordship made it clear that he made no claim to the control of such matters as the upkeep and maintenance of school buildings.  He did claim a right in the matter of the appointment of the teachers, and of the school programme and school texts&mdash;in other words in the religious, moral and spiritual side, as against the purely material side.</P>
    <P>I referred a few moments ago to a commission which sat in 1918, of which Dr. Corcoran was a member.  In the same year, a commission presided over by the late Lord Killanin examined the position of primary education.  One of the greatest Churchmen of our day, the late Cardinal O'Donnell, was a member of that commission.  So also was the then secretary of the Catholic Clerical Managers' Association, the late Very Rev. Canon Macken, P.P., of Claremorris, who represented the Catholic managers on the commission.  The other Churches were likewise represented. <Col N="335" /> Here is an extract from the unanimous findings of this commission signed by, among others, Cardinal O'Donnell and Canon Macken:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While we hold that the work of teaching in primary schools in Ireland is a national service, and that the assistance heretofore given from State grants towards the original capital expenditure on the erection of school-houses should be continued, there are, in our opinion, directions in which localities may well be called upon to evince their interest in the success of the State service, by contributing by a local rate towards the expense of primary education.</P>
    <P>We therefore propose that it be obligatory on county councils and county boroughs, in conjunction with the Board of National Education, to appoint school committees on the same lines as school attendance committees are at present constituted. Their duties and powers to be as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) The enforcement of school attendance enactments throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>(2) The maintenance, repairs, heating, cleaning, and equipment of national schools unless adequate provision has been otherwise made.</P>
    <P>Before expending money in the maintenance, repairs and equipment of non-vested schools, the owners of the buildings should enter into agreements with the school committee as regards the use of the buildings during certain hours and for a certain number of years for primary education purposes, so as to warrant the committee incurring such expenditure.</P>
    <P>It should also be optional for such local committees to undertake the following charges:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) The payment of the moiety required from the locality in order to secure the medical and dental treatment of the pupils in the schools, and to secure the provision of meals in necessitous cases. Also the payment of the local <Col N="336" /> moiety towards discharging the annuity on the residence for the principal teacher.</P>
    <P>(2)  The provision of school books and requisites in necessitous cases.</P>
    <P>(3) The provision, where necessary, of plots of land for the purposes of horticultural instruction, and also the provision of sites free of cost to enable managers to erect teachers' residences where not already provided.</P>
    <P>The expenses incurred in exercising these powers and fulfilling these duties to be met by a county-at-large or borough rate.  In cases of dispute in the distribution of the local rate for any of these purposes the matter should be referred to the Commissioners of National Education for their decision.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These recommendations, I would remind Senators, were made when we had an alien Government here in 1918 or 1919.</P>
    <P>I shall quote one further extract to show that in this matter of education the distinction or division between the spiritual and the material side does exist and is, in fact, recognised and provided for by the Church itself. This extract is from the Encyclical <i>Divini Illius Magistri&mdash;The Christian Education of Youth</i>, by His Holiness Pope Pius XI, an authority which, in such a matter, is beyond question. The extract I propose to quote is taken from the paragraph headed &ldquo;Relations Between Church and State.&rdquo;  The first portion of this paragraph deals with the boundaries which limit the respective activities of Church and State and refers to the words of His Holiness Pope Leo XIII on the subject. It points out that some subjects may be the concern of both authorities, though from a different point of view. Then it goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Now the education of youth is precisely one of those matters that belong both to the Church and to the State, &ldquo;though in different ways,&rdquo; as explained above.  &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; continues Leo XIII, &ldquo;between the two powers there must reign a well ordered harmony.  Not without <Col N="337" /> reason may this mutual agreement be compared to the union of body and soul in man.  Its nature and extent can only be determined by considering, as we have said, the nature of each of the two powers, and in particular the excellence and nobility of the respective ends.  To one is committed directly and specifically the charge of what is helpful in worldly matters; while the other is to concern itself with the things that pertain to Heaven and eternity.  Everything, therefore, in human affairs that is in any way sacred, or has reference to the salvation of souls and the worship of God, whether by its nature or by its end, is subject to the jurisdiction and discipline of the Church.  Whatever else is comprised in the civil and political order rightly comes under the authority of the State; for Christ commanded us to give to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and to God the things that are God's.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These extracts and the statements by prominent Churchmen which I have quoted make it quite clear that changes in our primary system which would concern themselves only with such external and material things as school buildings, their upkeep and maintenance&mdash;changes which might imply the handing over of such administrative details to local committees and the imposition of a local rate&mdash;that any such changes would not be inconsistent with fundamental Catholic principles and would not, as might be gathered from the Minister's speech to which I referred earlier, do violence to Catholic ideals or to the religious sentiments of our people.</P>
    <P>I have thought it necessary to dwell at some length on this in order to dispel any misconception that might arise, and to forestall a possible argument that here in this motion we are asking something which, if granted, would be an invasion of the rights and privileges claimed by the Church under what is known as the managerial system.  On the contrary, this is a proposal to relieve managers of an obligation with which they find themselves burdened&mdash;one which they are <Col N="338" /> not in a position effectively to carry out, because they are not provided with any powers to enable them to carry it out.  They are, in fact, asked, and expected, to make bricks without straw.</P>
    <P>I come now to the first proposition in this motion, viz., that the total cost of the erection, reconstruction and equipment of schools should be provided from State funds.  School building in this country has always been carried on&mdash;in fact is still carried on &mdash;in a haphazard and desultory fashion.  In the early days of the system, many schools were built by private individuals, often by the local landlord, and they remained the private property of the individual who built them.  These are known as &ldquo;non-vested schools&rdquo;.  Nowadays the State provides at least two-thirds of the cost of erection, and the school building is vested in local trustees&mdash;usually, in the case of Catholic schools in the Bishop of the diocese, his Vicar-General or some person specially appointed by him, and the local parish priest, who is the manager of the school.  Let us see what the usual procedure is when it is decided to build a new school.  I should say here, of course, that the existing school may be condemned for years before the decision is finally taken to replace it. That is no uncommon experience; there are 300 of them in that category at present.  The manager must provide a suitable site.  He gets no financial assistance from the State or the local authority to enable him to lease or purchase a site.  The site chosen has to satisfy the Board of Works, and if the manager believes the site is suitable and the Board of Works think otherwise a controversy arises that may go on for years.</P>
    <P>Let us assume, however, that the question of the site is settled&mdash;the manager has somehow or other raised the necessary funds to provide it.  The Board of Works will then, in consultation with the Department of Education, make an estimate of the cost of the new building.  If the money voted for school building in that particular year is not already allocated&mdash;and <Col N="339" /> this often happens&mdash;the Department of Education informs the manager that a grant equal to two-thirds of the estimated cost of the building will be made available, provided he is prepared to put up the balance.  Let us see what this means.</P>
    <P>A school to accommodate 100 pupils would cost, even pre-war, something in the neighbourhood of £2,500 or £3,000. The manager, in addition to providing the site, would in that case be expected to provide £800 or £1,000 as his share of the cost.  Now I ask Senators to visualise the ordinary rural parish&mdash;with its population of small farmers and agricultural labourers. The manager is expected to raise within his parish this capital sum.  He can do so only by way of appeal for voluntary subscriptions.  In nine cases out of ten the manager will say he is unable to provide the local contribution, and here begins another battle between the manager and the Department. There is provision in the rules to enable the Minister to grant, in case of necessity, a bigger proportion than two-thirds, and a process of bargaining is set on foot between the manager and the Department, something like what goes on at a local fair &mdash;only that this particular haggling may go on for months, or even years, before final agreement is reached.</P>
    <P>I do not think I can give a better description of what happens in such cases than was given by Mr. O'Neill, Secretary of the Department of Education, in the course of his evidence before the Committee of Public Accounts in April of this year.  He was being examined as to the circumstances in which a school was closed for 16 months, during which reconstruction work was being carried out.  I quote from page 16 of the report of the Public Accounts Committee, and Minutes of Evidence which was ordered to be printed in July, 1942. The date on which the evidence was given is April 30th, 1942.</P>
    <P>I quote questions 136 and 137:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;136.  Chairman&mdash;Can you give any information as to that, Mr. O'Neill?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> Mr. O'Neill: It was really more a Board of Works case than ours, because the chief delay arose in the section dealt with by the Board of Works.  In the beginning, there was a great deal of haggling over the grant.  That occurred in our section of the case, because the manager wanted us to contribute more than we were willing to.  We were haggling for about four months.  After that, as I have said, it was a question of the Board of Works having difficulties in carrying out the reconstruction. We kept on asking the Board of Works to expedite the business.  I can give you a time-table if you wish.</P>
    <P>137.  Chairman&mdash;Is there any staple basis for grants or does every school which comes up for repairs become the subject of a bargain between the Department and the manager as to what proportion of the cost will be defrayed by a grant from the Department?&mdash;No. There is a regular scale.  We give two-thirds and the manager gives one-third.  That is the normal thing that applies in general practice.  Where you have a necessitous parish, however, in a congested district in the west particularly, where a manager may have nine or ten schools and a very low rateable valuation, then he asks that we should give more and that he should have to raise less.  Sometimes he asks that he should not be required to give anything at all.  It is there the haggling comes in.  In this case the manager wanted only to give one-sixth.  In justice to the taxpayer we did not think that we could give him five-sixths, and so we haggled for a few months and finally came to a bargain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is Mr. O'Neill's description of what took place in that particular case.  Four months' haggling before the bargain was finally made&mdash;that is before the work was even put up for contract!  One can only imagine how long it took to decide that the reconstruction was necessary at all before the actual haggling began.</P>
    <P>I shall give one other instance to show the delay that can take place before a school which is declared <Col N="341" /> dangerous and injurious to health can be put into a proper state of repair. Some time in 1934, the M.O.H. for County Kildare called attention in his annual report to the condition of one of the schools in his area.  Nothing was done about it.  Three years later &mdash;in 1937&mdash;he reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This building is, generally, in a dilapidated condition.  The floor is in disrepair and is a serious danger to children owing to the possibility of accidents.  The fireplaces are in disrepair.  The walls and floor are dirty.  It is, evidently, many years since the walls were distempered. The end wall shows a large area of dampness; the wall over one window is dangerously cracked.  There are slates missing from the roof and the exterior plastering is in disrepair. There are signs on the wall which indicate rain coming through roof. The roof of the cloakroom is in a dirty condition.  The desks are of the old, obsolete type.  The closet walls are dirty and this structure is insufficiently lighted and ventilated. The eave gutters are missing and defective.  The surplus water from yard flows into schoolroom.  These premises are in such a condition as to be a nuisance or injurious to health.  They are, in my opinion, definitely unfit for use as a school in their present insanitary condition.  I recommend that this school be not used until it has been put into proper repair and condition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then began a series of communications between the manager, the Department of Education, and the Board of Works, and in which even the Kildare Board of Health and the Local Government Department took a hand.  Yet, in December, 1941, four years later, the medical officer of health felt compelled to report as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I again beg to call attention to....school, which remains in a condition injurious to health.  I have repeatedly, in the last few years, reported this matter to the board, but no definite action has been taken to secure a remedy.  In a State professing Christian ideals in its Constitution, it is a paradox that children <Col N="342" /> should be compelled by law to attend daily in such hovels which are masquerading as national schools, and which are endangering and undermining the health of the citizens of to-morrow.  The neglect to repair and maintain old schools, and failure to provide new ones, is in sharp contrast with the board's action in repairing old cottages and providing new ones despite war conditions. Following this report, an assurance was received that the conditions of this school would be improved, and at time of writing repairs are at last actually in progress&mdash;seven years from time of first report on what was among the worst schools in County Kildare.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I need not dwell further on this aspect of the case, but when Senators know the circumlocutory methods and the interminable delays connected with this question of building schools, they will not be surprised to learn that only 334 new schools were erected in the ten-year period, 1932 to 1942.</P>

      <P>Because the Minister mentioned these figures here on the occasion of the debate last July.  I hope that the Senator will not think that I am drawing any comparison between the work of this Government and of the last Government in this connection.  I think that the position was better in the past ten years than in the previous ten years.  I do not want to make political capital out of this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right, but the selection of dates was unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures were given by the Minister on the occasion of the debate in July.  That is why I mentioned 334.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told the Seanad here last July that according to his figures, <Col N="343" /> which were not up-to-date, 600 new schools were required, and that 300 of these could be regarded as being in the &ldquo;very urgent&rdquo; category.  There are about 5,000 schools in the country, so that approximately one-eighth of them need to be replaced.  This, I may add, is an extremely conservative estimate.  If the present rate of 30 new schools a year is to continue, when does the Minister hope to finish the work?  How many schools will require urgent replacement or reconstruction by the time these 300 are finished with?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that £2,500,000 was expended on school buildings and reconstruction since 1932; but, on his own showing, that amount was entirely inadequate to cope with the problem. If that problem is to be tackled in a serious way, the first step is to short-circuit the present cumbersome procedure. The two-thirds and one-third regulation is not imposed by Act of Parliament, nor has it even the force of a statutory rule or order.  It is a hundred-year old rule, carried over from the old National Board&mdash;one that could be altered in the morning by a stroke of the pen.  Money for school building is capital expenditure.  It could, and should, be raised by loan, and its repayment spread over a long series of years.  As it is now, one generation of parents in a parish is expected to contribute one-third of the cost of a building which will supply the needs of at least three generations. The State is in a better position than any individual manager to raise money on favourable terms, and if the total cost is provided by the State all this haggling can be cut out and the work can be put in hand immediately it is decided that a new school is necessary. Managers will be only too glad to cooperate with the Department if they are relieved of the necessity of providing a local contribution.</P>
    <P>Here I might refer to a possible objection that will be made both to this and to the second proposal in the motion.  The managers and the ecclesiastical authorities attach considerable importance to the question of ownership. The schools, as I have stated, <Col N="344" /> are, in the main, the property of local trustees&mdash;parochial property, that is&mdash; and some people may say: &ldquo;How could the State build schools which they may not own, and how can a local authority expend money on property which belongs to someone else?&rdquo; Whenever such a problem is posed to me, I always call to mind an incident which happened in my own family some years ago.  One of my girls, aged about four or five, got a present of a male puppy.  She told her mother that she would call him &ldquo;Nell&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Oh, but,&rdquo; her mother objected, &ldquo;you couldn't call a little boy-dog &lsquo;Nell&rsquo;.&rdquo; The child thought for a moment, and just said &ldquo;You could&rdquo;; and that was all that was about it, and &ldquo;Nell&rdquo; he was called.  And when someone now tells me that you could not spend public money on what is, legally, private property, I just say &ldquo;You could&rdquo;.  It is conventional to think otherwise, of course, but let no one say that it cannot be done if we wish it done.</P>
    <P>Not only that, but in this very case of school-building it is being done at present.  I stated that, in certain cases of necessity, the Department is satisfied to accept a smaller contribution than the usual one-third.  In the very poor areas the manager may not be asked to contribute anything.  The total cost is provided by the State, but it does not, because of that, raise any question of State ownership.  The school building is vested in local trustees, and is, and continues to be, parochial property, just in the same way as if the manager had contributed the full one-third proportion of the cost.  I should point out here that, before a grant is made by the State towards the erection of any national school, the manager or trustees must execute a deed in which they give a very elaborate undertaking to the effect that the building will always be used as a national school, that it will be subject to the control of, and to inspection by, the Department of Education, that the programme taught therein must be approved by the Department, and that if these conditions are not observed then the money granted by the State must be refunded <Col N="345" /> by the trustees.  What more security than that is needed by the State?</P>
    <P>The Killanin Commission, in the extract which I quoted earlier, suggested that the owners of the non-vested schools should enter into agreement with the local authority as regards the use of the buildings for primary education purposes, in order to warrant the local authority expending money on repairs and maintenance. They did not suggest that they should be transferred to the local authorities.  And it must be remembered that, though the schools are, and remain, private or semi-private property, they are used for a public purpose for the benefit of the community as a whole, and technicalities or conventions as to legal ownership should not stand in the way of doing what is necessary to render them suitable for the purpose they are intended to serve.</P>
    <P>It cannot, therefore, be urged as an argument against this motion that its implementing would involve a transfer of the ownership of the schools either to the State or to the local authorities, because all that is asked here can be done, and should be done, without raising any question of a change in ownership.</P>
    <P>Here, perhaps, I might refer to another point that is sometimes put forward by those who profess to see a danger in these proposals.  The fact that the manager contributes a certain proportion of the cost of erection or up-keep of the building, it is said, establishes a legal claim which would confer on him a certain security in case a Government ever desired to take all control of education out of the hands of the Church&mdash;to establish a purely secular system and oust religion from the schools.  Now, every sane man knows that any legal claim thus established would not be worth a thraneen if the circumstances which are envisaged in the suggestion arose here.  If one could possibly visualise the advent of a Secularist or Communist Government here who were determined to take over the schools and oust the teaching of religion from the schools, does anyone think for a moment that <Col N="346" /> such a Government would allow a legal technicality like that to stand in their way?  They could pass an Act of Parliament in 24 hours that would wipe out every legal title and transfer every school in the country either to the State or to a local authority, and in that case, one of the strongest arguments that such a Government might put up would be the condition of the school buildings and premises. They might well make that the pretext for taking all control of education out of the hands of the managers.</P>
    <P>Little argument will be required to recommend the acceptance of the second portion of this motion.  To save me the necessity of reading them out, I have circulated to Senators some typical extracts regarding the condition of the schools, taken from the most recent reports of the county medical officers of health.</P>
    <P>These are by no means exhaustive, but I think they are sufficient to show that a state of affairs exists all over the country which constitutes a positive danger to the health and wellbeing of the community; and the question will arise, &ldquo;Are we going to allow that state of affairs to continue and, if not, where is the remedy to be found?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Medical Officer of Health for County Sligo has summed up the position very succinctly in the course of his report for 1939.  Here is what he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is such a mass of evidence accumulated to prove the evil effects on young children of unhealthy environment that no one can dispute it, yet for lack of funds, or inability on the part of managers to get from the controlling authority such funds as are available for urgent repairs, young children must according to the law receive their education under conditions decidedly injurious to their health.</P>
    <P>For at least nine years the school child must spend on an average six hours a day in school.  They are the most impressionable years of the lives of 90 per cent. of the children, and the influence of the school environment on the health, character <Col N="347" /> and future home of the school child cannot be over-estimated.  Surely then the school building should be designed to improve the health, leave a favourable impression and inculcate a healthy mode of living.</P>
    <P>The teachers alone suffer more than the children because they have to spend almost one-third of their lives in schools belonging to a bygone age. Only those who can adapt themselves to living and teaching under the most adverse conditions can hope to complete the school year with a clean bill of health.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In connection with the upkeep and maintenance of school buildings, the Department of Education have formulated certain rules and regulations, or rather they have carried them over from the old Commissioners' rules. Here is one of them:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Rule 49 (I).  &ldquo;The duty devolves upon the manager of making arrangements to ensure that each school under his charge is kept in proper repair, is properly furnished, that the internal walls are whitewashed or distempered as required, that at intervals the rooms are washed out with carbolic soap or other disinfectant, and that the school is made comfortable by being properly lighted, cleaned, ventilated and adequately heated in cold weather.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And here is another:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Rule 45 (5).  &ldquo;When the school premises are vested in trustees it is the duty of such trustees to keep the house, furniture, etc., in repair, and should the trustees fail to carry out their obligations in this matter the grants to the school may be suspended.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the Department may cease to pay the teachers' salaries. For they constitute 99 per cent. of the grants to schools.  If a manager for any reason fails or is unable to carry out the duties enjoined on him in these rules the only penalty which the Department are in a position to impose is the suspension of all grants to the school, which is just a euphemistic <Col N="348" /> way of saying, &ldquo;We'll no longer pay salaries to the teachers in that particular school.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I must not forget to mention that to enable the manager to carry out the onerous duty imposed on him, the State provides what is called a heating and cleaning grant.  The manager is expected in the first instance to find the necessary funds to supply fuel to the several schools in the parish, and to keep the school premises and out-offices in a clean and sanitary condition. When, several months later, he submits details of this expenditure, and supplies vouchers, etc., he may, if he manages to comply with all the complicated regulations governing the grant, receive a refund on the basis of £1 for each £1 expended, but only up to a certain limit, and that limit depends, strange to say, not on the number of rooms to be heated or their size and situation, nor on the extent or nature of the sanitary requirements, but on the number of pupils who attend the school.  In the vast majority of the schools, in the rural schools especially, the heating and cleaning grant is entirely inadequate, and there is ample evidence in the medical officers' reports that many schools are sorely wanting in regard to both heating and cleanliness.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I might say that a week or two ago, in the Dáil, the Minister informed Deputy Byrne (Junior) that the State grants were equal to one-half of the certified aid in cash or kind contributed locally.  If that statement is correct, then the regulations must have been changed very recently, because the official rule on the matter up to this year was, and as far as I know still is, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where aid is provided in kind, the total amount of the grant under all heads shall not exceed the total amount of cash expenditure incurred on the heating and cleaning services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms of the scheme, both by managers and teachers, was that allowance was not made for contributions in kind&mdash;turf or wood supplied by parents, for instance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> However, even if the present State grant were doubled or trebled, I hold that unless special machinery is created for its distribution on the basis of necessity things will remain unsatisfactory.  If these grants are made on the basis of attendance, or even in accordance with the size and number of rooms, etc., all sorts of inequalities will arise.  In some cases a grant arranged on any such basis will be more than what is required; in others it will not be nearly sufficient. There must be some local administrative machinery to see that each case is dealt with according to its needs, and my view is that the proper people to undertake this work, and to be held responsible for it, are the local public health authorities.</P>
    <P>Each year the medical officers of health furnish reports to the local health authorities on the condition of the schools in their area.  But the board of health can do nothing about it.  The owner of a private house which is declared to be dangerous or to be a nuisance and injurious to health can be compelled to remove or abate the nuisance and put the premises into a proper sanitary condition. If he fails or neglects to do so, the board can do the work itself and hold him responsible for the cost of doing it.  So far as I know, there is no such power in the case of a school &mdash;at least I have never known it to be exercised.  All that can be done is to obtain an order to close down a school, and while there have been threats of such closing in a few instances I have never known any case in which the health authorities actually carried out the threat.  No doubt the board would consider it a great hardship on a manager to do any such thing.</P>
    <P>My solution&mdash;the solution urged in this motion&mdash;is that the obligation now placed on the manager by Departmental regulation should be transferred by legislation to the public health authorities.  These should be charged with the duty of seeing that every national school in their area is kept in repair, that it is periodically painted or distempered, <Col N="350" /> that arrangements are made for adequately heating the rooms and cleaning and scrubbing the floors, that the playgrounds are drained and gravelled, and above all that the out-offices are regularly attended to and kept in a proper sanitary condition.  I want to make it clear that I do not attach any blame to the managers for the present unsatisfactory position in regard to the maintenance of these buildings.  I have said on many occasions elsewhere, and I say it now, that they have been saddled with an impossible burden.  Very many of them have made heroic efforts to discharge the obligations imposed on them, and for this they deserve the highest praise; but there is no use shutting our eyes to realities.  No one will get up here, or I expect elsewhere, and say that everything is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>There is more reason than ever now, not only for uneasiness in regard to this matter but for positive alarm, because of a dangerous and insidious enemy that has lately made its appearance in our midst.  I refer to that dread disease known as infantile paralysis.  This scourge has been, as you know, endemic in the United States for many years.</P>
    <P>I cannot say whether there is any connection between its appearance here at this juncture and the advent of thousands of American citizens to our shores.  Be that as it may, America has spent millions in fighting the disease and in research work in connection with it, but they have up to the present found no infallible remedy in the case of those whom it claims as victims.  They have, however, made some important discoveries in connection with it.  Up to three or four years ago it was believed that it was a respiratory disease, and that the source of infection and of transmission to others was through the nose and mouth&mdash;that persons sneezing or coughing transferred the virus to the surrounding atmosphere, whence it was breathed in by others to make its way through the nasal passages to the brain.  That was the accepted theory until quite lately.  Now it has been <Col N="351" /> definitely established that the virus is contained in the bowel discharges of infected persons, and this to a much greater extent&mdash;more than twice the extent, it has been stated&mdash;than in the respiratory organs.  It has further been established that flies coming in contact with these discharges can transfer the infection to human beings.</P>
    <P>The medical experts were for long puzzled over the fact that the incidence of this disease was much greater in villages, small towns, and rural areas than in large centres of population. Here was the probable solution. Sanitary conditions in the large cities are less liable to constitute a source of infection in the manner referred to than in the more backward places. Relate all this to the sanitary conditions in our rural schools, and we at once realise the gravity of the danger with which we are faced.</P>
    <P>Think of the open pits cleared out, at best once a year, at worst at intervals of several years or not at all.  Think, too, of the want of sanitary convenience in 99 per cent. of our farm houses and rural cottages, and of the carelessness of people in such matters.  Only then will we realise how little prospect there is of permanently stamping out this dread disease.  Where America, first in the world, I would say, in matters of sanitation, has failed, what hope have we who are so blissfully indifferent and neglectful in these matters? I feel that our people do not realise the extent of the danger facing them.  I doubt if the health authorities themselves realise it.  I believe that such public announcements as have been issued from time to time have lulled the public into a false sense of security and relief&mdash;I would be sorry to think that this was deliberate.  We are told the number of deaths.  How many have made a complete recovery, or how many of those attacked are fated to live on for years as helpless cripples? Little has been said of the abortive form of the disease&mdash;practically indistinguishable from an attack of influenza or a common cold.  These attacks may be thrown off without leaving any ill-effects, and without developing any paralytic symptom; but <Col N="352" /> nevertheless the person so affected may be an unconscious carrier of the virus of the disease, and a source of infection for others&mdash;infection which may develop into the worst form of the disease.  We have an enemy in our midst that we may not get rid of for many a long day.  I fear that unless drastic measures are adopted this dread plague will affect increasing numbers of our population.  That is why I think the proposal in this motion is so terribly urgent.</P>
    <P>I dread to think of what may happen next summer when the ubiquitous fly is again on the move.  I believe we could face an armed invasion with greater chance of success and with less latent danger to our people.  I am, therefore, much more concerned about the second proposition in this motion than the first, because the danger that I foresee is imminent.</P>
    <P>Even if everything I ask here is done, and done without delay, it will not, I fear, rid us entirely of this plague, but it is the first obvious and most urgent step by way of limiting the incidence of the disease, and it is equally obvious that it is only through the machinery of our public health authorities that the danger can be adequately tackled. It must, of course, be accompanied by a widespread campaign to educate the public as to the danger, and the steps they can take to lessen and prevent its spread.  I ask Senators, therefore, to join with us in urging as firmly and strongly as they can the acceptance and the immediate implementing of this motion by the Government.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Connell has given a very clear and explicit explanation of the conditions obtaining in our national schools, and has made a very forcible plea for his motion.  I must, however, honestly say that I feel there is no great demand from either managers or the public for the implementation of this motion and the carrying out of the suggestions which Senator O'Connell has made. The whole demand has come from the <Col N="353" /> teachers.  The Department, to my mind, are doing practically all that the motion suggests should be done, but Senator O'Connell wants to go the whole hog.  He wants to strip both managers and the people of any particle of responsibility which they may have for the maintenance and erection of schools at the present time.  Senator O'Connell asked Senators to visualise what happens when a demand is made by a local school manager for a grant for building or reconstruction of schools.  I shall give the House and Senator O'Connell an example of what happened in the parish in which I live. In that parish we had three very dilapidated schools.  We had for some years very aged managers and nothing was done to the schools.  They were allowed to get into a very bad state of repair.  Some five or six years ago &mdash;I think it was in 1936&mdash;a young, energetic curate came to the parish and the manager asked him to take up the question of the reconstruction and renovation of the schools.  He first called in an architect, got the schools examined and an estimate for the rebuilding of one school and the reconstruction of two others.  After receiving the estimate, he called the parishioners together.  It was the blackest year of the economic war, a year in which neither the farmers nor the agricultural workers had much money.  The wages of agricultural workers at the time were in many cases less than £1 per week.  Senators can therefore see that no parish in the West of Ireland at the present time could be in a worse position to meet a charge for building or reconstructing schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After that meeting it was proposed that as no big subscriptions could be got from anybody, there should be a weekly collection of 3d. from every household.  That suggestion was agreed to and collectors were appointed.  In a little over a year the whole amount required for the building of one school and the reconstruction of two others was collected. There were no playgrounds attached to the schools, but local landowners gave an acre of ground as a free gift to the manager for playgrounds in the case of two of the schools and the Land <Col N="354" /> Commission gave an acre for the third school.  The position as Senator O'Connell correctly stated is that in all cases three-fourths of the cost is subscribed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two-thirds of the cost and, in some cases, five-sixths of the cost is given by the Department. In fact in some cases seven-eighths or the whole of the cost is given.  If that is so, I cannot see why such a small amount as one-eighth, one-sixth or one-third, as the case may be, cannot be subscribed by the parish.  What we have done in our parish can be done in every parish in the country where the manager will carry out his job.  I think the Minister will agree, if he makes inquiries, that in our parish we have three up-to-date schools, schools as good as anybody wishes to find in rural parts, built at very little cost to the people.  The people are very proud of these schools and they want to keep them as their own property.  They are proud of their property and they do not want to hand them over to another party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have even greater objection to the second portion of the motion in which the Senator suggests that the responsibility for heating and decoration of the schools should be handed over to the public health authority.  We all know what it would cost.  It means that the local rate-payers will be taxed for that, taxed to four times the extent the work would cost if done under the present conditions.  We all know that when repairs such as the putting on of a slate is done by a public authority, it costs ten times as much as if it were done by the local handyman.</P>
      <P>In that case the parishioners of different schools districts would be taxing themselves unnecessarily for something they could get done at one-fourth of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Connell that <Col N="355" /> there are many schools a disgrace to the public, to the parish, and to the manager, but I suggest to him and his colleagues that they devise some means whereby managers who are lax in performing their duties would be made perform them, or whereby authority could be taken from those managers who neglect their duties to the alarming extent that the Senator has mentioned. That would be a much more sensible way to attack the question of proper sanitary and other accommodation. The Senator has suggested that the State and the local authority should take over the responsibility, but I do not think the country is very anxious to change the present system. Probably it would mean getting in the thin end of the wedge, to oust the managerial system and the authority of the local people in the ownership of their schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment Senator O'Connell on his great industry and the orderly manner in which he made his case to the House. It is a very good example for all of us in any work we have to do here; it shows us the value of having in this Assembly, on a subject like this, a man who really understands it, and who can approach it, not in a narrow way, but&mdash;looking at the whole broad subject and the vastness of the problem&mdash; in the only possible way in which it can be approached and solved.  We must be clear in our minds as to our aim in this matter of education.  This is the sort of subject about which we can have a free and frank discussion which need not arouse any Party feeling. We should have a sound basis on which to carry out our plans for the future.  The Minister for Education and the thoughtful people in the country who want to do the right thing for education and by our educators should be clear as to the aim and how it is to be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said here before that, if I were asked as to the first thing I would like to give the children of this country, I would answer &ldquo;good <Col N="356" /> health&rdquo;.  That is the first thing&mdash; sound bodies with, of course, a clear understanding that they have souls to save.  If that is a commendable aim, we have to look at the whole problem of education from that angle.  I am satisfied that the problem never yet has been approached from that point of view.  If it had been, we would not have this unsolved problem to-day. One is not to find fault with the present Minister for Education or with any of his predecessors.  This is a heritage of the past.  Naturally, it is only just now that we are getting clear of the fogs and mists that have fallen over our own minds about this whole matter of our school buildings.  It is time we got clear and time we moved faster.  I would have hoped that the present Minister would be somewhat more revolutionary about it.  He has had a grand opportunity, and it is time that we should be much more forward.</P>
    <P>We came into possession of schools that were nothing better than hedge schools.  We accepted, in greater part, the traditions passed down from the old Board of Education.  We changed the methods and altered the school programmes.  We changed a considerable number of the subjects but left many of them as they were.  Senator Counihan looks at what could be done about school buildings in a very prosperous parish in County Dublin, with its magnificent land and its very well-off people, even in the days of the economic war, when he told us frequently that he was a poverty stricken man himself.  He told us now what could be done in a rural parish where local land-owners could hand away a good acre of lovely land to become playgrounds for schools, and where you could get three such landowners in the parish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two; the Land Commission gave one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was the manager who gave one.  However, I am thinking of the generosity of these landowners.  Surely that is not typical of the Twenty-Six Counties?  It strikes me that he was a strange economist who determined that every house- <Col N="357" /> holder in this parish was in an equal position to pay 3d. per week.  I do not see how it was that Senator Counihan could pay only the same contribution as was paid by his workman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, that was the scheme the parishioners planned. I think there was a good deal of Communism in it; there was rather a Socialist approach to the whole problem.  They seemed to think that each householder had equal responsibilities. It seems to me that we must look at the country as we find it. There is no need to stress the situation with which the Minister made us acquainted recently, when I raised this matter here in reference to the conditions in my own county.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Connell has kindly circulated a report giving a picture of the position generally and the problem to be faced.  There are two questions raised.  The first is that the State should erect these schools.  Senator O'Connell has outlined the present scheme and has pointed out very effectively the arguments against it. There are parishes where the present scheme is in operation but, even in the comfortable parishes, there is a great deal of haggling before you can get the school built.  You may get a school built which is most needed and which serves the greatest number of children and where it is most obvious to the eye of the traveller; but in the very same parish there are more remote schools which, as I said here before, are not habitable for the animals belonging to the men who send children to the schools.  That is the difficulty about the present plan of the Department.  If the Government had a plan to make available, in a particular year, as much money as would build all these schools, I do not think Senator O'Connell or any of us would mind in what fashion this money was dispensed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But this scheme as at present administered has been going on over the years, always leaving us with a residue <Col N="358" /> of bad schools and, mind you, bad schools, very frequently with good teachers, while, perhaps, only a couple of miles away there is a new school which makes the old one look more odious in comparison.  So far as we can judge from the Minister's policy, his methods are not going to be changed.  That is not satisfactory and cannot be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that in many parishes an impossible problem is set to the managers.  I have come into contact with managers who made visits to the Department in Dublin at their own expense&mdash;some of them old men&mdash; and saw them going home very disconsolately to impoverished conditions. They will tell you: &ldquo;How can I go to the people?  You know their conditions &mdash;they have not the money.  I have no halls to help to raise the money, and even if I had, a great many of the people have not got it, and those who are the poorest are the people with children to send to the schools.&rdquo;  There are inequities in a situation like that which no manager can overcome, and, as far as I can see the problem ahead of us, a new method must be devised if our aim is to give the country the new schools it requires.  We ought to give the country all the new schools it needs within two years, and the total cost, as the Minister has stated, could be borrowed at 1 per cent.  It would not be an extravagant demand, if you look at the return from the angle of the benefit it would confer on the health of the future citizens of the State.  I believe that the value would really be incalculable.  It would be much better to spend capital investments on new schools than to put money into new hospitals to house some of the children who would probably have had seated in their young frames the germs of diseases that would only become obvious in later life.</P>
    <P>Most of us are familiar with conditions in the schools of to-day.  Senator O'Connell did not say everything about them, and neither did Senator Counihan.  We know that young children have to sweep and clean out those schools because there is no proper provision made for it, although there <Col N="359" /> is evidence of tuberculosis and malnutrition. We are aware of that from the reports of the medical officers of health.  Young children&mdash;some of them not too comfortably clad nor too wellfed&mdash;are attending these schools, and, perhaps, late in the afternoon when they are tired out, they are most susceptible to picking up germs when cleaning the schools for the morning. No one can regard that as a satisfactory condition of things.  There is also the problem of the badly-maintained schools.  You may have children leaving a tolerably airy house to go to a badly ventilated school.  Within an hour, they have used up more of their energy than other children, accustomed to these conditions, would use in half a day.</P>
    <P>Further, the planning of our schools has not, I think, been given the consideration it deserves.  Senator O'Connell referred to what we might call the sanitary conditions of our schools.  They are really dreadful, and I wish Senator Counihan would go to see them for himself.  He tells us about these schools in Dublin, but he ought to go to see some of the schools in the country.  I know what they are like.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Conditions in the schools I saw are as perfect as they can be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Every school in the country ought to have a water supply attached to the sanitary arrangements in such a way that they would not be in the abominable condition we now find them.  Apparently, in fact, no one can be made responsible and again, on that matter of a water supply, conditions in some of our rural schools are appalling.  Children get thirsty during the day&mdash;I remember being like that.  We had to go practically a mile to get a can of water and carry it back to the school when ten gallons would be required instead of a four-quart can.  I do not know if things have changed very much since then.  How many of us can cast our minds back and recall what conditions were like in our early youth?  We could, nowadays, <Col N="360" /> in our late youth, or early middle age, see how much arrangements have changed, or ask the teachers what conditions are like to-day.  In a great many places I know they have not changed.  We are building new schools without completing the job.  We should keep the complete health of the children in mind.</P>
      <P>My view is that the State ought to provide the money&mdash;no one can provide it as cheaply or in the same orderly way.  I do not think it is a job for the managers going around to their parishioners.  There are, of course, parishes where money is more easily obtained than others, yet in the fertile fields of Meath you will find schools as in Connemara where a considerable amount would have to be spent to put them into proper condition. Looking at it from any angle, I cannot imagine managers having any objection to the provision of suitable schools for the coming generations.  I believe it is essential that the State should do it, because the old system is unworkable in a great many parishes, particularly in the poorer parts of the country.  In the poorer parts of the country in other days we had a greater number of children going to school and the heavier burden was accordingly imposed on the parents if they were to fit into the Government's scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is partly the problem as I see it in connection with the erection of school buildings.  Under present conditions and policy, it will take us too long to get the new schools we require. From the point of view of the lowest grade of society in this country, it is terribly important that the children should go into buildings that would be pleasant to look at.  If children are going into what looks rather like a nice home to which they do not belong, I am convinced that they look and wonder how they should behave.  They begin to think of their feet&mdash;a relic of the old Eastern custom of leaving shoes at the door.  That is due to some peculiar sensitiveness which reaches the minds of children.  If the children are going into a proper building that can be maintained properly, it is much easier to inculcate habits of cleanliness. <Col N="361" /> You have nothing but a picture displeasing to the eye.  It does not matter so much about the children's hands or their boots or anything else.  The point is that we are going to improve the standard of our people as a whole. We have an obligation to try to raise up the most lowly in that matter.  It is much better to start by bringing them into pleasant buildings, where the walls are pleasant to the eye, where you could have pictures for them to look at, so that there would be something attractive for the children to see when they raise their eyes from their desks.  I think that the good effects of doing this on the children would be immense, and the teachers would not have to take them out two or three times a week to tidy their person, as has been the case in some schools.</P>
    <P>I would like to make another point because I am aware of the fact that in parts of my county anyway this is a very serious problem.  Senator O'Connell talks in the latter part of his motion about the upkeep of school buildings and premises, including repairs, heating, lighting, cleaning and sanitation.  In the matter of the heating of schools I think there are different customs in different parts of the country but I know that the heating of schools now in parts of the country is for the teachers and the parents a very dreadful problem.  I travelled up by bus to-day and behind me were people from my own county. The story they told me about conditions in part of my county&mdash;a part which runs between the town of Coote-hill and the town of Cavan&mdash;in regard to the fuel problem was really rather dreadful.  There is no turf bog within miles of this area I speak of.  They imported coal in the old days.  Even in most of my county where we have bogs half of the turf crop was not saved.  There is very little timber. Even in the homes of the children of that area at present the problem of fuel and of cooking is awful.  The teachers in that area urge the children to provide fuel for the schools; either to take some with them or to provide the money for the fuel.  The situation is that the children have not got the fuel to take with them and when they <Col N="362" /> subscribe the money the fuel cannot be purchased because it is not available. I urge that the Minister should take note of this problem, investigate it and see how far it is representative of conditions over a fairly wide area of the country&mdash;probably not in my county alone but other parts of the country.  I imagine it would be true of County Monaghan, partly anyway of Leitrim, and across the Midlands over to the Minister's own part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are asking local authorities to do certain things in this matter.  Our county council offices, our courthouses, our hospitals, our committees of agriculture and vocational schools are not without heating.  Why?  It may be that the cost was high, but anyhow the heating was provided for the local authorities, but it was nobody's job to do it for the schools.  It was just left to the fates.  The schools are without heating, and I am afraid are going to be without heating during this winter. The winter has not been very severe yet, but who knows what the months to come may bring.  I shudder to think what might be the results in many parts of the country in the schools where some of the children may be rather badly nourished and with no heating for weeks or months.  That is a situation that ought not be permitted to develop.  If the responsibility was on somebody to do something about this other than the rather scattered responsibility that exists at the moment a situation like that could not possibly develop.  I think we ought to face up to this problem in a new way, not in the kind of haggling bargaining way we have been accustomed to in the past, but to face it as a nation with faith in itself, with hope in the future, and with a conviction that it wants its new citizens to be brought up to life within its confines strong and vigorous in body and healthy and free in mind, to give them something that they can pass on to others that will come after them.  You are not going to do that if your policy is to be a narrow haggling bargaining method concerning a few thousand or even a few million pounds.</P>
    <P>This land is worth a good deal to us if it is worth anything.  It is worth <Col N="363" /> many hundreds of millions of pounds. We ought to take care that if we are going to pass something on that we will not pass it on to a generation much more decrepit than we are.  I think the Minister should take his courage in his hands.  I know he may say that we have not got the materials, but I know schools in my own county with quarries situated so close to them that you could throw the stones from the quarries on to the sites of the schools. We ought to try to adjust ourselves to the prevailing conditions.  Schools were built in this country in the old days and magnificent work in stone was done in this country 100 years ago or earlier.  I think that it is rather a tragedy that that art should be lost. Throughout the country you can see the magnificent bridges that were built under our railways.</P>
    <P>I think that the old art should not be lost.  I recognise that there are difficulties concerning timber, but I think we could get over the difficulties if we only had a definite policy and put it into effect.  I do not subscribe at all to the point of view that because materials are unprocurable we need do nothing.  We have a certain number of people unemployed, and I think a great number of the people in the building trade could be put to the building of schools and to doing the stone work.  There are methods by which we could cover the schools too. In earlier days we covered buildings very well in this country.  I think the Minister ought not to be frightened by the problem which is obviously deterring his Ministry from doing a good number of things that ought to be done &mdash;the problem of where the money is going to be got; what it is going to cost.  I think the Minister, like a good many of us, has had valuable education on that in the last two or three years. We have money in the country and we have credit and it would be to our credit if we used that money to give us new and more beautiful schools because we will have better men and women as a result of it.</P>

      <P>To a regrettably small House, Senator O'Connell has <Col N="364" /> made a most valuable and enlightened statement.  We all feel that the future of the race largely depends upon the conditions under which children spend their years of education.  This State has adopted the principle of compulsory school attendance and we accepted the principle which tightened that up in the School Attendance Act of this year.  That places upon us an obligation to see that children should not be forced to spend their years in schools that are a menace to their health and under sanitary conditions that are deplorable.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Connell must have startled some Senators by his description of the state of some of the schools, but he did not startle others of us because the reports of the medical officers of health and inspectors had brought home to us the necessity for doing something in this connection.  Having said that, I regret that the attempted approach to this subject has been through the medium of a motion in this House.  I do not think that that is the proper way to approach this subject at all. Why do I say that?  Because the proposal in this motion, portions of which appeal to all of us, involves new principles.  These may give rise to suspicions which Senator O'Connell has endeavoured to meet.  At all events, the motion would need to be discussed with the other parties concerned&mdash;those who may look upon themselves as having vested rights and vested duties which are more important than rights.  Though we are all agreed that something must be done to get rid of insanitary schools and to see that the children whom we compel to attend school do not imperil their health and their future by so doing, the approach should have been by way of asking the Department of Education to bring together the managers of the schools, the trustees in whom the schools are vested and representatives of the teachers.  In this way, some agreement could be arrived at which would solve the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter was not quite fair to the Minister in suggesting that this was a matter of money.  The difficulty is not entirely a matter of money. <Col N="365" /> The Department will, I am sure, be as generous as possible, but the proposals in this motion are, in a way, revolutionary.  They should not be pressed without our having heard the other side&mdash;that is to say, the managers' side, the Bishops' side and the trustees' side.  That is, I think, important. We all want what Senator O'Connell wants.  We are all shocked at the revelations about the schools, and we are all anxious to remedy that position, but it is for us to consider whether the passing of a motion in this House, which shows want of interest in the matter, is the way to approach the difficulty.</P>

      <P>The last speaker impressed me by the suggestion she made. If such a conference as the suggested between managers, the Education Department and representatives of parents and teachers could be secured, a settlement of this question might be arrived at.  It is the duty of the State to protect the family and, in the protection of the family, the child will get its meed of protection.  Paragraphs of the Constitution state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The State recognises the Family as the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.  The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
      <P>The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State, or to any particular type of school designated by the State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State has a very important duty to the children and, if that duty is not being performed from other quarters, it is for the State to see to it.  Senator Counihan spoke of the work done in his county.  I could contrast with that the want and absence of work in other counties as wealthy and as prosperous as the county referred to by Senator <Col N="366" /> Counihan.  As a result of years of hagling, even though the education authorities offered as much as £6,000, negotiations have gone on for seven or eight years&mdash;seven or eight years of penalty upon the large group of children accommodated in that school.</P>
    <P>Nothing has yet been done.  I know of a case where haggling has gone on for as long as 17 years and nothing has been done.  I have in mind an old school, built after the Education Act came into force in 1832.  Haggling was going on in connection with that school for almost 30 years.  During most of that period, in a building 40 by 20, providing 4 or 5 sq. ft. for every child, three teachers were compelled to squeeze themselves into a corner of a room to make room for the children. That went on for about 27 years.  Even where the Department are willing to make the grants, delays are continually occurring and that state of affairs will continue as long as the present system lasts.  In one case, the report of the medical officer of health, made in 1937, condemned the location, the approach, the overcrowded condition, the playing space and the evidence of dampness in the rooms.  Yet, nothing has been done.  The Department are prepared in that case to advance £6,000 as their quota to the cost of the building. The conditions are appalling.  The school, the report states, is situate in a back lane, is unhygienic, insanitary, a nuisance to the public health and a danger.  The location is in a slum area. I suppose we must have schools convenient to slum areas, but this is a case where the removal of the school from the slum area would make very little difference in the journey imposed upon the children.  Within about 100 yards of the present school, there are excellent sites.  The cloakroom was not ventilated, says the report, and was damp, lighting insufficient and walls showing large signs of dampness.  It is interesting to note that the same applied to schools in the course of the medical officer's report.  One portion of the building he describes as a dance hall.  The school not having sufficient room in its present building, they selected a dance hall convenient to the school as a section of it.  This was <Col N="367" /> never intended for day work.  You all know that dance halls are utilised at night and the lighting in this room was entirely unsuitable.  Another portion was called the cardroom of the building which was adjacent.  It was used as a schoolroom by day and for a game of cards at night.  I could add very much to the number of examples. Senator O'Connell referred to one that was taken over, I understand, practically by the Department.  We want to give the child good health.  If we want to do justice to the Constitution, I think immediate steps should be taken in this matter.</P>
    <P>Recently a report was handed to me of the returns from 35 schools which were investigated.  Of those, to 35 fuel was supplied, but in 23 of the schools there was no provision made for its utilisation.  There was nothing for kindling.  It happened to be a turf area and I do not know how they got the turf, possibly it was presented by parents.  A heap of bad turf was thrown up convenient to the school, but no provision was made for lighting. In only six out of the 35 schools was there any provision made for periodical washing.  Some of these schools I understand may not have been washed for years and in only six of them was any provision made by the managers. We could continue for hours speaking of the number of these requiring treatment but where is the money to come from?  Where is the money coming from presently?  The State advances a certain portion and the taxpayers advance the rest.  Who are these people who contribute the money but taxpayers?  Why not extend the system and let us put it on the taxpayers until this great evil, this national disgrace is moved from us? Senator Counihan says that this would mean stripping the managers of every vestige of their authority.  That is not so.  I think it was Senator O'Connell who made that amply clear.  If Senator Counihan had been listening he would not have made that statement.  There are non-vested schools and vested schools&mdash;schools vested in the State. That does not strip the managers of their authority.  If there was any suggestion <Col N="368" /> that this process might take place under a new Government then provision could have been made to give ample assurance to the managers that such would not take place.  Of course anything can take place by a stroke of a pen in an Act of Parliament. I do not see what safety the managers have at present more than they would have by vesting the schools in the State and letting the State control the schools.  There are other schools vested in the State, the technical schools.  Much money has been spent on these institutions.  Side by side with the technical school we may see a national school accommodating three or four or five times the number of students.  The technical schools are cared for by the State and lighted by the State and vested in the State. There does not seem to be any great cause for complaint.</P>
    <P>One Senator said that there was no demand from any source except from the teachers.  The teachers have been making demands all their lives not alone in their own interest but in the interest of the pupils.  Everybody knows that the result of their efforts is to some extent the important additions that have been made in many schools.  I should not pass here without complimenting many of the managers who have at considerable trouble put up almost perfect schools and who are heating and lighting them.  These are models.  There are many of these but there are others who, perhaps through no fault of their own, living in poverty-stricken areas, cannot make the necessary provision.  No matter what grant the State may make it will always be insufficient.  We should have something on the style of the technical school committees, that would give an assurance to the managers that a local rate, and by no means heavy local rate, would be made to maintain schools.  I urge the Minister not to counter this by a lot of enormous documents in the true stereotyped office manner, but to put his hand on his heart and say to those people who have spoken that he is not going to continue his inhumanity in respect of the schools.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with the motion, although I did not hear Senator O'Connell's speech.  It would be a very unwise step for the Government to defray the whole cost of heating and maintaining these schools.  The amount that falls on local people is very small, but it represents the very big principle that the local people should retain some share of responsibility in primary education.  They cannot maintain their interest in it unless they make some contribution towards the financing of it.  The cost that falls on the local people I believe is very small.  It is a good argument in favour of the motion to say that the schools are being neglected, and that, despite the fact that the Department is willing to give large grants, it is often hard to raise the money locally. The schools are, therefore, neglected. But if the Department wishes they can force the local people to take action and build new schools by refusing the grant in respect of the teachers.  In that way if the Department desires it can compel new schools to be built wherever necessary, and can insist on schools being properly maintained. The Government by taking over the whole charge would be taking one step in the process of secularisation, which has gone too far.  It would be time we took a step in the opposite direction. No doubt the new schools are very useful from the point of view of providing accommodation, but I think they are not much better from the point of view of architecture.</P>
      <P>From an architectural point of view they are not very much to look at. After all, the aspect of the building has an important influence on the child mind and the Department would be very wise to see whether they can improve the outer appearance of new school buildings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad Senator O'Connell has raised this question if for no other reason than that it enables me to bring to the Minister's notice the condition of the national schools in the parish in which I reside, namely, the schools in Finglas and St. Margaret's.  Both of the schools have been condemned and are unfit for any <Col N="370" /> child to enter.  The school in Finglas is badly lighted.  There is no sanitary accommodation, the result being that all people in the locality who can afford to do so, are sending their children to other schools.  My own boys have never entered the school, and even if there were no alternative school, they would never enter it.  In that case, there is a bus service which enables people to send their children to other schools in town.  In that case also the difficulty which Senator O'Connell has mentioned does not arise inasmuch as the local people have done their duty. The parish priest has secured a site for a new school, but despite that fact, the old hovel is still retained there. The position in the other portion of the parish is somewhat different because there are no funds.  I do say something should be done in the case of the Finglas school to provide a new building.  The Department, I understand, has offered to give a very generous grant and whoever is responsible for the delay, it is a great disgrace. I am not blaming the Department because I feel they have done their duty, but I would appeal to the Minister to take some steps to make whoever is responsible proceed with the erection of a new school.  As a matter of fact, on last Sunday the parish priest denounced every public representative in the country who was not prepared to take the necessary action to remove such a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to do everything in his power to provide proper schools for the country.  There are several hundreds, I understand, of these unsuitable schools.  With regard to what Senator O'Dwyer has stated about the desirability of recovering a certain portion of the expense from the local people, are not all the local people taxpayers, and if the necessary funds were provided by the State, would the money not come from the same source in the end?  Where is the difference?  Certainly, the vocational schools all over the country are practically model schools, and for the sake of the small amount it would take out of the local rates, I do think it would be a step in the right <Col N="371" /> direction to provide for these expenses out of some central fund.  I, of course, approve by all means of leaving control in the hands of the present managers.</P>
