      <P>Before taking up the business on the Order Paper to-day, I should mention that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is unwell and will be unable to attend to-day.  As there is every probability that the House will be sitting to-morrow, I think it would be better if the Committee Stage of the Water Supplies Bill were deferred until then and, if the Parliamentary Secretary is still unable to attend on that day, the Committee Stage can be postponed to the next meeting of the House.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>In regard to item No. 6&mdash;the motion in the name of Senator Michael Hayes&mdash;it has been represented to me, on the understanding also that the House will be meeting to-morrow, that the House should agree now not to take that motion until to-morrow.  A definite understanding to that end now will facilitate arrangements.  May I take it there is agreement to that suggestion?</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>In connection with Item No. 4, that is, the motion for the annulment of Emergency Powers (No. 98) Order, the House will recall that when the motion was under debate on the last day on which the House sat the debate was adjourned for the purpose of seeing an amending order before the debate was resumed.  I have been given to understand that the Minister for Finance, who is now present, is desirous of making a statement before the debate is resumed, and that <Col N="142" /> it will suit his convenience if the House would be agreeable to taking that statement as first business to-day.</P>
      <P>Subsequent proceedings on the motion can be reviewed when the House has heard the Minister's statement. I presume there is no objection to that course.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>I have received notice from Senator Baxter that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House this evening, he will direct attention to the making of the order prohibiting the export of store cattle to Britain, and will inquire of the Minister for Agriculture the motive or necessity for the imposition of such an order; and, further, will ask for information as to how long the order is to be in operation, or when it is likely to be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I have to thank you, A Chathaoirligh, and the House for giving me an opportunity to make a statement with regard to the amendments that I propose to make in this Emergency Powers Order, dealing with compensation for personal injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will remember that when, before Christmas, this matter was before the Seanad, I undertook to reconsider the provisions of the personal injuries scheme, having regard to the views expressed in the course of the <Col N="143" /> discussion here.  I have reviewed the provisions of the order and have gone into the criticisms offered in this House.  I have tried, in so far as it was possible for me to do, to meet&mdash;I think I have met to a not inconsiderable extent&mdash;the principal, but not all, of the criticisms which were offered. Everybody will agree that it is not possible to frame any estimate of the total cost of compensation with which the Exchequer may be faced as a result of the present emergency.</P>
    <P>However, I have decided, in the light of the representations made as to the general inadequacy, in present circumstances, of compensation based almost entirely on the Workmen's Compensation Act scale, at any rate where there are dependents, to take some measure of risk and to revise the scheme to provide for allowances in respect of the dependents of disabled earners and also for allowances instead of lump sums in fatal cases, where the dependency is total or almost entirely so.  I do not propose to make awards of compensation in respect of the dependents of deceased non-earners unless necessitous circumstances are established.  As regards partial dependency, which is, of course, a matter of degree, and in many cases might be trifling.  I could not undertake to pay continuing allowances, and I propose that partial dependency in fatal cases shall be dealt with on a lump sum basis where the merits of the case are established, and that any such grants shall be measured by Workmen's Compensation Act standards.  I cannot undertake to make payments in respect of persons who have been only partially dependent on an injured person who is himself in receipt of compensation.  I have arranged for the preparation of a new order accordingly.</P>
    <P>As regards categories of dependents, I propose to adhere to members of the injured or deceased person's family as defined in Part III of the original scheme, that is, father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, step-father, stepmother, son, daughter, grandson, <Col N="144" /> grand-daughter, stepson, step-daughter, brother, sister, half-brother and half-sister, a pretty wide circle.  In addition, to meet the plea put forward by Senator Hayes on behalf of the adopted child, I propose to include a child in respect of whom the injured or deceased person had placed himself or herself <i>in loco parentis.</i>  Instead of adhering to the limit of 15 years applicable to juvenile dependency laid down in the Workmen's Compensation Act, I have decided that allowances in respect of children will be payable up to the age of 18 years unless they are prevented by physical or mental infirmity from supporting themselves, when they will continue to be payable up to the age of 70 years.</P>
    <P>I propose also in the case of disablement awards to provide for an allowance for the housekeeper of a widower or widow residing with him or her to look after the dependents.  Senator Hayes put in a plea also for dependent aunts or uncles.  I am afraid I cannot meet him in this; I think I have gone as far as could reasonably be expected in the matter of providing for dependents having regard to the unlimited liability we are undertaking.  Of course if an aunt were called in she would be entitled to the allowance set out in the case of a housekeeper looking after dependents.</P>
    <P>With regard to the rates of allowances, the suggestion was made that regard should be had to earning capacity.  In considering the suggestion it has to be borne in mind that corresponding compensation schemes have to be provided for members of the A.R.P., the Local Defence Force and the Local Security Force services, and it will be appreciated that it would be difficult&mdash;indeed it would be practically out of the question&mdash;to frame schemes covering organisations comprising all classes of society but rendering common services to the State which would have the effect of providing compensation for the members by reference to their own widely varying incomes.  Apart altogether from this aspect of the matter, it is not possible to ignore the potential burden upon the State of compensation <Col N="145" /> payments.  The fact is that we do not know where we stand in the matter of compensation.  We have so far been fortunate in that incidents giving rise to claims have been few, but the future is highly uncertain, and it is incumbent upon the Minister for Finance, so far as is in his power, to proceed on the basis of what the State can reasonably be expected to afford, should further incidents occur.</P>
    <P>We cannot, moreover, ignore the possibility that in spite of all our efforts to maintain our neutrality we may find ourselves embroiled in the war, with a resultant very heavy bill for compensation not only in respect of personal injuries, but also in respect of property, and it may be taken that if we were to adopt now, because of the fewness of bombing and other incidents of the kind, somewhat liberal schemes of compensation in which due allowance for earning capacity was made, it would be impossible to introduce less liberal schemes later, merely because a new set of circumstances had arisen. In short, as Minister for Finance, I cannot ignore the contingency of damage to property and of death and injury, on a wholesale scale, resulting in an enormous total liability for compensation.</P>
    <P>While British policy in the matter of compensation need not perhaps be regarded as particularly relevant to what we may elect to do here&mdash;though one or two speakers here and one speaker in the Dáil thought that we ought to have British rates of compensation in mind in drafting our own scheme&mdash;it is worthy of note as bearing on the question of earning capacity that the British personal injuries scheme for civilians, which covers also members of civil defence organisations, provides that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The degree of disablement caused to a person by a qualifying injury... shall be assessed by making a comparison between the condition of disablement caused to that person by that injury... and the condition of a normal healthy person of the same age and sex without taking into account the earning capacity <Col N="146" /> of the disabled person in his own or in any other specific trade or occupation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, felt constrained, while making additional provision for dependents, to adhere, in the case of disabled men or women who are earners, to the maximum of 30/- a week provided for in the original scheme. This is the Workmen's Compensation Act maximum and I am aware that some Seanadóirí do not view it with favour, but I am satisfied that I could not, the situation being so uncertain as it is, with prudence provide for a more liberal rate where there are no dependents. For earners under 18 years of age the maximum rate will be 15/- a week.  For non-earners over 18 years of age the maximum rate will be 18/- a week, and for non-earners under 18 years of age 9/- a week.  As regards the dependents of disabled persons, I propose that allowances shall be paid at the following maximum rates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In respect of dependent wife or husband or in respect of any female person residing with a widow or widower for the purpose of having the care of his children&mdash;7/6 a week.</P>
    <P>In respect of each dependent other than husband or wife&mdash;4/- a week.</P>
    <P>Disablement allowances will be reducible by reference to the percentage degree of disability.</P>
    <P>In the case of fatal injuries I propose allowances as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>For a widow over 45 years of age or, if under that age, in receipt of an allowance in respect of a dependent, or incapable of earning&mdash;18/- a week.</P>
    <P>For a widow under 45 years of age not in receipt of an allowance in respect of a dependent and capable of earning&mdash;12/6 a week.</P>
    <P>For a widower dependent on deceased wife and incapable of earning&mdash;18/- a week.</P>
    <P>In respect of dependents while living with a widow or widower 5/- a week and after the death of the widow or widower&mdash;7/6 a week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> For dependents of an unmarried man or widower or of an unmarried woman or widow&mdash;7/6 a week.</P>
    <P>The widow's allowance would cease on re-marriage and an allowance in respect of any other female dependent would cease on marriage.</P>
    <P>Various other points regarding the scheme were raised in the last debate, and, as promised, I have looked further into the issues raised.  In the light of the views expressed in the course of discussion regarding possible payments by employers in respect of disabled persons, I have decided that any such payments shall be disregarded in computing the amount of compensation to be paid under the scheme, save, of course, in so far as persons remunerated from public moneys are concerned, where, under the terms of their employment, special arrangements in regard to injury pay may be applied.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Hayes and Senator Douglas on article 8 (5) of the original scheme, it is now intended to regard any injured child up to the age of 18 who is not an earner as a non-earner for the purposes of the scheme and disablement allowance will therefore be payable in respect of young children.  Senator Hayes drew attention also to article 21 of the scheme, which provided for the withholding of grants in respect of dependents who died before an award was made.  That article was based on an exactly corresponding provision in Section 18 (4) of the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934, but as I have now decided to depart from the lines of that Act in relation to awards to dependents in fatal cases the question of retaining article 21 no longer arises.</P>
    <P>As regards article 22, which appeared to Senator Hayes to suggest that the medical attendants and the undertaker would share all the compensation payable, in respect of a person who leaves no dependents, I would point out that the compensation payable in such a case consists only of a lump sum to cover the reasonable expenses of medical attendance and burial.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> Senator Foran urged that disabled persons entitled to National Health Insurance benefit should be entitled to draw both benefit and the appropriate rate of compensation in full.  I cannot agree to an arrangement which, in effect, would be tantamount to duplicate payments in respect of the same injury.  It must be remembered that the State also contributes substantially to the cost of National Health Insurance, and having regard to the potential burden of compensation upon the Exchequer, I think the State is reasonably entitled to have regard to the payments made from a State-aided fund in respect of an injury, and that we shall be dealing not inequitably by such persons in providing that where Health Insurance benefits are lower than the appropriate rate of compensation, the difference shall be made up out of compensation moneys.</P>
    <P>Exception was taken in the course of the last discussion to article 29 of the scheme, which provides for the deduction from awards of compensation of moneys due to the State.  It is hardly necessary to amplify what I said on that occasion.  The State has to find the money for the needs of the country, including the social services and including the cost of this scheme of compensation, where it cannot be recovered from Governments, and it is not unreasonable that where moneys required for these needs and services are properly due they should be collected.</P>
    <P>Article 36 of the scheme was the subject of criticism as being directed in effect to giving the Minister a free hand to refuse compensation regardless of reasonable entitlement.  That is certainly not the intention of the article.  While there is provision in Article 32 for forfeiture of an award on conviction, that article deals with awards which have actually been made. Claims may, however, be made based on false statements and it was deemed desirable to take discretionary power to refuse awards in cases of the kind without necessarily adopting the extreme measure of having the persons concerned convicted of an offence and made liable to court penalties.  However, the article can no doubt be redrafted <Col N="149" /> in a form which will make the intention more clear.</P>
    <P>Allied to the point raised regarding Article 36 was the suggestion that it would have been desirable that the provisions of the compensation scheme should have been embodied in a statute.  A statute is, however, hardly appropriate to a scheme of the kind. It is almost inevitable that in the course of administration, particularly should incidents occur which would lead to claims on a wholesale scale, amendments, possibly of a trifling nature, will from time to time be found necessary to meet cases of a kind which cannot now readily be foreseen, and it would be nothing short of absurd if the machinery of amending statutes had to be put in motion to secure these amendments.  It is a further consideration that corresponding schemes have also to be made in respect of the Local Defence Force and the Local Security Force, bodies the establishment and regulation of which is provided for, not by statute, but by Emergency Order. To embody the schemes for such forces in a statute would, I think, be quite inappropriate.  I need only say that the scheme, which is embodied in a statutory order, will like other similar schemes have all the force of a statute, and any person properly entitled to the compensation provided for in the scheme will be granted that compensation.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas asked on what basis we should make claims against another Government where responsibility had been brought home to that Government for injury to our citizens.  Our citizens are clearly entitled to make such claims as they consider proper, and we shall do what we can to secure the utmost measure of compensation from the Government concerned.  It may, perhaps, be argued that where a belligerent Government has accepted responsibility there should be no need to measure compensation by standards adapted to our own purse, but we are faced with the fact that it has not been possible in all past cases to secure foreign acceptance of responsibility, and it might not be possible in all, or in any cases which might occur in <Col N="150" /> future.  The State has undertaken initially to see that compensation, whether recoverable or not, will be paid, and discrimination in the matter of initial payments as between &ldquo;recoverable&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-recoverable&rdquo; cases could not be justified.  We must necessarily proceed on the basis that the liability may have to be borne finally by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I took the liberty of suggesting through you, Sir, that I might be given permission to make this statement and, as it involves a number of figures and details that one could not expect the members of the Seanad to grasp immediately, that, if the Seanad so desired, I might make the statement to-day and the Seanad could, in its discretion, fix another date later on for the full discussion of the proposed amendments.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I would like to agree entirely with that suggestion.  I think we ought to express our appreciation of the Minister's treatment of the House.  He has dealt specifically, I think, with every suggestion made either by myself as the mover or by anybody who spoke to the motion on the last occasion and he has met, I noted, five or six points completely. While we appreciate what he has done in that particular way&mdash;and apart altogether from our view on the merits of what he has done, we appreciate that he should have come to the House and told us his proposals&mdash;it would be better, I think, that we should see his statement in print and have an opportunity then of getting any further points we want to raise cleared up.  I think we could fix the next meeting of the Seanad, after to-morrow, for the conclusion of the discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as its title indicates, is a measure to amend the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938.  As the House will remember, that Act of 1938 controlled conditions of employment in shops; defined the normal working hours of members of the staffs of shops, restricting the working of overtime; provided for suitable meal intervals, weekly half-holidays, holidays in lieu of Sundays worked and annual holidays with pay. The Act was in a sense experimental. During the three years in which it has been in operation experience has shown that it contained various defects which rendered difficult the full enforcement of the Act and certain amendments to it have become necessary. This amending measure was framed to meet these difficulties.  In passing the Bill, Dáil Eireann had regard to the fact that I stated that some further amendments which had been discussed in that House would be introduced when the Bill was in Committee before the Seanad.  As the Bill, like all measures to amend previous enactments, contains a number of sections which are not directly related one to the other, discussion on it could not be called a discussion on principles but rather upon the details of the proposals and, if the Seanad will give me time, I will indicate the nature of the various amendments which the different sections seek to bring into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 defines a member of the staff of a shop.  It appears from our experience of the working of the Act that the definition of a member of the staff of a shop contained in the original Act brings within its scope certain clerical or transport employees other than <i>bona fide</i> members of the <Col N="152" /> staff of a shop who may do for the proprietor within the precincts of the shop some work on odd occasions coming within the definition.  It was not intended that such people should be included.  One or two illustrations may perhaps help members of the Seanad to understand what I have in mind.  A clerk employed in a motor garage might on some occasion supply a customer with petrol although that would not be part of his ordinary duty, or a person employed ordinarily in transport operations, the delivery of goods purchased in a shop, might on occasion participate in the sale of goods in the shop.  The fact that such an employee did these duties occasionally would bring him within the definition of a member of the staff contained in the original Act although it was not intended that they should be so included, nor would the nature of their work permit of their being subjected to the same regulations as to hours as might apply to ordinary <i>bona fide</i> shop assistants for whom the Act was originally designed.  We are, therefore, altering the definition in such a manner as to exclude such persons while ensuring that all employees who are <i>bona fide</i> members of the staff of a shop will remain within the scope of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 3 excludes from the Act persons employed as breadvan drivers or as milk roundsmen or as ice-cream vendors. It was not intended that such classes of workers should be included within the scope of the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act.  Clearly, the nature of their employment is such that they could not be subjected to the same limitations in respect of hours as ordinary shop assistants working within or adjacent to the premises of a shop.  During the course of the discussion of the principal Act in the Dáil an amendment was inserted designed to ensure that the conditions attaching to an ordinary shop would attach also to a travelling shop, and it appears now that that amendment, designed to achieve that purpose, also had the effect of bringing within the scope of the Act such persons as breadvan drivers, milk roundsmen and ice-cream vendors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> In 1939 a number of breadvan drivers in Drogheda lodged with their employers claims for payment of overtime on all hours worked in excess of 48 hours per week.  Arising out of that claim there was a test case taken to the courts and in the Circuit Court a decision was given in favour of the employees, a decision that they were in fact within the terms of the Act.  That decision of the Circuit Court opened up a very wide prospect.  It involved not merely substantial arrears of payment, amounting to several tens of thousands of pounds, by bakery proprietors, but it also involved, apparently, a complete disorganisation of the manner in which the bakery trade is carried on.  It would certainly have involved a cessation of the method of selling bread by means of breadvans.  Consequently, a decision was taken at that stage to amend the Act so as to give effect to the original intention, which was that these classes of workers should not be included.  Subsequently, the other parties to that particular action appealed from the decision of the Circuit Court judge and there were various hearings in the High Court and Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court decided that while the vehicle involved in the test case, namely, a breadvan, was deemed to be a shop under the Act since retail sales were carried on therefrom, the employee could not be regarded as a member of the staff of such shop since he was not working in the precincts of the shop, and, in fact, carried on most of his business at the doors of the houses of his customers some distance from the van.</P>
    <P>While that decision of the Supreme Court removed the necessity for the present amendment in regard to breadvan drivers, it also removed from the Act employees of travelling shops with which the section was originally designed to deal who might carry on retail sales at some distance from the travelling shop.  It demonstrated that if the breadvan driver, milk roundsman or ice-cream vendor transacted most of his business in the form of retail sales in the immediate vicinity of the van, he would be regarded as a member of the staff of the shop.  It also demonstrated that the court regarded <Col N="154" /> the present definition of &ldquo;member of the staff&rdquo; with its use of the word &ldquo;precincts&rdquo;, as not suitable for use in connection with moving vehicles as distinct from premises or places, and that the position of vehicles under the principal Act required clarification.  Section 3 is designed to meet the old difficulties which we knew existed under the principal Act as well as the new position created by the decision of the Supreme Court. The purpose of the amendment is to retain within the scope of the principal Act all genuine travelling shops, while excluding <i>bona fide</i> delivery vans doing a small amount of retail trade and breadvans, milk roundsmen's vehicles and ice-cream vendors' vehicles.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with hotel employees. While the principal Act was under consideration in the Dáil and Seanad, there was considerable discussion as to the advisability of attempting to deal with the hours of work of hotel employees under a Shops Act.  Although the Act was framed to provide for the inclusion of hotel employees within its scope, considerable doubt was expressed by many members of both Houses as to the wisdom of doing so, in which doubts I personally strongly shared.  In fact, I stated during the course of the discussion in the Dáil that if hotel employees had not been included within the scope of the Bill when first introduced, the difficulties which had emerged during the discussions in the Dáil were such that I certainly would never have attempted to include them subsequently.  Experience has shown that outside the City of Dublin, the provisions of the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act in respect of hotels were practically unworkable. It is only in the City of Dublin, where there are large hotels with permanent staffs and where there is a reserve pool of skilled labour which can be drawn upon as required by hotel proprietors, that it has been found possible to carry out in full the provisions of the Act in relation to hotel employees.</P>
    <P>In the rest of the country, where circumstances are entirely different and where they vary from district to district <Col N="155" /> and from one type of hotel to another, the difficulties experienced by proprietors in carrying out the provisions of the Act were such that the inspectors of the Department reported that they could not be enforced at all, and in many cases the objections to the enforcement of the Act were equally strongly voiced by the employees of the hotels, and particularly those hotels in summer resorts which open for only a few months in the year and in which a large part of the employees' remuneration comes in the form of tips, with a consequent disinclination on the part of the employees to take holidays and lose revenue on that account.  It became obvious, therefore, that the Act had to be amended, and as the Bill now stands, we propose to delete hotels from its scope altogether, except in the County Borough of Dublin. At some later stage, it may be possible to devise legislation designed specifically to deal with the problem of employment in hotels, I do not, however, want to be taken as definitely promising such legislation, because the difficulties that arose were not due entirely to the inapplicability of the Shops Act to the hotel business.  They were due also to the very great variations in the type of business carried on in one hotel as distinct from another.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill is a minor amendment, which deals with the tea interval in chemists' shops where the provisions of the Shops Act came into conflict with the provisions of the Pharmacy Act of 1875.  In certain types of chemists' shops, it became impossible for the proprietor to comply with both Acts.  He had to break either one or the other, and that position has been rectified by the amendment.  During the course of the discussion in Committee in the Dáil, certain amendments were put forward on behalf of hotel proprietors which it was claimed would ease some of the difficulties of the catering trade under the principal Act. I examined these amendments and had certain consultations with interested parties concerning them.  I found that there was amongst all people, employees' and workers' organisations, <Col N="156" /> considerable unanimity of opinion as to the desirability of the changes, and consequently I indicated in the Dáil that I would accept amendments on the same lines if moved in this House, and in fact undertook to arrange that such amendments would be moved. That was solely for the purpose of securing the expeditious passage of the Bill through the Dáil.  These amendments have been drafted and will be submitted to the Seanad in due course. A further amendment will also be necessary following the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Martin v. Galbraith, Ltd., to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill will exclude ice-cream vendors from the scope of the principal Act from the date on which the Bill becomes law, but it is clear from the judgment of the Supreme Court that if retail sales are carried on in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle, the courts will probably regard the employee concerned as a member of the staff of the shop for the purposes of the principal Act.  That decision removes most, if not all, breadvan drivers and milk roundsmen from the principal Act since they carry on their business from door to door, but ice-cream vendors, who transact their business from a vehicle, would therefore be within the scope of the principal Act up to the date on which this Bill may become law and could therefore put in large claims for overtime for work done during the period between May, 1938, to the date of the passing of this Bill.  As I have stated, it was never intended that such persons should be within the scope of this legislation, and we are removing them from the principal Act by this Bill.  It will, however, be necessary to provide that their exclusion from the principal Act will be retrospective.</P>
    <P>That covers all the provisions in the Bill.  I have explained that its purpose is to effect such amendments in the provisions of the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938, as experience has shown to be necessary and as are designed to ensure that the provisions of that Act will be made more easily workable and enforceable.  I do not think that any of the amendments are <Col N="157" /> of such a character as to conflict with the principle of the principal Act. They are all designed to ensure that difficulties which have arisen in the enforcement of the Act will be removed, either by modification of the terms of the original Act or by an amendment of its scope.</P>

      <P>There is one point, which is rather a Committee point, which I would like to put to the Minister. I am very far from being an expert on the hotel business, but the point has been put to me.  The Minister has accepted a number of amendments which were put forward in the Dáil and which will be duly moved here.  Section 23 of the principal Act of 1938 provides that the proprietor of every shop shall specify, in a notice in the prescribed form, the daily hours to be worked by each member of his staff with an interval for rest, meals and so on.  I gather that the 1938 Act has not been rigidly observed in hotels, but it is assumed that, when this amending Bill is passed into an Act, it will be regarded as something that must be absolutely observed.  This particular provision, not in regard to the observance of a 48 hour week, but in regard to the putting up of the notice and that it must be observed in a particular form, has been found difficult to follow. In fact, arrangements have frequently been made with workers and the trade unions concerned and no friction has occurred.  It has been suggested to me that the Minister might be willing to accept an amendment&mdash;I should be prepared to frame one if necessary&mdash;taking power to amend by order that particular sub-section of Section 23 of the principal Act which prescribes these forms.  As I have said, I am far from being an expert on the matter, but it does seem to me that if there is difficulty in applying this it might be possible, after a little more experience of it, to arrive at a situation where something <Col N="158" /> better than what is in Section 23 of the principal Act could be framed. If the Minister were given power to make an order, following representations made to him by the parties concerned, employers and workers, it would save him from having to bring in an amending Bill.  I would be quite prepared to put down an amendment for the Committee Stage, to have the matter discussed, if the Minister thinks it is at all feasible.</P>

      <P>I think it is a pity to bring hotels into this Bill.  The Minister seemed to express a doubt as to the propriety of doing it.  He realises, I think, the difference there is between hotels in Dublin and hotels in the country.  There is also a great difference between hotels in Dublin.  I am more acquainted with the smaller hotels in the city which cater for the needs of people of modest means, and which, consequently, cannot afford to employ big staffs such as the Shelbourne or the Gresham would engage. These small hotels employ, say, a waitress and a boots.  If the provisions of the principal Act were to be rigidly enforced, I myself could not have got a meal when I arrived at a late hour in the city last night.  It is a great pity, I think, that legislation dealing with hotels could not be the subject of a Bill in which the conditions relating to all hotels could be examined, and their difficulties faced.  The Minister has indicated that he proposes introducing some amendments on the Committee Stage and that he has been in touch with people engaged in the hotels.  Perhaps when these amendments come before us we will find, as regards the hotels that cater for people of modest incomes, that the situation will reveal itself as other than it is at the moment.</P>

With regard to the Bill itself, I have <Col N="159" /> no objection to it, provided reasonable time is allowed for the sending in of amendments for the Committee Stage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The points raised on this stage of the Bill were, as Senator Hayes has said, largely Committee points.  With regard to Section 23, to which Senator Hayes referred, the suggestion was made to me that the section should be amended on the lines indicated by him.  I was not prepared to accept the amendment&mdash;not that I am very strongly opposed to it in principle&mdash;but it seems to me to be essential to have some system of ensuring that hotel employees will know what times they are expected to work, and that there will be some record which will facilitate the Department's inspectors in seeing that the prescribed hours, and only the prescribed hours, are, in fact, worked by hotel employees.  Unless we have some system such as Section 23 provides&mdash;this putting up in the premises of a notice of the hours to be worked by each employee-the enforcement of the Act by the Department's inspectors will become very difficult.  It is not unreasonable, I think, to require that hotel employees&mdash;certainly in the City of Dublin where the Act will apply only in the future-should know, some time in advance each day, the hours they are expected to work on that day, so that there cannot be arbitrary changes in the times at which they will be at work without regard to any arrangement which the employees may have made.  There is, of course, a provision in the Act which allows a hotel manager to depart from the provisions of that section in circumstances of an emergency such as would arise if there was a very large and unexpected influx of customers who had to be attended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Senator Foran's observations, he is not correct in assuming that adequate time was not given to members of the Dáil to put forward amendments.  It is true that the Dáil agreed to pass the Committee and Report Stages the same day, but there was a considerable period during which members of the Dáil were free to submit <Col N="161" /> amendments.  A number of amendments were, in fact, discussed by the Dáil on the occasion of the Committee Stage.  It is a matter for Senators to decide when they will take the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to Senator Alton's point, I indicated that this legislation deals only with the hours of working of shop assistants.  Presumably, the Senator has in mind that an assistant who works all day might also be asked to work all night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have some notice of the Senator's point.  I am not sure at the moment whether the Acts which control the hours of opening of shops extend to chemists' shops.  So far as the Conditions of Employment Act is concerned, it controls only the times in which the individual assistants may be employed.  If a shop remains open for a longer number of hours than the assistants are required to work, some arrangement for a relief staff would have to be made.</P>

Senators are, no doubt, aware that the Bill was a considerable time before the Dáil and it was only towards the end of the session that it was, in fact, taken.  I do not want to rush the Seanad unduly, but it would be desirable <Col N="162" /> that we should not delay in the passage of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Architects (Registration) Bill be now read a Second Time.  When this Bill was introduced by me I was actuated by two motives and I believe that these were shared by the other Senators whose names appear on the Bill.  One of these motives was that of increasing the usefulness of this House as an integral part of the Oireachtas.  I have felt for some time that this House could perform a useful service by the discussion in a definite form of proposals for legislative changes in this country which have not been and ought not to be the subject of Party controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under our present system the Executive Government of the day is chosen from a Party and its time is usually fully occupied with the legislative programme of that Party and by various other measures which may become urgent through the circumstances of the time.  I feel strongly that this House, which is rarely overwhelmed with business &mdash; I remember occasions when it was, but not recently&mdash;should endeavour to bring forward measures designed to improve the law of this country and that it should discuss them fully and leisurely without regard to Party affiliations.  The public examination and discussion of such proposals in the form of a Bill is, in my opinion, more likely to be effective than by means of a resolution.  Such public discussion may possibly, in some cases, lead to the discovery of a strong opposition in the country which would show that the time was not ripe for legislation.  In other cases it might produce a Bill which would be largely an agreed measure and which the <Col N="164" /> Government may with or without amendment adopt if and when the Bill reaches the Dáil.</P>
    <P>A good example of what I have in mind is shown by the Town Planning Bill which was passed through this House with the support of members of all Parties some years ago.  It was not adopted by the Government, but it was followed by a Government Bill &mdash; the Town and Regional Planning Bill, which is now law.  When introducing the latter Bill in this House, the then Minister for Local Government, Mr. S. T. O'Kelly, paid a tribute to the preliminary work done in this House.</P>
    <P>Another, though less important example, is the Bodies Corporate (Executive) Act of 1928, which was introduced in this House as a Private Members' Bill and passed the Dáil in very much the same form.</P>
    <P>It is my intention, if the Bill passes the Second Stage, to ask the House at some stage to refer it to a Select Committee with power to send for persons and papers so that evidence for and against the Bill may be heard and an effort made to make the Bill one which will command pretty general support.  I hope that the Government will keep an open mind with reference to the Bill while it is in this House and that no announcement of Government approval or disapproval will be made until the Select Committee has reported to the Seanad or until the Bill reaches the Dáil.</P>
    <P>My second, and, of course, the most important motive in introducing this Bill, was my conviction that it would be very much in the public interest if the principle of registration of architects were adopted in this country and I propose to explain my reasons to you as clearly as I can.</P>
    <P>Before doing so, I would like to make it clear that this Bill is put forward solely as a measure of public policy and not in the private interests of any person or body of persons.</P>
    <P>Doctors and dentists are required by law to be registered, not in their own interests, but to safeguard the health of the public.  Since the outbreak of war the Government have, by order, <Col N="165" /> required many manufacturers and traders to be registered for various purposes because they considered it to be in the public interest to do so&mdash;not simply in the interests of manufacturers or traders.  In my opinion registration of any class of persons by law should be considered on the basis of public interest and on no other grounds.  The fact that this Bill has been ruled to be a hybrid Bill does not alter the fact that it is a public Bill and not a private measure, and I ask the House to judge the principle of the Bill solely from the point of view of public interest.</P>
    <P>The Bill was not introduced on behalf of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland or any other body.  It was introduced after consultation between the Senators whose names appear on it and a number of leading Irish architects, but the introducers only are responsible for its contents.  It is understood that since the Bill was introduced a meeting of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland has approved the principle of registration but has criticised some of the provisions of the Bill in certain respects. These criticisms can no doubt be considered if the Bill goes to Committee.</P>
    <P>For my part, I am not tied to any of the provisions in the Bill.  I regard it rather as a draft which will be improved by public discussion and consideration. As long as the principle of registration is accepted, I am open to consider amendments to any part of the Bill, and it is my hope that the Bill will be considerably improved in Committee if the Second Reading is passed.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that a very large number of States have made legal provisions for the registration of architects.  I think it will interest the House if I read a list of the countries in which architects have to be registered by law.  They are:&mdash; Austria, Australia, Argentine, Brazil, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Cuba, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Yugo-Slavia, Norway, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Roumania, <Col N="166" /> Russia, Spain, Sweden, South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, U.S.A.</P>
    <P>There are probably others but I am not certain.  I have only given those in which, I am satisfied, architects have to be registered.  The fact that these countries have registration does not, of course, prove that we should follow them but it provides a <i>prima facie</i> case for the examination and discussion of the question.  The fact that our fellow-countrymen in the Six Counties have to be registered if they wish to practise as architects provides an additional reason.</P>
    <P>The general arguments in favour of registration were expressed in an interesting way in the Preamble to a Bill for the regulation of the profession of architects when it was introduced into the French Chamber of Deputies. I obtained the quotation from an article in the <i>International Labour Review</i>, January, 1940, and I propose to read it to the House as translated into English in that article:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Architecture is rightly considered the greatest and most useful of the arts because it can provide such a variety of solutions to the multifarious problems with which it deals, because it steadily builds up a harmonious background for the life of the community, because it directly influences industrial activity, and because it contributes to the comfort and health of the population.  Its field of action covers all buildings required for human occupation in any given territory.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The architect has therefore a social mission which can be extremely beneficial if it is carried out with talent and competence.  If, on the other hand, it is badly carried out, whether through ignorance or through carelessness, it may en-endanger the safety and health of the architect's fellow citizens, and at the same time considerably reduce the æsthetic value of the urban or rural scene.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It therefore seems only right to require the architect to prove that he has the necessary knowledge before permitting him to exercise his art.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" />&ldquo;This knowledge can be acquired only by a course of specialised education enabling him to develop his artistic gifts by suitable artistic training, to learn the technical means available for carrying out his ideas, to assimilate a sufficient knowledge of public and administrative law, social and economic science, and general culture, to enable him to fulfil his duties, and finally to acquire experience of his profession by practical training.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If it is admitted that the architect should also possess sufficient authority and sense of professional duty to defend the often important interests entrusted to him and to carry out satisfactorily the duties as an adviser or arbitrator with which he is often entrusted, it will be realised that it is only by suitable training that he can reach the desired intellectual standard, and that no mere tests of ability can guarantee his possession of these qualities.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At present, anyone in any place is free to exercise this profession in any way, and it must be recognised as undesirable that activities of such importance for the public welfare should be entrusted to anyone prepared to undertake them without some previous check on his abilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The French Parliament, apparently, accepted those views and made provision for the registration of architects. I agree generally with the arguments in this document which I have just read, and it is my conviction that the passing of this Bill or a similar Bill into law would assist the public generally who may be responsible for the erection of buildings in this country in the future by enabling them to recognise a qualified architect and by preventing them from employing a person in the belief that he (or she) is a qualified architect when in fact he is not.  There is nothing in the Bill which makes it obligatory on any person to employ an architect if he does not desire to do so.  Some persons will regard this as a defect in the Bill, but I feel that the time is not yet ripe for more drastic provisions, and that it <Col N="168" /> would be going too far at present to interfere with the legal right of an individual to employ a person not an architect to advise him in the building of a house.  At the same time I do believe that the registration of architects will in itself call attention to the importance of having qualified advice where the erection of buildings is concerned, and I believe that, in time, few if any buildings will be erected except from plans prepared by an architect.</P>
    <P>The case for registration may be said to rest upon three main propositions: (a) that the establishment and maintenance of a high architectural standard is not only of national importance but of public concern also from the point of view of health and general well being; (b) that if a high standard of architecture is to be established and maintained, architects must be trained and educated, and (c) that it is in the public interest that a clear distinction be drawn between the trained and untrained practitioner.</P>
    <P>We have some very fine buildings in Eire of which we are justly proud, but we have also, unfortunately, a number of buildings which, at best, can only be styled mediocre, and a very considerable number which, to put it mildly, are inferior.  There are too many places where our beautiful landscape has been defiled by ill-planned and badly constructed buildings. Slowly, but I hope surely, people are beginning to appreciate the value of a beautiful building.  The bad as well as the good that architects do lives after them, and I feel that the Legislature has a duty to future generations to see that those who are to be entrusted with the planning and elevation of our buildings should be equipped in every possible way to give of their best.</P>
    <P>The benefit to this country of the Bill, should it become law, may not be realised for many years to come.  As I have said, it was not considered practicable or desirable to include any provision which might have the effect of removing from any person his present means of earning a livelihood.  The Bill, therefore, gives a right to registration to every person now practising <Col N="169" /> as an architect in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Fully qualified architects at present enjoying a good practice have nothing to gain from the Bill.  On the contrary, from their point of view, the Bill has the objectionable feature of admitting to the register possibly unqualified persons who are at present engaged in practice.  I realise that those people, who would possibly get a better standing than they may have at the moment, may be the only people who will gain an immediate advantage on the day on which the council is set up should the Bill be passed, but the architects whom I have consulted recognise that that situation will have to be faced, and are prepared to accept it for the general good.  After all, if the registration of architects were postponed until a later date, the same situation would have to be faced; you would have to decide whether or not you were going to deprive of their livelihood people who had been perhaps depending upon that profession, although not fully qualified, and you would be simply that much further back.  That is inevitable, I think, in any scheme of this kind&mdash;you have had a similar position in other countries, and they have had to face it&mdash;but that simply means that the sooner we act the better.  If the registration of architects is postponed to a later date we will have to face the same situation, and the towns and countryside may have suffered further disfigurement in the meantime.  Registration, as proposed in this Bill, will not debar anyone from entering the profession, but it will ensure that persons who enter it in future cannot practise until they have obtained a definite standard of efficiency.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself proposes a very considerable measure of State control of registration.  The majority of the members of the proposed Architects Registration Board will be nominated by the Minister responsible, and regulations made by it will require Ministerial approval before they can take effect.  Although not provided in the Bill as introduced it is my intention, should the Bill go to Committee, to propose an amendment providing that after a few years the President and <Col N="170" /> Vice-President of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland shall cease to be <i>ex-officio</i> members of the board, and that their places should be taken by elected representatives of registered architects.  Obviously, that could not take place immediately, because you would have to get your register established and checked before you could have a proper system of election.  The Bill, though in no sense identical with the British Acts of 1931, 1934 and 1938, embodies such provisions of those Acts as appear to be suitable to this country.  It should be clearly understood that the Bill is intended to do nothing more and nothing less than restrict the use of the title &ldquo;architect&rdquo; to people at present engaged in the pursuit of architecture, and to those in future who attain the qualifying standard.</P>
    <P>I think I have made a reasonably good case for the acceptance of the principle underlying the Bill, but I have not stated why I consider it urgent that a Bill providing for State registration of architects should become law at an early date.  It may be suggested that the whole question should be allowed to stand over until after the period of emergency caused by the war.  Even if this argument were to be accepted, I would say that that is no reason why the Seanad should not proceed with the Bill in preparation for after the war.  In my opinion, it is highly desirable that some system of registration of architects should be in force at whatever date the war comes to an end.  It may well prove to be an essential in dealing with other countries for the purpose of obtaining reciprocity, so that degrees and qualifications recognised here may be accepted for registration outside Eire.  I have already read to the House a list of countries where registration is in force, and I need scarcely point out that in several of those countries, including our nearest neighbour, Great Britain, there has been widespread destruction of buildings as a result of enemy action.  After the war, there must be extensive rebuilding in those countries, with the probable result that many opportunities may occur for temporary work for young architects <Col N="171" /> from Ireland.  If, as is quite possible, the shortage of building supplies in this country continues for a period after the war, many of our young architects may find themselves without work for several years.  If they could obtain temporary work in countries which are repairing the damage of war, it would be to their advantage, and the experience which they would gain would benefit this country when they return, as no doubt very many of them would.</P>
    <P>At the present time the examinations qualifying for membership of the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland are not recognised for the purpose of admission to the register in Great Britain or in Northern Ireland. The position, therefore, is that a student who qualifies for admission to the Irish institute is debarred from practising as an architect in either Great Britain or Northern Ireland&mdash; unless he takes those examinations which are recognised&mdash;while anyone who resides or who may take up residence in the Twenty-Six Counties, whether qualified or not, is free to practise as an architect.</P>
    <P>The Degree of Bachelor of Architecture of the National University likewise is not recognised for registration, and a holder of that degree desiring to practise in Great Britain must first become an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Before his name can be submitted for election to that body he is required to pass a further examination which, if my information is correct, is in one subject only.</P>
    <P>The existence of a board such as that proposed to be set up by Section 2 of the Bill with the powers set out in Section 3 would place this country in a position to negotiate for reciprocal recognition with, I believe, good prospect of success.  This is my reason for considering it important that the consideration of this Bill should take place this year, and a <i>bona fide</i> effort made to work out a Bill which the Government can reasonably be asked to accept if and when it reaches Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> From information supplied to me I understand we have at present in Eire 267 students in architecture; 92 of these are studying in the National University and 175 are preparing for the examinations of the Institute of Architecture.  Some of these will drop out, but a very substantial number are likely to qualify.  If we believe that the principle of registration of architects is bad or that the circumstances in this country are such that registration would be undesirable then we can do little or nothing to help these students. If, on the other hand, this House shares my view that the principle of registration of architects is good, and if there is a probability that work will not be available for them here after the war and for the large number at present qualified but without jobs, then I feel strongly that we should make an endeavour to make arrangements with other countries by which Irish qualifications will obtain full recognition, especially in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.  Leading architects whom I have consulted are of the opinion that a necessary step to pave the way for any negotiations for reciprocity would be the passing into law of this Bill or some similar Bill embodying the principle of registration.</P>
    <P>I have explained the general provisions of the Bill and the principle underlying it, but I have not considered it necessary or desirable to explain the Bill in detail at this stage. I may mention, however, that one or two small errors will be found in the Bill as printed.  These are typing errors and not due to a mistake on the part of the printer.  On page 3, line 55, the words &ldquo;Section 4 or 8&rdquo; should read &ldquo;Section 3 or 7&rdquo;.  On page 7, line 48, the words &ldquo;Section 8 or 9&rdquo; should read &ldquo;Section 7 or 8&rdquo;.  I must apologise for these errors, which I regret. If there are any parts of the Bill which are not clear to Senators I will endeavour to explain them in more detail when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that I recognise that no Bill of this character could properly become law without careful consideration by the Government of the day.  I ask this House to approve the principle by <Col N="173" /> passing the Second Stage and then, in Committee, to do the necessary spade work with a view to presenting to the Dáil a Bill which is worthy of its serious consideration.  The responsibility of deciding whether or not it should become law and the most suitable time for its enactment would then rest on the majority of the other House, guided, no doubt, by the Government.</P>

      <P>It is a great pleasure to me to second the motion that this Bill be read a Second Time. As Senator Douglas has explained, the Bill has not been put forward with a view to trying to secure legislation on this important matter in any hasty or ill-considered fashion.  It is put forward principally in order to have the matter fully and carefully examined. The promoters of the Bill are in no wise tied to its provisions.  All they wish is to have the principle of registration for the architectural profession accepted by the Seanad and they will be quite ready to welcome a most complete and searching examination of all the details of the Bill in Committee afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In bringing forward this Bill, we consider that the Seanad is an especially suitable place for it to begin its course. In the first place, the Seanad has been created specifically as a vocational Seanad and therefore it should take a very special interest in the question of organising the various vocations in the country.  In the second place, the Seanad is so constituted that it can give a great deal more time than the Dáil to the consideration of exactly this sort of constructive, non-contentious measure.  It would be quite possible for the Seanad to do a great deal of most useful work if it could even go beyond this Bill at a later stage and proceed to assist a good many other professions in the country which are anxious to be allowed to organise themselves and to set up registers for themselves.  It is very doubtful if any better body could be devised for such a purpose than this Seanad might be if it decided to devote the time and the attention to the <Col N="174" /> matter, and there is hardly any work which would be of greater value to the country in the long run than the systematisation and better arrangement of all those professions, which are striving at present under difficulties to achieve a certain measure of organisation.</P>
    <P>Personally, I felt bound to support this Bill, first of all because I am generally interested in this question of vocational organisation and have devoted a good deal of attention to the subject and because I know that this particular profession is one which is probably most in need of some measure of this kind.  Secondly, because, as a representative of the National University, I am keenly interested in the future welfare of our school of architecture in University College, which is the only school of its kind in Ireland, and its graduates will be most intimately affected by the passage of legislation of this kind.  It will be of the greatest importance to those large numbers of young men and women now studying architecture in University College if, on graduating, they can find themselves entitled to enter a properly recognised and properly organised profession. Senator Douglas pointed out that we have 92 students in University College at the moment.  We are turning out young Bachelors of Architecture in great numbers.  Unfortunately the Bill, as it stands, owing to the circumstances of the moment, can hardly go as far as many of us would like to see it go in the direction of giving these graduates of the University School the full recognition to which their studies and their attainments will entitle them, but it will go a certain distance, at any rate, in this direction, and, as a representative of the National University, I take a very great interest in that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>One argument which may perhaps be advanced against proceeding with the Bill is the argument I have heard mentioned outside and that is, that we have a commission sitting at present to deal with this whole question of vocational organisation.  I have actually heard it suggested that to go <Col N="175" /> on with this Bill at present would be an insult to the commission.  As a member of that commission, I can assure the House that there is no danger whatever of its being taken in that light. There is no danger whatever that the commission will consider that its work will be interfered with if the Seanad should decide to go on with this measure and give it the full examination and consideration that it deserves.</P>
    <P>In the first place, the commission is very unlikely to present its report for a considerable time.  It certainly will be at least six months more, and very likely longer than that, before its report is ready.  It has to cover a very wide field and investigate the conditions in a great number of professions and would-be professions in the country, and it would be quite impossible for it to have its report ready before the end of next summer or thereabouts.  When its report is ready, it will have to be considered by the Government and its recommendations will have to be very carefully thought over.  Then these recommendations probably will have to be put into effect piecemeal, by the passage of a whole series of Acts of Parliament &mdash; if the Government of the day thinks fit to put them into effect.  For that reason, to offer the report of the commission to any particular profession which is anxious for registration is really beside the point.</P>
    <P>The question of any particular profession being registered will be affected by the report of the commission only at a very distant date indeed; and, in any case, the report of the commission will deal with the whole matter in such general terms that it is quite legitimate for any profession that feels that it needs organisation urgently at this particular moment to press for such organisation.  In fact, of course, the real object, or one of the principal objects, of the commission will be to secure or suggest means by which the various professions which require organisation and registration shall be enabled to get that more cheaply and <Col N="176" /> less cumbrously than it is possible for them to get it at present.</P>
    <P>The great difficulty that faces quite a series of vocations in this country which would like to be organised in that way and be given the power of registration and so on, is that at present it costs a considerable sum of money and takes a great deal of time and trouble to secure registration by way of a Private Bill through Parliament.  This measure is an attempt to test whether that work cannot be done more expeditiously and in less costly fashion by means of ordinary legislation.  It is because it will test the capacity of the Seanad to live up to its vocational character and to do this work for the many vocations anxious to get registration, that we are so anxious to have it considered.</P>
    <P>The case of the architectural profession, as Senator Douglas has emphasised, is for several reasons more urgent than that of most other professions. First of all, there is a great need in the country itself, and secondly, there is the question of our relations with other countries in this matter of qualifications of architects. Everybody knows that we have been very sadly wanting in the matter of architecture for a long time back, that there is nothing almost that we need more, from the civilised point of view, than men who will be highly trained and have greater artistic skill and greater capacity in this matter of building than we have had.  An immense amount of building has been done in Ireland in the past 30 or 40 years, but I think it is not invidious to say&mdash;and that everyone will agree&mdash; that a large part of it has been unfortunate, and unfortunate precisely because we have not had the trained and qualified architects to look after it, to see that it was carried out properly and that some standard was applied far more thoroughly to it than has been the case.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the question of urgency that I would like to stress.  Senator Douglas has referred to it already.  It is that, whereas English architects can come <Col N="177" /> over here and practise quite freely, because we have no system of registration at all, our architects cannot go to Northern Ireland or England and practise there.  If they do, they have to submit themselves to a further examination and undergo various tests. If we had a proper system of registration in this country, they would not have to undergo those tests at all. If our architects had a system of registration there could be some reciprocity between these three areas and our architects could get the same opportunities in Northern Ireland and England which English architects freely and readily get here.  In that way, this Bill would do something to put this country on equality with Northern Ireland and England, and if only from that point of view I think it important that the fullest consideration should be given to this Bill.  It is really rather ridiculous, at this time of day&mdash;after 20 years of self-government &mdash; that, in the case of this most important profession, we should allow ourselves to continue in an inferior position with regard to England and Northern Ireland, that we should have our training and qualifications in this country regarded as something below the standard which applies in England.  If for that one reason alone, it would be well worth while to give the Bill a Second Reading and let it go before a committee.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas has already stressed the ultimate value of the Bill in producing a higher standard of architecture in Ireland, and it is unnecessary to go into that point at any greater length.  We have a duty to ourselves and to the country generally, to see that a profession like this &mdash; which is of such immense importance, not only for the present, but for the whole future of the country&mdash;should be of the highest possible status and given the utmost opportunity so to organise and develop itself that it will be on a level with that most important profession in any other country in the world.  It is only fair and right that we should be interested in taking measures to see that this is done, and it is one of the duties we owe both to ourselves and to the future of the country to see that the profession of architecture&mdash;one of <Col N="178" /> the most important of the arts and one of the arts which makes the most impression on everybody&mdash;will be put on a proper level, and that we will not lag behind Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which organised this profession many years ago, and behind a great number of civilised countries all over the world which have done the same thing.  It is for all these reasons that I am interested in trying to have this Bill put through, and I sincerely hope the Seanad will give it full, patient and careful consideration.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to oppose the principle of this Bill, but I cannot arouse myself to the enthusiasm we have had from its proposer and seconder.  The proposer of the Bill says that because it is good we should support it.  I would not think it is good, I think it is harmless, that it is innocuous. When I hear the Seantor talking of highly-trained, artistic skill, I begin to wonder at the mental approach to the whole problem.  Artistic skill cannot be obtained by training: it is born in the man.  You will get some people trained as highly as you like and they will produce some prosaic building which may be suitable and which will stand up in an honest fashion and contain the necessary number of bathrooms and so on, but which will not be a work of beauty. To think you can get more beautiful buildings by these people would be the greatest mistake in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Look at the work of architects in the past.  Look at some of the terrible neo-Gothic houses of the Georgian period.  I have no doubt that they are the work of highly-qualified people and yet they must be considered atrocious.  They are dark and inconvenient inside and undignified in elevation.  Look at the Albert Memorial which, I imagine, was designed by an architect.  Can anyone say it is a work of beauty?  Do not let us go away with the belief that, by this measure, we are going to get more beautiful buildings.  We may get safer buildings and we may prevent a certain number of unqualified persons from calling themselves architects.  But let <Col N="179" /> us realise that this Bill is not going to effect very much.</P>

      <P>It is, I think, desirable that I should inform the Seanad of the attitude of the Government to this Bill.  Senator Douglas asked that I should not express an opinion on its merits at this stage.  To some extent, I propose to comply with his wishes. While I, personally, found a number of the arguments advanced in favour of the Bill by Senator Douglas entirely unconvincing and the claims made for it by Senator Tierney preposterously extravagant, I think a case might be made, at some stage, for legislation of this kind.  But the case must be one based upon the public interest.  I do not think that we should have legislation of this kind providing for registration of persons practising a particular profession or calling unless it is clear, beyond doubt, that the public interest requires it.  The obligation of making that clear and removing any doubts rests upon the promoters of the measure.  It is not sufficient to make the case that the interests of the particular class of persons mentioned in the Bill will be enhanced.  If we are to proceed to give protection in this manner to persons following a particular profession, it must be clear that not merely their interests but, much more, the interests of the public require that it be done.  I do not think that that case has been made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable that the Seanad and the promoters of the Bill should know that the Government is not prepared to facilitate the enactment of this measure at this time.  Senator Tierney gave some indication of the reason for that attitude.  There is in existence a Commission on Vocational Organisation. That commission is preparing its report and that report will, I understand, be available this year.  Senator Tierney says that it will be available in about six months.  I think I read in the newspapers that the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland gave evidence before that commission and submitted <Col N="180" /> proposals to it.  I think we should wait and see what observations the commission have to make on these representations.  We should be aware of the general character of their report before facilitating the enactment of legislation of this kind.  The Government desire that this measure should not be proceeded with until they shall have had an opportunity of examining and considering in full whatever recommendations the Commission on Vocational Organisation may have to make in regard to the architects' profession. It is contended that there is some element of urgency which requires the enactment of this Bill now &mdash; even before the report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation is available.</P>
    <P>Personally, I do not believe that any problem affecting the architects' profession in Ireland is so urgent that it cannot await the presentation of the commission's report, even if it takes the commission six months to conclude its deliberations.  For these reasons, the Government cannot agree to facilitate the passage of this Bill.  It will be clear that these reasons are independent of any opinion the Government may hold upon the merits of the Bill, as such.  Those who are responsible for its promotion, and who may be involved in expense if they proceed with it, should, I think, know at this stage that that is the attitude of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather disappointed at the line taken by the Minister.  He seems to base his objection to the Bill largely upon the existence of the Vocational Commission. Senator Tierney spoke of the special suitability of this legislative body for dealing with a matter like this, on the ground that we are, or purport to be, a vocational body.  To talk of the Seanad as a vocational body is, to my mind, merely silly.  We are an ordinary Second House.  We have very limited powers, and these powers relate to every aspect of government, not being limited to vocational matters, as they should be.  I believe that the Vocational Commission owed its genesis to <Col N="181" /> the idea of exploring the means which would bring about a different system of organisation of society in relation to its political life.  I think that the Vocational Commission may be doing good work, but its report will have only a slightly educational significance. To suggest that anything should be postponed until that report is available and is being acted upon, seems to me to be a very easy and unconvincing means of side-stepping a proposal.</P>
      <P>Although I listened attentively to Senator Douglas, it seemed to me that the real point of such an enactment as this was not stressed by him.  He pointed out that there are students in the National University going through what one must assume to be an extremely arduous discipline to prepare themselves for a certain activity.  At present, I can take a cheap office and put a plate outside announcing myself as an architect.  Being perfectly free, and not tied down by any professional rules, I can work a publicity and advertising campaign which will convince the simple-minded people of this country that I belong to that body of distinguished architects to which Senator Douglas referred.  So long as you have a position in which one man may voluntarily undergo an arduous preparation and another man achieve the same position in society without doing that, you discourage people from taking the more difficult course.  You cannot expect every simple-minded person who wants to build a house to make an elaborate examination of the qualifications of the person who describes himself as an architect.  Yet, one man can describe himself as an architect, without qualification, while another man who has, at great expense and labour, submitted himself to discipline, is only in the same position as he is.  It is in the public interest that there should be some label whereby a person would know that an architect was possessed of the proper qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane spoke about artistic skill and said that it was either born with one or it was not.  That is the old-fashioned, romantic idea.  It is shared by young men who go around labelling themselves as great poets and feeling that the mere label demands <Col N="182" /> that they should be exempt from the ordinary rules of society.  Nobody is born with the capacity to do great things.  That is possible only after discipline.  Nobody is born with great artistic skill.  The greatest musicians and the greatest painters in the world realised that they had constantly to be laboriously applying themselves to their work in order to make, what they were producing, perfect.  Senator Sir John Keane also seemed to assume that you merely sat through a certain period in the National University and then received a diploma as an architect. I presume that, in any academic institution such as that, you must undergo training before you receive the diploma, and that you must demonstrate to the satisfaction of those in charge that you have acquired the artistic skill necessary.  It is time that this bubble was pricked regarding people being born with the ability to do great things.</P>
    <P>Some of Senator Douglas's arguments did not seem to me to carry weight. What I want is that no man be allowed to practise architecture unless the public have the assurance that he possesses a certain degree of competence. If you pass this Bill, you will have a certain awkward condition, as is always the case under such legislation. There are men without qualifications practising as architects. It would be unjust if you suddenly said to a man who had been earning his living for 20 years by architecture that he would no longer be at liberty to carry on his work.  In all these cases, the quacks, or non-qualified men, are allowed to continue.  That would have to be done in the case of this Bill, too. I was not convinced by Senator Douglas as to the effect of this Bill in enabling our qualified students to practise in England.  I understand that the degree in architecture given by the National University is accepted in England as equivalent to the final examination of the R.I.B.A., subject to those who receive the diploma here passing an examination in professional practice.  I think that that is the case, though I am not quite sure.  I do not think that this Bill will do much to <Col N="183" /> alter that.  I was struck by the fact&mdash; here I speak without knowledge&mdash; mentioned by Senator Douglas that there are about 92 students pursuing the course in architecture in the National University, and a very much larger number in the Institute.  With my, unfortunately, cynical mind I began to suspect that the discipline required of those in that other institution is less rigid than in that with the lesser number.  That opinion may be due to my mind becoming a bit distorted through having lived so long.  I think that any architect qualified in the National University is able, by showing that he is aware of what is required in professional practice, to practise in England.  In the case of medicine and dentistry, the position is, I think, rather different.  I can purport to treat a sick person.  If I were qualified as a doctor and the person I was treating died under my care, I would not be chargeable with manslaughter. If I, in my unqualified condition, performed an operation on Senator Quirke and he succumbed I should suffer the disadvantage of being chargeable with manslaughter.</P>
    <P>There is a certain analogy with regard to houses.  I remember when the then Minister for Local Government admitted here that certain houses built for the vulgarising of the landscape in Kildare should never have been allowed to be built.  They have been a waste of public money, detrimental to the unfortunate people condemned to live in them and they have helped to make the landscape more hideous than it need be.  That does not apply only to those houses in Kildare.  I could say a lot about the houses I have seen built around the country.  It would be a good thing for the people of the country, as a whole, if you had qualified men and a body governing their activities to whom you could refer.  If we could turn to the National University or the Institute of Architects and say: &ldquo;You have let loose on the unfortunate people a body of men, with your seal, purporting to be qualified and they have built these houses in Kildare, robbing the public by doing so, and destroying the landscape,&rdquo;<Col N="184" /> it would be very much in the national interest.</P>

      <P>In the case of trade unions, it is perfectly ridiculous that you can employ only a plumber who has been apprenticed to his father and who is, therefore, eligible to be a trade unionist.  If you employ one of these men and he makes a complete mess of the plumbing and ruins your house, you have no redress.  On the other hand, if you employ a man who has a natural-born skill&mdash;I believe that is possible in plumbing; it was what Senator Keane had in mind&mdash;you have the whole trade union organisation against you.  If, in carpentry or plumbing, you can only employ somebody recognised by the union, then the unfortunate victim should be able to turn round and say: &ldquo;You have certified this man as a plumber or carpenter and he has made a mess of my house.  You, as the recognised body in law, are bound to make amends for the harm done to me.&rdquo;  That is the position I should like to see with regard to architects.</P>

      <P>There the Minister is going on the bad line of thinking only of a section of the community instead of thinking of the well-being of all the people.  The Minister will not convert me to that unstatesmanlike attitude. I am interested in the welfare of the people as a whole.  At one time, when one went out of Dublin, one passed into charming country.  When you go out in any direction now, you find that the country is disfigured because of our being taxed more than we need have been for the provision of houses which are hideous to look at.  <i>De gustibus non est disputandum.</i>  Senator Sir John Keane does not like the Albert Memorial.  Possibly his father or grandfather regarded it as the most beautiful thing ever built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not interested only in the beauty of things.  I know a man who <Col N="185" /> told me personally how lucky he was not to have bought a new house in which he was at one time interested. He bought another house and shortly afterwards he noticed that the gable end of the house which he nearly bought had cracked right down.  That was a case of the speculative builder doing the thing on the cheap.  Everything is done to give these houses a good appearance but nothing is done to ensure that in a few years the people who have bought such houses will not find that they have made a bad mistake in buying them.  I personally want a higher standard in all these matters.  I admit that i ask that more from other people than from myself but I do know enough about human nature to realise that if by passing through a five years' course in the university and submitting to an examination in one of the hardest worked courses in the university at the end of that time, you can put up your plate outside your door and call yourself an architect, the people of the country are not left in the same unprotected state as if you could put up a plate outside your door and call yourself an architect without undergoing such a preparation.</P>
    <P>I think this is a matter about which there might be Government legislation. I remember a time when there used to be a jam jar bearing a label on which there was a guarantee that it contained nothing but pure fruit.  Sometimes in smaller print at the bottom of the label the words appeared: &ldquo;With a judicious admixture of fruit juice.&rdquo;  The position at the present moment is that you can label something that never got within half a mile of fruit as jam and the public are not protected.  When Senator Douglas talked about distinguished architects I rather groaned inwardly, because I have often heard ordinary laymen talking about distinguished architects and I knew that they were talking about people who had no qualifications in architecture at all.  Frequently, out of a certain perversity of my nature, I have tried to assume a surprised look and have said that I did not know that the person mentioned was an architect at all.  Certainly there was no reason why he should be called an architect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> I am sorry for one thing that the Minister is refusing to accept this Bill. If he had accepted it, I would have liked to have proposed certain more rigid provisions with regard to the limitation or protection of vested interests.  I do think that people should be allowed to know whether a man is a fully qualified architect having gone through a university course, whether he is the product of an institution or whether he is allowed to call himself an architect merely for the reason that he was practising in that alleged capacity for some years before.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he is not going ahead with this Bill.  I do not want to attribute any unworthiness of thought to the Minister, but I must say that I would require more than the remarks he made here to be convinced that he, who is not entirely devoid of intelligence, really believes that within a year we are going to have a proposition put forward by the Vocational Commission which is going to smooth the way for a complete Government re-arrangement with regard to professions.  I do not believe that the Minister thinks in his heart of hearts that the report, when it does come, is going to make a straw of difference in regard to the professions or that the Government would take any action in relation to these professions as a result of that report.  The Minister might have made certain criticisms of the Bill as put forward. He might have put forward a reasoned criticism of the statement made by Senator Douglas, but the one thing that discouraged me completely was his talk about the proposed report of the Vocational Commission.  The Vocational Commission to my mind in conception was not related to such an individual problem as is involved here. What the public certainly understood was that it was going to examine the steps that it would be necessary to take to order society in relation to the vocational activities of the people.  I do not think that it was related to the conferring of degrees, the institution of bodies governing the professional practice of their members or the registration of members of such bodies. I am prepared to take a bet with the <Col N="187" /> Minister here and now that in 24 months from now there will be nothing received from the Vocational Commission that will in any way affect the decision of the Government as to the action they should take in relation to the matter now before us.  Once the Government says that it is going to do nothing, we may assume that nothing will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>With the opening statement made by the Minister I find myself in very cordial agreement. The claim that can be made for this Bill was stated quite tersely and correctly by the Minister, namely, that the purpose and the justification of a Bill such as this is the protection of the public and not the protection of any profession.  That is the underlying principle governing the registration of members of other professions for which the principle of registration has been already established.  It is definitely set out in the Preamble to some of the Bills establishing these professional organisations.  I might quote, for example, the Preamble of the Medical Act of Britain, 1858, which underlies our Act of 1927.  Our Act was, indeed, merely a local application of the British Act of 1858.  The Preamble runs in this way:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As it is expedient that persons requiring medical aid should be enabled to distinguish qualified from unqualified practitioners, be it therefore enacted....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That seems to be the only justification for providing for registration of the members of any profession.  I think that Senator Douglas has established that, for the protection of the public, exactly the same system of registration is required in the case of architects as is required in the case of the medical or dental profession.  There are other professions very strictly controlled by methods of much longer standing, such as the two branches of the legal profession, but in cases in which action has been taken in the last 100 years, it has generally followed the lines proposed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not need to be convinced by Senator Douglas's argument because <Col N="188" /> I was convinced beforehand that protection was proper and necessary for the public in the case of the profession of architects in the same way as the other two professions I have mentioned. Its importance is different in kind.  In many respects the architect's work does not come so closely into our lives as the work of the medical or the dental profession, but it does come into the life of all of us to a certain extent and it is proper that people who desire to employ architects for any purpose should be in a position to recognise that there are certain architects who have undergone certain training, whose skill has undergone certain tests and to distinguish such people from others who, while they may possess considerable natural artistic ability which is capable of development, have not had the advantage of such training. Sir John Keane thinks that there is no difference between these two classes, but some people would prefer the man of practical experience while others would give their patronage to those who had specialised training.  It may be there are men of genius outside those who have been so trained.  But the present Bill will provide for people who have been carrying on practice as architects before the introduction of the Bill.  It can be no hardship on those entering the profession in future to provide that they must undergo a certain amount of training to fit them for the essentials of their profession. It is quite true that a man may go through any amount of training and still be a very inefficient architect or doctor, but there is a better chance that he will be a competent worker at his profession if he has undergone a certain line of training and has had a certain amount of experience, the nature of which would be decided on by persons competent to decide, with the view, as I suggest, of the interest of the public and not the interest of any class or profession.</P>
    <P>The present Bill differs in some respects, and I do not think to its advantage, from those that govern the professions of medicine and dentistry and, while I am entirely in support of the principle of the Bill that there should be a system of registration, I have some regrets that more attention <Col N="189" /> was not paid by the framers of this Bill to the legislation which, after considerable thought and considerable experience, has been adopted for those two other professions.  I think a more effective, more useful and workable measure would have resulted.  I trust the Seanad is not going to be deterred from studying this question and framing such a measure or putting it forward by the discouraging attitude of the Minister.  As I understood the Minister, all he did was to tell us to-day that the Government was not at present in a position to pledge itself to support or facilitate the passage of such a Bill through the Oireachtas.  I do not think that he suggested to the Seanad that it should refuse to consider the planning or drafting of such a measure based on the draft which Senator Douglas has introduced to-day. In fact, I think his advice went in the other direction.  I think a measure of that kind could be made very effective. I am not, of course, going into any detail in criticism of some of the clauses in the present Bill before us, but I notice that in many respects the architects' profession will be much more closely tied than is found necessary by experience in the case of the other professions I mentioned.  There are similarities between the Bills, but there are very great differences which require consideration.</P>
    <P>There are questions to be considered in the framing of the Bill also as to what extent practice of architecture should be carried on by persons other than those on the register.  Many people think that nobody can practise medicine or the healing art unless he is on the Medical Register.  Anybody is free to practise the healing art if he does not represent himself as being on the register or as being a qualified medical or surgical practitioner.  Senator Desmond Fitzgerald seems to have some very entertaining ideas of the licence enjoyed by members of the medical profession.  He suggested, whether seriously or not I was not able to make out, that members of the medical profession had a free hand to commit manslaughter, without question from anybody.  I can assure him that is not so.  A medical man can be indicted for manslaughter just as readily <Col N="190" /> as anybody else if he gives reason for it.  The reason that he is not indicted for manslaughter is that he so seldom gives reason for it; but that does not give him a licence to commit it. Almost the only privilege, if it is a privilege, that a registered medical practitioner enjoys is that he is bound to issue a certificate as to his opinion of the cause of death of a patient he has attended and he is bound to issue the certificate without charging any fees therefor.  It is true that a non-qualified medical practitioner is not bound to issue such certificate or, if he does, it is of no avail.</P>
    <P>One other point, which is a major point in the Bill which I hope we will come to discuss in detail, is the constitution of the board to control registration. I have no criticism of that board as a purely temporary instrument but I would have very grave criticism of it if such an instrument were to be proposed to control registration during future years.  A temporary instrument may be necessary until a register is established, but as soon as a register is established or as soon as may be after a register is established, I think the profession should, to a very large extent, control itself.  A board of the nature outlined in the Bill is not suitable to have control over future policy as to the conditions of education and as to the discipline of the profession.  It is a bureaucratic body almost entirely and in some respects where it is not altogether a bureaucratic body it seems to me to be hastily conceived and unworkable. However, I do not want to go into such details at present.</P>
    <P>I give every support to the principle of the measure that Senator Douglas has put forward, but many other details I would like to criticise.  I base my support of it entirely on the protection such a system of registration would give to the public.  There are other benefits in such a system of registration.  I base my support of it in the interests of the protection of the public and not the protection of any group of professional people, nor am I at all interested in it from the point of view as to whether it will facilitate <Col N="191" /> or impede the possible vocationalisation of society in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself to a large extent in agreement with Senator Cú Uladh.  It may be necessary in the first instance to state what an architect is.  Not only is he a person who makes a plan for a building or set of buildings but he is also a person who is charged with the duty of seeing that the building is properly constructed in accordance with the plan, that the proper materials are used, and that any alterations that are made are suitable.  So that an architect's function is greater than the function of what I think Sir John Keane might call an artist, that is, a person who makes a plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position with regard to architects in Ireland is that there is only one university institution in the 32 Counties which gives a degree in architecture, and that is University College, Dublin.  Those of us who are familiar with the work in University College, Dublin&mdash;I do not profess any familiarity with the work of architects &mdash;but those of us who are in University College, Dublin, know that the architectural students and staff are people who work very hard; that the course <Col N="192" /> is a long one and a difficult one, and that the degree is generally regarded as being very well worth while.  It is recognised in England by the Royal Institute of Architects there except, as Senator Fitzgerald has said, for an examination in professional practice. It is not a very serious difference as between the two bodies.</P>
    <P>Besides University College, Dublin, and its architects, there is also the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland.  In University College at present there are, I am told, about 97 students, and there are about 160 others in the Institute.  At the moment any person can use the title &ldquo;architect&rdquo;, and what the Bill proposes is to restrict the use of the title to trained persons.  I do not see how that principle could be objected to. Having restricted the use of the title to trained persons, the Bill does not propose&mdash;and it should be clearly understood&mdash;to compel anybody to employ a particular type of architect. Liberty is left to the public to employ any kind of person they choose, but the person who has not had a university training, or a training with the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, is not to be allowed to use the title &ldquo;architect&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is proposed then to control them by a board which is set up under Section 2.  I must say that I am not wedded in any way to particular provisions of the Bill.  I am interested merely in seeing that the public is properly served by having designated for it the people who can properly call themselves architects, the people who are trained, the people who, as Senator Sir John Keane has said, are skilled artists.  I will not go into that general question, but I think it elementary that no person finds himself in possession of skill of a high type from his birth.  He must be trained for it, and persons who do not subject themselves to the ordinary discipline of a university or other training of the kind, never become competent as artists, as writers, or even as poets, without practising the art over long and painful periods.  Senator Rowlette suggests that he is not satisfied with <Col N="193" /> the board.  I think the principal function of this House would be to accept the principle of registration of architects, if the House were agreeable, and then the matter could be further discussed, and discussed, as Senator Cú Uladh has suggested, very slowly.  If necessary, all interested parties could have their say, and a Bill could be presented to the Dáil after considerable discussion and, I presume, considerable compromise.</P>
    <P>The object of the Bill, therefore, is not to benefit architects, but simply to enable the public to recognise them. Senator Fitzgerald mentioned a number of ugly building schemes throughout the country.  I happen to know, from my contact with architects in University College, that not a single one of those schemes was designed by a university architect, nor do I think was any one of them designed by a person whom they would recognise as an architect at all.  The object of the Bill, therefore, is a public object and it must be remembered that local authorities over a long period of years now control building.  You cannot make any alteration to your house without applying to the local authority. There is also town planning and it is universally recognised as a sound public principle that there should be control of building, control of the kind of buildings which may be put up in particular places.  Surely when we have accepted that principle, as we have in our public legislation, we should go a step further and enable the public who are complying with that legislation to know what kind of person they can use in order to give them service which is based upon a particular type of training.  There is no suggestion in the Bill of giving particular people privileges, and Senator Douglas read out a very imposing list of countries in which registration has been adopted.</P>
    <P>I now come very briefly to the Minister's objection.  It is a familiar one&mdash; with the Minister&mdash;that the time is not ripe.  I have some sympathy with him at the moment in all his difficulties if he thinks this particular type of legislation will, so to speak, be planked down upon him, but I think the Government might be reassured that, <Col N="194" /> if this Bill were passed this evening, it would be some considerable time before it would reach the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would.  The Minister is, I think, quite misinformed when he speaks of the &ldquo;promoters&rdquo; of the Bill.  I do not know whether he uses the word in its technical sense as used in standing orders, but Senator Douglas is no more a &ldquo;promoter&rdquo; of this Bill than the Minister is the promoter of the Shop Hours Bill.  He is exercising his function as a public representative to bring in a public Bill for a public purpose and if the Bill were to pass its Second Reading now, I do not think any fees would fall to be paid or any expenses to be incurred by anybody.  The argument used by the Minister that there would be promoters and expenses has no validity, nor, I think, has his argument about the report of the Vocational Organisation Commission.  Senator Tierney said that the commission could not report within six months.  I think it will probably be found that the commission will scarcely report before 12 months, and, even if it did report, I do not think that any harm would be done to any possible report the commission might make by this House having taken steps to draw up a registration Bill for architects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senator Douglas is entirely correct, and I support him very strongly in his view, that the Seanad should do work like this.  In the nature of things we do not give the same lengthy and detailed consideration as the Dáil to finance or to Bills of that nature.  We never discuss Estimates, which occupy a considerable time in the Dáil.  Our powers are very restricted and we naturally have more time than the Dáil.  I think it would be a sound principle, which has not been adopted by the present Government and was not adopted by the present Government's predecessors, for us to discuss certain matters which are not of acute political concern and which are not urgent.  I think this Bill is not urgent in spite of what has been <Col N="195" /> said.  It has no political significance at all, and I think the House would be well advised and well fitted to discuss the matter, to reach a particular conclusion and then to pass it on to the Dáil.  I would not at all ask the Minister to stand up and give his benediction to the Bill and to say: &ldquo;Go ahead, and when it does pass the Seanad, I will back it in the Dáil.&rdquo; Far from that.  I think the Minister might not have thrown any cold water upon it, but that he might have taken the attitude: &ldquo;The principle is not a bad one, and, if the House gives the matter consideration through a Select Committee, hears objections to it and hammers out a Bill, there may be time in the Dáil to go into it.&rdquo;  I think that is all that the Minister and the Government are being asked to do.</P>
    <P>I recognise at once that the Government has a great many other irons in the fire at present besides having to take up this kind of thing, but that, I think, is the very reason why the Seanad should take it up and carry it considerably further than the Second Stage.  If it did that, I think it would be very useful.  So far as the principle of the Bill is concerned, I am entirely in favour of it and I suspect that the Minister himself is in favour of it. With regard to the report of the Vocational Organisation Commission, if this Bill were discussed and hammered out in detail, I think it could have nothing but a useful and profitable effect upon any report which that commission could possibly make.  I therefore suggest that it should pass the Second Stage, and that the passing of it on Second Stage should not be regarded as a victory or a defeat for anybody, but simply as a matter of our doing a job of work which we think ourselves competent to do, which falls to be done at present and which I think ought to be done, so that we might get ready for a situation when the time we spend now might be of a very great value indeed.</P>

      <P>I rise not so much to take part in the discussion on the Bill as to offer a few words of explanation in connection with my own position.  As the House is aware, I subscribed my name to this Bill in <Col N="196" /> order to facilitate its introduction; at least, it was represented to me that by assenting, its introduction would be facilitated.  I subscribed my name to it because it had also been represented to me, and I agreed, that the matter of the Bill was such as should receive the fullest discussion in the Seanad.  I want now to make my position clear. When I agreed to act as an assenter to the Bill, I made it clear that if time were not available, or circumstances not opportune for its discussion or for its acceptance by the Government, I should be relieved of all responsibility in connection with it.  As a matter of fact I foresaw difficulties at the time.</P>
      <P>I think my colleagues in the Seanad who also assented to the Bill will agree that these were the conditions under which I agreed to assent to the Bill.  In view of the Minister's statement which we have just heard, and in view of the fact that there are more urgent problems calling for the attention of the Minister and the Government, I feel that I must support the Minister in his attitude on the Bill.  I would like very much that the circumstances were different and that we could go ahead with it, but at the present time the whole order in legislation and Government matters should be one of strict discipline.  In matters of this kind, the Government must decide what is the course, and for me at any rate, when the course is indicated I feel that it is my duty to support the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinConlon" hpid="Mr. Conlon Mr. Conlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech of Senator O Buachalla has rather surprised me in view of the fact that he put his name to the Bill.  The Senator referred to the Minister's speech.  I do not think the Minister made any case which would justify Senator O Buachalla in adopting the attitude he has just indicated. But, I suppose he knows his own business best.  The Minister said he was not satisfied that Senator Douglas had made any case that the Bill would be in the public interest. He, or somebody else, suggested that possibly it was in the interests of some members of the Architects' Association. The fact that some section of that association might derive some benefit from it would not necessarily mean <Col N="197" /> that it would not be in the public interest. Personally, I think Senator Douglas made a very good case, from the point of view of the public interest, for the Bill.  I will leave it to Senator Douglas to deal with that aspect of the matter when he is replying.  The Minister also stated that he did not consider the passing of a measure of this kind was a matter of urgency. On that, Senator Douglas made at least two points of importance.  One was that large numbers of people may become unemployed due to the fact that this Bill will not have been passed and, secondly, that a certain number of architects may not be able to take up the work which it is thought will be available in plenty as soon as the war is over.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of the matter I would like to deal with.  More than four years ago, when the Bill under which this Seanad was set up, was going through the Dáil, it was suggested by the Taoiseach that arrangements would be made by which a vocational Seanad would be set up. Although this House is supposed to have been set up on a vocational basis, I think it will be admitted by everybody that such is not the case.  Various vocational bodies nominate representatives for election to this House.  Two Seanad elections have been held.  On the first occasion, when the vocational bodies nominated the persons they would like to see going into the Seanad to represent them, they found that, owing to the system of election in operation, there was no possibility whatever of their nominees getting elected; that there was no possible chance of anyone getting elected to the Seanad except persons who had the backing of one or other of the two big political Parties.  We were told, however, that arrangements would be made to bring about the object which it was said the Government had in view, but more than four years have elapsed since then, and nothing has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement has been made that if this Bill were passed other old-established vocational bodies would also expect to be put on a proper statutory basis.  What that statement amounts to is this: that the Government <Col N="198" /> do not want to be troubled or bothered to take up these matters. The point of urgency was not stressed by the Minister.  It surely is no argument against this Bill to say that if it were passed other old-established vocational bodies would be coming along seeking the same kind of statutory recognition. Even if they did so, I fail to see why they should not get it.</P>
    <P>I referred a moment ago to the fact that more than four years ago the Taoiseach indicated that the original intention was to have this House elected on a vocational basis.  Speaking in the Dáil on the Second Reading of the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Bill, 1937, on the 7th October of that year, the Taoiseach, in a reference to the Seanad suggested by the commission set up to examine the question of a Seanad formed on a vocational basis, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That undoubtedly could be got if our economic life was at the moment organised on a functional basis so that we could get representative functional bodies who could themselves directly elect on to the Seanad....  Unfortunately from the point of view of getting a different Second House (from the Dáil) we are not so organised.  If we should become organised in that way in the future, there is provision in the Constitution so that a measure such as we are now proposing could be amended to allow representative functional or organisational bodies, when formed, to elect their members directly on to the Seanad....  We are not organised in that way and, in the main, I think there are scarcely any statutory bodies to which we could hand over the power and the right to elect members directly on to the Seanad.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unless bodies, such as the architects, are established on a proper functional basis there will never be any chance of getting a Seanad elected such as the Government and the Taoiseach would seem to desire.  I put that point of view forward for the consideration of the Government.  I put it to them that they ought not to oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.  They may think <Col N="199" /> that some changes are desirable in it. Is so, they can put forward their case before the Select Committee which Senator Douglas has suggested.  That committee would have the power to examine persons and papers, and before it all details can be gone into. The committee will be able to decide whether or not any changes proposed are reasonable or otherwise, and it can be relied upon to come to proper decisions. I am strongly in favour of the principle of the Bill, and intend to vote for it.  I hope that the members on the opposite side of the House will also support the principle of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The few remarks that I have to make on the Bill are based largely on what I heard here this evening and on what I knew already.  I understand that Senator Hayes, in the course of his speech, said that the degrees conferred by the university here were recognised in England, but that the degrees of the Institute of Architects were not.  If our university degrees are recognised across the water, it seems to me that there is no great urgency in passing any further legislation.  I would like to have some information on the line of demarcation there is between the engineering profession and the profession of architects.  There seems to be no definite line of demarcation&mdash;at least, none was indicated to-day.  I understand an engineer can draw a plan of a house and deal with the sanitation and all the other requisites for the building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw attention to the fact that engineers also are not recognised by any statutory authority.  I should like to see the architectural profession put on a proper basis.  If they were, I believe it would be in their own interests as well as the interests of the general public.  I think there has been good reason for complaint.  You will find a person drawing up plans and subsequently you will discover when the <Col N="200" /> building is half constructed that it is defective in some way.  You have &ldquo;quackery&rdquo; in every profession, and as a member of a profession I object to &ldquo;quackery&rdquo;.  The State has to some extent recognised trade unionism.  The trade unions are guarded in this respect, that a man cannot get work unless he is able to produce his trade union card.  Professional and vocational bodies are naturally anxious that something similar should apply to them.</P>
      <P>I think we are all anxious to make this measure more comprehensive, to make it go further than dealing merely with architects.  It certainly should embrace engineers and other professions. We should put some distinguishing mark on professional bodies that require a university qualification and degree.  One point that occurred to me is that a degree granted by one body should be recognised by another. Apparently that is not the case.  If we were to establish an architects' institution along the lines suggested here, we would still be in the position that registration here would not be recognised across the water.</P>
      <P>I suggest that this discussion could well be postponed.  If we were to pass the Second Reading and proceed with the other stages here, and if the Bill were refused by the Dáil, we would not have gained very much; we would merely have wasted a good deal of time.  I suggest we should adjourn this discussion to a later date&mdash;perhaps Senator Douglas will agree to that&mdash; because otherwise we will simply be running against a stone wall.  I would far prefer a postponement of the discussion; at least we might have unanimity on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must congratulate Senator Conlon on what we might regard as his maiden speech here to-day.  I can well anticipate, as a sequel to our present discussion, an appeal from the auctioneers for registration.  That sort of thing would tend to widen our discussion a good deal if we agree to postpone it now and resume it at a more opportune time.  There is a necessity for the proper recognition of professional qualifications in other countries as well as in this country. <Col N="201" /> That would be all to the public good, because then people would not be imposed upon by persons not fully qualified to carry on undertakings that should be allotted only to genuine professional men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the suggestion made by the last Senator may be the saving of what may prove to be a very useful piece of legislation.  The Vocational Commission is sitting and we will probably have its findings made public in the course of the next few months.  In the circumstances, it is not asking too much to postpone this discussion for at least six months.  That would be a much better way than to have this Bill flung aside by the Minister and his Party.  Unless he is prepared to sponsor it as it goes from this House, there is very little use in going any further with it now.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to clarify the position of architects.  I suggest it should have a wider scope and include engineers and others.  It will then be of benefit to many people inasmuch as it will place them in a position to get employment. I think we could have a great measure of unanimity if this discussion were postponed and later, perhaps, the Bill could be extended to include certain findings of the Vocational Commission.  It is quite possible that certain findings of that commission will soon be made known, and the promoters of the Bill will have those things to guide them and there will be no clash of interests.</P>

      <P>So far as Senator Douglas's point goes, if and when the Bill is again being debated it might be possible at that period to pass the Second Stage and then it could be <Col N="202" /> amended to meet the requirements of the Vocational Commission.  I do not agree with Senator Madden when he says that the commission will probably go the way of all commissions and never be heard of again.  I do not think that is our experience.  I think our experience has been quite the opposite.  Practically all the commissions that have been set up have reported.  Some of them may have dragged along a bit, but as a general rule they have all reported and none of them has faded into oblivion.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the promoters of the Bill to adopt the suggestion made by Senator O'Donovan.  I think his suggestion was very reasonable.  Anybody who listened to the statement of the Minister will be convinced that that is the best policy.  There are various reasons why the Minister is not prepared to accept the Bill, apart from the possibility of running across the findings of the Vocational Commission. I think the last two speakers have given sufficient reasons for the adoption of Senator O'Donovan's suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to intervene to make the position clear.  The Vocational Organisation Commission is at present preparing its report.  This is a Bill for vocational organisation.  The sole purpose of the Bill is to arrange for the organisation of people following a particular avocation.  The body concerned in this Bill, the Institute of Architects, has made representations to the Vocational Organisation Commission and, I understand, put proposals before it &mdash;at least, I have seen a report to that effect in the paper.  It appears to me, therefore, that that commission is considering the representations made by the Institute of Architects and whatever proposals were submitted by that body, <Col N="203" /> and that it will comment upon them in its report, and I think we should wait until that report appears before enacting legislation relating to architects. If there is nothing in the commission's report relating to architects, as Senator Fitzgerald suggested might be the case, then this matter might be considered again, but if there is something in it relating to architects, I think the Government ought to have an opportunity of considering it before being asked to make up its mind on this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would put it to the Senator that the position is this: that while I do not want to influence the Seanad in its attitude on this Bill I want them to know what the attitude of the Government would be, and that is that I feel that the Government will not support the passage of the Bill through the Dáil unless and until the report of the Vocational Organisation Commission has been published, when the Bill can be considered in the light of that report. If the Seanad think that any useful purpose is to be served in proceeding with the Bill, knowing that it is going to fail to get a First Reading in the Dáil, then that is a matter for them, but I would strongly suggest that it would be better from everybody's point of view&mdash;the members of the Seanad who are interested and also others whose time and attention might be occupied in discussions on the Bill in the committee that has been suggested to be set up&mdash;that the whole matter should be allowed to stand over until we get the report of the Vocational Organisation Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened here very attentively to this debate and, as far as I see the general position, I did not hear any very strong argument in <Col N="204" /> favour of this sudden rush of legislation on behalf of a particular section of the community.  Nevertheless, there was one point that struck me forcibly, and I have no doubt that the Minister is particularly interested in it also, and that is that architects here have no right to practise in other countries, as the position stands.  On the other hand, as Senator Hayes, I think, said, the Institute in England has recognised the status of Irish architects of University College, Dublin.</P>
      <P>If that is so, there is a contradiction of arguments.  In any case, I have no doubt that all of us would be very anxious to do anything within reason that would help to raise the status and prestige of our architects, and we have some very distinguished men of that profession in this country.  On the other hand, every aspect of life here to-day requires further legislation of the kind Senator Douglas is looking for here to-night.  Take the case of the shopkeepers in this country.  I do not suppose there is a country in Europe with as many shopkeepers as we have. Instead of being an agricultural country we are a country of shopkeepers, and the whole system of shop-keeping is slipshod and uncontrolled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a commission on that also&mdash;for the registration of shopkeepers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but Senator Conlon, for instance, is interested in auctioneers, and they could put up a similar argument.  As a matter of fact, I remember that matter coming before the House some eight or ten years ago, but there is not a single section of the community here that does not require some sort of legislation or control&mdash;if either legislation or control is going to improve it one iota: personally, I do not think it is.  I think that Senator Sir John Keane struck the most original note here this evening when he said that legislation or registration is not going to improve either the standard or the ability of the architects, auctioneers or shopkeepers of this country.  Legislation does not do those things, and there is every possible sense and reason in the Minister's <Col N="205" /> point of view, which is that we should wait for the next few months until we get the results of the long and laborious study of these matters that is being made by the Vocational Organisation Commission in connection with every side of Irish life.  Then we could have sound criticism and constructive proposals, but do not let us have this sort of piecemeal thing for one section of the community and say that they must be looked after while everybody else is ignored.  I think Senator Douglas would be well advised not to push this Bill to a decision to-night and that he should let it remain over until there is more unity of investigation for all sections rather than push it to a division and, perhaps, get beaten on it and do no good.  Let us show patience.  The whole world is in a state of flux at the moment and we will be in a better position at the end of the year to examine every side of Irish life and reorganise our whole social and commercial life after we hear the proposals of the Vocational Organisation Commission. Apart altogether from any interest that I have in Government policy I am perfectly satisfied that the Minister's suggestion to do so is reasonable and I think we should adopt it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There is quite a number of matters that have arisen in the debate to which I should like to refer.  In the first place, I shall start by dealing with the end of the debate and completely disagreeing with Senator McEllin in thinking that we cannot deal with this because the world is in a state of flux in which it will not be in a year's time.  I am afraid I cannot share his optimism.  I may also say that I was interested to find in this debate an example of the fact that extremes sometimes meet, and this is not the first time that Senator McEllin expressed admiration for the views expressed by Senator Sir John Keane.  I <Col N="206" /> do not find myself, in this case, in agreement with either of them, as has occurred before.  Before I deal with this question as to what should be done with the Bill now, a few things were referred to which I think I ought to take this opportunity to reply.  I have no quarrel at all with the statement of the Minister.  He came here and warned the House that, in the present mind of the Government, there was no likelihood that even if we proceeded with this Bill and produced a good one, the Government would go on with it.  That does not perturb me one tiniest little bit.  In the first place, I am collecting quite a good list of proposals that were made here and rejected, that were afterwards adopted by the Government.  Consequently, I would not refuse to go on with the scheme because the Government at this stage were not prepared to go on with it.  I think that if I were the Government I probably would not be prepared to go on with it immediately, and, as I think I more or less indicated in my opening speech, I never expected that they would proceed with it immediately. What I do believe, and believe strongly, is that there is a number of measures, of which this is one, which it would be extremely difficult to get any Government to go on with, because there is a number of side issues&mdash;Senator O'Donovan mentioned one with regard to engineers&mdash;which will, I think, only be solved by getting a committee of responsible men, with power to send for persons and papers, who will invite in the opposition, and those who may have side interests, and see whether they necessarily clash, which they may.  They may quite possibly decide that this thing is impracticable, or may quite possibly bring forward something which would be more or less agreed, agreed at any rate as far as the relative interests are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I am convinced that if this House were wise&mdash;there has been no serious argument against the principle of the Bill in the House&mdash;it would pass the Second Stage.  At some time during the year&mdash;possibly not for six months, but the time could be hastened if events showed that there was <Col N="207" /> a necessity for it&mdash;it could be sent to a committee with power to send for persons and papers.  The matter has been complicated by the fact that this has been ruled to be a hybrid Bill.</P>
    <P>In view of the remarks made by the Minister, and my own remarks in the beginning, I want briefly to refer to that.  This was not introduced with the knowledge or even with the suspicion in my mind that it would be deemed to be a hybrid Bill.  I agree 100 per cent. with the statement of the Minister that private bodies have no right to come along and get registered unless they can make a case from the point of view of the public interest, and, without in any way questioning, having regard to precedents, the rulings that were made, I think that procedure should be changed, and that we should not have facilities for privately-controlled bodies to bring forward schemes of registration, but that if they are brought forward they should be brought forward as a public Bill. I am not sufficiently familiar with the circumstances of the introduction of legislation dealing with registration in the various countries which I have mentioned, but I have looked up a number of them and I found that they were dealt with as public matters.  Nowhere were they dealt with by any scheme of private legislation.  It is not disputed anywhere that this is a public Bill&mdash;a hybrid Bill is a public Bill&mdash;but by virtue of the ruling it has to go, if it passes the Second Stage, to a committee. I would respectfully suggest to the House that the wisest course with regard to this Bill would be to let the Second Stage pass, to let it go to the committee, where there may be people who will petition to be heard, and, when it comes back here, by consent to hold it up until such time as it seems worth while sending it to a committee with power to send for persons and papers.  I did not introduce this Bill for the purpose of agitation. I have not canvassed a member of the House to ask him to vote for this Bill.  I put it forward simply as a measure which I had become convinced was desirable.  It is not possible in the time available here <Col N="208" /> now to deal with all the arguments pro and con.  I am quite prepared to submit to what seems to the majority of the House to be the best course.  If the majority do not believe in the principle of the Bill, they should vote against it.  If they do believe in the principle, they ought not to vote against it.  It should hardly be put on me&mdash;somebody should move the adjournment of the debate <i>sine die</i>, if that is the considered opinion.  Personally, I think it would be very much better to let the Second Stage go without a division.  We need not move for any committee at the moment.  We could consider between this and February whether it was wise to let it go to the special committee as provided in the Private Bills Standing Orders, which need not necessarily be appointed to-day.  My suggestion is that we should let it pass the Second Stage now.  I give my word of honour that I will not move any further stage except after consultation with members, so that there will be no unpleasantness or anything of that kind. We could see then whether it would be wise, at some stage, to go further.</P>
    <P>Let me make myself clear; I am not at all convinced that this Bill, as it stands, would work.  It is a skeleton Bill.  It does not purport to be anything else.  I recognise that registration of engineers might have to be tackled, not I think in this Bill, but at some time in the near future, and that possibly the relationships between architects and engineers might have to be defined. At any rate, they would have to be considered.  I believe that the way to do that is to get responsible architects and engineers might have to be defined. At any rate, they would have to be considered.  I believe that the way to do that is to get responsible architects and responsible engineers before a committee of this House, a select committee which has power to have conversations with them and hear their views, and see whether it is possible to find a way by which either the House might ultimately have two Bills or might have one Bill which dealt with both.  I think two Bills would be preferable. If we simply sit and do nothing, and particularly if we simply adjourn this debate, the effect will be that there is no preparatory work done at all.  The Minister is not convinced; he could not be expected to be convinced <Col N="209" /> in such a short time.  No one can prophesy what is going to happen after the war.  Certainly, no one can estimate when the war is likely to end.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that there is nothing at the present time to indicate any hope for its early conclusion. Unfortunately, I lived through another great war, and six months before its conclusion I thought it was going to last very much longer.  I do not think the circumstances are the same now, and I agree with the Taoiseach, but having regard to the position, and, to my mind, the strong desirability of pressing for full reciprocity of recognition, I think it would be extremely well if some of those points had been discussed.  While the war is on, and while there are acute shortages and acute difficulties, I do not think that the Government of the day&mdash;and particularly the Minister who happens to be Minister for Industry and Commerce and Minister for Supplies&mdash;will have time or ought to be expected to have time to deal with the matter, and I think it is the function of this House to do this kind of work.  That is not a new idea of mine.  It is about 19 years since I first became a member of the Seanad.  I have introduced and I have taken active part in a number of Private Members Bills, several of which were defeated and several of which became law.  None of them, whether it was passed or defeated, dealt with matters which created any Party controversy.  I clearly remember Senator T. Johnson, in close cooperation with the late Senator Browne, introducing the Town Planning Bill.  The Committee sat for a long time.  To the best of my recollection, we were told on the Second Stage&mdash;if we were not, I know that we knew&mdash;that the then Government would not promise to go on with the Bill.  They were not opposed to the principle of town planning, but they were very busy, and they certainly would give us no promise.  The committee, as I have said, sat for a long time.  They produced something very different indeed from that which had been introduced by Senator Johnson. Eventually they sent it to the Dáil, and it lay there for two or three years, but <Col N="210" /> the result was the Town Planning and Regional Act.  There was no question of hostility to the Government of the day.  It was simply a matter that was not taken on Party lines.  It resulted in a measure which I think some day will require further amendment, and which I do not think has worked as well as it might, but a measure which was at the time a very great step forward.  I see no reason why the same thing might not happen with this Bill.</P>
    <P>I did not altogether follow Senator Buckley in his remarks; I did not know exactly what he meant.  If he was referring to the fact that, as far as Senators in this House were concerned, it was clearly understood that this was a non-Party measure, and that there was to be no attempt to beat the Government or anybody else with it, then I entirely and absolutely agree with it.  That was always the understanding. That was the spirit in which I introduced it.  That is the spirit in which I am speaking now, and it is in that spirit that I would urge the Seanad to let the Second Stage pass, and let us afterwards discuss whether we should send it to any committee at all.  I think I would send it to the committee necessary under the hybrid Bill procedure, and stop there for the present. That means that there would be a Bill there at any rate.  At a further stage we can see whether we should send it to a Committee with power to send for persons and papers, a matter on which I have an open mind in view of the attitude of the Government.  At any rate that course would very largely meet the attitude here.  A number of us are in favour of the principle of the Bill.</P>

      <P>If a Select Committee is appointed, it will have power to send for persons and papers.  The committee will sit and there will be light and accommodation required and some incidental expenses incurred. If the Senator is assuming that there are fees payable, I am not aware of any fees being payable in connection with a public Bill.  That may be a matter of dispute. As to whether I and the other three Senators should be held to be promoters, I do not accept that position for a moment.  At any rate, I cannot accept it, unless there is a legal decision.  I had no intention of raising this matter, but the Senator has asked me.  I think the privilege of members to introduce public Bills is concerned in any such suggestion and I am not worried about it. At any rate, the passing of the Second Stage would not involve even the promoters, if any, in expense.  My own personal view is that if a Minister introduced a Bill which turned out to be a hybrid Bill, he could no more be held personally liable for fees than could an ordinary member of the Seanad.  I did not want to raise that now, but the Senator pressed me on the question of fees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If it went to a committee, either a Joint Committee or, if the other House did not concur, to a Special Committee, as set out in Standing Order No. 121 in connection with Private Bill procedure, there would be expense for anybody who petitioned to be heard, but no one is obliged to do so.  I suggest that we should not decide to-day whether or not it should go to that committee.  I should like time to consider that further, having regard to the circumstances. It may be that it should not. At any rate, if it passes the Second Stage, I would not move to send it to a committee, but that the question of a committee should be simply left over without any decision by the House at all, so that we might have an opportunity <Col N="212" /> of discussing with experienced officials, and perhaps with members, as to whether at the next meeting we should move that it should go either to a Joint Committee or a Special Committee.  But, at any rate, it can be agreed that there is no question of this House committing itself to pressing this Bill and starting a quarrel with the Dáil, because that would be contrary to the spirit in which the Bill was introduced. It would be the height of folly, in any case, so far as I am concerned.  I may be futile sometimes, but I am never deliberately futile, and I certainly do not want to be led into any such position.</P>
      <P>There is another point I should like to make with regard to recognition.  So far as I understand it, the degree of the National University is not one of the degrees which is accepted under the British Acts for registration.  But, if an Irishman becomes a member of the British Institute, he is then entitled to be registered as a member of the British Institute.  I am not quite clear as to whether he can become a member of the Institute as of right, but he can have his name put up for election if he is a Bachelor of Architecture of the National University and if he submits to another examination, which I understand is in professional practice. That is subject to correction, but I believe that is the case.  That is not contrary to what Senator Hayes stated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that in my opening statement.  I read portions of my original speech and there were portions which I did not read.  But, in that case I read it, because I was particularly anxious that I should not make any mistake.  In conclusion, I think it will be doing the Commission on Vocational Organisation the greatest possible disservice if it is going to be used as a whip to prevent legislation.  That, of course, has been done with all the best commissions in England.  It should be possible, surely, within a reasonable time, if the matter became more urgent, to find out by inquiry if it is in any sense the <Col N="213" /> intention of the Vocational Organisation Commission to deal with the matter which is the subject of this Bill. The Minister referred to the fact that the Royal Irish Institute of Architects gave evidence before that commission. He seemed to think that that indicated that the commission would report on that evidence and that it would have a bearing on registration.  I gave evidence before that commission in two capacities&mdash;I was president of one of the organisations and vice-president of the other at the time&mdash;and I do not believe for a moment that they wanted any more than to get a general survey of the organisations that existed at present in order to have it on their records.  If, on the other hand, the Minister has reason to think that we may get from that commission possibly an outline of a scheme for the registration of architects, another scheme for the registration of engineers, and so on, then I would be inclined to give way and wait, but I think we should only wait to the extent of not losing anything by it.  I certainly would be sorry to accept the suggestion that the report would be turned out in six months.  Personally, I have not any hope of its being issued and printed in six months.  If the Government get it in six months they will be doing very well.  If the Government have it printed and published in six months they will beat the record for speed for Government commissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The war may go on as long as I am afraid it will go on; but if by any <Col N="214" /> chance there are signs of its coming to an end earlier, I think the Government should very carefully consider whether they should not endeavour to get a reciprocal arrangement.  In conjunction with that, they may find out&mdash; as I am advised is very desirable&mdash; that there should be registration in this country at the same time in order to strengthen their position, and particularly that the powers, which I have not gone into in detail, but which are set out in No. 3, should be made law. I am in the hands of the House.  So far as I am concerned, I am not a bit anxious to be in a hurry.  In any case, I never intended that the Bill should go through in less than six or nine months.  I ask the House to let the Second Stage go through and, having clear regard to the Minister's attitude, we can then have some conversations and decide whether we should or should not have a further Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in the opinion of Seanad Eireann it is an urgent national necessity that the Government should increase the minimum price for the 1942 wheat crop to 50/- per barrel and should make an immediate announcement to that effect</P>
      <P>I am asking for something which is obviously so reasonable and so sensible that I feel the Minister might cut this debate very short by intimating that he proposes to accept the motion.  If the Minister is not so disposed now, what I have to say will be said in a manner which, I hope, will indicate that at least I am anxious that this discussion should be conducted in a calm, straightforward and frank manner, and that all the facts should be examined coldly and logically.  Food for humanity is something that, I suppose, was taken so much for granted in normal times, that we treated food producers in a rather thoughtless and haphazard way, but food has now become such a vital necessity of the human race, from Vladivostock to the Islands of Aran, and all countries are so disturbed and troubled in the struggle to obtain food for their people, that here in this calm and peaceful island we should be very grateful for the opportunity that was given us to provide ample food for all our people, and should understand that it was only the limitations which were imposed that prevented us from doing so.  I have asked that this question should be examined calmly and fairly.  At this stage I should say that the problem of food production, particularly in relation to wheat, has not been treated as fairly by the Government as I think it should have been.  Any subject that is of vital importance to the life of the nation in times like these should be examined impartially by the Government and by the people concerned.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that a certain attitude has been adopted, at least on the part of some members of the Ministry. I am raising the point now so that the Minister for Agriculture may have a chance of disabusing my mind, and the minds of many farmers, of a feeling they have, as to the attitude of the Ministry.  I have the feeling that the Ministry are not quite happy about the possibility of getting ample supplies of food provided by farmers under the conditions that exist, and that a sort of subtle campaign is being carried on that is unfriendly to farmers, and that is not helpful from the point of view of the Ministry or the nation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest when you have the Minister <Col N="217" /> for Supplies making statements like those that he recently made in our national Press, indicating that &ldquo;grain difficulties were due to the withholding of grain to an extent beyond anything anticipated,&rdquo; he may have information that I have not got.  The Minister for Agriculture may also have it.  I should like to be told on what facts that statement was based.  I should like to be told on what facts the people who sat at tables in Merrion Street or elsewhere in Government buildings in this city made their calculations as to the quantities of grain which our farmers were to turn into the food pool of the nation this year.  I suggest that the farmers are not withholding quantities of grain.  I suggest that the calculations which have been made were faulty in themselves.  I suggest in addition that the quantities of wheat which it has been asserted are being held by the farmers do not exist and that to urge, as some Ministers are doing, that the farmers are unnecessarily and unreasonably witholding quantities of grain is hardly in accordance with the facts, or at least it is half the truth only.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that, there is the other consideration which has been advanced in this House by me and others on this side of the House in various motions since war came to the world. That is the consideration that if you want to get food produced in sufficient quantities you have got to pay the producers a reasonable price.  I have put down various motions towards that end.  As soon as the first Tillage Order was made, I urged as strongly as I could that you have got to give the farmers a guaranteed minimum price. I am sure the memories of my colleagues on the left side of the House are not so short that they have forgotten that they voted that in their judgment the Government could not do that.  Wisdom came to the Ministry later and they discovered that they could fix a minimum guaranteed price. The view of many of us was then, and is to-day, that these prices are too low and, to the extent that any grain which is available for the market is being withheld at the moment, it is due entirely to the fact that the remuneration when the grain is put on the market <Col N="218" /> is not sufficient to justify the farmer putting it there.</P>
    <P>What troubles me about the attitude of the Ministry is that while it is permissible for a Minister to say that the farmers are withholding stocks of grain from the market, and to publish that statement in the Press, it is apparently not permissible to say that the farmers are not putting their grain on the market because the farmers think they are not getting the real worth of the grain.  In other words, the Press may say that the farmers are not doing justice to the community because they are withholding supplies of grain, but the community are not to be told that the farmers would put the grain on the market, any grain they have as surplus, if they were paid more money.  I do not know how much the Minister for Agriculture knows about it, but some of his colleagues know that there is a censorship to-day which is terribly unjustified with regard to any discussion relative to the price of grain.  Here is the sort of thing you get from the censor.  I suggest that none of us anticipated when the order was made and when we assented to it, that the censor would use his powers in this way.  I never believed he would use his powers in regard to matters of internal policy as between what the Government proposed to do and what others desired to have done.  That the censor would act in this fashion never occurred to any of us.  We subscribed to the proposal to give him these powers in complete ignorance of the fashion in which they were going to be used.  Here is a paragraph which was censored.  I am aware of the fact that it is but one of a number of instances in which the strong hand of the censor came down to prevent any discussion of prices through the Press. &ldquo;Belatedly,&rdquo; this man writes, &ldquo;the price for next season's wheat has been raised to 45/-.  Let us hope not too late for winter sowing.  Several farmers whom I have met think that at this price not nearly enough will be grown and that we shall have to try to import more at considerably greater cost. Hence there is great force in Mr. Martin Corry's proposal, which practically amounts to this: in addition to the 45/-, guarantee the farmers an <Col N="219" /> added bonus approaching 5/- as the farmers got nearer to producing 100 per cent. of our requirements.&rdquo;  I do not know where the mischief is in that, if it is not the reference to the fact that the 45/- offer came too late or the doubt expressed that it is enough to get us to grow wheat up to our requirements. But even if there were mischief in it from that point of view, I think that for the Government to use its powers of censorship to prevent any discussion through the Press of price in regard to the growing of wheat is a grave injustice to the nation and to the people of the nation.  The Government's view, as expressed up to the present, is that the price of wheat at 45/- per barrel is sufficient remuneration for the farmer.  They are not permitting anybody to tell us that it is not sufficient.  They are not permitting anyone to say anything publicly through the Press to the contrary.  The facts are, as far as any of us knows&mdash; and if I misstate the position I can be contradicted&mdash;that there is no evidence whatever that the area put under winter wheat so far is anything approximating to what was put under winter wheat 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>The policy pursued by the Ministry has the effect that while in fact the farmers are not putting their land under wheat&mdash;and they are not putting their land under wheat because, in the judgment of many of them, the price offered is not sufficient&mdash;they are not permitted publicly to say anything as to why they are not doing it.  We are all sailing blandly along, the Ministry knowing the facts and the farmers believing that they are justified in pursuing their present policy, but the net result for the nation will be that the supplies of wheat will not be available; food will not be available. Any of us who look to the future consequences of such a policy cannot feel happy with that attitude on the part of the Ministry or that the ruthless hand of the censorship in this matter of price in relation to wheat is sound.</P>
    <P>I think the sooner the Minister looks into that question from the point of view of agriculture the better, because it does not make sense.  We ought to <Col N="220" /> be in a position to say publicly that we think such and such a price is not enough for the goods we have to sell. This is an internal problem, between ourselves.  If we are sellers and other people are buyers, and if we are not selling because we are not getting enough, or if we are not producing a particular commodity because we think it will not bring the cost of production, we ought to be able to say publicly why we are not doing it.  We ought not to be put in the position of being misunderstood and misrepresented to the people who want our commodity.  They ought to know why it is not available to them.  Justice is not being done the nation unless that information is available to all.  I suggest that the Minister ought to concern himself very seriously about the attitude of the censor in this matter. I have considerable experience of it, into which I do not want to go at any great length.</P>
    <P>I have said already that I think it will not be disputed that the area under wheat up to the present is considerably less than the area under wheat last year.  Apparently 290,000 tons of wheat were expected from the home crop.  I presume the Minister will give us the correct figures, as far as he has got them, as to what the results have been.  It is estimated that we have got somewhere around 200,000 tons.  I suggest there were miscalculations. I do not know that any great stocks of wheat are being withheld but I am concerned, as we all must be concerned, about what the future holds for us.  I do not accept, and I do not think any other sensible, normal person will accept, that the farmers are refusing to grow wheat out of cussedness or out of laziness or for any of the other slanderous reasons which are repeatedly advanced as to why the farmer is not managing his land in a particular way.  From my experience of farmers, I think the farmer would do anything for which he was paid a reasonable price.  He would produce any commodity that his land could produce and he would engage in any sort of menial, arduous toil if he could see that there was reasonable remuneration for his efforts.</P>

      <P>He will do it to-day just as he has done it in the past.  The standard of living of the farmers in this country is not high.  We do not see any great prospect of its being considerably raised by putting a greater area under wheat.  Farmers, just like the rest of the people of this country, live on a cash economy.  The farmer of this country is not like the Bulgarian peasant.  He cannot take a sack of wheat or bag of potatoes, or couple of stones of oatmeal on his back and go into the bank with it to send to the Land Commission or to give it to the rate collector.  He cannot exchange it for boots or clothes for himself or his children.  He cannot even exchange it for a bag of sulphate of ammonia to fertilise his field.  He has got to get cash for anything he has to sell, and, accordingly, whatever he is going to produce he measures in terms of cash. The net result is that the farmer, like anybody else, looks at his farm and asks himself what can each field grow&mdash; how many tons of any particular crop. He asks what are the prices per ton, if he is going to cash it or translate it into food for his own farm.  The farmer, wanting to get cash, decides for himself that a particular crop or a particular method of farming will give him more than another method, even though the experts advise something else, or even though the patriots advise something else.  Can you blame him for determining that it pays better to grow oats and barley than to grow wheat if the experience of growing wheat, oats and barley for a year or two shows him that there is more cash in oats or barley?  What are the facts to-day?  In the markets on Monday in my town, oats were sold at 2/-, 2/2 and 2/3 a stone.  If I had a bag of wheat to sell and brought it into the market, I could not take more than 2/-, and nobody could offer me more than 2/- for it.  Tons and tons of oats have been sold in that market for the past couple of months.  It has been sold from 1/10 to 2/3 per stone, and the price of wheat is only 2/- per stone.  There is not a farmer that I know who can be got to grow wheat to sell at 2/- a stone if oats will bring him 2/- or 2/3.  When we are measuring the possible yields <Col N="222" /> from different crops, we come to the conclusion that we have got to get more for growing wheat than we must ask for growing oats.  We have to-day that anomalous position.  If you like you may call it a black market, but those are the facts.</P>
      <P>My motion suggests that the price of wheat should be raised to 50/- per barrel.  I am not going to say that the price of 45/- per barrel offered by the Minister is a bad price.  It is not, and in normal times it might be regarded as the very contrary.  I am not going to measure the price of 45/- a barrel against the wheat of the Canadian prairies, even if it were dollar wheat. I do not know that we can ever compete with that.  As I say, I do not suggest that 45/- is a bad price, but I think the Minister and the Government made a mistake. In the first instance, they advanced the price of wheat by 1/- a barrel, and then by a further 4/- per barrel.  Had they taken the leap which they should have taken, and raised the price from 40/- to 50/-, it would have made a very big difference.  I do not think that 50/- would be a great price, but I do not put myself, on the other hand, in the position of those who demand 60/- and say that they must get it or they will not grow wheat.  I think 50/- would be reasonable.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether that price would have given us all the wheat we require or not, but I think that 50/-, decided in October last, would have made a tremendous difference.  Had it been offered at the end of September, the area under wheat to-day would probably be 100,000 acres, or perhaps 200,000 acres, bigger than it is, and the whole attitude and mentality of the farmers to wheat growing would be different.  What would it amount to? Let us accept that 390,000 tons represent our full requirements.  If we put 5/- per barrel on to the present price, my calculation in respect of 390,000 tons is that it would mean an extra £780,000.  That is all it would amount to.  What are the facts and where is this sum to come from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us assume for the moment that every cent of that sum would come from the consumers who are of the non-farming <Col N="223" /> community, and let us look at the picture then.  I have here what must be regarded, in the absence of anything more authentic, as the authentic figures of our national income up to 1940-41.  It is the work of Professor Duncan who calculates, in a report published in the journal of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society in 1940-41, that our total national income from industry, agriculture, personal service and everything that can be included as national income, apart from the income from abroad, amounted to £167,000,000.  That amount was divided into £106,000,000, representing the national income of the non-agricultural section and £60,000,000 the national income of the agricultural section.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at it further and to realise that the £106,000,000 represents the income of approximately 1,043,000 people and the £60,000,000 the income of 1,923,000 people.  That means that 1,923,000 people got £60,000,000 for their services and 1,043,000 people got £100,000,000 for theirs.  There is a vast difference between the national incomes of the two groups, and if anybody suggests to me that the transfer of this extra £780,000, which would be the cost imposed by an additional 5/- per barrel, to the people who got the £106,000,000 is going to make a tremendous difference to them, I will not accept it. There is this fact anyway, that if they have to pay it, it will be paid to their own countrymen.  It will not make any of these countrymen rich and it will be kept within the country, and, if it is spent, it will be spent within the country.  I believe that it would do this great good, that it would change the mental attitude of many of our farmers to the whole question of wheat growing.  It would enable me and others who think with me, and have thought with me on this subject all along, to go out in support of the Minister and the Government and of all who are pressing the policy of grow more wheat on the people.</P>
    <P>We do not find ourselves in that position to-day, and we do not find ourselves in that position because we have <Col N="224" /> ordinary experience.  I tried to grow some wheat last year.  It did not do very well.  It was sown under favourable conditions and the work was very well done indeed, but when spring came I had half a crop.  I do not like to look at half crops of anything.  I did not know what to do and I did what somebody perhaps less foolish or less anxious to experiment would have done.  I sowed oats through the wheat. I harrowed it down and I reaped quite a good mixed crop.  My next-door neighbour had also sown wheat practically adjoining mine.  The crop was even worse than mine, and had to be ploughed up, and potatoes sown there. On an estate adjoining my land on the other side, where there were over 100 acres of tillage, all the winter wheat crop had to be ploughed up.  If it were possible to examine conditions all over the country, it would be interesting to see how far this position persisted throughout the country.</P>
    <P>That all represents extra cost.  There are risks involved in the production of wheat of considerable dimensions and very difficult to measure and these all have to be taken into account.  The net result in this case is that neither of my neighbours, up to the moment at any rate, have sown any winter wheat, either on the 100 acres, on one side or the smaller farm, on the other.  I have a much better appearance of a crop this year than last year, and I have more than twice as much done.  That is my own experience, and so, when we talk to farmers and tell them about what they ought to do, we must remember that when farmers have had practical experience of the risks and losses involved, they have to get something which will mean security to them when they have to take risks.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there are more risks involved in attempting the growing of a wheat crop than any other cereal and it is quite clear, too, that the yields are not capable of being calculated. It seems to me that somebody sat down at a table with clerks and said: &ldquo;We have so many acres under wheat and we are going to get so many barrels per acre.  What will the total yield be?&rdquo;, but when we went to do <Col N="225" /> the threshing, we did not get the barrels per acre.  I think it is there that the mistake was made.  It is not that the farmers are withholding the wheat, but that it is there that the chickens were counted before they were hatched.  If we are to get wheat for the coming year, it is going to be very difficult at this stage to get all we want, but I suggest that we had better be wise in time about what we attempt.  There could be nothing more dangerous to the whole position of our food supply than to attempt to put a greater area under tillage in spring than we shall be able to harvest.  Anybody who takes a short run through the Six Counties will see there hundreds and hundreds of acres of crops&mdash;and I said this earlier in the House&mdash;and, I think, thousands of acres of crops which were never harvested.  They sowed in that case more than they could reap, and we here could do exactly the same thing.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will probably appreciate that point, and I impress on him that there are physical limitations to what farmers can do.  We did not get a great deal of assistance last harvest.  I could have done no more myself and I do not know any of my neighbours who could have done anything more, and, but for the fact that we were blessed with a marvellous harvest, we would not have garnered in as much as we did.  It would be a great error of judgment on our part to drive our people into putting a greater area under the plough in spring this year than we shall be able to reap later on. It is something about which we must be very careful, because having to cut two or three extra acres of grain at a time when you should be harvesting other crops may cause you to lose all. Anybody who has experience knows that as well as I do.  Therefore I urge that we should be rational and reasonable, because we have to measure our capacity to sow more by our capacity to reap it&mdash;by the amount of labour available&mdash;and, in addition, we have to measure the fertility content of the soil.  With all these limitations, I think the Government are very unwise in not doing one thing, anyway, and that is, putting the price up so high that it will be attractive.  I think it <Col N="226" /> will be shown here that there is no profit whatever in growing wheat at 42/- a barrel.  I do not know if there is any profit in it at 50/- a barrel: that even at that price there is a living in it for the people who engage in the occupation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in his speech at Navan on Monday last, addressed himself at very great length to this question of wheat growing.  I think it is a matter that gravely concerns all of us, that when the Taoiseach or any Minister addresses himself to this or any other problem before a meeting of farmers he should make statements which are incontrovertible.  The Taoiseach said that a number of excuses for not growing wheat were put forward.  &ldquo;They were told that it was a very severe crop on the land, but he was now told that the most recent experiments had shown quite the contrary. From scientific examinations, not merely hearsay, wheat was one of the lightest crops from the point of view of taking plant nutriment from the soil&mdash;lighter than any other crop except barley.&rdquo;  That is a new one for me.  If the Minister for Agriculture has this marvellous expert who proclaims that wheat is the lightest crop in absorbing fertility from the soil, he should tell the House who he is.</P>

      <P>I think it is really tragic, when you are discussing problems relating to agriculture, to find that when experts give opinions their opinions are not related to the facts that are known to practically every farmer.  There is nothing more disastrous, in my opinion, to the future of agriculture in this country than that we should discover that the experts are at fault.  This is a question that I want answer to: If what the Taoiseach said be true, why is it that there is not more wheat being grown in a great many of the counties?  This policy of <Col N="227" /> growing wheat has been pursued with a patriotic fervour not second to that behind any other policy ever advocated in this country.  Take the County of Leitrim which is two to one in support of the Government policy. In the year 1940 the area under wheat in that county was 360 acres.  This is what I want the Minister to answer: If wheat takes less fertility from the soil than, say, a crop of oats, why is it that the farmers of Leitrim are not growing wheat rather than oats?  Why is it that they only grew 360 acres of wheat in a county where they probably have 11,000 holdings?  I think nobody accepts the statement made by this expert. I doubt if the Minister accepts it.  I would like to hear Senators on either side of the House say what they think about it.  From my own personal experience, I can say that it is not a fact.  I regret that anybody, on whose behalf it can be urged that he is an expert, should commit himself to such a fallacious statement as that.  Anyway, it is something that is not accepted by our farmers.  The strange thing is that when the Taoiseach referred to the excuses put forward for not growing wheat&mdash;that it was the severest crop on the land&mdash;he never once adverted to the question of price, although the Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach know, perhaps better than I do, that it is the question of price that is the excuse.  Indeed, it is not an excuse at all.  It is the fundamental fact in the whole position, a fact which should not have been evaded by the Taoiseach.  I should like to know if the Taoiseach did discuss the question of price, and if he, too, was censored. Could we have some information on that?  When the Taoiseach discusses excuses put forward by farmers, I suggest that he ought to discuss all the excuses. In my opinion the one he referred to is not an excuse at all, but a very good reason why farmers were not growing wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach then came to another point.  He referred to the position with regard to artificial manures, and said that was no excuse for refusing to grow wheat because if they put the wheat in &ldquo;their statistics showed that <Col N="228" /> this year they had an acreage far in excess of 650,000 under manured root crop and they could put the wheat into that land.&rdquo;  If they did that, the Taoiseach said they would have ample supplies of wheat.  I would like the Minister, or Senators on either side or the House to go down to the poor farms in my own county, in Leitrim. Monaghan, Donegal, Kerry, Clare or elsewhere: to go down to the farmers on the hillsides of Cavan who had good potato crops last year, and tell them that they had better put their land under wheat than under oats.  If they do, they will get their answer from them.</P>
    <P>I heard the Rev. Chairman of our county committee of agriculture inform the committee that in a field a farmer sowed wheat and oats.  In the portion of it in which the wheat was sown he had no crop at all, but in the other portion he had a splendid crop of oats. That man lost a crop on his manured land by putting wheat in it because apparently the soil was not able to produce the crop.  Therefore I say that the Taoiseach, in asking our farmers to sow wheat on our manured ground, is asking the impossible.  I imagine that half the manured ground in the country is on the poorer soils where wheat cannot, advisedly, be grown.  The probability is that if it is put in on such land you are not going to have more than half crop, so that the total net food yield will be much less than a reasonably good crop of oats.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach further on said that to help out &ldquo;he would ask farmers to eat less bread and to substitute other foods in their dietary.  This was easier for a farmer than for a town dweller. Potatoes were an excellent substitute, and where a farmer had potatoes and milk there was no fear of hunger.  He would ask the farmers to be as sparing as possible in their use of food that was particularly useful in the city.&rdquo;  We have it now that the farmers themselves can go on potatoes three times a day and produce wheat and send it in to the towns.  I suggest that is not the proper kind of approach to this problem&mdash;to urge farmers to produce a crop for the people in the cities and towns <Col N="229" /> and to adopt a lower standard of diet for themselves.</P>
    <P>Further on the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;Remember human beings will come first, and if there is any shortage the animals will have to go in this country as they had to go in other countries.&rdquo; There, again, I urge that that is a completely mistaken understanding of the psychology of the farmer: to tell him that if he does not do so his animals will have to go as they had to go in other countries.  I think nothing could be more disastrous to the policy that we want to see carried out than to tell the farmers that their animals will have to be killed off.  In the first place, I do not know that it is practical, or how it would be carried out, and if a policy is not practical it ought not to be urged.  Anyhow, it is a bad line to take&mdash;to suggest that we are going to have to kill more animals. Goodness knows, we have had more than enough of that in the past 12 months.  It was a costly and expensive business, but I suppose it was unavoidable, but surely we do not want to have to face that sort of thing again.</P>
    <P>Is there not this added consideration &mdash;to the extent that we lower our animal population, especially at times like these, when fertilisers are no longer available, are we not reducing very considerably the quantity of farmyard manure which is requisite for the growing of any crops?  We are able to go in for additional tillage, to plough and manure fresh land only to the extent that we are able to add to the numbers of live stock we have, and the greater the numbers of live stock we are able to maintain, the more manure we will have on our farms and the more land we will be able to put under the plough.  These are vital and important facts and they ought to be carefully weighed by public men before they make speeches.</P>
    <P>Further down, the Taoiseach said that the farmers would be very foolish to try to be like the boy with the nuts, endeavouring to grasp too much.  That is the only reference the Taoiseach made to price.  I think 60/- a barrel is an unreasonable price to ask, and it is not wise to ask too much.  I think the Minister has had this advice, not alone from the beet growers' organisation, <Col N="230" /> but from his Consultative Council, that 50/- a barrel would be reasonable and would get him all the wheat he requires.  It is not a sensible policy for the Taoiseach to urge that the farmer is not wise to act like the boy with the nuts, trying to grasp too much.  The farmer in asking for 50/- is not asking too much.</P>
    <P>Towards the end the Taoiseach read a letter he had received from a Limerick farmer.  This Limerick farmer was urging that the Taoiseach should ask the Bishops of the Church to encourage the people to recognise their moral obligations to grow wheat.  It is true that the Bishops have urged the farmers to do their best.  I am prepared to accept that the owner of land has certain moral obligations to the community.  That is a fact which we cannot side-step, but this also should have been added by the Taoiseach when he declared his opinion as to what he would like the Bishops to do&mdash;and I am quite certain that the Bishops would turn it over in their minds&mdash;that side by side with urging the farmers to grow more wheat it should be preached that there was also a moral obligation on the part of the community to pay a just price for the wheat.</P>
    <P>Up to the present the price of wheat, like the price of other commodities, has not been just, and because of that fact the farmer's attitude towards the whole problem of production of greater quantities of food is entirely different from what we would like it to be in an emergency.  This is a problem that can be solved if we all put our backs into it, and even if there are people prepared to suggest that we should ask 55/- and 60/- a barrel, we are determined to say to them that there must be some limit within reason and we do not want to ask too much. If the Minister gave us the chance, I am certain that, with the co-operation of all the people, much could be done; but not much will be done under the present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not quite know whether Senator Byrne is serious in his amendment.  The Senator suggests, while accepting 50/- per barrel, that we should amend the <Col N="231" /> Compulsory Tillage Order to make the production of wheat obligatory.  I do not know whether that is a Ministerial amendment or whether the Senator has submitted it on his own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said that in my judgment farmers have moral obligations to the community, but these obligations must not be all on the one side and the people must be prepared to pay.  I am glad Senator Byrne agrees that 50/- is reasonable, but under present conditions I think his amendment would not be workable.  I have a recollection of reading a speech made by the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures in Galway, where he said it was not practicable to insist upon every farmer growing a certain percentage of wheat as tillage crops.  You could not do that justly without first having a soil survey and determining the land which will grow wheat and the land on which wheat cannot successfully be grown.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether Senator Byrne will say that the West Wicklow farmers can successfully grow wheat. I know thousands of holdings in my county where it would be unjust to insist upon the farmers putting a percentage of the land under wheat.  I believe the crop would be a failure. For that reason it would not be sensible to apply that order.  If you do, you will have less food produced.  I would not be prepared to accept the amendment and I doubt whether the Senator is convinced that it would be practicable.  I urge him to reconsider his decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what has been said on this subject, it is quite clear there are grave fears that we are going to be short of grain before another season's crop can be reaped.  I do not know how much grain is available for seed or what the calculations are as to the surplus after feeding our stock.  I suggest that if the Minister accepted this proposal and if it were to operate from this moment and the people who have any wheat on hands would get 50/- per barrel for it, it would bring out <Col N="232" /> the wheat and then he would know where he stood.  Oats have been sold in Cavan for more than 2/- a stone, and I expect the same applies to other counties.  The Minister should be prepared to go into the market, or let the miller go there, and buy oats at 2/- a stone for storing purposes.</P>
    <P>Let us see how much grain this advanced price will bring on the market.  If it does not bring sufficient supplies of grain to carry the people to the next harvest, then the Minister should buy as many thousand tons of potatoes as will, when added to the wheat and oats, give us a sufficient supply of carbohydrates as will bring us to the next season.  I consider that it would be much better than letting the people go short and creating a very grave situation.  If we are as short as the Government say, we should try to measure how short we are and get a store left by against the days when it will be difficult to get supplies.</P>
    <P>It may be that my interpretation of the Taoiseach's remarks in Navan is different from the interpretation of some of those on the other side of the House, but I have examined them and I have given expression to the manner in which they struck me.  I myself think it is not the right approach to the whole situation.  I am just as anxious as any member of the Government Party or anybody else in this country that our people should not go hungry, and I myself believe that it can be prevented and avoided.  I think we have imposed limitations upon ourselves mainly because we are not prepared to pay farmers the cost of production. Those limitations ought to be removed and, with their removal, you will create an entirely different atmosphere.  If we are ready to do that, even now at this late stage, we can transform the whole situation and can get the spring, the vigour, the energy and the intention to do what has not been done in this country before, or what has not been done, at any rate, since we attempted it in another way in 1916, but unless we can get some of that spirit of unity and harmony and unless the farmer is paid for his job he will not do it, and if he does not do it <Col N="233" /> there is nobody else in this country who can do it, neither the Land Commission nor anybody else.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After the word &ldquo;barrel&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and should amend the Compulsory Tillage Order to make the production of wheat obligatory.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to assure Senator Baxter and the House that nobody inspired me to put down that amendment and that I consulted nobody in putting it down. It is my contribution and mine alone, because I am convinced that if we are going to get the wheat that we require this year in order to save this nation we will have to adopt some such policy as I am trying to outline in this amendment. Again, however, I tell Deputy Baxter that it is only my own contribution and has not been inspired or suggested by anybody, nor did I consult anybody.  I would support Senator Baxter's motion, but not for the same reasons that he has given.  I am not as sanguine as he is that by giving 50/- we will get all the wheat we require, or that by giving even £3 a barrel we would get all the wheat we require. No matter what Deputy Baxter or anybody else may say I am one of those people who do believe that there is a prejudice against wheat growing in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I have had a great deal of experience of growing wheat, and a strange experience, too, in connection with the price I got for it.  I remember having a very good crop, in 1927, I think it was, which I sold at 27/- a barrel, and did very well out of it. Two years later I had another good crop, but, in the meantime, owing to the policy that then prevailed, the flour mills were shutting down&mdash;two shut down in my own locality&mdash;and I wonder would the Senator believe the price that I was offered for that wheat?  I was offered 13/-, and I sold it afterwards for 16/- for feeding fowl. That certainly cooled my ardour for wheat growing until the present Minister came along with his guaranteed <Col N="234" /> price some years ago, and since then I have been growing wheat with varying success.  Sometimes it was very good, and sometimes it was very poor, but the same thing applies to all crops.  I have sown wheat, and it failed, and I have resown it later on in the year and had a good crop, and I sowed the land the next year with the same kind of wheat, April Red, and had a very poor crop.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons why I support Senator Baxter's motion to bring the price up to 50/-, and not because I believe, as I have said before, that it will get more people to grow wheat; nor is it for the sake of those people that I would support the motion, but for the sake of the people who have been growing wheat for the last two or three years and for years before that, and who will have to grow the wheat on the same soil.  Those are the people who I believe are entitled to get all that they possibly can get from the State.  I realise that the Minister will probably point out to us that we are getting 50 per cent. more than we were getting when the war began and that, compared with the world price, we are probably getting a very good price, but I would emphasise that this year, considering that many of us will have to sow wheat again on the same land as we sowed it on last year, and certainly the same land on which we sowed it in the last five or six years, and since there is practically no manure and the yields may be low, it will be very necessary to get as high a price as it is possible to recommend the State to give us.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is a difficulty there, too, and the Minister may argue that the State has gone as far as the community can afford to go, but no matter what the price is, I am still convinced that we will have to make some effort at compulsion if we are to get the wheat that is necessary for this year. We have been told that during the year that has gone we have not had enough wheat and that there may be a possibility of having to ration bread, despite the fact that we succeeded in importing a good share of wheat.  We imported that wheat in ships that could have been better employed in <Col N="235" /> bringing other things in here that were very necessary for the country, and we could have grown all that wheat if the people had done their national duty.  As far as I am concerned, I am prepared to try to insist on their doing their duty.  I do not see why the policy I am outlining should be impossible and I cannot agree with Senator Baxter on that point at all.  As far as Wicklow is concerned, I think he will find that West Wicklow grows probably as much wheat as any other portion of the county.  In West Wicklow they may not be able to sow winter wheat to any great extent but they sow spring wheat extensively and do very well with it&mdash;much better than in my end of the county.</P>
    <P>I agree that if my amendment were adopted it would be necessary for the Minister to schedule certain districts, mountainy or other districts if you like, but you must remember that the present Tillage Order, which is compulsion also, lays it down that a man must till a certain percentage of his arable land&mdash;I think it is 20 per cent. or 25 per cent of his arable land over ten acres.  I am only asking that a certain percentage should be fixed, whether it be 5 per cent. or 6 per cent. or 10 per cent.&mdash;that could be decided upon later&mdash;so that every farmer will have to grow that amount of wheat. In the case of the small man, that would make very little difference.  In many cases it would not mean more than half an acre, and on the bigger farms, where a man might have 100 acres of arable land, which would be a very large holding, I think that the least he ought to do would be to grow 20 acres of wheat.  I think it is a national duty that he should do that and I think he should be made to do it. That is my own personal opinion.  I have all kinds of land myself some poor and some good, and I realise the difficulties, but I believe that this can be done and that it will have to be done, especially in the year in which we are living now.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not see why we could not grow enough wheat in this country to give us an all-wheat loaf or why we should not have the bran and pollard <Col N="236" /> that we are now eating made available for stock feeding.  In fact, I cannot see why the same arrangement could not be made as in the case of the beet people, and it would be a great help to the farmers and they would appreciate it very much if they could get back the bran and pollard for stock feeding in the same way as the beet people get back the pulp.  I think that idea would be of great help to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no; there is not a bit of heat.  I think the Minister wants to speak to-night, and I do not want to delay the House.  I would be the last to wish to inflict hardship on any section of the people, but, as I have said, I know that in my own particular district we probably grow more wheat than we would be asked to do under this order.  I believe the same thing applies to the greater part of the Minister's county, and to the greater part of Senator McGee's county.  Those counties have been doing a great deal more than their share, so there must be some place where they are not doing their share.  There must be some <Col N="237" /> counties in Ireland with better land than either Wicklow or Wexford, land that could grow wheat, and apparently they are not growing anything like the amount of wheat which they should grow, and which it is their duty to grow.  Those are the people I should like to see compelled to do it.  In this year especially, that type of land would be ideal for growing wheat, soil which probably has not been broken since the last war, or not even then. Now that there is a scarcity of manure, that is the type of soil we want.</P>
      <P>As I said, this amendment is not inspired by anybody; it is my own, and mine alone.  I do not see any great difficulty about it.  I should like to repeat that we have to till only a certain percentage of our arable land.  There is no reason why a certain proportion of that arable land should not grow wheat.  It will not hit the small man, the mountain man or anybody else, if it is done in the proper spirit.  I hope the Minister will agree to the price, because I consider that this year the farmer could not get too good a price for growing anything.  I do not think 50/- is too high a price, but no matter what the price is I am quite convinced that we will not get the wheat unless we are prepared to take some measure to see that it is grown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Seanad has given me an opportunity to speak on this motion to-night, because some time ago I had promised to go down the country to-morrow to speak on wheat-growing to ordinary farmers, and I am quite sure&mdash;at least I expect anyway&mdash; that I will find a very much better spirit amongst those ordinary farmers than I find amongst the legislators. Any farmers I have met so far have been very reasonable.  They have said that they will do their best to produce wheat for the country.  The great majority of them look on it as a patriotic duty to grow this wheat. The great majority of them, if not all, thought they were getting a decent price, and that there was no reason <Col N="238" /> why they should not grow it.  All of them grew wheat successfully in the past, and hope to grow it successfully this year.  There is no foundation whatever for Senator Baxter's fear that the Ministry is unhappy about the position.  I think we have fixed a price that should get us the wheat which is required.  I think that, taking everything into consideration, the price is a good price to the farmers. If you compare it with the price paid for wheat in any other country, and if you compare it with the price paid here before the war, it is quite favourable. As a matter of fact, I think wheat is the only commodity, of all the agricultural commodities, for which at the present time we are paying a higher price than they are paying in Great Britain.  Last year, the price for wheat in Great Britain, where, as you know, wages and so on are very high, was 36/3 as against our 40/-.  We put up our price this year by 5/-.  I do not know to what figure the British Government is going to put it; I do not think they have announced it. For everything else that I can recollect, whether we take animals, animal products, other grain crops, potatoes or anything else, the British farmer is getting more than the Irish farmer. The one exception is wheat.  If we could get the same proportion of the land put under wheat here as they have in Britain we would be satisfied.  Comparing ourselves with other countries, the price is very good.  Compared with our price pre-war, the price is splendid.  It is 50 per cent. higher than it was pre-war, as Senator Byrne has just mentioned.  The farmers' costs have not gone up by anything like 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was looking through various documents in the last few days to see whether I could get costings for the growing of wheat, oats or barley, and the only thing I came across was the costings for growing oats, as published by the Tariff Commission, which inquired into oats in 1931.  I suppose the costings would not vary very much, except perhaps in the price of seed, as between wheat and oats.  If you look at those costings, you will find that the big items are labour, rent and rates. <Col N="239" /> They account for well over half the cost of growing a cereal crop.  Since pre-war, the cost of labour has gone up here by 11 per cent.  Rent has not gone up at all, of course, and rates in some counties have gone up by perhaps 10 per cent. or thereabouts; they have not gone up so much in other counties. In those big items, at any rate, the farmer's extra expenses in growing wheat would be somewhere between 10 and 15 per cent., and he is now being offered 50 per cent. more for the wheat he produces.  Seed is a big item in wheat.  The price of seed is being fixed this year.  It is certainly lower than it was last year, and all the rest is as low, I take it, as it was pre-war.</P>
    <P>Looking at this question in an impartial way&mdash;perhaps it is very hard for us to be impartial on those questions&mdash;I do not know how anybody can make a case, on the plea of justice, for a higher price for wheat.  There may be Senators here, perhaps on this side as well as on that side, who would not, as a matter of principle, oppose any proposition brought up here to give the farmer a better price for anything. Of course, if there are Senators like that, there is no use in arguing with them, because I presume that, if we had fixed 50/- and if Senator Baxter had said 55/-, Senator Baxter would get the same support for his motion.  I do not say that Senator Baxter would have said 55/-, but I think somebody would have said 55/- if we had said 50/-.  If somebody said 55/-, Senators here would support that motion&mdash;those Senators who would always support any proposition put up here for a higher price for farmers for any commodity. Senator Baxter was not very sure whether or not he was putting up the right figure.  He made the positive statement that 2/- a stone was an unremunerative price, but he added immediately afterwards that he was not sure that wheat at 50/- a barrel was going to pay.  I think it is a very strange and irresponsible thing for a Senator to come in here with a motion, to make a speech supporting that motion, and, when he had made the speech supporting that motion for 50/&mdash;which, he said, was made in all <Col N="240" /> good faith in order to get enough wheat grown here for human food&mdash;to say he was not sure whether or not it would pay at that price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is more or less admitting what I said&mdash;he was not sure that 50/- was a fair price.  I think the Senator, before bringing in a motion like this, to be helpful to the Government, to be helpful to the country in general, and to make sure that we would not have a famine in this country, should have been sure in his own mind and in his own heart that he was putting up a price which would prevent a famine in this country.  But he is not sure.  He is not at all sure that 50/- is a paying price.  He did say positively that he would not support 60/&mdash;why, I do not know, because he did not give any reasons why 50/- was a proper price and 60/- was not.  The only reason he gave as to why 45/- was the wrong price was that 45/- had already been fixed and he did not believe it was enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter criticised the statements made by the Minister for Supplies and the Taoiseach.  He said that the Minister for Supplies stated that farmers were withholding wheat.  I think that is a perfectly true statement. But, it may be made without any malice and, if the Senator wants to be helpful and if he thinks the Government are making a wrong approach, as he calls it, to the farmers in this crisis, there is no use in trying to make matters worse by interpreting those statements as if they were made with malice.  I have met farmers as late as last Sunday who still have wheat to thresh.  Those farmers are withholding wheat.  I do not think they are doing anything wrong and they do not mean to do anything wrong.  What happened in their case was that they had a big amount of corn to thresh. They could only get an engine to thresh for a day, or two days perhaps, last October, and they chose to thresh a certain amount of oats and barley and kept the wheat over.  They mean to thresh the wheat as soon as they can <Col N="241" /> and to sell it.  They are not doing anything wrong.  The Minister for supplies was appealing to such farmers, and I think he was perfectly right in appealing to them to get the threshing done as soon as possible and let us see what wheat we have in the country; because it is hard for a Government to make plans with regard to substitutes for wheat or the rationing of flour or bread, if that is necessary, unless we are perfectly sure of the amount of wheat that will be offered to the millers.</P>
    <P>I have met at least a couple of dozen farmers that a person would meet in that way and I have been interested in asking them this question when I meet them: &ldquo;How much wheat have you kept this year for the use of your family and for seed?&rdquo;  In practically every case the farmer said he kept more than last year.  He kept a little more seed, hoping to sow more wheat. He may succeed in sowing more and I think he will.  He kept a little more for his own family because, as he said, he thought things might not be too good with regard to the purchase of flour and bread.  I do not blame a farmer for that, either, so long as he does not overdo it.</P>
    <P>There again you have a number of farmers, probably a very large number, who have kept a barrel or two of wheat more than they require and who will, I am sure, if the appeal is made to them, put that barrel or two on the market later on.  But there again the Departments concerned are anxious to know what quantity there is of that kind of wheat, because, naturally, we do not want to introduce a scheme for the rationing of flour or bread if it is not necessary.  Therefore, I think that every Minister is quite entitled to make an appeal to farmers to sell whatever wheat they can possibly manage to sell without leaving themselves short; at any rate to sell all they can.  If the statement is made that farmers are holding wheat at present, that statement can be made without anything wrong being read into it.</P>
    <P>We all agree that in order to get food produced a fair price must be paid, but we can all have our own opinions about what that fair price is. <Col N="242" /> I have already stated that the price fixed for wheat compares very favourably with the price in other countries and with the price paid pre-war here and, after all, we must have some comparison of that kind to go by.  I do not think the expenses of a wheat grower here are as high as those of the farmer in England or Scotland. Senators may have seen what the wages are there.  They are exactly twice as much as are paid here at present.  The combined rent and rates are at least as high as here and there are other expenses, such as overheads and so on, which must be at least as high.  If farmers there could produce wheat at 36/3 last year, as they did, I think we were not asking the farmers to do anything unreasonable when we asked them to produce wheat at 40/- per barrel.</P>
    <P>The argument that Senator Baxter puts up is this: if we think we are giving a fair price for wheat, why do we not get more grown?  I think there is a great lot in what Senator Byrne said&mdash;that price is not everything; that there is a prejudice against growing wheat here.  It may be quite unconscious, but I think if Senator Baxter reads his own speech he will find on studying that speech that there is a prejudice against the growing of wheat even in his own mind.  He made the statement, for instance, that it was a much more &ldquo;chancy&rdquo; crop.  I met many farmers during the last year who said that they had considerable difficulty in harvesting oats and barley, and no difficulty in harvesting wheat. There is an instance, at any rate, where the chance was with the other crops, not with wheat.  I think Senators who grow wheat will admit that, if there is a certain amount of showery weather, you are much more likely to lose a barley or oats crop than a wheat crop.  That is what a lot of farmers found last year.  These were farmers who were unprejudiced; in fact, if they had any prejudice, it would be against wheat.  But they admitted that they had very little trouble in saving the wheat crop and considerable trouble in saving the oats and barley crop, if it did not fail altogether. I am not aware that Senator Baxter, as he stated, had been advocating <Col N="243" /> a guaranteed price for years, and that we had failed to respond.  I do not remember that he did; perhaps he did.</P>

      <P>I have been very keen on a guaranteed price, and, as a matter of fact, I have tried to bring in a guaranteed price for many of our commodities. Nobody will deny that it is quite a simple thing to have a guaranteed price for a commodity where the whole crop is used here at home, such as wheat and beet and other things. But it is not an easy thing, for instance, to have a guaranteed price for store cattle, of which we sell about 80 per cent. on a foreign market.  I do not know if it can be done.  It is easy for a Senator or a Deputy or any other citizen to get up and prophesy that the present price will not bring us in sufficient wheat, because that Senator or Deputy will be in a very strong position.  If his prophecy comes true, he will be able to say: &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;; if his prophecy does not come true, there will be no more about it; nobody will bother reminding him that he made that prophecy.  But the Government have to take other things into consideration.  They have to look at the increased cost, if that increased cost is unnecessary.  Senator Baxter says that it would be only about £800,000.  But even £800,000 is a good lot of money.  I think there is something in what Senator Byrne said&mdash; that even 50/- may not get all the wheat we require.  Senator Byrne at least is logical, because he is afraid that even 50/- would not get sufficient wheat, and, therefore, to make sure that we would get sufficient, he says we should bring in compulsion and make everybody grow a certain proportion of wheat.  I think there is at least logic there; but I do not think there is any logic in Senator Baxter's motion, because he did not give us any guarantee that the 50/- would get us all the wheat we require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter complained about the <Col N="244" /> censor.  I am not aware how far the censor has gone in this matter.  But, if the censor has cut out any proposals for an increased price for wheat, I think he is doing his duty. He is supposed to protect this country during the emergency.  There is one thing I am certain of, that he did not interfere with public opinion until the Dáil made its decision.  When the Dáil by a motion voted against an increased price for wheat, I think he was entitled then to say that the Government had got the necessary support for the order, that we were now in almost as serious a fight as if there were a war here, and that we should stop the criticism and go on with an appeal to the farmers to have more wheat grown.</P>
    <P>We must stop the criticism sometime. If we are doing our best and if it is necessary to have propaganda for wheat growing, to overcome the terrible prejudice there was here for many years, the censor was perfectly right in preventing people from writing letters to the papers or making statements which would have the effect of making the farmer hold back in the hope of a better price.  It is better that the farmer should realise that no higher price will be offered this year, that that now fixed will not be changed, and that it is up to him either to sow or not to sow on the price already announced.  There is no use in Senator Baxter telling us his experience of wheat growing, as he has said that his field had to be re-sown with oats.  He will admit that 40/-, 45/- or 50/- would not make any difference as far as a field like that is concerned. I admit that there may be a case made where wheat crops are poor a better price should be paid; but when they were not wheat at all, when either they were ploughed and completely sown with oats or harrowed and partially sown with oats, it did not make any difference what the price was.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter seems to find some fault with the Department for making a miscalculation.  It is possible that happened, but we did realise&mdash;I would like to assure the Seanad that&mdash;that <Col N="245" /> there was possibly some exaggeration in the acreage.  I know that there is a temptation to a farmer who has done slightly under the amount of tillage required under the Tillage Order, when the Gárda comes around to collect the census of his crops, to put that up to the correct figure.  If he overstates the wheat acreage by 10 per cent. in order, as he thinks, to evade a prosecution under the Tillage Order while it is possible that we get exaggeration in that way we do try to allow for that.</P>
    <P>Whether we allowed sufficient or not, I do not know.  After all, we must make some calculation.  We get the acreages in at the end of June and we have then to make plans, as far as we can, with regard to the cereals for the following year and we cannot wait&mdash;as Senator Baxter thinks we should&mdash;until after Christmas, to find out what the real acreage was.  We must go on some assumption and make some calculation. We do that and, so far at any rate, we have been wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I would like Senators to realise that, up to 1940 when the acreages were given fairly correctly, the experience was that only five barrels to the acre were delivered to the flour mills.  The remainder went in other ways&mdash;some as seed, some for milling for the farmer and his family. The average amount delivered for milling during all these years was about five barrels to the acre and that was what we calculated on again this year as being what we could get in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter also dealt with some of the statements of the Taoiseach.  I do not think there was anything wrong in them.  In fact, the Taoiseach was perfectly right.  If he pointed out to farmers that they could, perhaps, do with a little less wheat by using more potatoes. why should we accuse him of trying to bring in a lower standard of living?  Is it not a perfectly human <Col N="246" /> thing to do, if there is not enough wheat in the country?  Everybody will admit that and I am sure that, if Senator Baxter's leader had said it, the Senator would look upon it as perfectly normal; but it is because the Taoiseach said it that it is put down as advocating a lower standard of living.  If there is any wheat worth while, it could be used with potatoes and that would be better than no wheat.  If the Taoiseach made an appeal to farmers to spare wheat and use more potatoes, he was only doing what was perfectly natural in making a humane appeal to these people on behalf of the people in the towns who cannot so easily do without bread. Also, when he said that, if there is not enough food for livestock they must go, as human beings cannot go, what else would he say?  Are we to understand that we should let the people starve in the towns but keep feeding to pigs and cattle?  Surely there is nothing ridiculous in his statement. Everybody will agree&mdash;farm labourer or otherwise&mdash;that, if there is not enough food, human beings must be fed first, whatever about animals.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter says it is impracticable to do it.  It is hard, I admit, but there are ways, and ways must be found to do it.  We are not going to sit down in the Dáil or Seanad and say that, if the people are starving in the villages and towns and if animals are being fed, we cannot do anything about it.  We must find a way, and everybody knows we will find a way, if it becomes necessary.  I do not think Senator Baxter has made a case for this 50/-.  In fact, as I have said already, he has some doubt even on his own figure.  He was not sure even if 50/- would pay, but he was sure that 60/- was unreasonable.  I do not know on what basis he is going.  His mind is somewhere between 50/- and 60/-, but he is not sure if even that will bring it in.  Senator Byrne at least is logical, as he says he agrees with 50/- but is not sure that even that will bring the wheat in, and therefore says we should have compulsion.  It is not possible to have compulsion this year, but if the Seanad wish to pass the resolution making wheat growing compulsory, naturally the Government will <Col N="247" /> take notice of it and, if they come to the conclusion that compulsion is absolutely unworkable this year, I suppose they will be bound to give it serious consideration for next year.  I do not recommend the Seanad to pass it, as I would very much prefer to get the wheat grown on a voluntary basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a moment.  Senator Baxter talked about moral obligations of the farmer, and said there was a moral obligation on the other side.  That is true: we are all supposed to have our moral obligations, whatever walk of life we may be in, to do whatever we can in this effort during the emergency.  The farmer has the moral obligation to see that he is doing his best on behalf of the community in regard to growing food, and the rest of the State has the moral obligation to see that the farmer is properly remunerated.  We all agree with these premises, but where we do not agree, evidently, is as to whether 45/- is a proper price or not. I have met many growers of wheat who are very much in favour of the compulsory provisions advocated by Senator Byrne.  These are the growers doing their duty by growing a lot of wheat, and they say that there is no reason why they should go on growing more wheat than they should grow normally, to give the wheat to the mill and only take their chance of getting the 5 per cent. offals that are given back.  They agree to a great extent with what Senator Byrne said here&mdash; that, if every farmer was made grow his proper quota of wheat sufficient to give white flour all round again, and then if every farmer got his offals back, we would be very much better off, as then they would get offals which they are not getting at present.  The farmer has a duty also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing further I have to say, except in regard to the question <Col N="248" /> of rye as a substitute for wheat.  It has been put to us on many occasions. Rye is grown only in a few areas in this country to any extent&mdash;in Kerry, in Achill and in the Aran Islands. They are the only places I have seen it grown.  It does grow there successfully, on the whole, but I am told by technicians&mdash;and I am very much influenced by them, unless they agree though some Senators may not be influenced by them, unless they agree with them&mdash;that rye here is much more subject to virus disease than in Northern European countries.  Rye will do well in Scandinavian countries &mdash;in Finland and so on&mdash;where there is a cold climate.  Seemingly, virus disease can thrive here and not in those cold countries and, as a consequence, the rye is subject to failure here in many instances.</P>
    <P>In most of the land here where rye is grown, it is possible to get a better oat crop.  In at least 75 per cent. of the land, I think we would get a better wheat crop than rye, so it appears from what I can learn that there is not much to be said for the growing of rye on a large scale.  We have also the difficulty that we have very little rye seed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to take up the time of the House at any length on the question which I gave notice I would raise on the adjournment. What is troubling the mind of a great many people is that this order restricting the export of store cattle was made by the Minister, and that so far no information has been vouchsafed as to why it was made, or as to how long farmers may expect it to continue.  The operation of the order, as far as I am aware, has certainly been very unfavourable to small farmers and store cattle raisers.  It came into operation on Monday last, and fairs held since then have been unfavourably affected. At the time I think the Minister was concerned about the animal population consuming food which might be required for human needs.  The keeping of a considerable number of store cattle, as far as could be judged, was something that was perturbing. The Minister did not make the order without some reason, but the public have no knowledge of what his motives were.  Whatever the reasons may have been, what is of considerable importance to farmers is to know how long the order will be in operation, whether for a week or for a month.  A condition of uncertainty like that, especially in view of what farmers have gone through in the last year, and up to the opening of the ports for the export of stock, leaves them in a very perturbed frame of mind.  There is the added consideration that men who are able to go into the markets to-day are given the opportunity of buying store cattle definitely at a figure under their real value.  I have no doubt that a number of men who can do so are going to the markets and buying cattle from farmers at a figure considerably less <Col N="250" /> than that they would have to pay if the export markets were still open.  These cattle will probably be held for a month or six weeks, or for whatever period the order remains in operation, and when exports are resumed, those who have been able to speculate, and able to hold the stock, are going to make much more than the producers.  All I seek is to get from the Minister some clarification of the order, the reasons for its imposition, and when we may expect that trade will move freely again and the restrictions will be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. MacCabe Mr. MacCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the order could not have been imposed at a worse time, especially as regards store cattle, as we were hoping in the new year to get rid of stores.  The trade is now, unfortunately, restricted, and fodder for young cattle is very scarce this year.  That is a consideration in the case of many farmers, who have not the amount of fodder they had in previous years.  If they have to keep young cattle for a considerable time I do not know what the position will be. There is a scarcity of fodder and accordingly cattle will waste and will not be profitable when selling.  As the last speaker pointed out, advantage has, unfortunately, been taken of the position of owners who had to sell, having no other alternative but to stall-feed for some time.  Cattle are being purchased under market value. That is a terrible blow to farmers, who cannot afford to lose.  It would be of interest to the House and to the country if the Minister could make a statement as to when the order will be removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Senator Baxter has raised this question because there appears to be a lack of understanding of the order and also of information with regard to its duration.  The position is that we found ourselves early in January with quite a number of fat cattle, mostly grass-fed cattle.  At that time exporters were inclined to export cattle as stores, and the position was very bad, because some of the cattle exported as stores were bracketed on the other side as fat cattle.  Accordingly <Col N="251" /> a good deal of confusion arose. There was a tendency to export fat cattle as stores rather than as fats, and we thought it necessary to get rid of the fat cattle of which there were large numbers here.  They were grass-fed cattle and would go back in condition if kept any longer.  To get them into proper condition again would mean that they would need to be fed on grain, and we felt that we had no grain to spare. The owners were also under the impression at that time that there would be an increase in the price of fats, and they were holding on to them.  We worked hard to get an increase in the price but failed.  When we found that it was quite definite that the price would not be increased we announced that there would be no increase until April 24th, and that no cattle would be allowed to be exported during the month of January, except fats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We thought that the owners, having the information that there would be no increase in price, shippers with that information would only export fats, and that there would be a big clearance during January.  I hope that we will get all these cattle out.  It looks as if they are all going.  This week there was some difficulty in filling the ships with cattle, but I think there will be enough to keep the ships going until the end of the month. When that period is over the shipping of stores will be resumed on a much bigger scale.  There will then be no restriction on the numbers going out. There will be a restriction on stores as regards age.  Senators know that stores allowed out since the recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease had to have two prominent incisors up and a third appearing.  Senators may not know much about the dentition of cattle, but it means that cattle had to be at least two years and three months old, and sometimes older, before they got the third tooth.  I think we may get the age reduced somewhat when shipping is restored in February.  We are making an attempt at the moment, and I hope we will meet with success.  If so, the way will be open for some months from February 1st on for a very big export of older stores from about two <Col N="252" /> years upwards.  There will not be so many fat cattle then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I do not think there will be so many fats then, as the number of grass-fed cattle will be exhausted.  Probably we will not have so many stall-fed cattle to dispose of, or not very much more than we will require for home consumption, and that the export of stall feds will be small. Senators will be very interested in some figures I have.  As they know there was a very restricted export of cattle in 1941.  The stoppage began on January 17th and it was not until July 11th that exports of livestock for immediate slaughter commenced again.  There was, however, quite a considerable amount of exports in the form of dressed meat and canned meat.  As a matter of fact our exports for 1941 were only about 200,000 less than those in normal years preceding it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>About 450,000 went out in the form of live cattle and meat.  I only saw the figures a few days ago and I was rather agreeably surprised.  I thought we had a much bigger number of cattle awaiting export.  If the export of stores is resumed on February 1st it will not take very long to deal with the surplus.  It looks as if the position will become normal within a few months.  It is hard to say what effect the dentition regulations will have.  We have not had experience of them before.  It may mean that we can only export cattle from two years upwards. I do not know whether our own feeders in the midlands will create a sufficient demand to keep up the price of smaller cattle.  Probably they will, and be able to keep cattle moving all the time, by taking smaller animals of 15 or 18 months old from counties like Cavan and from the west, and feeding them for six months and exporting them.  Then the trade may settle down to normal and be I hope quite good.</P>
