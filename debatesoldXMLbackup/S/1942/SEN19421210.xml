    <Title>Building and Upkeep of Schools&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann is of opinion that the total cost of the erection, reconstruction, and equipment of national schools should be borne by the State, and that the public health authorities should be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the school buildings and premises, including repairs, heating, lighting, cleaning and sanitation.&mdash;(Senator Thomas J. O'Connell, Senator William Cummins.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recommend An Seanad to accept this resolution or the principles underlying it.  As Senator O'Connell has stated, this is not the first occasion on which this matter has been debated in the Oireachtas.  I do not understand what circumstances have occurred in the meantime which suggest to him that the situation is more serious now than it was when the matter was last discussed; nor do I understand why the Senator thinks there is likely to be any change in the policy of the Department of Education as explained to him on the last occasion when he raised this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Mrs. Concannon said, it is a rather unusual way to deal with a <Col N="374" /> matter which is not entirely one for the State or for the Oireachtas.  There may be very good reasons for opening a discussion on important changes.  It is useful that we should have reviews of important aspects of educational policy from time to time, but if we are suggesting definitely that changes must be made of a character affecting the present control of education in this country, we shall have to consider the views of important authorities not represented&mdash;directly, at any rate&mdash;in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Senator suggests that my remarks last July, in reference to the question of school buildings, made him feel that this matter should be reopened. He thinks that, perhaps, I have given a wrong impression in my statement and he wishes to correct that.  The statement was perfectly simple and clear and left no room for doubt.  I was not trying to postulate principles in this matter&mdash;it is largely a question for other authorities to postulate principles in regard to fundamentals in education&mdash;but what I did say was that we had a system in operation over a very long period of time. That might seem to condemn it in the eyes of some observers but, before we interfere with that long-established system, we must be satisfied that it is inoperable and also that what we seek to replace it by will be a distinct improvement, will be accepted generally and will work with ease.  Senator O'Connell has not, I fear, addressed himself to these aspects of the question. He has lightly assumed that important changes can be made and that there is not likely to be any dissent from the motion that he has put before the House.  I think he should have produced some evidence in support of his contention that such a change is not likely to meet with objection.</P>
    <P>Even before that stage was reached, it would be necessary to prove to the House and to the country that the present system has broken down.  In my opinion, it has not broken down. It is working fairly satisfactorily.  I emphasised, when I referred to this matter before, that the system was not perfect.  What system is perfect?  What system can be devised that will ensure <Col N="375" /> that there will be no delays when more than one party is concerned?  There are, undoubtedly, systems in the world which do not brook of delay, but one of the advantages of this system is that there is time for consideration.  There is time for discussion, and, as a natural result, you have certainly delays, particularly when you have more than one interest concerned.</P>
    <P>Now, the Church stands in a peculiar relation to education, more especially in this country where the vast majority of the people follow the philosophy of the Catholic Church.  That Church has laid down certain principles with regard to education and I suggest it is only the authorities of the Church who are in a position to interpret these principles if and when they see fit to do so.  It is not the function of the Minister for Education to interpret them, nor does it seem to be the function of other lay authorities.  The system is fundamental to educational progress and there is serious danger, no matter what some critics may think, that if it be interfered with, instead of having progress and orderly development, we are going to have quite the contrary.  We start off by having objections and finally contentions. Later we find we have confusion, and, possibly, chaos because you cannot make progress in education unless you have harmony.  You have to have peace &mdash;you have to have goodwill.  You have to plan your programme over long periods of time.  This system has been described, as I have already stated, not so long ago by a Catholic prelate as not being far from the ideal, and that is a general belief so far as the Catholic authorities are concerned.  The managers have certain rights and they are anxious to safeguard these rights and maintain them, and, in the world at present, there is no doubt but that changes affecting the Churches' position, either in regard to education or any other matter of social policy, are likely to be very closely scrutinised. We are not living in normal times.  We are living in times when revolutionary changes are taking place, and he would be a very wise man indeed, who would dare to prophesy the state of the <Col N="376" /> world after the present war.  I do not think, therefore, that this is a matter that can be treated lightly.  It is a very important matter.  I agree that it is most important that we should do everything possible to provide proper schools for our children, but we must be quite sure that the existing system and the existing machinery are failures and that our desires cannot be secured under the present system of things before we contemplate radical changes of the nature the Senator proposes.</P>
    <P>I do not think there has been any evidence given&mdash;I have not seen it and it has not been brought under my notice, and I have not been convinced by what I have heard during the course of the debate&mdash;that there is any measure of substantial support for the proposal in the motion.  I do not think there is popular feeling at all that the present system has broken down.  On the contrary, I think that the importance of maintaining the present system is recognised.  It is recognised now probably better than in more recent times.  Under a foreign Government we jealously watched our rights in these matters.  Then the slightest move indicative of interference in matters which affected the Catholic position was likely to be jealously attacked, or, I should say, the position was likely to be jealously defended against any inroads.  We have now a certain amount of experience under a native Government, and I entirely fail to see why we should assume that that thing which we would have fought against and contested most strongly if a foreign or alien Government attempted it we ought now try to bring in of our own free will without, as far as I can see, having even good reasons or reasons that might appear to be good to advance in support of it.</P>
    <P>I have been in touch with the Church authorities for a good many years and I am fully convinced, and I can assure the House, that the ecclesiastical authorities generally realise the importance of this whole question; that they realise fully and completely the necessity for keeping our schools in proper <Col N="377" /> order and condition and of having bad or defective schools replaced at the earliest possible moment.  The managers' representatives with whom I am in touch are also alive to this position, and I think it would be a mistake if we were to regard the isolated cases that have been mentioned in the House as typical of the condition of affairs as regards school buildings generally. Undoubtedly it is most aggravating, particularly to parents, to see schools continue in use which they consider are an eye-sore, sometimes unfortunately insanitary and which, in the opinion of the medical authorities, ought to be replaced. I think I can assure Senators that that matter is receiving careful attention, and they should not be misled into believing that because there are individual cases&mdash;perhaps a number of cases&mdash;of neglect that that is typical of the general position.</P>
    <P>I should like to give credit to managers for the splendid work they have done.  A good many cases could be cited by me to show that managers have made super-human efforts, that energetic managers are by no means in a small minority in this country, and that they have shown by their efforts and the splendid work they have done that the system can give excellent results.  If there has been any neglect there may have been reasons.  Managers may have difficulties in raising money.  It may be sometimes that the illness or age of managers affects their capacity to get work done but these are matters that have been gone into and are being gone into by the authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>Rather disparaging remarks were made yesterday evening as to the amount of progress that had been made and, one would imagine from the statements that were made, such as: &ldquo;Why not get the school building programme completed in two years?&rdquo; that all one had to do was wave a magic wand and get all this work done in a very short time.  That of course is impossible.  I am quite satisfied that good work has been done during my term of office.  Grants involving an expenditure of more than £2,500,000 for school buildings have been made <Col N="378" /> during the past ten years.  The whole building organisation of the country has not been concentrated on schools. During a great part of that ten years there was a very extensive house-building programme going on and there is a limit to the amount of work that can be done under any system. There is a natural limit.  You can spend more money and provide more staff and the Government is always willing to do that and have shown their anxiety to do it but when you reach a certain point the amount of the return you get is in the nature of a diminishing return.  I think everybody understands that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that money you mentioned spent on national schools or does it include technical schools also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>On the national schools. The number of managers involved in this work show that they are by no means a small minority.  As I said, you have these active and energetic managers, and I think they are in a majority if the present figures are any indication, because during the period I speak of the grants which were sanctioned by my Department covered 375 new schools, the enlargement of 162 and the improvement of 2,286 so that over 50 per cent. of the schools were involved in these figures.  During the term of office of the last Government you had something under 2,000 schools similarly attended to, so that, for the two periods the great bulk of schools have had money spent on them.  The number of new schools built is not as great as one would wish, but I explained to the Seanad that when normal conditions come back it is expected that a comprehensive programme of school building will be undertaken.  That programme will take a period of years.  I should think it will take ten years unless circumstances are entirely favourable and there is such an improvement in the method of administration that there may be larger sums than we now contemplate to be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Board of Works has been spending, for the past four years for example, well over £200,000 a year. That £200,000 a year means that the <Col N="379" /> Board of Works at a particular time has to have grants reported to it from my Department amounting to double the annual programme.  In order to carry out an annual programme of £200,000 or £250,000 expenditure on schools, the Board of Works has to have on its books sanctions for grants amounting to £400,000 or £500,000 as the case may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that it takes a lot of time.  It is the same with land division or anything else.  You have to do your preparatory work. You have to get all the preliminaries worked up to a certain stage before the actual technical work of building can be undertaken.  That is the position. It will take, in my opinion, ten years, and it will take an amount of money in the neighbourhood of £5,000,000 to cover that programme.  When I say that, I want it to be understood that I am making allowance for the fact that for the next three years or possibly for the next five years the number of bad and condemned schools that we have and which require to be replaced is probably going to be increased.  I am also assuming that the amount of work that will be done during the period between now and the end of the emergency, and even after it, is going to be very limited indeed.  Some of the Senators spoke as if it was quite an easy matter to get schools built under present circumstances.  Of course, it is extremely difficult, and we have not been able to proceed with important new schools which are ready to go ahead.  There is no use in Senators treating this matter in that fashion any more than there is utility in coming in here and telling the House that, owing to some action or inaction of the Minister for Education, children are suffering from lack of heating facilities in certain country schools.  I had a communication only yesterday from the district of which Senator Baxter spoke.  With one exception, the managers there had taken advantage of the Government grant for heating and cleaning.  So far as I remember the terms of the communication, the <Col N="380" /> money had been paid to them.  If loose charges are to be bandied about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Senator, when he wanted to make charges about bad schools, to let me have particular cases.  He failed to do so.  When he makes charges of neglect by managers or by me, I intend to pursue the matter.  I shall not allow a position to exist in which Senator Baxter or anybody else can make public statements of this kind without supporting them by evidence.  Talk of what happens in a bus is not sufficient and should not be mentioned here.  If there is definite evidence of neglect, let it be communicated to me in the proper way.  Surely, we have not reached a stage in which the Seanad will be simply a debating society to be used on certain occasions for bringing in conversations in the country as to this thing or that thing not being right.  There is a definite way of dealing with this matter.  There is definite responsibility in connection with it.  The authorities concerned are taking a keen interest in the matter and, if Senators want defects remedied, there is a way of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister put a question to me before about the bad condition of schools in my county.  I know that the Minister has reports on these schools in his Department and he had only to go there to get the information he required.  Repeated visits have been paid by his inspectors to the schools I had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not sufficient.  If Senators have particular cases in mind, they are failing in their duty if they are not prepared to let me know the names of the schools.  When they complain of schools not being properly heated or of their being in an insanitary <Col N="381" /> condition, I would, naturally, assume that their interest was more keen if they had taken the trouble to make representations to me during the years I have been in charge of the Department.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that it is extremely difficult for managers to provide the necessary funds to enable this work to be done.  As the House knows, at least two-thirds of the cost of building new schools or of replacing old schools is provided by the State.  In necessitous cases, we give more than two-thirds.  In the congested areas and in the poorer rural districts, we give substantially more.  It could be argued that, at present, the national Exchequer is bearing almost the entire cost of primary education, allowing for the salaries of the teachers.  The amount contributed locally is not great.  The managers know that and managers who want to get work done have very little trouble in coming to terms with the Department.  I am not going to be forced into a position in which I shall have to give additional money because there has been neglect over a long period&mdash;money over and above what I would give to a manager who has attended to his business at all times and who is doing his utmost to keep his schools in proper condition. Every possible assistance is given to such managers, and these managers fulfil their responsibilities admirably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have particulars of some cases here.  In the case of a rural school, the manager raised £1,800.  There is no town in his parish&mdash;it is purely rural&mdash; but he raised the one-third proportion of the cost.  In the case of two other schools in a northern county, the manager raised £4,000&mdash;the full local contribution.  In the case of another northern parish, the manager, in order to carry out certain improvements in the schools in his parish, collected £564, which was, of course, only a proportion of the cost.  In another area in the midlands, a manager collected £1,100 to carry out large improvements to two schools.  In the case of a parish in the poorer part of County Wicklow, £329 was subscribed towards a scheme of improvement and, in another case in the same area, a sum of £622 was subscribed, <Col N="382" /> being one-third of the cost of building a new school.  In another case of which I have a note, the manager carried out a very large building programme and showed himself to be exceedingly energetic.  He built a church costing £10,000, another church costing £5,000, a ball-alley costing £900, and carried out very substantial school works, building three new schools and repairing two or three others.  In view of the great work he had done, we tried to give him every assistance.  Despite all that work and the huge debt that must have been incurred, this manager was able to raise a contribution of £1,534 for his school-building programme.</P>
    <P>There is a case in County Cork where the manager raised £1,600 for two schools, in Leitrim where the manager raised £760, in Westmeath where the manager raised £950, and there are three cases in Donegal where the managers raised £700, £700, and £600, respectively, in very poor parishes.  As regards the case mentioned by Senator Counihan, I need not go into the circumstances of the parish.  It is a rural parish and I do not believe that it has a big population. Like most areas in which there are a certain number of large farmers, it has, probably, a large population of poorer people&mdash;labourers.  In that particular parish £830 was raised as a contribution to the building of the school.  Now, these are examples of work that is being done by energetic managers.  While all managers may not have been as good as these, and I am not claiming that they are, I am showing what can be done by good managers.  I am showing that money can be raised if they set about it properly, and I am showing that the people are interested in this matter and that there is no question whatever but that in all areas of the country, whether south, west, midlands or north, you have examples of cases where managers exerted themselves and have been able to get very substantial contributions from their parishes.  In the vast majority of cases the manager is anxious to get the work done.  We try to meet him.  We tell him we have a limited amount of money, but we certainly <Col N="383" /> do not wish to haggle with him. We have never held up a school for the sake of £50 or £100 or anything like that.  We have always tried to meet the managers, once the work was there and once we felt the manager was in earnest.  But the initiative has to be taken by the manager.</P>
    <P>I think that this question of local contribution is of importance.  I am entirely against the idea that all the work which is done locally should be transferred to the National Exchequer. As has been pointed out by Senators, that will necessarily involve greatly increased expenditure.  The work may be better done, but if it is better done it is going to cost very much more money, and I doubt whether, even if there were general agreement, which is impossible, on the necessity for the measures that Senator O'Connell proposes, the rural ratepayers would look forward to relieving their neighbours in this manner.  The rates have already gone up very substantially in rural areas.  They have gone up 25 per cent., 30 per cent., and even 50 per cent. in some cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you not doing it for technical education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different system, and we are not doing such an amount as is imagined for technical education.  There was a new Act brought in in 1930 when an endeavour was being made to extend continuation education through the country and the rural areas.  That phase is probably almost at an end.  Nothing had been done to provide up-to-date technical schools since the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction first came into being here.  A great many of them were carrying on in very temporary premises and in view of the general necessity for providing post-primary education in these areas, and particularly having regard to the need for training the youth of the country to industrial pursuits, it was necessary to give them new buildings. The amount of money is not at all so great, although it is substantial, because it is a limited problem as compared <Col N="384" /> with this question which we are discussing now.  I have explained that it is the policy of the Department, immediately conditions permit, to go ahead with the least possible delay and put schools into the best possible condition, first to replace the bad cases, the condemned schools which are so unsound that everyone agrees that they are in fact not fit to be used as schools; and secondly, until such time as they can be dealt with, to put the remainder into a condition of repair.  Some of them could be put into reasonable repair at a comparatively small cost, that is if we are thinking in pre-war figures, and there would be no loss from the educational point of view, nor, I believe, from the point of view of the health of the children in having them in these schools for a short period until arrangements can be made after the emergency to deal with the whole situation.  There is another type of schools, schools that are reconstructed, that have had substantial repairs, the main fabric being quite solid and the foundations good.  These could be maintained in use for quite a considerable time.  However, we have to make allowance for the fact that very little can be done now as the present situation is likely to continue for a period of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we can do is to have ready for action all cases that require attention. That is being done.  They will be ready for action immediately the emergency ends.  If at all possible, those that require attention will be attended to even before then.  What it is possible to do and what is being done is to make plans now so that intensive and concentrated effort can be made immediately work can be resumed.  The aim is to improve the general condition of the schools and to complete the matter within the limited period of time, say, ten years, so that at the close of that period such progress would have been made that all that would need to be done afterwards from year to year would be nothing more than replacing normal wastage.  Extracts from medical officers' reports are not in themselves sufficient to give a proper picture of the situation.  I am quite candid and quite deliberate when I say that some <Col N="385" /> of our medical officers of health have very high standards.  They are quite right to have high standards, but they ought to have regard to the practicability of putting them into operation.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the question of water-flushed closets.  It is impossible, except in isolated cases, to provide a water-flush system in rural areas.  You have to have certain conditions present. You have to have water available under pressure.  It is generally the case, I think, that you have to have an area of running water sufficient to take away the effluent after the filtration takes place.  We have tried, where possible, to provide that water accommodation, where the cost was not excessive, and wherever the managers have put up cases to have water systems installed we have tried to meet them, but in certain cases the costs would have been absolutely prohibitive.</P>
    <P>It is an ideal which I hope will eventually come into being, that all rural areas will have water laid on, but we must have regard to rural conditions. Senator O'Connell recently, I think, indicated that progress would have to be made with regard to home conditions and the teaching of cleanliness to the children, and even with regard to rural sanitation generally before we can be quite sure that the diseases of the type he refers to which are in danger of being spread can be eliminated. I think that the Senator said recently, it appeared in the <i>School Weekly</i> at any rate, that not 1 per cent. of our farm houses and cottages have even the most primitive sanitary accommodation, and that hedges and ditches may be the most potent sources of infection.  Until we improve that situation and have water supplies available in rural areas, I hope Senators will realise, it is very difficult to deal with this problem, except in the way in which it is being dealt with at present.</P>
    <P>It can be dealt with satisfactorily. The existing arrangements can be made quite satisfactory and hygienic, if the instructions issued by the Department in circulars from time to time are carried out.  If the managers and the principal teachers of the schools see to it that the children are instructed how <Col N="386" /> to use the sanitary accommodation, how to keep these places clean, that is to say, if the proper method of using the closets and the grave dangers that might arise from misuse are impressed upon them, much danger would be avoided.  If these precautions are taken, and if the instruction is carried out, as I am anxious it should be carried out, and as I have asked the managers and teachers on more than one occasion, then I think there will not be the danger that Senator O'Connell seems to indicate, from the schools. There is unfortunately a small number of schools where the accommodation is bad, and there is also a still lesser number where there is no sanitary accommodation.  I intend again to take up the matter of providing proper accommodation in these cases, and I hope that I shall be successful.  Certainly, if the position could be improved by installing water-flush closets, that would be the proper solution, but I fear that until there is a great change in rural conditions in that regard, ordinary earth closets will have to suffice.  We must take it that they are the normal methods of sanitation.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with Senator O'Connell that, as suggested in the <i>School Weekly</i>, the question of the danger of infection, the danger of disease from pollution by flies or otherwise, and particularly the danger of uncleanliness in the closets, should be explained frequently to the children. It should be explained to them&mdash;definite instructions have been issued in consultation with the medical authorities&mdash;as to how these earth closets are to be kept so as to make them as free as possible from the danger of spreading disease.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of Polymelitis&mdash;I think that is the correct technical name&mdash;I do not think that we could know at present what is the cause of it.  I understand that a medical body is examining the question here.  I think that we should wait until we have an authoritative decision from them, if they are in a position to give a decision, as to whether the situation is as bad as described by Senator O'Connell.  The <Col N="387" /> disease is a very grave one, but it is not to-day or yesterday that it has occurred here.  It has been here before. Even in New York, which, it is said, is the most sanatised city in the world, there have been epidemics of this disease.  It is also the case that while some members of a family get the disease others do not.  I understand that a good many doctors think that the danger lies in carriers, that there are certain persons who carry this disease.  However, I know very little about it, and it our medical specialists who are examining the matter can aid me by their findings in improving greatly the nature of the sanitary accommodation in the schools, I shall be only too happy to get any assistance I can from them.</P>
    <P>I think, a Chathaoirligh, I have dealt with the main points that were raised.  As I stated at the outset, I feel that it would be a mistake for the Seanad to accept this motion.  I think that it would give rise to grave objections and would not improve the position. Under the present system State and Church are working in harmony. As I have said, I have very good reason for believing that this matter is going to be examined very carefully, and I hope to have the full co-operation of the ecclesiastical authorities in carrying out the post-war programme I have envisaged.</P>
    <P>The matter has not been submitted to them but it is hoped that it will be submitted to them at an early date. I hope to have their complete cooperation in a large programme of that kind.  My attitude in this matter has been that if there are imperfections in the existing system, let us see what is the reason for them and let us try to have them removed.  If there are particularly bad schools in regard to which nothing is being done, let us examine the matter home, find out why something is not being done and, if it be necessary, let us discuss these matters with the ecclesiastical authorities fully and frankly.  I have found them very ready to listen to any representations I have made to them in the matter and, as I have assured the House, I am quite certain that when a <Col N="388" /> programme is put up to them for replacing bad schools after the emergency it will be given every consideration. Their only anxiety, I believe, is to collaborate and they are just as anxious as anybody in this House, or as I am, to see that a high standard is maintained.  They fully realise that managers have their responsibilities and duties and that the neglect of even a comparatively small number of managers would be reason for complaint and a cause for very serious criticism.  The system has on the whole worked very satisfactorily over a long period of years.  There is just as much anxiety on the part of the Church authorities to get rid of these bad schools as there is on my part.  Therefore, I think the motion is quite unnecessary; the discussion has not served any useful purpose and the House may rest assured that everything possible is being done to deal with the situation.</P>

      <P>In the debate on the Second Reading of the School Attendance Bill, I expressed some doubt as to whether the Oireachtas ought to insist on children attending schools which they could not attend without incurring grave danger to their health. I am sorry that this debate did not take place before the debate on the Second Reading of the School Attendance Bill because I think if Senators had studied the document which Senator O'Connell has kindly circulated, a good many of them would have hesitated, as I did, in giving support to the School Attendance Bill.  I have been thoroughly disappointed with the speech the Minister has just made.  He has made no attempt to meet the case that the health of the children is being sacrificed, day by day and month by month, in a large number of schools throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He spoke of these schools which are insanitary as being isolated conditions. If he had studied the document which Senator O'Connell had circulated, he would have seen that they are not isolated conditions and that in the few counties, the reports from which are given, these conditions are quite common.  I am familiar with that fact <Col N="389" /> because I have been in the habit of studying the reports of the county medical officers of health.  In every report I read, except in a few cases in which the matter is not mentioned at all, I find that the conditions are quite as bad as those described in the reports which Senator O'Connell has given us.  He has given us extracts from nine reports, but I think he could have given us similar extracts from 27 reports if he had the opportunity or the time to study these reports.  In report after report, we find the same conditions and faults as the Senator has here described, and the statement is frequently made that many schools are unfit for use and should be replaced. I have a sheet in my hand and I wish to draw the attention of the Seanad to a few points.  On the second page of the paper there is a reference to County Longford, where 30 schools were inspected and eight were reported as &ldquo;satisfactory&rdquo;.  That is just over 25 per cent., and that is, presumably, what the Minister referred to as &ldquo;isolated conditions&rdquo;.  In County Roscommon 30 schools were inspected in 1940; 26 were reported as being defective in one or more particulars, and four were reported as being entirely satisfactory.  Is that &ldquo;isolated conditions&rdquo;?  It is the satisfactory schools that come under the &ldquo;isolated conditions&rdquo; heading.  Out of 27 schools inspected in Roscommon in 1941, only two were satisfactory&mdash;approximately 8 per cent; 17 showed lack of proper maintenance of out-offices, which, no doubt, refers to the lack of sanitary accommodation.  In County Tipperary, North Riding, in 1941, many buildings were unfit for use as schools.  The report states:&mdash;&ldquo;Year after year each county medical officer of health urges in his report the speedy replacement of unfit schools, but the tempo of replacements has not increased.&rdquo;  It goes on: &ldquo;Only a Spartan could remain in one of these schools in the winter months, and it is inhuman to expect teachers or children to expose themselves to icy draughts in such conditions. The medical officer has complained on several occasions that he cannot expose the children properly to <Col N="390" /> make complete and thorough examinations. The great majority of the children need medical attention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister complained that Senator Baxter was making complaints from his own immediate information and said that the facts should come before the Department.  Does the Department not see the reports of the medical officers of health?  Does the Minister not consider that they bear out twenty-fold the facts that Senator Baxter has put before him?  I could go on, page after page, but I do not wish to weary the Seanad with repeated complaints, from county after county, from the medical officers of health.  They are the people to give evidence and the evidence lies there.  I repeat the quotation: &ldquo;Each county medical officer of health urges in his report the speedy replacement of unfit schools, but the tempo of new replacements has not increased.&rdquo;  The Minister has made the plea&mdash;with which I make no quarrel&mdash;that replacements take time.  The children are having the seeds of ill-health sown and that requires time, and they are given the time.  They are growing up unhealthy and subject to disease, and they are not youth of the country that we should be proud of&mdash;and could be proud of, if the educational and health authorities were doing their duty.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he cannot see any public demand for it.  That was the argument that Senator Counihan also used, as if the demand for any reform ever came from the general public.  The demand for reform always comes from people interested in a particular line of social work.  When it has been put forward, the public take it up.  There is no excuse for carrying on the present scandalous condition of things by saying that there is no public demand. That is only exposing the Minister's lack of conscience and his lack of responsibility to the country, for which he undertook responsibility.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest advances in public health administration in this country was the institution of the medical inspection of school children.  That was one of the last pieces of legislation which an alien Government conferred <Col N="391" /> on us&mdash;and probably one of the most useful it ever conferred.  It has failed largely in its object, because of the conditions in which the schools are kept.  Even the actual work of the medical inspector of school children is, in many cases, hampered by his inability to examine patients in the surroundings in which they come for examination. Senator Baxter made one remark, early in his speech, that seemed to me to be a thoroughly statesmanlike remark.  He said that what any parent desired for his children and, perhaps, the most important thing&mdash;apart from spiritual welfare&mdash; was sound health.  I think everybody in the Seanad will agree with him on that point.  It is a principle which cannot be overlooked.  The Minister says it must wait&mdash;that it must wait until the Department has time to consider things, that it must wait until there has been discussion and consideration of it&mdash;consideration of a system which is very long-standing and which stands self-condemned.</P>
    <P>I have nothing whatever to say about the managerial system.  I am not familiar with its working&mdash;and I approach this question entirely from the point of view of the health of the school children.  I cannot believe that the managerial system would be endangered at all by the provision of suitable school buildings.  Whether the buildings are to be provided and the repairs carried out in the particular way that Senator O'Connell urged, I do not know; and it is not a point on which I venture to trouble the Seanad with my opinion.  I am certain, however, that the present conditions are scandalous and are not being met by postponement after postponement&mdash; until &ldquo;discussion takes place&rdquo; and until &ldquo;there is public demand&rdquo;&mdash;and other evasive talk of that sort, to which the Minister has treated us for the last half-hour.</P>
    <P>I remember some 30 years ago, when the chief officer in charge of education under an alien Government was asked to take some notice of conditions affecting school children&mdash;the education of children in matters of health, his reply was: &ldquo;We are not concerned with the health of the children: we are concerned with their education.&rdquo;  I <Col N="392" /> thought that the day had gone by when any public official in this country would take that attitude; but, except for a few sentences of lip-service, that is the attitude taken by the Minister before the Seanad to-day.  The more things change, the more they are the same.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said&mdash;among many other things with which no one quarrels&mdash;that some of the essentials of progress are peace and goodwill.  That may be, but surely the health of school children is one of the essentials. It is quite as essential as peace and goodwill; and if peace and goodwill cannot be maintained while the health of the children is being attended to, then peace and goodwill must go.  The governing consideration of this whole question is in what way the health of the children can be preserved.  I cannot believe that the Oireachtas or any other authority has any right to demand of parents that the health and, possibly, the lives of their children should be endangered by sending them to some of the schools in the country which have been described in the reports of the medical officers of health.  These conditions are not isolated cases&mdash;they are common in a high percentage of schools in the country.  I am not suggesting that many of the schools are actually dangerous.  I agree that there are many reforms put forward by hardworking medical officers of health which are not practicable at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted that the conditions in some of these schools would not be regarded as ideal, but I feel he did not pay adequate attention to the scandalous conditions reported by the medical officers of health.  He did not seem to have had in his mind what occurred in County Mayo a couple of years ago when humane parents of children in a particular district refused to send their children to school because the school was not fit for them.  Of course, they were breaking the law as approved in the Bill we discussed the other day, but who will say that they were committing a sin in trying to preserve the lives and health of their children by refusing to send them to a school building which was unfit to spend a day in?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> I have spoken warmly on this subject because it is one in which I have taken a great deal of interest for many years and on which I have taken care to inform myself from the reports of the county medical officers of health.  I had intended to support Senator O'Connell's motion, although I do not pretend at all to have any knowledge of the best financial means of dealing with the issue.  I will support it in so far as I desire to impress on Senators that the situation is a very serious one and that it cannot be postponed by considerations of its being a long continued system, and so on.</P>
    <P>Nothing I have heard from the Minister relating to the managerial control of the schools, in so far as the matters with which the managers are specially concerned, is likely to support the Minister's attitude in the slightest degree.  No attack has been made by Senator O'Connell on the managers in my hearing or by anyone else who has spoken.  It is recognised that many of the managers have great difficulties and they have done their best in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>Wherever the funds come from, it ought to be a relief to the managers to have some of the burdens with which they have struggled for a long time lifted from their shoulders. Some have been able to get over the difficulties; others, through no fault of their own, have not.  There has been no attack either on the managers or the managerial system, and I cannot see how provision of public moneys, as suggested by Senator O'Connell, can interfere with the status, power or influence of the managers.  As I say, I am not familiar with the managerial system, but nothing has been said by the Minister to convince me that there is any substance in that part of his argument.  That is all I have to say&mdash; I may have said too much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">

      <P>I could not agree with the Minister that this debate has served no useful purpose.  Whatever one may think of the rights and wrongs of both sides of the argument, it must be agreed that, merely by drawing attention to the state of affairs that prevails in so many parts of the country, <Col N="394" /> Senator O'Connell has done very useful work indeed, and even though it may not be found possible to accede to his request, in any case, having drawn the attention of the Seanad and, through the Seanad, the attention of the public at large to the importance and, in some respects, the danger of this whole question, Senator O'Connell has done a great public service.</P>
      <P>I do not know that I should go so far as to agree entirely with the terms of the motion, and in that respect I have a great deal of sympathy for the Minister.  Personally, I am always frightened of schemes which imply the taking over by the centralised State of burdens that have for a long time past fallen on the people in particular localities.  There are very many dangers inherent in such a course as that.  There is, first of all, the danger that the public spirit of the people in these areas may become entirely atrophied because they may be inclined to depend entirely for things they ought to have enough energy and intelligence to do for themselves on some distant authority whose actions in the nature of things must be slow and cumbrous.  There is a great danger that if you extend that sort of public provision too far, you will end up by doing more harm than you will do good.  I have the feeling that what is needed rather is a loosening up of the machinery and of the methods that have been employed up to the present in the building and reconditioning of national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator O'Connell very thoroughly showed, the old system is an inadequate system.  It has been handed down to us, almost in a perfect state from the late 19th century and the attitude of the 19th century towards questions like this, and especially the attitude of public departments under the British Government, was very different from what the attitude of a native Government might be.  I have a feeling that the machinery is such that it puts a premium on the kind of haggling Senator O'Connell referred to.  Senator O'Connell would be satisfied if the Department of Education could take a lead in this matter rather than wait for the initiative <Col N="395" /> of the local manager.  Managers, in certain cases, could be gingered up to doing more than perhaps they are in a position to do at the moment because of financial fears and so on.  Everyone who knows anything at all about the subject is aware that managers in distant rural areas where funds are very hard to raise are faced with enormous difficulties in undertaking the provision of the larger sums that are sometimes necessary for the rebuilding or the total building of national schools, but if it was clear to managers that less difficulties would be met by them in their attempts to get help from the Government under the scheme even as it exists at present, I think that quicker progress could be made than is being made now.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty, apart from the one I have mentioned, is that Government action in these matters is apt to be much more expensive than the operations of the local people themselves.  It is very doubtful if the cheaper schools built by local labour would not be quite as satisfactory as the excessively palatial buildings put up by the Board of Works in out of the way districts.  I have a case illustrative of that aspect in my own experience.</P>
    <P>A parish priest, now dead, came to me when I was in the Dáil. He told me he was going to have a consultation with the Department about the building of a new school in a certain part of his parish which I knew well.  He told me he was going to put a particular case to the Department, and his case was this: previously it had been the custom in that part of the country for the manager to employ a local contractor either to build or repair his schools. By doing that, the manager was able to get the building or the repairs done for the two-thirds grant which the Government give, and this manager wished to go before the Department and ask them to put their cards on the table, so to speak, and do the same thing for him&mdash;give him all the money he required in the form of the two-thirds grant.  He pointed out that if they did that, he would be able to get the school built for <Col N="396" /> two-thirds of what it would cost if it were built in the way the Department proposed.  I may say that such a proposal shocked the Department tremendously. Ultimately, the school was built by the Board of Works under some kind of centralised contract.  The result was that a palatial school was put up, a school which, in my opinion, was far more elaborate than the conditions really required.  I have a feeling that a great deal of the building done by the Board of Works in the circumstances of that case and with that machinery is too elaborate, and that you could get equally good results in less time and with less cost if the machinery could be limbered up a little, if the haggling and the delays could be done away with.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister has a review of the whole matter in prospect, and I believe that if there were active co-operation between the Government and the Church authorities in the different dioceses, and if attention were focused on cases in which action is urgently needed, there is nothing in the system as it exists at present that should prevent progress being made.  What really is needed is not to do away with that system or to take refuge in complete State provision, but to make better use of the system as it exists.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other part of Senator O'Connell's motion, I think we ought to make a distinction.  There is a great difference between the heating and lighting of schools, and their cleaning, especially in regard to sanitation. Sanitation is the main question on which public attention should be focussed, and about which something should be speedily done.  As far as the heating of schools is concerned, I am not sure that you are going to get in the long run a more satisfactory method than the contribution of fuel by parents and children.  I am not sure that any other system would be as cheap or efficient.  There are a great many in the Seanad who have had the same experience as I have had, of going to school in the morning with two sods of turf.  That system worked quite well.  Where people have the interests of their children and of themselves <Col N="397" /> at heart there is no reason, under normal circumstances&mdash;apart from the case Senator Baxter mentioned&mdash;in a country district why the present system could not be carried on efficiently.</P>
    <P>Lighting is largely a structural question.  There is very little necessity to contemplate elaborate lighting arrangements.  The question is largely a structural one, but even some of the most modern schools put up by the Board of Works might be said to be deficient in that respect.  Many of these buildings have systems of lighting and ventilation that are extraordinarily cumbersome and old fashioned for this age and I feel that they could have a much simpler system.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Baxter that the situation should be examined by a single authority, that the Department of Education should have an expert architect who would produce a standard type of rural primary school which might be built in the cheapest way with local labour and under local contract.  I do not see that there could be any insuperable difficulty in that.  I believe it would be much more efficient than the present system of see-saw between the Department of Education on the one hand, the Board of Works on the other hand, and the managers as the third party.  Complicated responsibility is for the most part the cause of the trouble.</P>
    <P>I would also like to sympathise with what Senator Baxter said about the resthetic aspect of school building.  This may seem a small point to some but is a matter of enormous importance to the future.  It applies not merely to school buildings but to some of the other building activities of Government Departments.  Parts of the West of Ireland have been ruined by the activities of the Land Commission in putting up imitation suburban houses in country districts and presenting the people with a kind of cross between a police barracks and a picture house as the standard for ordinary dwellings, when there was already in existence an excellent type of rural dwelling which only needed to be improved and, if necessary, modernised, in order to be <Col N="398" /> made perfectly suitable.  The same applies to the national schools.  I think that not enough attention has been devoted to making the school building a real part of rural surroundings. That again is a point on which you can only get results if there is direct contact between the Department of Education and the architect who is advising on plans for schools and who is under the direct control of the Department.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with Senator Baxter when he makes a grievance of the fact that the children have to do their part in the cleaning of schools.  I cannot see what grievance that is.  Many of us remember doing that work when we were young and I do not know that it ever injured health. It certainly could not do harm if there is any sort of sensible organisation and proper supervision.  It is good for the children to be taught how to clean up schools, and it would be a good thing if they applied what they learned in that way in their own homes.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to pay more attention to the reports of medical officers of health on the question of sanitation, idealistic though they may be.  It is really a serious problem, and it is not confined to schools.  It is fraught with great danger, especially in country districts, when dealing with crowds of young people.  If some means could be found by which the conscience of the rural people would be awakened to the need for more attention than they seem to give to it, it would be a great step in advance.  Here again the complication of responsibility is a bad arrangement. It is a very bad thing to have county medical officers of health making these reports year after year and apparently having no authority and no power to carry out their suggestions.  The reports are published and are available not only for ourselves, but to foreigners.  They have a very bad effect on opinion in the world at large, and yet nothing apparently can be done. It is really a matter of organisation and attention, and I suggest that the Department of Education should adopt for a short time the rôle of propagandist by trying to get other bodies <Col N="399" /> interested besides the managers or the teachers.  Some good might be done in that way.  It concerns everyone, and perhaps it is a matter to which the parish councils all over the country might devote their attention.  I do not suggest that elaborate measures should be devised or that you should consider providing every school in Ireland with a water supply.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that that is utterly impossible.  No matter how long a period we allow and no matter what state of prosperity we envisage, there will never come a time when we shall have streamlined schools, with water supplies, electric installations and so forth.  We cannot expect these ideal conditions.  What is really wanted is more vigilance and care.  The responsibility for seeing that these things are attended to should be laid on some single body.  If that were done, you would get an immediate improvement. There is no danger to health in the conditions that prevail in the country generally.  The real danger arises when you have numbers of children crowded in a school where no proper sanitary accommodation is provided.  What is wanted is something simple&mdash;a supply of lime, for instance&mdash;and more attention. The great trouble is unawareness of the danger and of the necessity for constant attention.  If the Department would bestir itself and secure some direct means by which this matter would be attended to, a great step forward would have been taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Connell's motion may be divided into two parts.  As regards the first part, I am in entire agreement with him.  Article 42 (4) of the Constitution lays down quite definitely that the State shall provide for free primary education.  That would apply to the teachers and to the buildings and it might also be argued that it would apply to maintenance.  I do not understand why managers should be called upon in any parish, and particularly in the poorer parishes, to raise these very large sums or to haggle about how much they are to pay when they desire to build a new school.  For that reason, I am entirely with Senator <Col N="400" /> O'Connell in his suggestion that the State should accept that responsibility. In fact, it seems to me that, the moment the Constitution became law, a Bill should have been brought into the Oireachtas implementing that provision and enforcing on the Ministry which happened to be in power the responsibility for building whatever schools were found to be necessary after applications by the managers.</P>
      <P>I join with previous speakers in saying that there is no quarrel whatever in this House with the managerial system.  It works as well as it possibly could under the circumstances which obtain and which the Minister has described.  I cannot see that the taking over by the State of responsibility for the provision of schools should in any way interfere with what the manager is going to do.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the motion, I am, again, mostly in agreement with Senator O'Connell but I am not quite sure as to whether the maintenance should actually be undertaken by the local authorities or by the parish.  I feel that, under the Constitution, that is a definite responsibility of the State but I am not going to argue that.  Like Senator Rowlette, I am deeply concerned as to the state of these schools because not only have I read the memorandum which Senator O'Connell has put before the House&mdash; a memorandum compiled from official documents which cannot be denied&mdash; but I have seen a number of these schools myself.  I often go and have a look at a school to see how things which have been mentioned stand.  I think that the most important defect in all the schools&mdash;new and old&mdash;is the absence of playgrounds.  Where they exist, they have an appearance of sadness and dreariness.  Some of the surroundings of the old schools are really frightful&mdash;mud and stones and misery, all combined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The want of cover is a very important consideration, particularly in the wetter districts.  Take, as an example, the Kenmare district, where, over 14 years, the average rainfall has been 69 inches and in which there are 216 wet days in the year.  By &ldquo;wet days,&rdquo;<Col N="401" /> I mean days during portion of which rain fell.  That means that the children do not play on a number of days. They do not go out at all.  If some sort of cover were built on to the walls so that the children could amuse themselves during the break, it would make a great deal of difference.</P>
    <P>As regards the heating question, I cannot agree with Senator Tierney that everything is quite happy in this respect.  I do not think that the medical officers are altruists.  They are medical men going about the country, and they know the conditions the people can afford.  They lay very considerable stress on this matter.  The carrying of the two sods of turf may present no difficulty to children living near the school but, where children live a long distance from the school, it is a misery to have to carry two sods of turf on a wet day.  In my district, which is a turf district, the families who can afford it send in a rail of turf to make quite sure that the heating is not what I might describe as intermittent.</P>
    <P>In regard both to the mental and bodily development of children, the years devoted to primary education are really the most important years of their lives.  Discomfort in the school of any sort or kind will reduce the value of their primary education.  A child attending school constantly will put in 1,800 hours in the year.  The value of that education will be reduced by discomfort by 50 per cent., and it will also affect the preparation of those young people who pass on to the secondary schools and universities to a very considerable extent.  Coming to the question of sanitation and hygiene, I put on one side the question of water. Although you could have pumps and put the children to pumping the water, I do not think that is necessary provided that the conveniences which do exist are kept clean and that proper disinfectants are used.  In no single case which I have seen in the last week was there any attempt to provide any disinfectant of any sort.</P>
    <P>There is a very considerable point about this hygiene, apart from the liability to disease which has already been talked about, that the absence of <Col N="402" /> proper hygiene and sanitation does not impress on the young people the necessity for maintaining it in their homes in after life.  As other speakers stated, we know there is need for improvement. There is no use pretending that everything is perfect in the country.  It could be greatly improved by the young people who are now growing up if they were trained.  A very great advance has been made in developing primary education.  A number of schools have been built and a certain amount has been done as regards maintenance.  In fact, the Estimates show an appropriation of £9 per annum for each school.  That is, 3/6 per week.  During the summer for many months none of that money is required, so you have about 7/- per week for heating and cleaning during the winter months.</P>
    <P>What I feel about this is that the Minister might go a little quicker in some directions.  The Minister told us that other buildings have got to be built besides primary schools, such as houses.  I want to be broadminded about this and admit that there are other forms of education which have to be catered for, but I feel that this is the most important form of education. The children cannot get full value from higher forms of education unless their primary education is sound.  I understand that £250,000 is in the Estimate this year as purely for new buildings. I may be wrong in this and, if so, the Minister can correct me.  In this emergency a great deal could be done with a considerable part of the £250,000 in reconditioning or temporarily improving the older schools, so that they would be in a better condition over the next ten years instead of spending £250,000 on new buildings.  However, as regards educational buildings, at the risk of getting the normal reply we have an example in the £110 which was spent on Ballyvourney, and the £3,000 which is being spent for adult education during the past years&mdash;money that might have been allocated to what I call the foundation of our national life of the future.</P>
    <P>Primary education is most important in the life of our young people as a <Col N="403" /> whole, and any other education is rather of secondary importance.  As much money as can be spared for education should be definitely allocated to it at the expense of other things until the conditions under which education is being carried on have been made as perfect as possible, without extravagance or luxury.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to debates in this House, I usually hear opinions expressed against any extension of State control no matter to what branch of rural or city life it was intended to apply.  This motion is really intended, if it were acted upon, to widen the scope of State control, at least, to the cleaning, lighting and heating of buildings in which the children of the nation are taught.  Only one Senator to-day has objected to the extension of State control as far as it applies to the subject we are debating.  All seem very much inclined to extend the power and control given to the central authority.  I think that the extended control given to the central authority in this matter would not be to the best advantage of the country.  If not only the buildings, but the heating, lighting, cleaning, the provision of the meals for school children and the provision of books were to be handed over to the central authority, it would debar local people, whose children are being taught in the schools, from having practically any interest in the educational facilities within their purview.  I do not think it would really be the best solution to have the central authority to take over the whole managerial system&mdash;I use the word in the widest sense&mdash;the equipment and practically everything except the actual teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that the medical officers' reports as they have been circulated for our perusal, are certainly alarming. If they are to be read literally, it indicates a very serious condition of affairs in reference to many schools.  I could understand that a medical officer inspecting a school could classify it as having some defects, and that the defects might be very slight.  It would then appear that while many schools were defective they might be defective only to a very small extent.  Even with <Col N="404" /> all that, there is a very large percentage of schools indicated as being practically uninhabitable and condemned. Now I think the medical officers' reports are an indictment of the managers who are controlling these schools, and of citizens living in the neighbourhood.  I must say I speak only from my own observation and I cannot speak from any inner knowledge, but my feeling is that once a child leaves school in the country, until he is a man or until he has children going to school, he has no practical interest in the school&mdash;how it is equipped, how it is built and ventilated, or how it is heated.  He takes very little interest in it until he has children of his own to go back to the school and even then he just looks upon the school as an institution and takes very little interest in it.</P>
    <P>The fact that there are these numerous reports in regard to unsatisfactory schools is an indictment of somebody.  I think it is an indictment of the managers who are in control, and the people living in these districts. I have often heard it said when one passing along the road sees a neglected school, that the manager is disinterested, that he is old and is not taking sufficient interest in the management of the school.  If that be so, I think it is no harm this debate has taken place because, to put it as simply as possible, a &ldquo;shaking up&rdquo; is due to the people who have been negligent as far as the maintenance of schools is concerned.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Tierney that the initiative should come from the central authority, the Department of Education.  The Minister said that the first step ought to be taken by the local people, that is, by the manager or somebody from the district concerned; but really it seems to me that speeding up should be insisted upon from headquarters, as Senator Tierney suggested. If we had a better social spirit or a better sense of responsibility amongst the people generally, I think many of these complaints would be rectified automatically.  It seems to me that the supervision, examination and maintenance of the schools at a proper standard should be one of the <Col N="405" /> functions of the parish councils, which we heard eulogised so much just a year ago, and which seem to be fading into thin air just now.  We want a proper civic spirit carried to the end of our land.  I think that Muintir na Tíre, the parish councils and local committees of that kind should interest themselves in seeing that local schools are properly maintained, lighted and heated.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that in rural districts&mdash; and, indeed, in the city the same remarks would apply&mdash;we do not take much interest in our schools or go very often inside them to see how they are equipped.  We all like to see a new school after it has been built, and we must all admire the splendid buildings that have been erected in recent times in the city area.  It has been stated that some of these buildings are palatial.  I think that even in rural districts the local school should be an outstanding building even if it cannot be classified as palatial.  It should be a distinctive building in the rural area or small town.</P>
    <P>I should like again to say that the medical officers' reports as to the unsatisfactory condition of schools are certainly disquieting when one remembers that children have to spend so many hours of their young lives in buildings that do not conform to decent standards.  The difficulty as regards lighting in these buildings in the country is obvious although artificial light would only be necessary after the pupils had gone home.  If there is sufficient natural light in the schools, there is no ground for complaint and I think the designs of our modern architects and engineers leave no ground for complaint on that line.  As regards heating, I think the practice nowadays is to make a contribution towards the cost of fuel rather than actually to bring fuel to the school.  As regards the cleaning and dusting, if these duties were to be taken over by the central authority I think it would lead to great difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the suggestion I do make, that I am afraid that once people leave school, they do not go inside that school again until their children are growing up and can attend the school.  That is why I agree with Senator Tierney that there should be a &ldquo;shaking up&rdquo; from the central authority of the people who are responsible locally for the maintenance of schools throughout the country.  The question of school meals, which is a very live problem, has not been mentioned.  That has involved difficulties with the teachers and the net result of exending the control of the central authority would be that, apart from the fact that the Government had to supply funds to provide these meals, the central authority would have to be responsible for all details connected with supplying these meals.  There is also the question of supplying school books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point is that you would have too great a control by the central authority and too little interest shown by the people living in the immediate vicinity of the schools where their children are being taught and where, in many cases, they were taught themselves.  You must have a greater sense of responsibility amongst parents who live in areas served by these schools.  If a manager is not taking sufficient interest in the equipment and care of a school, it is the duty of the parents and of residents of that district to point that out to him.  As the Minister has said, the first <Col N="407" /> step must be taken by the manager and the parishioners should see that that step is taken.  The suggestion has been made that the Department of Education should take the first step if it has not been already taken by somebody else.  I think that a very good suggestion and then, perhaps, we would not have so many reports from medical officers, year after year, complaining of the unsatisfactory condition of so many rural schools.</P>
    <P>One last remark in connection with water supplies and sanitation.  To my mind, a water supply is more easily provided in the country than is proper sanitation.  I think that a proper water supply should be available in every school&mdash;I mean a supply for the purpose of washing, as well as for drinking. I speak from experience, having seen young children going out to play on the playground, or on the road where there is no playground, and coming back with their hands and faces in a soiled condition.  It would be a great training for them in afterlife, if they were taught to wash their hands and faces before coming back to school and a proper water supply for that purpose should always be available. If they came to school in the morning with soiled faces, it would be a good thing if the teacher made them go out and wash themselves.</P>
    <P>There are some districts where they could not put in a pipe system but where there could be a water-carriage system for sanitation and where, with very little difficulty, an efficient water supply could be obtained, in the vicinity of the school, for drinking and washing purposes.  The water-carriage system of sanitation would be the <i>optimum</i> for any large school and in any thickly populated district; and when there is a water supply in the town through the board of health it would be easy to have the water-carriage system available in the school, if it were in the vicinity of the sewerage system of that town or village.  There has been extensive improvement in water supply and sanitation to towns and villages throughout the country. Though I cannot speak with actual <Col N="408" /> knowledge now, I feel that schools could be connected, in many cases, with such water-carriage systems by very little expenditure.</P>
    <P>Senator Tierney made some very valuable remarks in this debate in connection with the rural districts.  The fact of lime being available should provide one of the most effective ways of dealing with dry-closet sanitation. These are questions in which parish councils, guilds of Muintir na Tíre and other local committees should be interested.  They could urge the Department of Education to take steps &mdash;which should be taken&mdash;to improve the existing buildings and provide any facilities urgently required.  On the other hand, it should be possible for the central authority to take the initial step or to force the local manager&mdash; if he has been negligent&mdash;to discharge his duties as supervisor and manager of a local school.</P>

      <P>An old lady was heard expressing piously her gratitude to the Almighty Giver of all goods: &ldquo;Wherever,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there is a big city, God Almighty has sent a big river to supply it with water for sanitation.&rdquo;  By the way, it never has occurred to anyone to make that an argument for the existence of God.  It is recalled to me by my friend Senator O'Donovan's talk about the water supply.  Would it never occur to anyone to erect the schoolhouse where the facilities requisite for the proper type of school could be provided?  I know of country houses, privately occupied, where hydraulic rams are used to get a very adequate supply of water from comparatively small rivers.  That is the starting point for the reform that, in conjunction with the motion before the House, I should like to have an opportunity to advocate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several of the speakers, including Senator Tierney, may be forgiven for their comparative youth in regard to this problem.  A good many of the evils of which we are complaining to-day existed long ago, and many reports and protests appeared frequently in the pages of the newspapers, and still the evil is here confronting us now.  I was brought back to my youth by my friend's remark: &ldquo;If all these things <Col N="409" /> are as they are described, then it means that somebody must be indicted.&rdquo;  And who?  Here, for a moment, the Senator's vigilance was relaxed, when he said the managers were to be indicted. I remember when the late Dr. Starkie, who was very prominent in the educational world as Resident Commissioner, made precisely the same attack before the Royal Society meeting in Belfast.  One of the immediate consequences was a controversy&mdash;wild as it usually is when it arises amongst our people.  The Catholic population were divided immediately into &ldquo;Catholics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Starkie-ite Catholics&rdquo;&mdash;shortened into &ldquo;Starkies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The managers are not to blame, and never were to blame, and no one who is acquainted with the problem and its difficulties would ever dream of blaming them.  Senator O'Donovan put the proper culprit into the dock, when he was looking for someone to indict: it is the people&mdash;the fathers and mothers of the children.  I do not think I am fair in calling them the proper culprits, because the tradition has been carried on, generation after generation, of hostility to the schools.  It has a double origin&mdash;one part of it is that the schoolhouses and school life made the majority of the school children hate the schools and look upon the teacher as the enemy&mdash;and the archenemy was the Minister for Education and all his minions centred in the capital.  It is an unfortunate fact, but it is a fact.  The school is a purgatory &mdash;a place or state of punishment where some souls suffer for a time before they can be sent to work to earn wages.  On the other hand, there is the evil tradition&mdash;the origin and purpose of primary schools.  They were founded here with the expressly deliberate intention of anglicising and proselytising the Irish people.  The hostility which that campaign aroused has survived to some extent to the present day.  The people do not like the schools sufficiently to build them alongside their churches and entirely out of their own funds.</P>
    <P>Since I last spoke on this subject&mdash; it was in the Dáil&mdash;there have been ever so many superb schools set up throughout the country.  The late Canon McHugh, for instance, was at <Col N="410" /> pains to set up splendid schools.  If anyone wants to see what a schoolhouse can be like, he has not much of a pilgrimage to make.  He can go to St. Mary's, in Haddington Road, and he will see there a magnificent schoolhouse which was built almost entirely out of the pocket of the Bishop of Thasos.  The expense in that case was borne almost entirely by one man, filled with enthusiasm for education and knowing, as he did, that it was part of the salvation of the people that their children should be properly brought up in housing appropriate to the imparting of education.</P>
    <P>After all these years, it is not too late to blow my own horn by claiming for myself the credit for having introduced medical inspection of schools.  I regret it is not yet done on a more comprehensive scale, even to include secondary schools.  But what is the use of inspecting some of the schoolhouses I have seen in Connemara? I made it my business during one summer holiday to go around the schools in a large part of Connacht and what I saw there was infinitely depressing, and the unfortunate thing is that nobody was to blame.</P>
    <P>It is a very encouraging and inspiriting experience to sit here and see interest in education and the schools revivified.  There are so many things that we have to do. So many demands are made on those entrusted with the reconstruction of the nation that it is hard to know where to begin, or how to carry on, and I think, when we take that into consideration, that there is hardly anyone to blame.  The blame is in history.</P>
    <P>At the present moment it is surprising to learn that so many millions are being spent on the actual provision of schoolhouses.  I took down a note from the Minister's speech that it would take ten years after Peace and an expenditure of £5,000,000 to cover the programme.  I do not think there is one man in a hundred thousand in this Twenty-Six County State who has any idea that so much has been done or that so much of the money raised by public taxation is being expended in that direction.  One of the Senators who has spoken aroused opposition in <Col N="411" /> me.  He talked as if we were to continue dotting the country with little unwholesome school buildings.</P>
    <P>Forty years ago or more, I showed how the number of schoolhouses could be reduced and it is easier to carry out that reform now than it was in those days.  The schoolhouse can be one of the sources of disease.  There are two diseases to which our climate is incident.  I look upon rheumatism as a national disease.  It costs us more in days lost by workers than would build palaces of schoolhouses in every county, and, to a large extent also, it is the source of tuberculosis.  If we had large central schools in chosen positions, and a motor bus collecting the children from the outlying districts and bringing them home again, they would arrive into school dry shod and with dry clothes.  Everyone knows the difficulty of imparting education to children standing shivering in sodden clothes in unwholesome, badly ventilated schoolrooms, apart altogether from the state of fatigue and discomfort that defeats the efforts of the best teachers.  No teacher can teach a pupil who is ill at ease or whose mind is preoccupied with something else.  That is a notorious fact.  One must be comfortable in order to listen to a university professor in a university college. Unless the teacher has got the pupil in the appropriate condition for the reception of knowledge, his teaching is wasted.</P>
    <P>Look how many things we could do in the big central school.  It could be laid out on fine lines.  You could have so many classrooms for the proper distribution of the day's curriculum. You could also have surroundings which would exercise a wholesome influence on the pupils by making them determined on having their own homes laid out on similar lines.  You could have it well equipped with a school library, with all the appliances that are so useful, for example, the cinematograph projector, and the teaching of geography and allied subjects through its exhibition of the activities of the different peoples, their industries and civilisation.  You could have all these <Col N="412" /> things, and, above all, a chosen staff of the best teachers because, the amount expended on salaries being proportionately less, better salaries could be paid.</P>
    <P>I do not look forward to a future in which every little village has its own schoolhouse.  Rather, I look to the time when the State will recognise that the education of the children is the foundation of the State&mdash;I am not speaking exclusively about religious or moral training.  Undoubtedly, the greatest asset the nation has at any particular era is the child and youth population, and you must learn to look on them in that light.  Not merely the parents of the children, but other civic-minded people of the State, are trustees for them, for their future health and education and general well-being.  We cannot expect to have a good citizen of a good State after leaving him to grow up anyhow.</P>
    <P>I began by differing in some respects from the Senator who preceded me, but he laid his finger on the spot when he referred to civic virtue.  What we are lacking in, and I do not think anyone will deny it, is not civic spirit, but the proper direction of it.  We are as patriotic as anybody under the sun.  We are full of civic spirit, yet know not how it is to be applied, nor how we are to harness it to get the last ounce of value from it.  We have not tried to do that, and it should be one of the subjects in the schools. Children should be taught what it means to be members of a State and what the State has a right to expect from them in virtue of what the State and the organised community does for them.  It would be very hard to persuade people that we are interested in carrying out the terms of the Constitution if they find themselves obliged to get the only training to fit them for life in the world in ill-equipped, insalubrious schoolhouses.</P>
    <P>Senator Tierney began by saying that this is everybody's business.  Undoubtedly it is and it should be brought home to Mr. Everybody that it <Col N="413" /> is his business, and that he should be prepared to be interested and to pay for it.  I do not see that the managerial system could in any way be interfered with if this great charge of providing well equipped and ideally organised buildings were a charge upon the State.  The management of the courses, the supervision and employment of the teacher, all these things could still be a local duty and a local interest.  They are not at all irreconcilable to me as a great enemy, according to the measure of my power, of undue interference on the part of the State.  I have inveighed against bureaucracy until I am sick of inveighing against it or any shadow of its approach.  Someone who said that Communism was just round the bend of the road was answered promptly by somebody else saying: &ldquo;Let us see that we keep it there.&rdquo;  If someone were to say that bureaucracy is around the bend of the road then let us all do our best to keep it around the bend and allow it to get no further. Bureaucracy is only a disease of the rule of Departments.  We have the Department of Education and through that there is State control.  That State control can work in a beneficent way for the local imparting of education. Inspectors can be very helpful as specialists in education, and instead of going out as spies reporting on the teachers, making enemies of teachers by classifying them in ways that affect their salaries, they could be most useful in promoting a high level of education in their districts.  That would be State interference, no doubt, but it would be State interference only in the good sense of friendliness, of helpfulness.  It would be benign and friendly interference.</P>
    <P>What we have got to do is to make education popular.  We have got to get the teacher to realise that the whole Nation is with him instead of the teacher having at teachers' congresses to fight for his salary, to fight against reduction of the salary and trying to better his position.  We, especially through the Legislative, should do something to make the teacher feel that we look upon him as next to the priest&mdash;next to the minister <Col N="414" /> of God.  He is one of the nation builders and I do not see why he should be condemned to spend so much of his life under uncongenial circumstances. Just as the young pupil must be put in a proper state of mind to receive education, so you must also have the teacher satisfied and contented in order to get his best work from him.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to know that after 21 years or so an active interest is again being taken by members of the Oireachtas in the provision of educational instruments of nation building. It seems to me that the State is not interfering unduly when it does for the individual what the individual cannot do for himself.  The State is made up of communities, with the initial cell the family.  Families in the townland and families in the parishes cannot under present circumstances raise money to build proper schools, even if the builders and building material were forthcoming.  Their interest in the schools could be fomented and preserved if they made a local contribution towards it.  All the citizens who are going to benefit by having the level of their fellow citizens raised and who realise that they are thereby improving and bettering themselves would be quite willing to have national taxation devoted to the provision of schoolhouses and the maintenance of them in repair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one or two points to make on this debate. The first is that we all agree that it is necessary to have in each parish a good school, properly ventilated and with a proper water supply and all the other necessities which would make it what a school should be.  I notice that one speaker said that in the matter of school buildings the manager should be blamed, another said the Government should be blamed, and someone else said that it was the people who were to blame.  We also heard extracts from the reports of county medical officers of health.  Of course, it is very little use to have a medical officer making a report and <Col N="415" /> then saying: &ldquo;I have made my report and no further can I go.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If a county medical officer of health reports that the house of an ordinary citizen was insanitary or that the dwelling was dangerous, the next step is that the local authorities, now the county managers, serve a notice stating that that person has got to vacate the house and, if it is not put into a proper condition, it must be demolished. Probably we would be able to solve this difficulty in regard to schools, or at least to take one step forward in that direction, if county medical officers of health made a recommendation that certain repairs should be made or that some necessity should be supplied to a school and be empowered to serve an order on the manager or whoever was the responsible authority to have the work carried out, it would be better.  When that is not done, that is where the big snag lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Connell suggests that the Minister for Education or the Department should take over the erection, and the local authorities the maintenance and inspection of schools.  I do not think that that would solve the problem or that it would do all the things we were told were necessary. The first thing we should aim at is to get the people and children in the parish to have respect for the schools, to regard the school in the parish as their school.  My suggestion would be that every county council would set up these parish councils&mdash;not as they are presently constituted but as more or less elected bodies of the county councils&mdash;to form school committees.  I would not be inclined to give them a lot more power over local administration, such as old age pensions and other things, but it would be a good thing if you had a committee of local people, of fathers of families in a parish who would take some interest in the schools and who would meet quarterly or half-yearly.  They would see what was necessary in regard to schools and what contributions should be raised in order to have necessary repairs carried out.  If it was a question of a new school the Department <Col N="416" /> would, taking local conditions into consideration, make the necessary grant.</P>
    <P>We are inclined to place too much responsibility on the central authority. We want the Government to do this, that and the other thing from central funds.  While we want that, we talk a lot about Governments taking to themselves excessive control.  We want them to give but we do not want to give anything ourselves.  In a number of places, there is a difficulty in providing school accommodation.  The manager will tell you in some of these cases that he would have built a school years ago, but that he found it impossible to get a site.  To make a start in this matter, the manager or Department should have power to acquire the necessary land.  When the Minister takes this power to himself, I suggest that he should obtain sufficient land to enable a teacher's residence to be built beside the school.  It is very regrettable that in a number of rural areas, three or four miles from a town or city, the principal teacher and his assistant reside in the urban district.  They travel out&mdash;formerly by motor and now by cycle or horse transport&mdash;each day, open the workshop, work for the number of hours prescribed and return to the town or city, taking no further interest in the parish or in the children of the district. That is bad.  Attached to every school in a rural area should be a teacher's residence, so that the teacher would be part of the parish.  It has a bad influence on young people to realise that the teacher, whom they look up to as one of the best educated persons in the parish, is not content to live in the parish.  We used to talk a lot about the flight from the land.  Here is an example of it.  In former years, the teacher occupied second place to the priest in a parish.  If the people required assistance or advice, they went either to the parish priest or to the teacher.  In many cases now, the teacher is not there to give that advice or to take part in organising dramatic societies or games for the children in after-hours.  Senator Magennis put forward a more elaborate scheme&mdash; that the schools should be built in particular <Col N="417" /> areas and that the children should be conveyed to those schools. That would be a very good plan, but I am afraid it is so elaborate that we cannot hope for anything like it in the near future.</P>
    <P>Senator Tierney suggested that the Department should have standard plans for schools.  I know a little bit about building and my view is that there is too much standard building and that too little consideration is given to the locality in which the building is to be erected.  There is an old story that, during the British régime, when the railway was being built from Galway to Clifden, the plan for a station house was sent by mistake to the West Indies, and the plan for the West Indies building was sent to Clifden.  That lack of suitability occurs not alone in respect of schools but in respect of all Government buildings. It happens even in the case of labourers' cottages.  No regard is had to the particular area in which the building is to be erected.  For that reason, I would not agree with Senator Tierney's suggestion that the Department should have a standard plan for rural schools, irrespective of the place where the school is to be erected.  The question of a water supply to schools has also been referred to.  It was stated that it was impossible to provide our schools with a proper water supply. With that I do not agree.  So long as you are prepared to incur the necessary expenditure, you will be able to provide the water supply.  In the cases of most schools, the water is obtained from the village pump.  That pump is, as a rule, adjacent to the school and it serves not only the school but the village.  Senator Magennis referred to the very bad schools be saw in Connemara. Generally, that is not the case. There are few areas in Ireland, taking everything into consideration, where schools are better served, so far as water supplies are concerned than in Connemara.  There may be bad schools in Connemara, but they are not anything worse than in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Tierney referred to the red tape of the Department in getting a <Col N="418" /> contractor to do necessary work instead of leaving the matter to the manager, who could have it done more cheaply by local labour.  Anybody who wants a job done can always get it done cheaply, provided he is not particular about how it is done.  But if State money is to be expended there must be proper supervision of the expenditure and in these cases there must be plans and specifications. Whether the work is done by the local authorities or the Board of Works does not make much difference.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell suggested that the repairs should be carried out by the local authorities.  In that case, also, plans, specifications, supervision and inspection would be necessary.  I do not think there was much point in the argument that the work would be done more cheaply by allowing the manager to have it carried out in his own way.  As regards the schools condemned by the medical officers of health, the difficulty seems to be to ascertain the responsible authority for carrying out the necessary repairs.  It does not seem as if many people like to blame the managers.  It is extraordinary that oftentimes you find in a parish that a school has been in a very bad condition over a period of years.  Then, it comes about that there is a change.  There is a new parish priest installed and in a very short time an attempt is made to build a new school.  Well, one must certainly admit that the new manager had become a little active and interested in the school.</P>
    <P>I think that the difficulty at the present time is that where a manager takes things easy, as many of them do, there is no authority to appeal to.  The local people, of course, have not much say in it and, even if every father and mother wanted a new school, and was prepared to make a contribution towards it, there is no way in which they can make their voices heard, except, of course, that they can organise a strike as was done in Mayo.  That is not done generally, and if anything like that is done there is always the suspicion that there is something more behind it than a mere demand for a school.  I do not think it is good that <Col N="419" /> we should always be giving more authority to the Central Government and asking them to do some of the things we should encourage the local people to do for themselves.  The time has come when we should reconsider the whole matter, place more confidence in the people and try to do something that will encourage them to be interested in their village.  One of the best ways of doing that would be to have parish committees.  I do not mean the present committees, but committees that would be elected by the heads of the families or otherwise and that would have some authority.</P>
    <P>If necessary, they would have power to levy a small rate or contribution.  If the manager was one of those who did not take an active interest in the schools, then they would have power to petition the Minister or to take up the matter with the Department.  At present it seems that no one can take the initiative except that the manager approaches the Department to look for a grant.  I am sure that it very rarely happens that the Department approaches the manager.  If the manager does not take the first step there is no school.  Something should be done to remedy that position&mdash;either the Department should have power to take the first step and request the manager to take up the matter, or power should be given to somebody to take it up with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should explain that when I said it is the manager's duty to take the first step I meant that with regard to the actual building of the school.  If a school requires attention, the inspectors have instructions to call the manager's attention to it, and medical officers have, up to recently, called the attention of the manager to unsatisfactory schools.  As far as calling the attention of the manager to the position is concerned the Seanad may rest assured that that is being done, but sending a manager a form is not exactly taking the first step.  The manager has to put up a definite proposal that he intends to proceed with a new school.  That is what I meant by the manager taking the first step.</P>

      <P>The board of health have powers when medical officers report to them that a school is insanitary.  Not all schools that are condemned as unsatisfactory are insanitary. I suggest that some Senators are under a misapprehension in this respect.  A school may be condemned as being unsatisfactory because it has insufficient playground space or because it has not the necessary amount of cubic space to accommodate the number of children.</P>
      <P>It would not be correct to assume that a school classified as unsuitable is insanitary.  I have not seen the report circulated to Senators, but if I had I would have gone into the matter. I intend to see that in future medical officers, if I can arrange it, will make a distinction in their reports between cases where they condemn a school as being insanitary and where they condemn it as being unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister a question with regard to sanitation in the schools and simple methods of sanitation, which is so important both for the health of the children and the health of the community, and also for the education and civilisation of our young people.  It seems to me that the Army must have had in recent times an opportunity of garnering a great deal of useful information. Has the Minister or those interested in education and in this question of establishing simple sanitary systems in the schools tapped any of that experience?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the school managers were circularised in 1933 calling attention to the matter of sanitation and their duty in that respect. It was a circular to managers of national schools calling attention to the work required to be carried out from time to time to keep the school in a proper condition and calling specific attention to the fact that public health authorities, through the medical officers of health, had certain responsibilities to carry out and that <Col N="421" /> therefore action should be taken by the managers accordingly.  In 1936, after consultation with the Local Government Department and the medical staff, a circular was issued giving specific instructions as to the manner in which earth closets should be maintained. I do not wish to take up the time of the House, but I could let Senators, if they wish, have copies of the circular.  In any case, specific instructions were given in it as to the way in which earth closets should be dealt with.  I do not think, having got expert medical advice on the measures to be taken, that there is anything further that it would be necessary to get from the Army.</P>

      <P>I am sorry about that.  I will send you a copy.  This debate has been an interesting one from many points of view.  I think it was Senator Mrs. Concannon, who at the outset expressed regret that we were discussing this matter in a small House, and that, too, is significant, symptomatic of the interest that is taken generally in educational matters. We have an instance of it in the newspapers this morning.  Two <Col N="422" /> of the three daily papers have not even one line of reference to the debate that took place on this matter last night.  One of these papers devoted two columns with a leading article to the censorship debate.  It is evident that <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i> is a bigger draw here, and possibly for the readers of the newspapers, than matters dealing with education, but that is, as I say, symptomatic of the whole position. There is no real interest taken in educational matters in this country.  I went through five election campaigns as a candidate in my time and through a number of by-election campaigns in support of other candidates.</P>
      <P>At meetings which I attended and other meetings which I addressed, meetings of my own Party or of other Parties to which I listened, while every possible kind of question, political, economic and general, was raised, never at one meeting did I hear any question or any reference to education; never did I hear anybody heckle a candidate and ask what he was going to do about schools and about education.  It was none of their concern. That seemed to be the attitude. There is no public opinion on education and, therefore, when Senator Counihan and some others said&mdash;the Minister himself even said something like it&mdash;that there was no public demand for this motion as introduced here, he stated what was true.  There is no public demand for it, but is that to suggest that we are to say nothing about it in the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested by some of the speakers that this was a proposal to strip the people of any responsibility in connection with education.  That is not the proposal.  The proposal is to put responsibility on them but to put it upon them in a regularised way. The people have no direct responsibility now.  Senator Counihan said the Department were doing everything that was necessary.  I think it would take a lot to convince us that that is correct.  He gave us an example of what was being done in a particular parish.  He began by saying that the schools had been allowed to fall into a disgraceful condition and that it was because of the fortuitous circumstance <Col N="423" /> that an energetic curate was appointed that things were made right.  He agreed that some schools were in a disgraceful condition and he said that the managers&mdash;I took a special note of his words&mdash;should be made to do their duty.  He did not suggest how, but we had a suggestion from Senator O'Dwyer as to how they should be made to do their duty.  He said the Department had a weapon in their hands, that if the managers failed to carry out the duty imposed on them, the Department could refuse to pay the teachers' salaries.  I am sure that Senator O'Dwyer, in the course of his historical readings, came across an institution known as the Whipping Boy. When princes and nobles were being educated long ago there was always a commoner educated in conjunction with them.  In any case, he was made a sort of stand-by, so that, whenever the prince deserved punishment, the whipping boy was called up to receive the punishment.</P>
    <P>It is related that there was a character named Barney Fitzpatrick, who served as a whipping boy for Edward IV, and there was a famous character named Murray, who fulfilled the same function for Charles I. Strange to say, these names are common enough amongst us nowadays, but in this case the teachers are to be made the whipping boys.  It is the children, however, who will suffer if the schools are closed.  If that particular penalty is enacted&mdash;and as I said in my opening speech, the only penalty the Department can inflict on a manager who fails to carry out his duty is to withdraw all grants from the school and let the school be closed&mdash;the teachers who are deprived of their salaries may number only one or two individuals, but 40 or 50 children will be deprived of education.</P>
    <P>I have listened to many speeches and Ministerial statements from time to time, but I cannot say that I have ever listened to one which caused me more despair than that made by the Minister to-day because his speech was a counsel of despair.  A number of Senators spoke in this debate, but none of <Col N="424" /> them was prepared to say that things were satisfactory or even nearly satisfactory. The Minister went very near saying it, if he did not actually say it. He seemed from his attitude to resent the bringing forward of this matter at all.  He referred to the fact that the question was debated on a previous occasion.  If he had the same occasion in mind as I have&mdash;the occasion when I brought this matter forward in the Dáil when I was a member of that House&mdash;he was referring to a discussion which took place about 1927 or 1928.  He asked what circumstances have occurred in the meantime to necessitate this motion.  What wonderful improvement has taken place in the meantime, I ask?  I think that is the answer to the Minister.  How much further are we now from where we were in 1928 in regard to the matters mentioned in this debate&mdash;the sanitary condition of our schools?  I shall give the answer from the Minister himself.  Six hundred schools, he told us last July, required to be replaced, 300 of them in an urgent category.  That is the answer, and that is why I think it necessary to bring forward this motion now.  He said that I had assumed that there was not likely to be any dissent, and that I should have produced evidence to show that the change would not be resisted.  I produced evidence to show why I thought there was no reason why it should be resisted.  It was the Minister's duty, if he thought it would be resisted, to produce evidence to show that.  He has not produced evidence to show that it would be resisted or that there is any reason for resistance to the change.</P>
    <P>Again the Minister more or less repeated what he said last July, that the system was a homogeneous entity and that it could not be interfered with without dire results.  He said that some distinguished ecclesiastic told him long ago that the system was not very far from being ideal.  I cannot conceive that when that opinion was expressed the system that was referred to had anything to do with the matter we have discussed here, material buildings and their condition.  The system, in so far as managers and the Church have <Col N="425" /> control of the teachers and of the teaching in the schools, of religious instruction, etc., is not very far from being ideal.  It is probably as near the ideal as can be reached, but no one would suggest, and I feel sure it was not intended to be conveyed to the Minister by this ecclesiastic, that the system under which school buildings are erected, and especially are maintained, is anything like ideal.  Nobody could suggest that.  The Minister says that these things cannot be done in a hurry, that school buildings cannot be erected in a hurry, that there must be time for discussion and consideration. I wonder what would he consider a reasonable time for discussion and consideration.  I could give him an example of a case where a recommendation was made by his own Department, as long ago as 20 years, that a new school should be provided and it is not provided yet.  I gave him an example of discussions and considerations that took place over seven and eight years.  A whole generation of children, from the infants to the seventh standard, have passed through the school in the meantime, and the mark of that unsatisfactory building and of the unhealthy conditions under which they worked will remain with them all their lives.  The Minister sought to make our flesh creep by saying that, if there were interference in the direction suggested, there would be contention, confusion and chaos.  I do not believe that.  I profess to know as much about it and, if I may say so with respect, to have longer experience of these things than the Minister.  I am prepared to say that, whatever may be the view in official quarters, 80 per cent. of the individual managers would welcome this change.  Seven years ago, in my organisation, I prepared a pamphlet in which this very claim was put forward. It was circulated to every manager, and not one protest was received from any quarter.  On the other hand, many statements, letters and verbal messages came to me approving of it.</P>

      <P>If the purpose for which the rate is struck is a good and proper one, it should be struck.  In that matter of rates, Senator Counihan, towards the end of his speech, gave the real reason for his opposition.  Under the present conditions, who is bearing this local contribution, wherever it is taken up?  It is the parents of the children&mdash;very often the poorest people.  The manager has no power to strike a rate, but he often makes a collection.  The banks, insurance institutions and railway companies get off scot free, although they are big ratepayers in the district.  I suppose that Senator Counihan is a fairly big ratepayer in his own district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose he would not give the field free if that were the case.  It was Senator Counihan, I think, who stated that this would be the thin end of the wedge to oust the managers from the school.  That cock will not fight nowadays.  It was good enough to make a suggestion of that kind when we were under an alien Government.  Who in this country <Col N="427" /> wishes to oust the managers from the schools?  No one wants to do that and no one should suggest it.  It is not correct or proper to make a suggestion of that kind, and it is an insult to our people.</P>
      <P>There was an objection on the ground of centralisation.  Senator Mrs. Concannon suggested that my proposal is revolutionary.  It is not revolutionary: it is being done already as far as the first portion of the motion is concerned.  Schools are being built nowadays the whole cost of which is provided by the State.  I pointed that out in my address yesterday.  There is nothing revolutionary in saying that all the schools should be provided in that way.  In the case of some of the schools which were built in that way, what is happening at present?  I agree with Senator Hawkins that in Connemara there are some of the best schools; the whole cost of erection was provided by the State and the local people were not asked to provide anything. But no provision of any kind is made by the State for repairs and the schools are allowed to fall into disrepair. The woodwork should have been painted every three or four years, or perhaps more frequently, in those damp districts in the West of Ireland. I, myself, saw a new school after ten years, where you could put a finger through the woodwork on the doors and window frames, as the manager was not allowed one penny towards the cost of repairs.  Everyone knows that some repairs are always necessary, and if there were some authority to look after these things the life of the building would be extended considerably. When these things are not attended to for ten or 12 years, a big grant is necessary for the reconstruction of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a question as to what managers could and what they should do.  I wish to make it clear that I do not indict or blame the managers in any way.  Cases were quoted by the Minister showing what some managers have done.  Some managers have worked miracles, but they are not all miracle workers.  They cannot be, <Col N="428" /> under the conditions in some places. It is quite impossible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>In some places, no miracle could happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In some places, it is impossible for them to raise money for some of the things they are expected to do.  I will give an instance of what has happened, as shown by the Appropriation Accounts for 1939-40.  A grant of £45,000 was voted by the Dáil as a Grant-in-Aid towards the heating and cleaning of the schools.  Only £35,000 odd was expended.  In the Appropriation Accounts, the explanation given for the discrepancy between what was voted and what was spent was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The saving&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>and that word is significant&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is accounted for by the number of cases in which managers of schools neglected to claim grants under the scheme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What was the explanation of the neglect?  We have it from Mr. O'Neill, the secretary, who was being examined before the Committee of Public Accounts and when this particular paragraph was referred to, the following discussion took place:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Chairman: Why do not the managers claim the grant under the scheme?</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Neill: They have to raise the money themselves.  In the western areas particularly, each manager has a good many schools. One manager might, for instance, have eight or nine schools and he finds it rather difficult to raise the actual amount that we require in cash, so that there are very considerable gaps in the claims.  The result is that in nearly 10 per cent. of the cases mainly from those western areas mangers have not sent in claims.  In the eastern areas and the well-off areas, there are fewer gaps as each manager has not so many schools and there is much more money.  The scheme, however, is not working as satisfactorily as we had hoped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Benson: Does that mean <Col N="429" /> that the schools are inadequately heated?&mdash;I am afraid it does.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(Questions 343-344 Committee of Public Accounts, 1939-40.)</P>
    <P>He said that in nearly 10 per cent. of the cases no claim had been made for the grant.  On first sight it looks rather strange that the manager did not claim it.  The reason he did not claim it was because he was not able to fulfil the conditions necessary to claim it.  If a manager had to spend £40, £50 or £60 on heating and cleaning, he had to spend it during this particular winter and he might hope to get half of it back by next May or June if he had not exceeded the limit. Because he was not able to raise it, he knew there was no use in claiming the grant&mdash;he had not fulfilled the conditions of the grant because he could not fulfil them.</P>
    <P>The Minister got rather indignant when he was replying to the statement made by Senator Baxter and he wanted to be supplied with the names of the schools.  I suggest that he should take up the report of the medical officer of health.  There he will find the names.  I did not give the names in the memorandum I circulated but most of the reports have them. There are general statements but there are particular statements about each school, and while the Minister may think the standards of the medical officers of health rather high, surely there is ample evidence there that in many areas such conditions exist?  They are not isolated instances &mdash;they are general all over the country. The Minister will have no difficulty in finding evidence that things are anything but satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that in some areas the medical officer has condemned, within two or three years, a majority of the schools in a particular county.  I do not regard that as sensible or reasonable.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends on what you call unsuitable.  I am referring especially to the sanitary conditions of schools and I say that in the majority of the schools in rural Ireland the conditions are unsuitable and dangerous to health.  The Minister says that earth closets are the normal thing.  They should not be the normal thing, even if it is not possible to provide other systems.  There are such things as Elsan closets or closets of that type.  Of course, all this costs money, but it costs money to maintain people in hospital and it costs money, too, to build hospitals.  Of course, it costs money.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has any knowledge of the way these earth closets are cleaned out, when they are cleaned out once a year or once in two or three years.  I have actual experience of seeing it and the practice has not altered very much since I was a teacher.  The only people who clean these closets out are these wandering nomads &mdash; Senator Tierney's friends I should say.  He expressed the view that he would like at times to be one of these, but I feel sure he would like to be far away from the place where these unsavoury tasks have to be carried out.  I have seen this occur&mdash;a pit dug in the playground and the contents of these closets emptied into it and slightly covered over in the same ground in which children are supposed to play, and I have seen children sink into and being pulled out of it.  I do not think the conditions are very much different from what they were in those days, according to reports I have got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not particular about the terms of this motion.  If anybody can show me a better way I will be more than delighted to accept it, but no better way has been proposed. The Minister is apparently content to let things go on as they have been going because he feels that they are not so bad after all.  There must be discussion and consideration he says, but in the meantime, the health and the lives of the children are endangered. I do not care whether the State pays the whole cost or whether <Col N="431" /> the local authority has to pay a portion of the cost, but I do say that the present voluntary system has broken down and there is ample evidence of that.  If the suggestion of Senator Hawkins is carried out and if there are local committees appointed to look after these things, good and well.  I suggest the proper people are the public health authorities.  What does it mean?  There should in connection with every school be a caretaker&mdash;someone who will clean the school and look after it and be responsible and paid for doing it. Every other public institution in the country, our technical schools, our court houses as was mentioned by Senator Baxter, and our gaols are all looked after, kept clean and at least sanitary, but our national schools, where 95 per cent. of our people spend a long period of their lives, are left to chance in a great many cases. Towards the close of his speech, the Minister said there was no reason for bringing the matter forward and it would do no good.  I do not agree with him.  I think there is every reason for bringing it forward. Senator Mrs. Concannon suggested that it was the wrong method of approach, that there should be a conference. Who is to call the conference? Why has it not been called?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <P>The Minister devoted the greater part of his speech to the building question.  As I pointed out yesterday I am very much more concerned with the maintenance and the sanitary condition of the schools. Even a bad building, even a building that requires to be replaced might be put into some kind of sanitary condition if steps were taken to do it.  I am much more interested in that aspect of the problem, but the Minister dwelt very little on that in comparison to the building question.  However, the Minister has now stated that he is in consultation with the ecclesiastical authorities, and he has hopes that something good is going to come out of it.  I hope so too, but I do not think the fact that this discussion has taken place is going to hinder or delay that. I think rather the contrary, and I do not regret bringing forward this motion.  I have no reason to regret it. It has been a valuable discussion, and it is right and proper that people who occupy responsible positions, such as members of the Oireachtas, should have the duty to discuss these things if they think conditions are such as they are.</P>
      <P>Senator Counihan said that there was no public demand for this, but Senator Rowlette dealt with that point. There are a lot of things the Government do that there is no public demand for.  There are a lot of things that they do in respect of which the public if asked would say: &ldquo;Do not do it at all.&rdquo;  I am sure Senator Counihan did not make a demand for compulsory tillage, and yet compulsory tillage is a good and proper thing.  If the Government were waiting for a demand from Senator Counihan and his friends for compulsory tillage, I expect they would be still waiting.  We have certain responsibilities as representing the people, and it is our duty to bring these things to the notice of the Government if we think that is necessary.</P>

    <P>With regard to the actual terms of the motion, I am not tied in any way to them, and if there is an assurance from the Minister now that things are going to be improved very soon, I am not going to press this particular form of reform.  But &ldquo;I hae ma doots&rdquo; that anything remarkable is going to happen. <Col N="433" /> Senator Baxter referred to schools that require heating, and another Senator referred to the magnificent buildings recently erected in the city.  I do not know whether the Minister knows what is going on in some of these schools at present.  I am credibly informed that in some of these new big schools in the city fine provision was made for central heating and that sort of thing.  One of the latest schools built was at Larkhill. That is a magnificent building, but another Department of Government has refused to supply the material for heating it.  The Minister will contradict me if I am wrong in saying this: that while there is provision for central heating in these schools the children are shivering because the Department of Supplies has refused to supply anthracite.</P>

I do not want to divide the House on this motion, because a vote one way or another will not make any difference in this House.  I hope that the discussion has served a useful purpose. I believe it has, and while many views were expressed one way or the other, I think it has brought home to many of the Senators that there is a problem to be dealt with.  I hope that it has been brought home equally to the Minister that there is great urgency in regard to this question, especially in regard to the sanitation of schools.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Government be requested to appoint a commission to inquire into and make recommendations as to what steps are desirable to increase the usefulness of the Civil Service to the community as a whole; <Col N="434" /> that, in the opinion of the Seanad, the terms of reference to the commission should include inquiry into the methods of recruitment and promotion in the Civil Service, and the relations of that Service with outside organisations, especially those which deal with production or distribution.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service is the administrative machinery of Government.  Without an efficient, well-managed and loyal Civil Service no Government however good can carry out its policy nor indeed can it obtain the reliable information which is essential for the formulation of an effective legislative or administrative programme.  If the Civil Service is inefficient or if it is hampered in its work by unsuitable or antiquated methods, no Government can be a good Government no matter how beneficent its intentions. In a democratic country the people govern themselves through a Parliament elected by them and an Executive Government responsible to it.  In order to secure this measure of democratic control general elections are held periodically, and in normal times not more than five years can elapse without an election.  (It is not intended to refer to the present subject of an election.)</P>
    <P>If in a democracy such care is taken to see that the Government is subject to the wishes of the people and if, as I have said, the Government depends on the Civil Service, it should not be difficult to prove that similar care should be taken to see that the machinery of administration through which a Government functions should be subject to periodic revision in order to keep it responsive to changes and growths in the duties and functions which it has to perform.  If it is important that this country should have the best possible Government and that each Ministry should be filled by the most suitable men available for the position, it is equally important that, not only the Civil Service as a whole, but each separate Department should be equal to its task and kept at the highest level of efficiency.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a <i>prima facie</i> case for an examination into and revision of the Civil Service and its <Col N="435" /> methods at least every eight or ten years.</P>
    <P>The last Civil Service Commission was appointed in 1932.  It presented an interim report to the Minister for Finance in February, 1934, and its final report is dated November, 1935.  The work now required from civil servants in many Departments is very different from that required in 1934, and an inquiry held now would have many additional and different problems to consider.</P>
    <P>Briefly stated, the reasons why I believe that a public inquiry should be held at an early date are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  During the last decade there has been a very substantial increase in legislation by Government Order.  This increase has been much accelerated by the emergency, but the annual growth in the number of Executive Orders was marked even before the outbreak of war.  This means that a large proportion of the laws of this country are not discussed in Parliament until after they have come into operation and many of them are never discussed at all.  Errors, therefore, cannot be rectified until some harm is done.  This has added greatly to the responsibility of civil servants, whose general training has been to avoid individual responsibility.</P>
    <P>(2)  The emergency has led to a substantial increase in State interference both in production and distribution and the responsibility for many essential services and supplies which formerly rested largely on private enterprise now rests on the Government. Whether or not this was inevitable or desirable I do not now propose to discuss. That it is a fact will not be disputed.  As a result civil servants have not infrequently to undertake tasks of a highly important and often technical nature for which their normal training has not fitted them and which were never thought of when the normal Civil Service machinery was designed.</P>
    <P>(3)  No one can foreshadow post-war developments with any degree of certainty but it is reasonably safe to say that everything seems to point to a <Col N="436" /> continuance of State interference in industry both on its productive and distributive sides for a very considerable time to come.  All the indications would seem to point to a period after the war during which all the essential commodities in the world may be under international control and trade and commerce be dependent to a great extent on inter-State negotiation and international co-operation.  Under such conditions duties might conceivably be placed on our Civil Service which under present conditions and with its present personnel it would not be able to perform with the necessary knowledge and efficiency.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the welfare of this country for a generation or two may well depend on its capacity to mobilise, in the period after the war, the best brains and the most experienced persons which it possesses.  It is not slighting the Civil Service to say that all the brain power and experience which we possess is not within its borders.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I believe the reorganisation of some parts of our Civil Service, and particularly its relations with outside organisations, to be an urgent problem which cannot be shelved without serious consequences.</P>
    <P>Before endeavouring to give my reasons in greater detail I would like to clear away all possibility of misunderstanding in one important respect.</P>
    <P>I am not making an attack on civil servants as such.  I have no sympathy with the irresponsible and casual attacks on the Civil Service which are whispered from time to time. State interference in trade, even if no errors are made, is bound to cause trouble and aggravation to individuals with consequent resentment, with the result that some people are inclined to blame the Civil Service for what after all is only the carrying out of Government policy.</P>
    <P>I believe that the standards of loyalty, integrity and academic efficiency of our civil servants are as high as in any country in the world.  Within the limited functions which the Service was devised to perform I believe the <Col N="437" /> standard is very high.  Like every other organisation of human beings, it has its misfits&mdash;I could without difficulty name a few individuals who seem to me to be in jobs which are too big for them&mdash;but my experience of our Civil Service during the last 20 years has impressed me not with the number of unsuitable or incompetent persons which it contains, but rather with the very large number of able, efficient, and conscientious persons to be found in it.</P>
    <P>People who sneer at the Civil Service &ldquo;mind&rdquo; neither understand the calibre of the men who enter the service nor the excellent qualities which they so often display in it.  It is not uncommon to hear the Civil Service spoken of in a contemptuous way, and I feel that there is a danger that a general hostility to it on the part of the public may grow up which could have nothing but ill results.</P>
    <P>The inquiry which I would like to see made would therefore not be into the faults of civil servants, but rather into the use we make of them&mdash;the responsibilities we have placed upon them and the machinery under which we expect them to work.  Such an inquiry should help to restore confidence, not to lessen it.</P>
    <P>The reports of the commission appointed in 1932, presided over by Mr. Joseph Brennan, are interesting and instructive documents which have not received the attention which they deserve.  This commission did not, however, deal with most of the problems which I now consider urgent, though of course the report of the commission may have indirect bearing on them.  It could not have done so for two reasons &mdash;firstly&mdash;because many of the problems either did not exist at the time or had not become acute or of general public interest; and, secondly, because these problems could not have been dealt with without evidence from trade and industry and from the general public which was not offered to the commission. The report draws special attention to the fact that the commission endeavoured to obtain evidence from the general public but such evidence was not offered.  The reason for this is, probably, that the general public had <Col N="438" /> not at the time even dreamed of the extent to which State interference would develop in a short time and the extent to which the work of the Civil Service would directly affect the ordinary life of the people of the country and also its trade and industry.</P>
    <P>The Brennan Report, therefore, deals mainly with what for the want of a better phrase I will call internal problems of the Civil Service and is based on evidence supplied from within the service itself.  I do not think that a new commission is required to deal with these subjects, though, no doubt, if a commission is set up it may have to spend some of its time on internal problems which may have arisen in recent years.  Its main problem would be to consider what changes are possible and desirable in the Civil Service to make it a more effective instrument to deal with modern State requirements in this country.</P>
    <P>This involves consideration as to whether our Civil Service, which, in the words of the Brennan Report, is &ldquo;in a highly organised condition which has been developed gradually from one stage to another over a long period of time in the light of lessons derived from practical experience&rdquo;, can suddenly and quickly adapt itself from within to meet entirely new circumstances where the whole economic life is likely to be subject to State control instead of dependent on private enterprise.  Except for such changes as have taken place during the past 20 years, and these have not been very extensive as far as I know, the gradual development referred to by the Brennan Commission took place in a service designed for a highly industrial country of 48,000,000 with an empire of over 500,000,000.  A State of 3,000,000 largely agricultural may well find that the &ldquo;light of lessons derived from practical experience&rdquo; is not the light most suitable to guide it during the critical years after the war.  If this country is to hold its own in the post-war world it will have to depend on its ability to co-operate with and gain the friendship of other nations without sacrificing its own national characteristics and ideals.  This will require enterprise, initiative, constructive ability <Col N="439" /> and capacity to act promptly when necessary.</P>
    <P>My general criticism of our Civil Service in action is its delay, its lack of initiative and enterprise and its inefficiency as an organisation, which I regard as distinct from the individual efficiency of its members.</P>
    <P>These faults are, I believe, inherent in the system and will never be remedied by reform from within.</P>
    <P>Individual enterprise and initiative in the business world usually lead to promotion.  Not so in the Civil Service where the man who plays for safety and keeps strictly to the rules is far more likely to be promoted than the man who is willing to take risks in dealing with an urgent problem. Under the selection board system promotion is granted on general efficiency in carrying out service rules and length of service, and not in direct relation to any specialist qualification which may be required for the particular vacancy.  Promotion by &ldquo;merit&rdquo; means &ldquo;merit&rdquo; according to Civil Service standards.</P>
    <P>Business men often complain that as soon as an official has become fully conversant with the problem with which he has to deal, they find that he has been removed to another section of the Department, and that a new official has taken his place.  Presumably this is one of the results of the present promotion system.  This is a definite discouragement of specialisation and, therefore, leads to inefficiency.  If the State is to control production or distribution in any industry it should be possible for an officer to gain experience in dealing with any one problem and in time become as efficient and experienced as any man engaged in private enterprise.  To ensure this it should be possible for a specialist to rise to high rank in the service without ceasing to specialise, instead of as at present, when success in one direction will often lead to a change to another sphere in which the official has no specialised knowledge.  It is possible, of course, that sometimes this tendency for change may be due to a jealous disposition on the part of a <Col N="440" /> superior officer who does not like to see a junior officer getting too much specialist knowledge and experience which he himself does not possess.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for an outsider to judge fairly what occurs inside the service as high civil servants are properly very reluctant to talk even about their grievances.  My own experience in interviewing officers on many varying matters leads me to believe that a grave defect in the Civil Service is the frequent failure of the higher grades to give clear directions from above and then leave it to the lower grades to carry these out with despatch and promptitude.  All kinds of matters even of minor importance have to be submitted for authority or approval with delays which make for inefficiency and which invariably aggravate the public.  This may, of course, not be always due to the system but to a misplaced sense of dignity or prestige on the part of the higher official.  The most successful business managers are those who can develop responsibility and initiative in those under them by a judicious delegation of authority while at the same time retaining essential control.  While I do not suggest that business methods would in every case be suitable for adoption in the Civil Service I am of the opinion that the qualities required in a successful manager are very much akin to those required by men in the administrative grades in the Civil Service.  If a junior official finds from experience that everything he puts up to a particular senior will be invariably altered or rejected, he soon loses all originality and plays for safety every time.  The fact that promotion in the higher grades is largely based on reports of superior officers in rank creates a tendency to imitate the style of working and a moulding of ideas and mentality to those of the superior officer.  This can only lead to mediocrity of outlook and is a definite barrier to reform and progress.</P>
    <P>One important cause of delay and lack of individual responsibility and enterprise in the Civil Service is the system of &ldquo;files.&rdquo;  When a memorandum or letter reaches a Department it goes first to the central registry. <Col N="441" /> The clerk who opens it decides to what division of the Department it should be sent and he is supposed also to go to the files to see if there are any relevant papers which he should attach to it.  The document then commences its journey through the Department. Its journey will give in most cases plenty of visible evidence of detailed work by officials but it does not lead to prompt decisions.</P>
    <P>Generally the official will avoid giving an answer if it can be passed on to some other section.  He usually adds his memorandum and passes on the file.  Unless an official can find an absolutely foolproof and cast-iron precedent he will play for safety and pass it on to a senior who often has less actual knowledge of the matter than the junior.  Instead of investigation by 'phone or oral inquiries to enable prompt action, the file is transferred from one official to another with observations, opinions or comments.  This system may have merits when permanent legislation is under consideration and when delays are meritorious rather than dangerous.  This is not so where matters affecting trade or commerce are concerned, and the system of &ldquo;files&rdquo; may well be one of the causes for the dissatisfaction which exists at the present time.  I do not, of course, suggest that an efficient filing system is not of first-class importance, but I do believe that the present system of &ldquo;files&rdquo; should be carefully examined in the interests of efficiency and prompt action.</P>
    <P>I do not think that all our senior civil servants appreciate how serious delay may often be under present conditions. Everyone engaged in business knows that with the present shortage of supplies promptitude in decision is essential.  Failure to act promptly means loss of supplies in nine cases out of ten.</P>
    <P>If in the post-war period&mdash;to use the words of the Taoiseach&mdash;&ldquo;State control and State intervention will tend to remain and to entrench itself in many spheres where formerly private enterprise alone held the field,&rdquo; it will be essential that some method be found to avoid the delays which seem inevitable under our present Civil Service <Col N="442" /> system.  The quotation from the Taoiseach ends at the word &ldquo;field&rdquo;, although I read it as if he made the last remark, which was, of course, my own.  This might well be one of the most important matters to be considered by a commission.</P>
    <P>In order to make clear the harm that can be done by delay I will give one illustration.  A quantity of raw material of which there is a serious shortage in this country became available in New York and a list of the stock was obtained by the Irish Consul there, dated 31st July.  It was conveyed to this country through the Departmental machinery and did not reach the groups of Irish manufacturers who required the material until October 13th.  I have no idea how many files it went through in its journey or how many memorandums were written on it.</P>
    <P>Once it reached the Irish manufacturers concerned there was no delay. Consultation took place by telephone between the principal firms concerned and a cable was sent within six hours. As was to be expected the largest and most valuable part of the stock had been disposed of before the cable from the Irish manufacturers was received.</P>
    <P>Another kindred matter that requires investigation is the Civil Service habit of requiring &ldquo;forms&rdquo; to be filled in for every conceivable purpose.  If statistics were available showing the time spent and the paper used in the filling of forms during the last ten years which could have been dispensed with or which served no really useful purpose, I think everyone in this country would be astonished.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that State control and State planning are impossible without information.  To obtain that information some forms are essential.  The complaint against the Civil Service is not that it makes use of forms but that many of its forms are unnecessary and a large proportion of them incomprehensible. Even those who fill them in do not always understand them with the result that the information conveyed is neither reliable nor accurate.  Forms <Col N="443" /> are waste of time unless they convey accurate information to those who are to use them.  This means that the phraseology used by the person who prepared the form must be understood by the person who is to complete it.</P>
    <P>The preparation of a form is a highly technical matter and the man who prepares a form should have expert knowledge of the subject.  He must know the mentality and phraseology of those who are to complete the forms.  If, for instance, the forms are intended to enable a Department to control production or distribution in any industry the forms should be prepared by a person fully conversant not only with the problem but also with the usual practice in that industry. Simplicity of language and directness are essential in any well designed form.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be uncomplimentary in any way to the Civil Service, but I do not think that amongst their many virtues, either simplicity of language or directness, are those for which they are most noted&mdash;certainly not in their letters or documents.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to think that the reason why so many of the forms sent out by the Civil Service are either obscure or meaningless to the general public is that neither in their upbringing, their training nor in their daily work are civil servants brought into direct contact with the people for whom the forms are intended.  Civil servants, to some extent, live and work in a world of their own apart from normal life.  Their outlook is inclined to be city and suburban and too often their attitude is one of being on guard against the public rather than of co-operation with the public.  Even if forms are well designed and accurately filled in, they have their limitations in practice.  It is rarely possible to get an adequate view of a problem simply by studying statistics.  This is particularly true where the individual studying the forms has no practical experience.  It will never be possible for even the most efficient civil servant to plan the satisfactory control of production or of distribution in any industry simply by an examination of <Col N="444" /> forms submitted to him.  Some method should be found for close and continuous co-operation with persons with practical experience if State control is to meet with any real success.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another important matter which I feel requires careful consideration by a commission.  The resolution refers to the relations of the Civil Service with outside organisations. Trade and industry, both on their productive and distributive sides, are being organised to an increasing extent and most classes of manufacturers are now working together in associations of their own, or in groups within the Federation of Irish Manufacturers.  If State control and interference with industry is to increase, it is of the utmost importance that some satisfactory method should be found by which close and effective co-operation can take place between representatives of industry and the Civil Service.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told the Federation of Irish Manufacturers that it was important to have an industrial organisation capable of providing sound technical advice to the Government.  I fully agree, but I suggest that it is equally important to find really satisfactory methods of conveying that advice, and to include in the Civil Service a number of persons with the expert knowledge necessary to make the best use in the national interest of that advice.</P>
    <P>One of the most urgent problems for consideration by a commission would be the place of the technically efficient person in the Civil Service.  There is a very widespread feeling that during the emergency caused by the war, we have failed to find methods by which the State could make really effective use of the most experienced men in industry in the vital matter of securing essential supplies.  Instead of close co-operation between trade and industry and the Department of Supplies there has been too often a kind of vague hostility.  Instead of businessmen generally feeling that the Department was there to help them in vital problems of supply, and the Department feeling that the leaders of the business community were ready (as I know many of them were) to sacrifice personal interests during the emergency <Col N="445" /> for the common good, there has been a feeling of mistrust.  This is not the time to discuss the reasons for this in the past, but in my opinion there is blame on both sides.  The duty of a commission would be, not to hold a <i>post mortem</i>, but to suggest a remedy.</P>
    <P>The system of advisory committees to answer questions put to them by the Department and to consult on matters placed before them whenever summoned by the Department has proved a failure, and in any case the underlying principle is, in my opinion, all wrong.  These committees were usually called only after the Minister had decided to act instead of being brought together to face a problem and advise the Minister in the national interest after all the available information had been examined and considered, and with a full sense of responsibility as experienced citizens of the State.</P>
    <P>As a result these consultative committees sometimes went to the Department with the object of protecting themselves against inexpert and ill-considered interference, and the views they expressed were too often those of individuals thinking alone with a greater or less degree of self-interest and wishful thinking.  The fact that on the one hand the committees rarely had confidence in the ability of the Department to act wisely and the fact, on the other hand, that the officials felt that they were faced with selfish and conflicting interests, sometimes led to extreme caution and delay, with the result that action was not taken as soon as it should have been.  It also resulted in some cases in the Minister interfering in matters where better results could have been obtained by leaving it to the trades concerned to carry out negotiations subject only to very general supervision by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If, instead of these consultative committees, definite boards or councils had been set up whose members were charged with the responsibility and with the duty of proposing a plan to the Minister under their own names with, of course, the secretarial and administrative assistance of the Civil Service, I believe the results would have been much better.  Such boards <Col N="446" /> might have had general supervision of the carrying out of plans proposed by them if such plans had the approval of the Minister.  When businessmen are called in for consultation, and when they feel that whatever they may say is open to suspicion and that their advice or representations will be conveyed to the Minister by a civil servant who knows much less about the problem than they do, it does not make for good results and their sense of personal responsibility is lessened.</P>
    <P>Where trade bargaining and arrangements with other countries are concerned the system of consultation by officials who are to carry out the negotiations has also been a failure. One of the greatest factors in obtaining supplies, i.e., the desire of traders outside this country to maintain their close and friendly trade relations with traders in this country, is lost if the negotiations are carried on by civil servants alone.</P>
    <P>Recently a number of businessmen were invited by the Minister for Supplies to accompany civil servants to a conference in England at which supply problems in which they were vitally concerned would be discussed.  When they reached England the businessmen found that they were only regarded as advisers and would not be allowed to be present at the more important meetings. The result was that nobody was satisfied and arrangements were made that since then have had to be revised. This to my mind is a good instance of how not to co-operate and a very unsatisfactory way of using expert knowledge and experience.</P>
    <P>The problem of the technical advice which must be obtained by the Civil Service from time to time, whether from experts inside the Service or outside it, is a very difficult one.  The present system is most unsatisfactory. The training of the Civil Service produces a tendency to minimise the value of technical experience and there is sometimes an inclination to treat expert opinion somewhat lightly.</P>
    <P>The successful businessman knows the importance of technical advice, but he also knows its limitations and how to use it in the most practical way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> Normally, if a Minister needs technical advice, he goes to the administrative class, in which the expert has no place.  The request for advice will be passed down until someone, probably a junior or assistant principal, goes to an expert, whether inside or outside the service, for an opinion.  The expert will probably submit a memorandum, which may be re-written or commented upon by everyone concerned except the expert, before it reaches the Minister, who may make a decision without personally seeing the expert at any time. At each revision the expert's memorandum becomes less and less expert, because the officials who revise it are further and further removed from the actual realities of the problem.  Surely it must be admitted that this system is inherently a bad one.</P>
    <P>One difficulty in the present system of advisory committees which are consulted by civil servants is that, in many matters, it is only a technical or experienced mind that can really appreciate advice or representations from industrial representatives.  If such advice can only reach the Minister through officers of the executive or administrative grades, it is almost certain that a number of errors will be made from time to time.</P>
    <P>An inquiry into the Civil Service should, I feel, include an examination into the system of Parliamentary Questions and their effect on the efficiency of the Civil Service.  Personally, I am convinced that, from the public point of view, the system of Parliamentary Questions has considerable value, and I would be very sorry indeed to see it completely abandoned. I am not sure, however, that it has not a rather unsatisfactory effect on Civil Service routine, which might be remedied, after careful consideration of the whole problem.</P>
    <P>The fact that a Question may be asked about even the smallest detail reacts on the Civil Service in two ways. Firstly, the Minister, or the Secretary of the Department, will see that little, if anything, is done without his knowledge or sanction, and this results in an elaborate system of minutes, reports, submissions and Departmental conferences, <Col N="448" /> which mean delay and a considerable amount of unnecessary work and effort on the part of officials. The effect on the officials is to cause them to be ultra-cautious in everything they do, knowing that any slip, however unimportant, if disclosed to the public, may be the cause of admonition and possibly loss of promotion.  The result is that a decision which should take a matter of hours is often delayed for days or weeks, and every aspect is committed to paper and examined while all the possible reactions are considered carefully.  Everything has to be set out, condensed, annotated and explained, so as to be easily assimilated by the Minister, who may have to reply to Supplementary Questions in the House.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that, even in the best managed concern errors will be made. Businessmen know that, when an error has been made, the wisest thing is to admit the error frankly and apologise, while taking every possible step to rectify it.  This, in business, generally leads to making a permanent customer or client.  Departments of the Civil Service rarely admit an error, and I have often wondered whether it is not regarded as a principle of some Departments that a fault should not be admitted in public.  There is, therefore, a danger that the fact that Parliamentary publicity may be given to what was, after all, a minor error of judgment has the effect of producing ultra-caution and lack of initiative on the part of officials, which is not really in the public interests.</P>
    <P>It would tax the patience of the House if I were to refer to all the various matters which might properly be considered by a commission.  I have endeavoured to indicate in a general way what I consider urgent problems, the consideration of which is necessitated by the increase in State interference in trade and industry.  It is obvious that these problems do not arise equally in all parts of the service and some of the criticisms I have made may apply to some Departments and not to others.  It is also certain that some Departments are likely to play a more important part in future development <Col N="449" /> than others.  I have dealt mainly with trade and industry, because I know most about it, but I do not suggest for one moment that the scope of a commission should be confined to this aspect of the problem.  I have not dealt with the problem of the steady increase in the size and cost of the Civil Service, which is a matter that must be faced some of these days.  Personally, I do not see any way of preventing a further increase, except by introducing new methods and closer co-operation with outside organisations, where the State is assuming a right of interference and control.</P>
    <P>Also, I have avoided dealing with the question of the increased power now being vested in civil servants.  That is the fault of the Oireachtas and not of the Civil Service.  The increase in bureaucracy in professedly democratic States is causing serious concern in many countries and might well be a desirable subject for a separate debate in the House.  I am not discussing the power Parliament chooses to give to civil servants, but rather the question of their fitness for it and how they should use it.</P>
    <P>As I have already pointed out, our Civil Service is largely based on that in Great Britain.  It is significant that since 1922, there have been several inquiries into the subject in that country, but I do not think that much change took place until after the outbreak of war in 1939.  It was only after the outbreak of war that the British Treasury showed any signs of recognising that the organisation of the administrative machinery of government was a subject requiring expert and specialised study.  It was not until 1941 that the British Treasury developed its investigation section into an Organisation and Methods Division, which was available to help Departments of State in improving their organisation.  It is interesting and significant to note that, this year, the British Government created an advisory panel of three experienced business men, acting on a part-time basis, in order to supervise the work of the Organisation and Methods Division.</P>
    <P>The House of Commons Select Committee on National Expenditure, which <Col N="450" /> has been examining the administrative machinery of Government, has presented a report dealing with the organisation and control of the Civil Service.  I have not seen the report but only a résumé as published in the London <i>Times</i>, from which I gather that the Committee said that recommendations for improving the efficiency of the Civil Service in Great Britain have frequently been shelved during the past 25 years and that continuous and authoritative stimulus is required if effect in the spirit as well as in the letter is to be given to needed changes. It makes the very interesting and important recommendation that the House of Commons should set up a Select Committee, to be appointed each session, to conduct, on behalf of the House of Commons, a continuing review of the machinery of Government. It seems to me that much could be said for the appointment of a similar Committee of the Dáil or of both Houses.  Anything which would add to the general confidence in the Civil Service and in its relations to the Oireachtas would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I doubt if Reports of British Committees will be of much value to us here.  Our problems may have a certain similarity to those to be faced in other countries, but we must face them ourselves and solve them according to our own needs. If there is dissatisfaction, it is we who must deal with it.  If there is inefficiency, it is we who will pay for it.</P>
    <P>Before I close I would like to say a word with reference to the type of commission I would like to see appointed.  It should be small, not more than ten, and its chairman should be a man of independent position and experience who is not a civil servant.  It should include one or two men, if possible, with actual experience in the management of large businesses involving the employment of large staffs.  It should not have more than two civil servants, and should rely on evidence from the Civil Service for its information on existing methods and organisation rather than from its own members.</P>
    <P>Fortunately the Civil Service is not, <Col N="451" /> and I hope never will be, a Party question in this country.  This motion should not, therefore, be discussed on Party lines.  I think I have shown the House that there is a problem, and that it is an urgent one.  Normally I am not an enthusiast for the appointment of commissions, but in the case of a non-Party national question such as this I do not know of any better method of approaching it than by a small commission with adequate powers and with instructions to report as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I listened with deep interest to the statement of Senator Douglas on this matter of the Civil Service, but, with all respect, I do not think that he made a case for the setting up of a commission to inquire into the Civil Service in general at present.  He probably may have satisfied himself and, maybe, satisfied some others that some sort of inquiry into the Departments that have to have frequent and intimate dealings with business, trade and commerce in these times, might with advantage be set up but even so I doubt whether it would be wise to set up a commission or any other type of inquiry at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas admitted himself that a great part of his statement concerned the relations between the Civil Service and certain Departments of State, and, he pointed out, the reason was that his own particular business in life brought him more into touch with these Departments than with others, and, therefore, he was more familiar with these Departments, but however it be, I do not think the Senator, with all respect to him, made a case for the setting up of a commission with terms of reference to inquire into the type of organisation, activities, work, promotion and efficiency within the Service or the operations of the Civil Service body as a whole.  I did not take it that the Senator was making any attack on the Civil Service and I know he had not that intention, though in <Col N="452" /> developing his case, he did endeavour to point out where there were in his view grave weaknesses in so far as Government operations were carried on by the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>But, as I say here, and as he admitted, these relate primarily to the business of the State Departments that are now obliged to interfere so much in industrial and commercial affairs.  I agree with the Senator that it is probably true that as we see things and as they are likely to develop in the post-war period, whenever that may be, it is possible, for a time at any rate, State interference in business and industry and in the ordinary affairs of the individual, even outside business, industry and commerce, is likely to increase.  I do not look upon that as a good thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, and likely to continue so.  I do not like it. I am old enough to have been brought up in a system where a person was largely free to direct his energies and his abilities in his own way without very much interference and, generally speaking, to be free to say what he liked and to act within the limits of law and common sense and go and act as he pleased.  That is probably not likely to be true in the future, and those of us who have grown up under the old régime would probably feel it more than the people growing up today under the strict rules that prevail to <Col N="453" /> a certain extent&mdash;not here to such an extent as in other countries, but, still, we are growing and developing here too.  That is getting off into another topic.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service I have known, a little from the inside but more from the outside, for the greater part of my life.  I have known civil servants and have had some business with Civil Service organisations in the old British days, from the time I was 19 or 20 years of age, and that is a good while ago now.  The Civil Service of these early days and of to-day I have always found&mdash;and I agree thoroughly with Senator Douglas in this&mdash;an efficient, courteous, industrious, loyal and conscientious body.  That is my experience of them.  I quite agree with the Senator again that there was an odd person here and there that ordinary citizens like myself happened to know, who was not up to general standard, but the Civil Service, like every other organisation in the country, is human and has its failures, a very small proportion, so far as I know the Service. I think the Senator agrees with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I said so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>But, I think the Senator was largely inclined to blame the Civil Service for the sins of the Government.  The last Government developed an industrial and economic policy, and in recent years the present Government has developed it to a much greater extent in certain directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Are those its sins?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of that line of policy meant interference to a considerable extent with commerce, trade and industry.  A system of tariffs means that; a system of highly-developed tariffs means that very often&mdash;in fact, always.  If there was not the closest co-operation between certain trades and industries that the Senator would wish, I think the Minister and, therefore, the Government was to blame, not the civil servants.  Wherever there was that co-operation and contact between these bodies, generally speaking as far as I have heard from industrialists and business people, they found the civil <Col N="454" /> servants an efficient, industrious and helpful body.</P>
      <P>I do not think you will ever get rid of a number of the complaints that Senator Douglas charged against the Civil Service system.  The Civil Service is slow.  I do not think anyone can deny that as a general rule it is slow in operation.  It tries to be safe, maybe too safe, and that means delay. I do not think that in any Civil Service body answerable to a Minister or to the Government, to the Committee of Public Accounts, or to the Parliament and the Oireachtas, you will ever succeed in getting the same rapidity of decision or anything approaching the rapidity of decision&mdash;even from the most responsible civil servants&mdash;that one expects to get and will get in business. The businessman, if he is running a business on his own, has no one to answer to but himself.  If he is a manager of a business he has his boss or his board of directors, and his conduct of business will be judged usually on the profits he makes or shows to the owners or the directors of that business.  There the matter begins and ends, but the civil servants have a whole series of bosses, with the Parliament as a supreme hierarchy, but passing in the meantime through such bodies as the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one of the last points that Senator Douglas touched upon I think he put his finger on the spot: that the cause of much of the slowness and much of the delay and of the sources of complaint that were contained in his own speech is the Parliamentary Question.  Only to-day I was listening in the Dáil to an answer being given to a Parliamentary Question relating to an old age pension that had been granted to somebody&mdash; I think it was in County Cork&mdash;ten years ago.  Now that is common.  You also have the military service pensions, but I need not go through the variety of small matters about which Parliamentary Questions are asked every day the Dáil sits practically&mdash;about the division of land, for instance: &ldquo;Why Jack So-and-so, the son of So-and-so, did not get a division of land when land was being divided in 1922.&rdquo;  That happens, and unless the civil servant <Col N="455" /> has every possible iota of information that could likely be called for at a period of ten, 15 or 30 years afterwards, then he is at fault and the first person to complain will be the member of the Dáil who does not get the fullest information. Then again, civil servants in all these matters have to watch how a particular case was dealt with.  It may be an old age pension or something of that kind.  They have to watch decisions that have been made in the past, so that when the case of a man in a parish in West Cork who gets a small pension, or whose pension is reduced because of his means, is compared with a man in Donegal, the same principle will underlie the decision. Therefore, there must be all the time close co-operation and consultation, not alone between sections of one Department, but between one Department and another so as to secure that an even tenor of decision is kept and that no claim could be made that one individual in one part of Ireland was treated more generously than an individual somewhere else.  That would not happen in business.  Once a man in business makes his deal, buys his horse or a pair of shoes or his hat; once the woman in business buys the article she requires, or a man makes a contract for a ton of flour or a ton of cement, when the money is paid over, that is the end of it.  No one would want to go over the record of these transactions unless the bill had not been paid and someone wants to keep an eye on it. You cannot compare that to the Civil Service.</P>

I do not think you will get that satisfactory type of organisation that the minds of Senators and <Col N="456" /> Deputies conceive; you will not get the prompt dealing by any Government organisation that one expects and gets generally where the well-run business is concerned.  I am quite with the Senator in regard to the main theme of his speech about the necessity for the Departments of State having to deal with businessmen a good deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably more in the future, but most of the complaints made by the Senator were complaints he had come up against during the period of the emergency.  Probably he has had similar complaints in the past but they were not brought so definitely home to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Minister?  I was not making complaints; I think that is important.  I was indicating from the present what I thought might happen in the future in different circumstances if some way was not adopted of dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to misrepresent the Senator at all, but I took it that &ldquo;complaint&rdquo; was not a bad word to describe what the Senator suggested&mdash;as something which, if it had not happened, might happen if there was grievous delay in certain Departments in giving out information that they got; delay and loss to business firms.  That probably has happened. I think the Senator indicated that something of the kind had happened, and if the organisation of civil servants that will have to deal with business firms is not improved in some direction, it probably may occur more frequently in the future.  Perhaps it would be wise that certain Departments might have to modify their type of organisation in order that they may be enabled to get into business in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see it, the less contact it is necessary for business to have with the Civil Service, the better for business. Businessmen ought to be free to do their business in their own way and not be tied as they are, unfortunately, tied in present circumstances.  Under <Col N="457" /> existing conditions, it is probable that they will continue to be tied.  I do not think that any sort of organisation will get over that difficulty to-day.  Generally speaking, I do not think that our civil servants could be better, taking them as a body.  Some of those who have had considerable responsibility placed upon them, arising out of the emergency, especially those dealing with commercial and industrial firms, have proved remarkably successful so far as my observation and capacity to judge count.  They showed themselves very able men.  If some of them had taken another line and gone into business, with the opportunities open to businessmen here, they would have been remarkably successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>They would be working under a different system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Which would give them scope and freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot get that in the Civil Service so long as you have Parliamentary control.  The level of efficiency in the Civil Service, even in the matters dealt with by the Senator&mdash;I refer to the Departments which are dealing with industrial and commercial firms&mdash;is very high.  I doubt if it is higher anywhere.  I do not want to say that everything in the garden is so lovely that it would not be better to have some sort of an inquiry. Mistakes are bound to be made.  I am sure that plenty of mistakes were made in the new circumstances arising out of the emergency, but I do not think we could better the type of men and women we have in the Civil Service&mdash; high up and low down.  Except for the reactions of the emergency upon us&mdash; and they have been severe&mdash;I do not think that there is any difference in the present type of civil servant from the type we had 20 or ten years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anything, there is an improvement in the calibre of the people we are getting.  In their system of recruiting, the Civil Service Commission has been successful in giving us&mdash;particularly in the higher grades&mdash;a great deal of excellent material.  I could not <Col N="458" /> speak too highly of the younger men and women who have come into the higher grades from our universities. The examination which the Public Accounts Committee puts the senior officials of our Departments through every year provides a test of the efficiency of our civil servants to manage their Departments and control expenditure.  We have had that Committee of Accounts operating now for 20 years.  Some of the ablest men in the Dáil have served upon it.  I think that every individual who has sat on that committee would say that we have an excellent, efficient, industrious, loyal and faithful Civil Service.  Those civil servants do their work conscientiously and are able to stand up and defend their administration of the large sums&mdash;in some cases, very large sums&mdash;of money for which they are responsible.  Through that body one gets a close, detailed scrutiny of the working of every Department.  I think that Senator Hayes was a member of that committee.  At all events, there were always on it men who were highly interested in Departmental administration, and who insisted on examining not only the accounting officers but, in some cases, other officials, regarding the detailed expenditure of their Departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that that committee's functions are extremely limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that does not prevent them from inquiring into the financial administration of our public Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not inquire into the efficiency of the Civil Service as a machine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot probe into the expenditure of public money&mdash; the authority for spending, and how and where it is spent&mdash;without getting first-hand knowledge as to the efficiency of the Civil Service.  While the committee is not there for that purpose, its members will, probably, have the best knowledge of the efficiency of the Civil Service, because of the advantageous position in which they are <Col N="459" /> placed.  My experience teaches me that accounting officers have a wholesome fear of the examination which they have to stand at the hands of the Public Accounts Committee into the financial administration of their Departments. There, one gets to a large extent, if not to the extent which Senator Douglas and Senator Hayes would desire, an examination of civil servants that throws, incidentally, at any rate, a clear light on the working of the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons given for recommending this commission was the number of Orders made under the Emergency Powers Act.  Well, in so far as they are matters of policy these Emergency Orders can be, and many have been, the subject of discussion here and in the Dáil.  A number of them are matters of policy and a number are matters of detailed control. Some of them relate to affairs of commerce and trade.  They can be examined&mdash;and have been examined in the Dáil and in the Seanad&mdash;and in so far as they are responsible for adding to expenditure they can later be examined by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I do not suggest that somebody might not be able to make suggestions that would make the body a more useful or efficient organisation but in every Department you have at the head people whose duty it is to examine their own machine, and who are called upon by the Minister, and sometimes by the Department of Finance, which supervises the Civil Service as a whole, to defend in detail their administration in regard to certain matters.  That happens pretty often.  The Department of Finance hears a complaint about delay here, there or elsewhere in the service.  The Department gets a complaint about want of diligence in some section of a Department and these matters are not lightly passed over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The secretary of the Department concerned would be called in if necessary, if it was a grievous case.  Officers of the Department of Finance would make an examination into the Department if any complaint reached us that there was slackness that deserved <Col N="460" /> looking into.  That has been done and the Department of Finance are always open to do that.  In that way they keep a pretty alert eye on the Service as a whole, and they are always open to suggestions from members of the Civil Service themselves.  Members of the Civil Service do make suggestions frequently as to improvements that they think can be made in the Service or in their own Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

      <P>I have just said to the contrary.  I said, not two minutes ago, absolutely the contrary, that I did not believe that somebody here or elsewhere could not make suggestions that would improve the organisation and improve the efficiency.  I think there is some foundation for what Senator Douglas says in reference to some Departments, at any rate, about lack of enterprise and initiative in the Civil Service as a whole.  It does not give much scope for initiative or enterprise.</P>

      <P>In any section or Department in the Civil Service I cannot see how you can have much scope for initiative or enterprise.  It is like the law.  It is built up, as Senator Douglas says, largely of decisions and files.  Every item that goes into the Civil Service has to have a file on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into the necessity for files, because that arises from the type and nature of the machine and they must exist as long as Parliament and Parliamentary control exist.  Senator Douglas says, bring in specialists in the Civil Service.  There are many specialists in the Civil Service, and if you bring specialists in they will not be long in it before the businessmen will say that they are as rotten as any civil servants and worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what is said by many business people because they cannot get a decision in a hurry, but the specialists would have to be in the system as long as Parliament lasts. The experts would be tied up by the system just as much as those who entered the Civil Service at 20 years of age and spent 25 years in it.  There are specialists in the Civil Service, professional men, and the bitterest complaints about delay I ever listened to, not in this Department but in another, were complaints about delay by specialists, bitter complaints by men in the same profession.  The system of promotion now adopted is generally by selection board, and seniority is one of the things that counts, but it is not the deciding factor, because if it were left to the head of a particular office to make a recommendation it might be that some of the things that Senator Douglas had in mind about a man copying his superior and moulding his outlook would be the deciding factor.  With the selection board that is not so, because the board is taken from a number of Departments as a rule and they try to assess a man's merits from <Col N="462" /> a variety of points.  Seniority is one of the things that counts.</P>

      <P>But would the Senator leave that out?  The man under whom he works has had three or five or perhaps ten years' experience of him, and if he is honest and conscientious you have got to read what he says.  Knowing the man who makes the recommendation you give it the attention you think it deserves, because the civil servants on these boards are the colleagues of these men, and if a particular man is a crank and those under him have to play up to his idiosyncrasies, the civil servants on these boards know that, and they will try to evaluate the man and give proper value to the representations that have been made.  I cannot see a better system for promotion within the Civil Service than the selection board.  If there is any other I would be glad to hear of it. Another thing the Senator talked of, and I agree with a lot of what he said, had reference to forms.  They are a necessary evil I am afraid, particularly income-tax forms, and it is most difficult for the ordinary person, and even sometimes for the Minister for Finance, to understand them. Income-tax forms are the most difficult, I imagine.  Other forms I have come across are very simple.  Those which it would be necessary to fill in for rations would be most simple.</P>

      <P>Well, I have not seen them.  The most difficult I have ever come across are the income-tax forms.  It was not that I was trying to dodge them.  I was trying to fill them up honestly, and that is a very difficult thing to do.  I will say in regard to them, that whenever I went to the officials of the Department dealing with income-tax, I got the best help and advice possible, free, gratis and for nothing, even to the disadvantage of the Minister for Finance at the time.</P>
      <P>One of the last matters mentioned by Senator Douglas was the rise in cost and numbers of the Civil Service. That, certainly, is serious.  There has been a very heavy increase in numbers and a very big increase in costs in the last ten years or so.  The Civil Service has been rising in numbers and in cost and, as far as I can see, that tendency is likely to continue, particularly having regard to the attitude of the Dáil, and perhaps of the Seanad. There is a constant demand for further Government interference in all sorts and varieties of human affairs.  We are asked: &ldquo;Why do the Government not control this and that, why do they not direct this, that and the other?&rdquo; That is the general attitude, not the attitude of one Party or one set of individuals alone.  It is coming from all sides. With that mentality you are bound to have an increase in the numbers and cost of the Civil Service.  I think the tendency will be towards greater interference with the private individual as well as with business, with public and private affairs.  Future development will be in that direction, so far as I can see, and, therefore, the Civil Service will grow and the cost will continue to rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the present time, during the period of an emergency, would be the best time to have an inquiry. I am not against inquiries on the whole, certainly not in principle, particularly inquiries into the Civil Service, but I do not think this is the best time to set up an inquiry.  I do not think there is an urgent need for it, considering that not very long ago we had what was called the Brennan Commission.  That body reported in <Col N="464" /> November or December, 1935, and the report was presented to the Dáil on the 8th of May, 1936.  You had there a most representative body; I doubt if you could get a more representative body.  Looking down the list of members, I find there are five who are either present or past members of the Seanad. The chairman was Mr. Joseph Brennan, now Chairman of the Currency Commission.  Then there was the Reverend J.E. Canavan, S.J.  He did not stay the whole course; he resigned after the interim report on arbitration was published.</P>
    <P>There were also the late Mr. Coade who, when I first knew him 30 years ago, was secretary of Cantrell and Cochrane&mdash;I think he was afterwards managing director; Mr. L.J. Duffy, the present Secretary of the Labour Party; Mr. Condren Flinn, a chartered accountant; Mr. A.M. Fullerton, a former Secretary of the Valuation Office; Rev. Brother Galvin, Lord Glenavy, ex-Senator Thomas Johnson, the present Senator Professor Joseph Johnston, Senator Sir John Keane, Mrs. Mary Kettle, Senator Professor Magennis, Mr. Daniel O'Donohue, who, I think, is now chairman of Boland's; Mr. J.J. O'Leary, of Cahill's; Senator D.L. Robinson, and Miss N. Ryan. That, I think, was a most representative body.  It was appointed to inquire into the organisation of the Civil Service, with special reference to the arrangements for securing efficiency in its working, the general standard of remuneration, the age of retirement and the method by which arbitration could best be applied to the Service. Senator Douglas drew attention to the fact that the commercial community did not bother to go before the Brennan Commission or give any evidence whatsoever, although invited by public advertisement to come and assist.  Perhaps they would do so now. I think Senator Douglas would leap at the opportunity now as a business man, but they were offered an opportunity to come along and examine the organisation and efficiency of the Civil Service then and they did not do so.</P>
    <P>In the second paragraph of the final report, the commission stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We should have welcomed <Col N="465" /> evidence from unofficial persons or bodies, especially those that could speak for any considerable economic interests in the country, but, although we took steps by newspaper advertisement and otherwise to indicate our readiness to hear anyone who might desire to tender evidence, we received no application for this purpose from any quarter outside the Civil Service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That would indicate that there was not much of a grievance on the part of the business community as regards the Civil Service and its efficiency at that time.  Again the commission states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is significant that, as we have mentioned at the outset of this Report, we have been offered no evidence from business circles or from any other section of the general community that they have experienced any practical need for reorganisation of the Civil Service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the condition of affairs when that Report was made at the end of 1935.  With all respect to certain members of the commission who are in this House, I might say that it was as good a commission as could be got to examine such a matter.  You had a variety of interests represented, official and unofficial.  There was no member of the Civil Service actually on the board, although there was a number of ex-civil servants, including the chairman, who had considerable experience in the Civil Service, as also had Lord Glenavy and Mr. A.M. Fullerton, formerly Secretary of the Valuation Office.  They would be sure to give their views freely and frankly on the Civil Service, as they knew it when they were members of that body, and as they found it when they had to deal with it after they left the Civil Service. There were also businessmen, accountants, educationists, clerics and people with experience on public boards, on that commission, and the general tenor of their reports was that they could not do very much.  They made recommendations with regard to terms and conditions of service, entry into the service, salaries and wages, and so on; but on the question of organisation <Col N="466" /> they did not find much wrong with the Civil Service as a body.</P>
    <P>I have another reason for not seeing with a favourable eye the adoption of the motion proposed by Senator Douglas.  Now, on all sides, I, as Minister for Finance, in charge of the Civil Service, am being pressed for staff.  Big as the Civil Service now is, as compared with years ago, we do not seem to have nearly enough staff to deal with present conditions. Indeed, we have to slow down the service in several Departments. There are frequent complaints in the Dáil that we are not dividing land; we had to take a huge slice of the staff of the Land Commission and devote their services to other Departments.  We had to do the same with a big portion of the Staff of the Revenue Commissioners and of other Departments. Every man I can get hold of in these days is needed, and there is more than enough work for him.  Therefore, I do not look with favour at all on the motion that an inquiry should be set up, which would take even three or four of a staff to deal with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in view of the tendency of limitation of export of milch cows by reference to available shipping space to depress prices in the home market and widen the margin of dealers' profits, the Seanad is of opinion that such limitation as may be necessary, owing to transport conditions or desirable in the public interest, should be effected by an appropriate levy on the export of milch cows, springers, and in-calf heifers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am moving this motion entirely on my own personal responsibility.  It is true that I am a member of a body which is inquiring into various matters affecting our agricultural position and that, in due course, that body may have views to express on the general question <Col N="467" /> of maintaining and improving the quality and numbers of the best kind of cows in the country.  At the moment, however, that body is not in a position to make any settled recommendations on that point.  Meanwhile, there is a problem forced upon us which the Government and the House should take into account, that is, the present tendency for the rate at which our best cows are exported from the country to be somewhat accelerated.</P>
    <P>In proposing a tax on cows exported, I am quite aware that such a proposal is likely to be somewhat unpopular, and that any Government, especially a Party Government, which adopted a tax on the export of cows, would be laying itself open to unfair and, perhaps, damaging criticism on the part of the Opposition, if the Opposition were prepared to act on the principle that any stick is good enough to beat a dog with.  I am assuming that the Government, though a Party Government, will act in the spirit of a National Government and that the Opposition will put national considerations above Party considerations&mdash;and if that assumption is not justified by the facts, it ought to be.</P>
    <P>The loss of our best cows has been a chronic condition&mdash;going on for generations. On that point, I will quote some figures which are not without interest.  The number of cows supplying milk to creameries in 1938 was 573,000, while in 1941 it was 530,000&mdash;a diminution of some 43,000 cows.  The amount of milk supplied to creameries per cow in 1938 was 370 gallons, while in 1941 it was 349 gallons.  Therefore, not only was there a diminution of some 40,000 cows, but there was a diminution of 20 gallons per cow, between 1938 and 1941.  Of course, it is possible that these cows, although they ceased to supply milk to the creameries, did not leave the country.  On the other hand, it is probable that a number not so very different from that did leave the country.  In normal times, up to 1939 and 1940, the export of cows was about 50,000 or 60,000 per year.  I apprehend that recently, and especially in the last six months, that rate of export of our best cows has increased greatly.  I <Col N="468" /> fear that the rate of export is now in the region of 100,000 cows per year.</P>
    <P>The background of this whole affair is the fact that milk is in great demand in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There is a scarcity of protein for human ration there, and they have elected to discourage beef exports from Éire to Great Britain as a source of protein; otherwise, they would not pay 9/- less for beef cattle than for forward stores.  Against that, they have shown recently a tendency to derive protein in large amount by consuming a greater quantity of fresh milk.  Quite recently, they arranged things in such a way that practically every drop of milk which farmers in Northern Ireland and Great Britain can spare, beyond household requirements, is sold at a fixed price.  The price for liquid milk in the present month, December, 1942, is fixed at 2/6 per gallon; and the price for milk of manufacturing quality, that is, milk corresponding to the quality of creamery milk, is 1/11 per gallon.</P>
    <P>That means that the farmer in Northern Ireland or Britain who has milk to spare can be practically certain of getting 1/1 per gallon for it and may, in some cases, get 2/6 a gallon or even more, if it grades as Grade A milk.  That has inevitably and automatically caused a serious appreciation in the value of all cows in Britain and Northern Ireland.  Cows in that area have gone up in value by more than the seasonal amount for the autumn of the year.  I do not know by what margin they have increased in value, but I should not be surprised that cows were worth £20 a head more in September and October, the autumn of the year, than they were at the corresponding time a year ago.</P>
    <P>In that situation, there is a tremendous suction set up, tending to suck our surplus cows out of our country because of the profit in the higher price.  After all, what self-respecting cow would go on producing milk in County Limerick for 9d. a gallon when she could be producing milk across the Border at 2/6 a gallon or, at all events, 1/11?  The only limit to the export of cows appears to be the transport facilities available for them, <Col N="469" /> and I gather that cows come last in priority in transport, that all other kinds of cattle get out first, that cows are allowed out only to the extent of the transport facilities available, and that a licensing system exists by which the Minister issues licences only to the number of cows for which transport can be got.  Suppose transport conditions were free and normal, and there were no restrictions on the carrying of cows.  We may assume for the sake of argument that all cows in this area are of the same value and that all cows in Britain and Northern Ireland are of the same, other value.  In other words, cows in this area are worth £40 apiece and all cows in Northern Ireland £50 apiece.  Given free transport facilities in that case, the dealer would buy cows in Éire at £40 apiece and sell them in Northern Ireland or Britain at £50 apiece, leaving him with a gross margin of £10 normally to cover transport and his expenses.  That would give rise to the problem and to the proposition contemplated by by motion.</P>
    <P>If I am right in thinking that there is limitation on transport facilities for the export of cows, then there is a potential supply of cows available on this side of the Border for export greater than transport facilities can take.  That situation gives you a market in favour of the dealer.  He can pick and choose his cows and, whereas, in normal circumstances, he should pay £40 for what I might call a typical cow, he can get all the cows if he has a licence, for as low as £30 each.  If that be the essence of the situation, it makes a present to the dealer of a surplus profit and my case is that if that surplus profit arises, it is in fact in the nature of an unearned increment and it should be intercepted by the State in the form of an export tax on cows or in some other way which I will shortly suggest.</P>
    <P>To find out whether the facts are as I think they are, I know it would be necessary to ascertain over a period of normal years what was the normal gross profit obtained by dealers in buying cows in Éire and selling in Britain and then to ascertain, in reference to the present era of limited transport facilities, whether and to what <Col N="470" /> extent that normal gross profit has been in fact widened by reason of the glut of supply here owing to the lack of transport facilities and to ascertain to what extent dealers were making abnormal extra profits.  An export tax could then be imposed equal to that differential profit to capture for the community something which would otherwise go into the pockets of the cow dealers.</P>
    <P>If the State did that, in theory the dealers would still pay the same price. They would be paying the owners of the cows for those they bought and the only difference would be that the surplus profit instead of going into the dealers' pockets would come into the pocket of the State by way of taxation.  If I am right in thinking that we are exporting 100,000 cows in the year, the increase in the margin of dealer's profit may be of the order of £5 or £10 per cow.  Obviously, over a period of 12 months, there is a nice little nest-egg to be collected of £500,000 or so which would help to relieve taxation in other directions and would not diminish by one iota the prices which farmers would obtain for the cows they did sell.  That would deal only with one aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>It would not affect in any way the quality of the cows we export.  It would still leave unsolved the problem of trying to increase the number of the best cows and heifers we keep in the country, but on the assumption that we must continue that undesirable economic drain of our best cows for export to England, it would at all events ensure that the Exchequer benefited rather than the dealer from the present abnormal situation and the undesirable drain.</P>
    <P>There is another way in which the Minister could capture for the State the profit which might otherwise go undeservedly into private pockets.  If I am right in thinking that there is not as much transport facility for cows as would be desirable from the point of view of the number of cows that people would like to sell, then the licences which the Minister issues, being based on the limited transport facilities available, <Col N="471" /> have a real commercial value and would tend to be sold for the commercial value in the same way as licences for fat cows and other cattle were sold during the economic war period.  If there is the slightest sign of any sale of licences to export cows taking place, I suggest that the obvious thing for the Minister to do is not to give these licences gratis to anyone, but to fix a price at which those licences would be sold by tender and to vary that price from week to week in accordance with demand.  In that way, in accordance with variations in transport facilities, he will be able to get a price for those licences which exactly corresponds to their commercial value and will prevent the dealers profiting by the present abnormal transport situation.  I have, at all events, opened the matter for discussion and, perhaps, if the debate is adjourned until next year we may be able to develop the discussion in various other directions.</P>

      <P>The Senator's statements are all wrong.  I am not discussing <Col N="472" /> the statement about preserving our best cows for home consumption, but his statements about the export trade in cows are all wrong.  First of all he said that in pre-war this country exported something like 60,000 cows. Does he include in-calf heifers in that, I wonder?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Springing heifers are shipped in a great many cases as stores.  They are not included to any great extent in the other shipments. When we were distributing the licences we found that there were hundreds of cases of persons saying that they exported in-calf heifers as stores for the reason that in many ports&mdash;ports like Waterford, for instance&mdash;there are special rates for fat cattle, store cattle and springers.  I wonder where the Senator got his statistics?  He says that we export under licence 100,000 cows a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>14 per cent. is roughly one-seventh and, according to my recollection, the total export of cattle in a year is about 700,000.  A seventh of 700,000 is 100,000, if you take 700,000 as the rate for the whole 12 months period, but it might apply only to the period under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator referred to any person with knowledge of the situation or to someone in the Department of Agriculture, he would find out that there are only about 900 licences per week issued in England to the Department of Agriculture.  That would be only 46,800 if they were issued for the 52 weeks.  That does not include the limited number exported to Northern Ireland, but it is a long way short of 100,000.  The Senator also said that transport conditions are a means of swelling shippers' or dealers' profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> I tell the House that, as far as transport is concerned, there are no shipping restrictions on cows, and have not been for a long time.  Milch cows have a priority claim on all boats going out and all the shipping companies recognise that claim.  They are never held up, as facilities are always given for their export.  As a matter of fact, there are no transport difficulties in regard to the shipping of cattle for a considerable time&mdash;not since the crush came on after the foot-and-mouth congestion last year.  We are able to get away, in a short space of time, all the cattle we are able to export.  As far as I know nothing is held up for more than three or four days.  There are no transport restrictions as far as shipping is concerned and there have not been for a long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Transport on railways and shipping is a very precarious job, particularly for milch cows.  They are subject to a good many complaints, a good many breakdowns, and they suffer a good deal in transit, but that is only a thing that any of the dealers or any business man will understand, and anticipate as likely to happen in the course of trade.  Tariffs will not lower the dealers' profits, if that is what the Senator is concerned with. He seems to be afraid that the dealer is making too much, but the tariffs might possibly have the opposite effect. The Senator should know that during the foot-and-mouth outbreak, when we had to get many licences under restrictions, the profits during that time were higher than they were at any time since or before.</P>

If the Senator wants the Department to put £10 a head on every milch cow or in-calf heifer exported, and if the Department decided to do that, I can say that it is the farmer who would pay that £10 and not the exporter.  The Government would have no means of checking it, and it would be a matter of indifference to the dealer or exporter what tariffs were put on.</P>

      <P>Cows are making up to £60 a head and I think a farmer that gets £60 for a cow is not very badly off.  It is not a bad price for cows and they made that price in Dublin last Wednesday.  The Senator talked about the conditions of export but I am afraid he did not know very much about them.  The facts are that the British Government allow about 900 cows a week to be exported to England under licence.  These licences are sent to the Department of Agriculture which sends them to the Secretary of the National Executive of the live stock trade.  At one time the National Executive met to distribute the licences <i>pro rata</i> according to the numbers of cows exported by dealers in 1939.  Since then the members of the National Executive could not give the time to it and an official of the Department of Agriculture with the secretary of the National Executive is working on them.  They get the licences <i>pro rata</i> on the 1939 figures. I cannot see that it could be done in any other way, because the export of springing cows and in-calf heifers is a specialised job.  There are markets to which they are sent and, if it was left to the farmers to ship their cows, they would not know where to send them.  They would not have the clients to handle them either and they would not know the markets for which these cows would be suitable. At present no milch cows are exported from Éire to Scotland, so the whole business of export is in the hands of the British Government, which sends licences to the Department of Agriculture. The number of these licences is limited to about 900 a week.  Northern Ireland will take a limited number of cows, but, again, the licences come to the Department and anybody coming in to buy cows here must have a licence or permit from the Northern Government to bring the cows into the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> As regards the imposition of a tax, any tax that is put on will come out of the farmer's pocket.  It does not matter whether the export tax is £10 or £1, the dealer will look for the same profit and he will buy his cows as cheaply as he can.  The only thing which will regulate that is competition and supply and demand.  I do not know what is at the back of Senator Johnston's head in advocating a tax on these cows.  It would have no effect whatever on the price which the farmer would get for his cows.  If these restrictions were put on, it might have an adverse effect.  I strongly oppose the motion and I do not think that the Minister will give any countenance to it, either.  I do not think that any sensible man would give it countenance.  I am surprised at Senator Johnston putting down a motion of this type.  I am here as a representative of the cattle trade and Senator Johnston never consulted me to ascertain what effect it would have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with what Senator Counihan says.  It is to be deplored that, after the last decade of trouble through which the cattle trade has passed and after every human difficulty that could be put in front of it was so placed, we should now be confronted with giddy motions to upset the even tenor of the way with which England's difficulties have provided us &mdash;a favourable opportunity to make the prices which Senator Counihan rightly quoted.  I suggest to Senator Johnston that the fall of 40,000 in number of cows from 1938 to 1941 and the reduction in the milk supply may, in part, be attributed to the absence of food which was, normally, at the farmers' disposal and the use of which the Government had no option but to prohibit.  That was bound to have some effect on the production of milk per cow and on the <Col N="477" /> number of cows the farmer would feed. It is very human for the farmer to try to place his cows where they will produce 2/6 a gallon for milk instead of the wretched price paid at home.  What compensation would be required to keep these cows at home?  You cannot expect the farmers to go on keeping these animals without some compensation. To attempt to stop the profits coming to them now is, I suggest, entirely imprudent.</P>
      <P>As regards the profits of the dealers, it is my fortune frequently to auction cows and I see the dealers very keen, even to the tune of 2/6, to obtain possession of the cows.  If any of us takes the trouble to examine our towns, we will find in each one relics of broken-down cattle dealers, men who found it necessary, unlike professors, to get up at three or four o'clock in the morning and walk, with the light of a cigarette, in slush and muck, while contributing, at the same time, through taxes, to the maintenance of our always desirable academic institutions.  We spend a great deal of time in the Seanad talking about professors and the work of professors.  I sometimes think that all the time we so spend is not spent in the interest of the children who are being taught.  To-night, we heard the Minister for Finance deploring that the Dáil and Seanad are frequently asking for more interference with the normal flow of work&mdash;more Government control, more officials and more expense.  Instead of a motion like this, I should be delighted to see a motion coming from any side of the House which would endeavour to restore the cattle trade to the position which it occupied ten years ago.  Whatever other blot is on the administration of the Ministry for the past ten years, that of the cattle trade is one which will not be wiped out for 20 years to come.  Families had to make such sacrifices during the past 20 years that they were ruined.  It is absurd to have motions now brought in to obstruct those who are trying to replenish the modest living which has, at all times, been the lot of the Irish farmer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give some figures which do not agree with those <Col N="478" /> given by Senator Johnston.  The figures supplied to me were: Dairy cattle exported in 1938, 71,000; in 1939, 78,000.  As Senator Counihan mentioned, heifers in calf were not included in that figure in many cases. The rule about heifers in calf is much more strict now and they are at present included in the exports.  Taking the six months, May to October, 1938, we exported 46,000 cattle and, this year, in the period May to October, we exported 41,570.</P>
      <P>The total for this year to the end of October was 69,900, and if all the licences will be used up from this to the end of the year the total export should be 80,000.  So there is no great difference between the exports now and what they were pre-war, especially taking into account that heifers in calf are now included, and they were not included at that time.  Senator Johnston was not exactly correct in his understanding of the way in which these licences are issued.  Senator Counihan explained to a certain extent how it is done.  The British Government in consultation with us issues a certain number of licences, and as Senator Counihan said they fix a figure, it is 1,000 at the moment.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad disapproves of the action of the Minister for Agriculture in substituting an officer of the Department of Supplies for an officer of the Department of Agriculture as a member of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Order No. 237 was made on 9th November and the purpose was to make it possible to alter the constitution of the Pigs and Bacon Commission. The constitution of the Pigs and Bacon Commission was set out in the Act of 1939 and the amendment was embodied in the Order making it possible, so to speak, to eliminate an officer of the Department of Agriculture and to substitute therefor an officer from the Department of Supplies. Frankly I do not understand the purpose of that Order.  I do not think that there is any other institution in the country that has brought upon the Minister more criticism and brought more confusion in the minds of a great many people than the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  The Minister will recollect that when he was amending the Pigs and Bacon Act I indicated my view about the alteration being then made and urged that the change from the old Pigs and Bacon Board to the Pigs and Bacon Commission, putting the sole responsibility for the control and care of pigs and bacon production in the hands of three people, was not wise.  Now the constitution of that commission consisted until recently of the gentleman who was chairman of the previous Pigs and Bacon Board, <Col N="480" /> with the addition, I understand, of one or two officers of the Department of Agriculture.  There was an officer of the veterinary branch and an officer directly from the Department of Agriculture. I may say I am all against that method of placing so much of the ordering of our affairs in the hands of what we look upon as the Civil Service.  I feel that they are out of touch with these matters and that it is impossible for them to keep in touch. What troubles me about this is that this change has been made, whereas if you had one representative of the Department of Agriculture, one would feel that he would have an understanding of the problems and would have various opportunities in the Department of getting data and information. With an individual like that on the board or on this commission one could hope that there would be a certain amount of understanding of the producers' point of view.  When you come up against a situation in which an official like that has been dropped, and has been substituted by a representative of the Department of Supplies, one immediately begins to think that the approach is made from the point of view that the distribution aspect is more important than the production aspect.  That is how it appears to me.</P>
    <P>Whoever is responsible for this Order, whether it is the Taoiseach as Head of the Government, or whether it is the Department of Supplies acting with or without consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, it is a departure that, from the procedure point of view, I cannot support.  It is something of which this House ought not to approve.  I am raising this matter because there is a principle of considerable importance involved.  What I urge is that, from the point of view of consumers, and from the point of view of the people in the Department of Supplies, it is more important to get production, and if the Pigs and Bacon Commission have any function in respect of production, and if they have any opportunity of assisting production, it is vitally important that the constitution of the commission would be such that evidence would be available to producers that there was somebody <Col N="481" /> there who really understood their problems.  I confess I am in the dark as to how this body functions.  Apparently, to a considerable extent, it is independent.  It is acting under a statute of the Oireachtas, and is independent of the Minister.  I presume that it must get information and advice from the Minister.  I am not quite clear what control the Minister or his Department exercises over it.  It is impossible for outsiders to understand how this body functions.  I am not one of those people who consider that we should do away with ordering and regulating at the present time.  I do not think we can.  I do not accept the view that we can dispense with the authority that the Minister has taken to order and regulate supplies, distribution, and production, where that is possible.  You must have some sort of organisation, but I am not clear how this body functions or what is the connection with the Department of Agriculture. I want to get from the Minister some statement as to the connection between his Department and this commission as to how far they are responsible for shaping policy, how far it affects production, and how far there is consultation with the Minister.</P>
    <P>If the Minister tells me that there is continuous consultation between the Department and the Pigs Commission, perhaps the case which I make falls to the ground, because although the individual who was a nominee or an official of the Department of Agriculture has taken his departure from the commission, information can still be made available to the commission and the departmental point of view can still be made known.  But I imagine that this body was, under the system which operated previously, able to conduct its affairs without having to call in, except on rare occasions, perhaps, an adviser from the Department.  The ordering of its affairs should be in the charge of men who all the time in our present circumstances keep the production end in view.  My opinion is that production is going to be the whole problem in the future.  I agree that if production lessens or falls considerably under what it is to-day, the problem of distribution <Col N="482" /> will be insoluble.  I do not know what the Minister's view is, but I may say that I am not at all optimistic as to the prospects of an increase in our pig production in future.  I do not know whether the Minister will recollect that a very long time ago, at least seven or eight months before the position became acute, I suggested in this House that by last July the number of pigs available for curing could be cured in one factory.  Probably some Senators will recollect my saying that eight or nine months before that position actually came about.  I found fault with the whole policy then.  What I dislike about the action which has been taken is that it shows a disregard for the interests of producers or for the problem of producers, and, after all, production is the major end.  You will really have very little difficulty with distribution if you get production. Production being by far the biggest consideration, the point of view which you have to keep in mind, if any point of view at all is to be represented in shaping the policy which the Pigs Commission formulates, is the point of view that can, so to speak, voice the interests of producers.</P>
    <P>I presume that the new departure is now in operation as the Order was signed on 9th November, but this is the first occasion on which attention has been drawn to it.  I do not know whether the change has actually taken place but, anyway, it seems to me it is a step which should not be taken and which the Minister should not have assented to unless there are reasons which do not appear obvious to us. Whatever the Minister's point of view may be, I think that any member of the community for whom I would claim to speak in this House, the producers of pigs would have to take exception to it.  I recognise that the Pigs Commission have a very difficult part to play and a very difficult task to perform, and that they are subjected to a great deal of criticism.  Some of it, I admit, is perhaps not well-informed criticism, because naturally many of the people who talk about these things are considerably in the dark.  Nevertheless, the commission itself is not <Col N="483" /> being given a fair chance unless it can bring to bear on the whole problem a balanced judgment.  One would have imagined that there was no necessity to alter the constitution of the commission in the way in which it has been altered.  Whatever the reasons were, it might be expected that the producers' end could be better served by the original arrangement.  I think the general principle underlying this Order is unsound.  The policy is not wise. As far as I am concerned, it is not an action to which I could subscribe.  I think that some other method should have been adopted if the problem of production presented to the commission a task which, according to its constitution, was beyond it faithfully to discharge.  I do not know whether it is possible now to alter the situation, but at any rate the principle is one which I felt should not be permitted to pass without being brought to the notice of the Oireachtas so that an opportunity might be afforded of hearing the producers' views about it.</P>

      <P>It is well, perhaps, that Senator Baxter raised this matter because as he truly remarked it is the first time it has been raised publicly and it gives me an opportunity of explaining why the change was made.  As the Senator pointed out, an amending Act was brought in in 1939.  It was laid down in the Act that the Pigs Commission would consist of a chairman appointed by me and two ordinary members, to be members of the staff of my Department. Some time ago, as Senator Baxter mentioned, an Order was made, signed by the Taoiseach, enabling me to appoint an officer of the Minister for Supplies instead of an officer of my own Department.  Senator Baxter, in the first place, believes that there was some sinister move there of which I did not approve.  I want to point out that when an Act is amended by an Emergency Order it must be done by the Government; it cannot be done by a Minister.  Any Order made by <Col N="484" /> the Government is signed by the Taoiseach.  It was I asked the Government to make that Order for reasons which I shall state.  The problem of distribution of bacon had become, I may say, one of the major functions of the commission because, when bacon got scarce, naturally they were looked to to see that whatever bacon was in the factories was distributed on an equitable basis.  Then also they had the duty imposed upon them of looking after the illegal curing of bacon. Added to that they had the function put upon them of dealing with pork butchers and of allocating a certain amount for that purpose&mdash;to see that each pork butcher got his fair share of the business.  All these matters which, in the ordinary way, would not be matters for my Department were being administered by the Pigs and Bacon Commission, but the machinery was very roundabout inasmuch as anything they proposed to do had to come to my Department, had to be sent to the Department of Supplies for their observations and back again to my Department.  As Senators are aware, it is very hard sometimes to get either &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to queries addressed from one Department to another. Queries come back and are again returned and it takes a long time to get these matters settled up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought the quickest way to get these matters fixed in the future would be to have an officer of the Department of Supplies there, so that they could fix things at the commission meeting without any great trouble.  Senator Baxter should have no fear that the representative of the Department of Supplies will be opposed in any way to the interests of the producer.  The very name of that Department implies its functions: no Minister is more anxious to have supplies of bacon than the Minister for Supplies.  My anxiety might be more to see that the producer is satisfied: his anxiety is to see that the consumer is satisfied.  He could not do that without enough bacon, and he cannot get enough bacon unless he tries to please the producer. The officer of the Department of Supplies will be most anxious to get the <Col N="485" /> producer to produce enough bacon, and I cannot see how he would try to thwart the producer in any way.</P>
    <P>With regard to policy, before the emergency and under legislation they were entirely responsible for policy. The lines of that policy were laid down in the Act, and they had very little to do before the emergency but fix prices for producers, fix the quotas for each factory, and the quota of home sales for consumption.  That was all laid down in the Act on a certain basis. Policy did not come into it, though judgment did, to a certain extent, as they had to judge what the home sales should be for a certain month, and take certain things into consideration when fixing the price of pigs.  To some extent, you might call that policy. Since the emergency, I adopted the practice&mdash;as I mentioned here before&mdash; of meeting them occasionally to discuss policy.  Though they were not bound to do so, they always showed me the courtesy of coming to see me when I wished to discuss matters with them, and they gave consideration to any views I expressed.  Sometimes they convinced me that I was wrong, but they always listened most patiently to my views.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, policy enters more into this question, as the low number of pigs in the country makes even the fixing of the price of the pigs a matter of policy, and not so much a matter of following the Act.  We must have regard to the amount required for human food, and that is rightly regarded as being more my function than theirs, so they come to get my opinion.  They ask how the wheat crop is doing, as wheat is required for human food; and they ask how the potato crop looks, as it is also required for human food; and so on.  These are all matters that must be considered when they make up their minds on the price of pigs.  It is extremely difficult to give any indication of the trend of the number of pigs. The trend looked very good up to recently. We always make our graph on the number of sows put to service, and there was a good increase shown from last February up to October.  The tendency went down then, but whether <Col N="486" /> that is for one month only or is a general tendency, I do not know. Senator Baxter should remember that this is entirely a matter for feeding.  If he or anyone else could tell me where there is feeding stuff not being used by any farmer&mdash;where, if pigs were paying, the farmer would feed pigs, and is not doing that&mdash;there might be a case; but, if there is no feeding, and if no farmer has any feeding left unused, no more pigs can be fed, and that is all there is about it.</P>
    <P>The officer of the Department of Supplies has been appointed, and is acting now in place of one of the officers from my Department.  Even the officer of the Department of Supplies was appointed by me, and can be removed by me if I do not think he is acting rightly. The Order made by the Government gives me the option to appoint an official from that Department instead of one from my own Department, but I am not bound to do so.  I think that things will go more smoothly as a result of this change, and do not think the producer will be in a worse position in any way.</P>

      <P>I am glad that I raised this point, as the Minister has cleared up several matters about which I myself had no knowledge, or of which I was doubtful.  With regard to the Minister's comment on the future outlook for pig production, the problem is one more of fuel than of food in my county, as we have to cook the food for pigs, whereas previously we could turn in the bags.  The Minister may be surprised to hear that seven tolerably good pigs were sold in our fair on Tuesday last, ten or 12 weeks old, for £4 10/-.  That is the way prices are with us.  It is disastrous, as no county in the country has held to its pigs and <Col N="487" /> sows as we have.  This may not be a matter of interest to southern farmers, as the situation in the south is entirely different.  They may be short of food there, but their fuel supplies are better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says it is a problem of food, but my opinion is that our total yield will drop to such an extent that, unless we get higher prices, we will not get as much food.  The problem of price is a big factor in determining the quantity of food available for pig production, but I cannot go into a discussion on that now.  The Government would take the long view on pig production. We cannot do that to-night, but it is something which could be discussed when the Seanad meets again, <Col N="488" /> as there is not enough discussion on these things.  Some Senators like to find fault when these points are raised and think we are being merely critical. There can be an open discussion later on, on this whole problem, and I am glad that the Minister has given us this information.  It is of interest to me to know that the Pigs Commission is in close and constant touch with the Minister.  If we are asked about policy later on, we will know that responsibility has been accepted by the Minister for policy, and that it is not the responsibility of the Pigs Commission.</P>
