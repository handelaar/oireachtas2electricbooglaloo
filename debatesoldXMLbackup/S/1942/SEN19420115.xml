    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That this House is of opinion that Ministerial or Government pronouncements on supplies or other important aspects of the present emergency should be made to Dáil Eireann or Seanad Eireann, and that suitable legislative or administrative action should precede rather than follow Ministerial statements likely to cause alarm among citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a motion which has been in my mind and in the minds of a number of other members of the House for quite a long time.  I move it for the purpose of getting an expression of opinion from the Government on a general principle, that is to say, as to whether important announcements should not be made in the first instance, where practicable, to the Dáil or the Seanad rather than to newspapers, whether foreign or Irish, or at dinners or functions of various kinds as distinct from meeting of either House.  It seems to me, Sir, that the principle itself is one of some importance.  Ministers are servants of the people and are responsible in the first place to the Dáil.  The Dáil, it appears to me, in the nature of things is the best instrument available through which to convey to the people important announcements or radical changes in our economy or otherwise.  There may be defects in the Parliamentary system, but every effort should be made here to work it.  That is especially the case in this country where owing to our history &mdash; our recent history and our remote history&mdash;we are unused, perhaps, to Parliamentary Government.  Similarly, it seems to me <Col N="254" /> that the best practical demonstration of unity of purpose and the realisation of the duty of everybody to do what he can in an emergency, is to be found by way of declaration to the Dáil or to the Seanad followed by reasoned and reasonable discussion and decision.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that unity of purpose, or even agreement as to a general plan, does not preclude reasonable discussion.  At the moment Great Britain is at war.  Her Ministers are naturally harassed and overworked and are bearing immense responsibilities but I am sure the House will have noticed that in Great Britain, the Prime Minister and other Ministers make all important declarations to Parliament.  I realise, of course, that declarations which have merely a propaganda value may be made to foreigners but they, I think, are on a different footing from statements on the internal situation.  Statements bearing on the internal situation should be made in the main before the Houses of Parliament.</P>
    <P>In the motion, I am putting forward the view, which apparently the Government has not taken and does not yet take, that instead of making startling announcements, then allowing an interval to elapse and then proceeding to do something about it, the pronouncement should be made at the same time and on the same occasion as measures are being taken to cope with the situation.  That would mean that there would be more encouragement for the people and it would lead to more unity of purpose amongst them.  The policy that has been pursued since the beginning of the emergency has not varied.  At first Ministers told us that everything was for the best in this country in spite of the war, that we had a magnificent Government which had shown great foresight, and that the country was to be congratulated upon our comparative immunity from suffering.  Then we go from that particular attitude to another attitude where very serious things are threatened and where dark hints are given of imminent difficulty and trouble.  It seems to me, Sir, that that kind of speech constantly made in the country is merely likely to trouble people's <Col N="255" /> minds and, possibly, in the end, to create the worst of all situations, namely, a situation where Ministers have cried &ldquo;Wolf&rdquo; so often that nobody believes them at all.</P>
    <P>The most recent example of the ignoring of the Dáil was the interview given by the Minister for Supplies to the <i>Yorkshire Post.</i>  I am not attaching any very great importance to the giving of an interview to an English paper and it may be susceptible, I think, of a great many explanations, but I do feel that this is not capable of explanation.  If on the 30th December, the Minister knew of the difficulties he mentioned to that paper, the necessity for general rationing, and so on, he must surely have been well aware of that situation before the Dáil adjourned in the middle of December. It would have been much more appropriate and much more helpful to everybody if the statements had been made to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Constantly, people who have intervened in matters relating to the emergency have been told that they were wrong, that they were beforehand and that they were defeatists.  For example, the Minister for Supplies has now declared that we are going to have a system of general rationing; that bread may be rationed&mdash;the most difficult thing of all, perhaps, to ration.  On the 5th March of last year in this House a motion was proposed asking for the setting up of a national register of consumers with a view to facilitating rationing should rationing on a general scale or to any extent become necessary.  Rationing, it was stated, should have two objects: (1) the preservation of employment to the greatest degree possible, and (2) the giving of a fair deal to all sections and particularly to the poorer sections of the community.  It was put forward by myself in that debate, in column 611:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that the only way in which we can relieve the situation, which is bound to get worse, is by honestly telling the people what the position is.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> I think still that if people were told fairly and squarely what the position is and what steps were being taken in the situation they would be prepared to go to almost any lengths.  The Minister for Supplies in that debate did not agree that there was any necessity for a general scheme of rationing or even to take the first step, namely, the preparation of a national register.  He refused the national register mainly on the grounds that it would be expensive, but he was not able to say what the expense would be and I think we are justified in believing that he actually had never found out what that expense would be.</P>
    <P>Other Senators who debated that matter, Senator Quirke, for example, thought that such a step as the taking of a national register would be panicky. He described it as panic legislation and gave us a slogan with which we are very familiar, namely, &ldquo;Trust the Minister.&rdquo;  Unfortunately, those of us who have never trusted the Minister do not find ourselves in any better position to trust him now than we did many years ago.  As a matter of fact, it must be borne in mind that only people who have entirely abandoned their own judgment and placed that judgment in the care of somebody else can adopt with satisfaction to themselves the situation that they trust the Minister and do not bother.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter on that occasion suggested that there would be considerable difficulty with regard to wheat after the next harvest.  He said a number of things that have since then been proved to be true.  His speech was described by the Minister for Education, who spoke on the second day, as a rather long and defeatist speech.</P>
    <P>What I feel is most alarming about Ministerial speeches, no matter where they are made indeed, is that Ministers, getting up to talk about the emergency, appear to argue on their feet.  Quite obviously, the Minister for Education had not given any consideration to this matter of a national register and just poured out arguments as you would in a debating society.  The <Col N="257" /> same thing occurred to us here on the question of fuel and transport with the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. MacEntee.  We had a debate on turf on a motion with regard to a turf order and the question was raised, if the turf were won how would it be transported to Dublin; how would it be kept in Dublin, and how would it be distributed in Dublin?  The Minister gave quite an airy reply to the effect that if the turf could be got the transport problem would solve itself but, not very long afterwards, the Taoiseach told us the transport problem was insuperable.</P>
    <P>What I want to put to the House is that if the situation were faced up to in the proper manner there is no length to which people would not go if they were convinced that all citizens were getting a fair deal and there was clear direction from on top.  I do not see that we can have any co-operation or that anyone can do what everyone wants to do at the present moment, namely, assist the Government, unless they can get a clear idea of what the Government does want and where the Government does want to go.  My reading of speeches made outside Parliament has led me, rather reluctantly, to the conclusion that either they do not know where they are going or they are taking rather elaborate steps to conceal their direction from the ordinary reader and hearer.</P>
    <P>With regard to declarations made outside the Dáil, we have broadcasts and we have speeches, and Ministers do not hesitate to make the most serious statements merely for, I think, debating purposes.  We were told, for example, by the Taoiseach that we were the most blockaded country in the world.  That is, I think, obviously not true, not corresponding to the facts.  The Minister for Supplies, speaking at a dinner of the Institute of Journalists in January, 1941, told us that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;by force of circumstances, or deliberate design, each of the belligerents had taken steps the direct consequence of which is the curtailment or stoppage of supplies coming <Col N="258" /> to us, although in the case of Great Britain action by design has only recently occurred.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely, if blockade by design has been entered upon by the British it is extraordinary that it has not had more effect than we have noticed since January, 1941.  It seems to me that statement had simply no meaning and, at any rate, if it had a meaning and if it were true that Great Britain were beginning to blockade us by design&mdash;as distinct from refusing to send us something of which she was herself short or of which in her own judgment she could not spare any quantity&mdash;if such a very grave emergency had arisen as blockade by the British, the first people to be acquainted of that should certainly have been the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Minister for Supplies has gone to a Fianna Fáil Cumann, or Fianna Fáil executive, or some kind of shadowy meeting at which the Press does not attend, and he denounces the black market.  He denounced the black market last month.  One wonders what has been done about the black market in the interval.  In all these interviews, Ministers can make any kind of statement they please.  Senator Baxter, speaking in the Seanad, is told that he is a defeatist.  Members of the other House and members of this House are told that they are acting against the national interests by making certain statements.  Ministers, however, can speak where they like and take all the advantage of being able to be reported as they please, but, as was indicated in the Seanad yesterday evening in regard to the wheat debate, their opponents must submit to a very rigid censorship.</P>
    <P>The thing reminds me of a well-known story in Irish, and indeed in other languages, of the old woman who, on a very frosty night, went into town.  The dogs barked at her and she bent down to pick up a paving stone to throw at the dogs and she found that the stones were frozen.  She said: &ldquo;Is bocht an scéal é madraí scaoilte agus clocha ceangailte&rdquo;&mdash;it is a hard situation to have dogs loose <Col N="259" /> and stones tied.  That seems to be the situation that Ministers want with regard to this emergency.  They want the opportunity to say what they like, whenever they like, to whom they please, and what would be regarded as alarmist and anti-national in anybody else is apparently the height of wisdom and national benefit in them.</P>
    <P>Even the most recent speech of the Taoiseach at Navan struck me as very alarming for the ordinary person.  I do not understand, for example, why the Taoiseach, like a fond parent, should be protecting us from the knowledge of interviews which irritate him and which would irritate us if we saw them, but which he is not going to let us see in case we should get irritated. The net result of that is that everybody in the country interested in one of the belligerents&mdash;and a great many people are interested in one or the other&mdash; begins to frame imaginary interviews. Some of them blame X and some blame Y, but the general effect is to inflame feeling and cause uneasiness.  Each interprets the interviews as his own bias dictates.  I do not know what these interviews are.  I tried with members of the Defence Conference to find whether they had ever heard of these interviews.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Interviews were not mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said articles.  I never heard of these articles and they had never heard anything about them.  As a matter of fact, members of the Defence Conference can sometimes be told very important things about which they never heard in the conference.  I had myself an example of that.  I was able to tell a member of the Defence Conference of a very important happening, of which I was a witness, and he was told that there was no knowledge of the matter four days later, although it is inconceivable that a particular piece of information could not have travelled 130 miles between Sunday afternoon and Wednesday afternoon.  I am sure it did.  I see now, for example, that Ministers propose to go out on a grow <Col N="260" /> more food campaign&mdash;Mr. Aiken at Castlebar; Dr. Ryan at Limerick; Mr. Derrig at Kilkenny; and Mr. Aiken at Cavan on 27th January&mdash;with, on occasions, officials of the Department of Agriculture.  One wonders will these meetings be simply &ldquo;grow more food&rdquo; campaigns, or will they, like the meeting in Navan, be meetings at which external politics, defence, our imminent danger of attack owing to certain people writing certain articles and the growing of wheat will be all mixed up in one speech.  I think it very undesirable that that kind of procedure should be adopted.  It looks very much like Ministers going out and taking a political job, making political speeches and appearing in the forefront in the preparation of a political campaign under the guise of fulfilling certain duties during the emergency.</P>
      <P>Without detaining the House any longer from the very important matter before it with regard to the price of wheat, I may say that it seems to me that there is no clarity, no decision at the top of the Government with regard to the emergency, with regard to supplies, or even, indeed, with regard to defence, and that it would be much more desirable that important statements should be made in either of the Houses of Parliament.  It would get Ministers more assistance; it would inspire the country with more confidence; and it would help to build up institutions here which would give us strength to face any emergency which may come upon us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is all that is to be said about the motion, I suppose I had better intervene at this stage.  I read in this morning's paper that Bismarck, the Emperor of Germany, divided the races of the world into two classes&mdash;the masculine and the feminine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>How could he when there was no such person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; I should have said the Chancellor of Germany. Amongst the feminine races, he put <Col N="261" /> the Celts.  If Bismarck was right and if Senator Hayes is a Celt, the speech we have just heard would certainly support Bismarck's contention.  It is, I understand, the privilege of the feminine sex to nag, and the speech we have just heard from Senator Hayes is a typical example of the type of nagging to which the Government has been subjected in certain quarters for some time past.  It is, of course, no doubt, a source of pleasure to Senator Hayes and some others to go back over the past year or two to pick out this incident and that incident, and to parade them as something on which to base criticism of the Government, but I do not know where it is going to get us.  There is surely an obligation upon members of the Oireachtas to do something more than nag in our circumstances, and I suggest to Senator Hayes and other members of the Seanad who might be inclined to take the same line that the reiteration of their criticism of various minor incidents that occurred, or that may occur, is not going to achieve any purpose.  I do not know if we are to take seriously Senator Hayes's contention that Ministers should not speak at all on matters of importance, except to the Dáil and Seanad.  That is apparently what he meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers have a function other than that of leading the Oireachtas.  They have a duty to the people.  They are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that members of the public are fully informed about all matters that affect their interests. It is their duty to guide public opinion to ensure that the course of action which is necessary for the national safety is taken by members of the public, and these various pronouncements that are made by members of the Government through the newspapers, at public meetings, and over the radio, are all designed, not to secure political advantage for the Government Party, but to give the public the information the public want, that is, not merely a statement of the facts <Col N="262" /> of the situation but also a statement of what course the Government wants the public to take, so that the national danger may be reduced.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes took a somewhat different line from that taken by one or two newspapers in the country which have been publishing leading articles on somewhat similar topics in recent weeks.  On various occasions during the course of the past year or two, it became necessary for members of the Government&mdash;myself in relation to matters of supplies more particularly than any other&mdash;to tell the public what may happen.  I have had to announce a possible shortage of flour, a possible shortage of coal, a possible shortage of other essential commodities, not for the purpose of making startling announcements independent of the Oireachtas, but for the purpose of endeavouring to get from the public that measure of co-operation which would, perhaps, enable the danger envisaged to be avoided, and which would certainly enable it to be reduced It is not correct to say, as some of the newspapers have attempted to convey, that the first intimation of a possible rationing of flour and bread was made through the medium of an interview with an English newspaper.  That is the very reverse of the truth.  If announcements of that kind should be first made to the Dáil, I have only to refer to the announcement I did make in the Dáil on that very subject during the final session of last year.  I gave on that occasion to the Dáil a statement of our position in regard to wheat supplies.  I told the Dáil the quantity that we anticipated we would require to enable a full supply of flour and bread to be kept up during the cereal year and how we stood in relation to supplies, and I went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;No matter what we may do, we will not have more than sufficient flour for human needs in this year. We may not have sufficient.  The estimated yield of 290,000 tons from the Irish wheat crop has not yet materialised; not more than 170,000 tons has yet come in.  There is, of course, still time for the balance to come in&mdash;the harvest was late&mdash;<Col N="263" /> but if the full estimated quantity is not secured, then we will not be able to reach the end of the year with an all wheaten loaf.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That pronouncement was made to the Dáil on 13th November last year.  In making that pronouncement I had in mind the possibility that a great deal of the wheat harvest in the hands of farmers had yet to come in, and that, if that did not prove to be the case, there would be available a supply of barley which could be substituted for wheat and enable a full supply of flour of some kind to be kept up during the cereal year.  In the course of a few weeks I began to have doubts as to whether that hope was likely to be realised, and in the course of a public statement made not at a Fianna Fáil club behind closed doors to which the Press were not admitted, but at a public meeting held, no doubt, under the auspices of a Fianna Fáil Cumann but which Senator Hayes was free to attend if he wished&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I thought fit to let the public know through the medium of that public meeting that:</P>
      <P>In the case of wheat, the full quantity required to supply the whole of our needs of flour and bread was not obtained from this year's harvest. Whether that failure to produce enough will mean inability to maintain a full supply of flour and bread to our population is not yet clear. We had hoped that if wheat fell short a sufficiency of barley would be available to mix with flour and thus to maintain a full supply of bread with-our rationing.  To date, the quantity of barley placed on the market is inadequate for industrial and other normal uses and there is no surplus available to substitute for a possible deficiency in wheat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The 12th December last.  In the light of these pronouncements, <Col N="264" /> made in the Dáil in November and in public in December, what foundation is there for the allegation that the announcement at the end of December, or early in January, that we might not be able to avoid a rationing of flour, came as a shock to the public as has been suggested?  On the same occasion that I intimated we might not be able to avoid the rationing of flour, I referred to the possibility of having to ration gas in Dublin.  We are again told that that came as a shock to the enlightened individuals who write leading articles in some of our newspapers.  I presume the editors of these newspapers and other people who have been speaking in public on these matters take some measures to acquaint themselves of what is happening before they choose to comment upon them.  In the case of gas, in the City of Cork and in the City of Limerick, and in at least half a dozen other large provincial centres, gas has been rationed for months past.  The chairman of the Dublin Gas Company, at the annual meeting of that company reported in the Irish newspapers of September of last year, announced that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The company's position in regard to coal had further deteriorated and they had seen their small stocks consistently dwindling to the point when even a short cessation of deliveries would force them to suspend manufacture of gas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of these facts which should, presumably, have been known to the people who choose to comment upon them it is surely preposterous to suggest that the announcement that gas might have to be rationed came as a shock to anyone who had taken the trouble to acquaint himself of what the supply position is.  It is, I think, desirable that these facts should be made known to the public by every means and on every occasion so that the public will understand not merely what the situation is that we are facing, but what is required of them.  If the difficulties of that situation are to be cased it was necessary to inform the public that we were facing the possibility of having to ration gas in Dublin. <Col N="265" /> The rationing of gas in Dublin might be more serious from many points of view than the rationing of gas elsewhere, and, by public co-operation and by a voluntary reduction in the quantity of gas used, particularly by large consumers, we might be able to avoid it, at any rate during the winter months in which the absence of gas at all hours of the day, would cause the greatest hardship.  It is true that, by a purely fortuitous improvement in the situation, we have been able to avoid the necessity for introducing gas rationing in Dublin, at least for the present, but that avoidance of the rationing of gas will continue to be possible only if we get from the public the degree of co-operation in the utilisation of gas which has been pointed out to them.  Surely it was in the public interest, and in everybody's interest, that that situation should be explained fully to the public by any means, and the extent to which they could help to improve the situation made clear to them.</P>
    <P>The same is true in relation to our flour and bread.  It is a recorded fact that 470,000 acres of wheat were grown in this country last year.  There has been some suggestion that the average yield was slightly less than normal, but if it was it could only have been so slightly less as to make no appreciable difference in the situation.  In some districts the yield was above normal. On the basis of the normal proportion of the wheat harvest retained by farmers for their own use, either for the purposes of seed or to meet their domestic requirements, it was reasonable to assume that we would get from that acreage of wheat the 290,000 tons of dried wheat which we estimated.  It was not that 290,000 tons were essential, except in so far as that every ton of wheat secured from the Irish harvest removed the necessity of having to import a ton of wheat and made available a corresponding amount of shipping space that could be used for the conveyance of some other essential commodities.  We have not got the 290,000 tons of dried wheat that we anticipated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say how much has been got in?</P>

    <Col N="266" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The quantity in to the end of December was the equivalent of 190,000 tons of dried wheat.  We could import more wheat than we thought would be necessary by avoiding the importation of other goods which, from many points of view, are almost equally necessary, but we cannot, even if we utilise the whole of the shipping facilities available to us, make good the entire deficiency represented by the non-arrival from Irish farms of the quantity of wheat that we anticipated. It may be that a substantially large quantity of the wheat that we anticipated will yet come into the hands of merchants and millers from the growers.  Wheat is still coming in, although not nearly in the quantity that is required.  For some weeks past the average deliveries of wheat have not exceeded more than 1,000 tons a week, although our consumption is 1,000 tons per day.  Our plans are based on the anticipation that there is still to come from Irish farms some tens of thousands of tons of wheat which will be available for the feeding of our people before the next harvest.  As I have stated, we can increase the quantity of wheat that we will import, but even allowing for all the increases in imports possible, and for any reasonable anticipation of deliveries yet to come from Irish farms there will still be a deficiency in wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable that the public should know that.  It is desirable that that fact should be made clear to them.  It is necessary, first of all, that the farmers should understand the difficulties they will create for the country if they withhold wheat unnecessarily.  It is desirable that the members of the public should be warned against waste in relation to bread or flour or other wheaten products, and it is desirable that there should be a wider general realisation of the enormity of the offence committed by individuals who use the wheat required as human food as feeding stuffs for animals.  It is the duty of the members of the Government to go to the public and make these facts known, and to make them known in a manner which will strike the public imagination, and get the <Col N="267" /> members of the public to think about them and appreciate the importance of them as individuals as well as of the developments that are taking place.</P>
    <P>It is true that there are classes of goods in respect of which it is not desirable a public announcement of a shortage should be made before supplies are got under control.  I have been pilloried by members of the Opposition in the Seanad and in the Dáil, and through the Press, for announcing, in advance, a possible shortage of certain supplies.  This time last year their complaint was the very reverse, as I will ask Senators to remember.</P>
    <P>About this time last year I had to announce the impending rationing of tea and immediately there was a howl of criticism from many people because no previous intimation of the possible rationing of tea had been given.  It was obviously undesirable that any undue reference should be made to a possible scarcity of tea, because tea is a commodity that can be stored and, if stored, it will keep for quite a long time.  That consideration does not apply in the case of bread or some other commodities.  In the case of tea, it was not until supplies in the hands of the wholesale trade were got under control that any announcement in relation to rationing was made, although there had been some intelligent anticipation of a possible shortage among members of the public beforehand. It is necessary to avoid making general rules such as Senator Hayes suggests in relation to matters of this kind.  Where it is clear that the public, through their co-operation, and if they have the knowledge, can help to avoid difficulties, then the public must be given the knowledge. On the other hand, where it is clear that undue publicity might possibly create panic and a state of disorganisation in the matter of distribution, then publicity has to be avoided until precautionary measures have been taken.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes mentioned that such announcements should be made in the Dáil or Seanad, to be followed by discussion <Col N="268" /> and decision.  Where the action contemplated requires decision by the Dáil, the course indicated by him is followed.  It is, of course, the normal practice of Governments, in times of peace, to try out new ideas upon members of the public, to discuss various legislative projects in public before legislation giving effect to them is introduced.  That is not merely the normal practice, but it is a desirable practice, and it tends to strengthen rather than undermine the democratic idea.  It gives the public an opportunity of expressing a general opinion on the idea before it is formulated in precise terms.  It gives various bodies throughout the country an opportunity to make representations as to how their particular sectional interests might be affected by such legislation. It is desirable that members of the Government should speak frequently to the public concerning the general legislative programme of the Executive, their general ideas as to how future events may influence national policy, so that there can be developing amongst the public a knowledge of the circumstances that the country will have to face and a discussion as to the best means of coping with these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I notice some criticism of Ministers giving interviews to foreign newspaper representatives.  Of all the preposterous objections that have been advanced to actions of the Government, that surely takes the bun. There is an obligation on members of the Government, not merely to direct legislation in Parliament, not merely to lead public opinion within the country, but also to ensure that misrepresentations of the national position or national attitude outside the country are corrected, and corrected by the most effective means.  Stronger and wealthier countries than ours maintain organisations in foreign countries for the purpose of dealing with these misconceptions and misrepresentations of the national position. We cannot afford to do that, but when it is clear, in relation to many important aspects of the national position or the national policy, that there is a misunderstanding <Col N="269" /> existing in other countries, and if an opportunity of correcting that misunderstanding by giving interviews or statements to foreign newspapers is offered, it is the duty of members of the Government to avail of that opportunity.  The contention of some Irish newspapers that Ministers should give interviews only to them is surely baseless.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes referred to some matters relating to the past, and I should like to refer to them also.  It is not true that I made any pronouncement to the effect that general rationing will be necessary.  It is true that we have taken a national register, or are in process of compiling a national register, following the census taken some time ago, with a view to ensuring that an extension of rationing will be possible of speedy execution if it is considered necessary.  It is well known that recent developments in the war have immensely intensified our supply problem and, while it is much too soon to say to what extent that disimprovement in our position will involve an extension of rationing, it is obviously desirable that we should be ready for it, if it becomes necessary.  It is for that reason we are preparing the national register and are arranging for the printing of ration books.</P>
    <P>Members of the Dáil and Seanad who proposed this course before have not had to take into account the immense difficulties there are in present circumstances of doing these things.  The printing of some 3,000,000 ration books, the mobilisation of the supplies of paper and other materials necessary for that purpose, is a task of immense difficulty and it is going to take some time to complete.  But no decision has yet been taken to utilise these ration books, when available, for the rationing of any commodity and any announcement to that effect, through the Press or elsewhere, is entirely unauthorised.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that if we have to adopt the rationing of flour and bread, it cannot be on the basis of a coupon system.  There are something like 1,000,000 loaves of bread used per day in this country and any coupon system would, at least, have to have <Col N="270" /> the loaf as the unit, and if we tried to make an arrangement for the checking of 1,000,000 coupons a day, in order to ascertain if people were getting more than their ration, it would involve a staff far out of relation to anything we might recruit. The rationing of flour and bread, in the circumstances of this country, will be a task of immense difficulty.  Even if we have now to face it, I do not suggest that any really satisfactory system of rationing is possible.  There are difficulties of relating flour to bread; there are immense difficulties in relation to the farming community, the majority of whom are independent of flour mills and bakers for their supplies. They arrange to have their own wheat milled by commission millers, and some of them have their own mills, and the problem of bringing them into any equitable system in regard to flour and bread is a very difficult one.  It certainly cannot be a coupon system; although the ration books may be utilised in relation to it, it will not be on the basis of clipping coupons from the books.  However, I think it is desirable that it should be known that the taking of the national register and the preparation of books for rationing have been done as a precautionary measure, and, in fact, if they have to be utilised it will only be when the need for an extension of rationing to other commodities has become clear.  In relation to most of the commodities to which reference has been made in the newspapers it is not yet clear whether any extension of rationing will be necessary at all or not.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which Senator Hayes referred was statements made by Ministers concerning turf and the transportation of turf.  Now, it was impossible, of course, for the Government, in June, July and August of last year, to know what precisely the turf transportation problem was going to be.  The size of that problem depended upon so many factors that were unknown and unknowable, that no definite idea as to the extent of the problem could be formed.  The quantity of turf that would be available for transportation, the quantity <Col N="271" /> of other fuels that would be available in the areas to which the turf might be transported, the physical difficulty of operating rail and road transport services in the light of fuel and other difficulties, were all unknown and unknowable, but the fact is that the transportation problem in relation to turf has not merely been found to be manageable but that the arrangements made were such as to ensure that the quantity of turf arriving in Dublin now, the quantity of turf which has been arriving in Dublin for some time past, is in excess of the consumption in Dublin, and there is accumulating in the non-turf area a reserve store of turf amounting to 150,000 tons which will be available to meet the fuel needs of the area for some time to come.  The fact that there is the accumulation of that reserve, the fact that even at the present time the arrivals of turf in the city exceed the consumption of turf, is surely an indication that the problem of transportation has been solved.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes referred also to a matter to which he has frequently referred before, and that was a statement made at the beginning of last year that we were a blockaded country, even the most blockaded country in Europe.  Our circumstances at the moment are not quite as bad as they were this time last year.  This time last year there were no shipping services of any kind available to this country, there were no ships available for the transportation of goods to this country, whereas at the present time we have ships of our own, perhaps not adequate to supply all our needs, but they are at least available now and are busily engaged in bringing in supplies to this country.  I did not say, as has been suggested by Senator Hayes, that we were being blockaded by Great Britain by design, but that the British Government had taken action the result of which had been the cessation of the arrival of supplies here.  I did not attempt to attribute any motives to the British Government, and no doubt what involved the taking of that action was the need to meet the urgent necessities of their <Col N="272" /> own situation, but when the British Government makes an order prohibiting the export of goods to this country I have to take it that that is action by design and not by accident, and the British Government, which up to that time had operated an open general licence arrangement in relation to goods exported to this country, cancelled that open general licence and required a specific licence with regard to each consignment.</P>

      <P>I do not know what particular significance the Senator attaches to the word.  It is quite true that at this time last year there was no country in Europe worse off than we were in the matter of the ability to obtain supplies from abroad.  If there was such a country, I want to know which country it is.  We have, by our own efforts, succeeded in improving that situation in the interval, but even at the present time our ability to obtain goods from abroad is probably substantially less than that of, certainly, the majority of European countries, if not all of them.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the situation is in Denmark, but apparently there is available to that country a very wide area of supply in Europe itself which is not available to us.  So far as Norway is concerned, I presume the same thing applies, but I have not got the information as to that and, therefore, cannot say what the real circumstances are.  In the case of the neutral countries, such as Sweden, they have a much larger mercantile marine than we have, and I think the same is true of Spain, <Col N="273" /> Portugal, and even Switzerland, but the information which one can obtain with regard to these countries indicates that the supplies which come from overseas are certainly not scarcer than they are here.  However, I referred to the matter only for the purpose of making clear that in any reference I made to that situation I was concerned only to state facts and not to attribute motives, and any attempt to twist my words into attributing motives is unjustified by the context.</P>

      <P>I do not know that there is anything else that Senator Hayes said to which I need refer at this stage.  He referred to a statement I made at a public meeting recently concerning &ldquo;black market&rdquo; activities, and asked what was I doing about it. The whole object of the statement was to point out that the curbing of &ldquo;black market&rdquo; activities needed the co-operation of the public and that nothing that the Government could do would be nearly as effective as co-operation from the public along the lines indicated on that occasion. Surely, it was in the national interest <Col N="274" /> that that fact should be given publicity through the newspapers, and certainly that was the sole purpose I had in mind: not to indicate that there was a difficulty there, but to show to the public how that difficulty could be reduced by their actions.</P>
      <P>The motion, anyway, suggests: &ldquo;That this House is of opinion that Ministerial or Government pronouncements on supplies or other important aspects of the present emergency should be made to Dáil Eireann or Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;  I say that that suggestion is impracticable and that, even if it were practicable, it is undesirable. I say that it is the Government's duty to ensure that knowledge about supplies or other important aspects of the present emergency is given not merely to the Dáil or through the Dáil but given to the members of the public by every means available to the Government, particularly when these pronouncements are made for the purpose of indicating how the public can cooperate in dealing with national difficulties.</P>
      <P>On the point that &ldquo;suitable legislative or administrative action should precede rather than follow Ministerial statements likely to cause alarm among citizens&rdquo;, I say that that all depends upon the nature of the statements.  If the purpose of the statement is, as I have indicated, to tell the public what the situation is and how to help to remove the difficulties, then there is no question of legislative or administrative action.  Where there is a question of legislative or administrative action, it is often desirable that the public should know what is contemplated, and what the position is before being presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i>  Where it was found necessary that Ministerial action should be taken, it has been taken, and in a few cases, where undue publicity as to possible scarcity or other difficulties could be a cause of trouble, there has been an avoidance of it.  I suggest, therefore, that there is no point in the contention in this motion, and that the tabling of the motion by Senator Hayes indicates, rather, an entire misconception of the functions of Government in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he will tell the House what is the total all-in cost at the North Wall of the wheat which he imported?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That question is one which is rather difficult to answer at the present time.  For a large part of last year the only means of importing wheat open to us was <i>via</i> Lisbon.  The wheat was shipped to Lisbon in American ships, unloaded at Lisbon, stored there for a time, then re-loaded into smaller Irish ships and brought on here.  That was a most costly method of importation.  The references which have been made to foreign wheat costing 80/- and so on relate to that wheat only.  Nobody pretended that that was an economic method of importing wheat, and it was only the dire needs of the situation, and the fact that we had to procure wheat at any cost in order to keep up the supply of wheat required by our people, that justified the utilisation of the Lisbon route.  The importation of wheat direct in our own ships costs substantially less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>How much less?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer that at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Approximately how much less?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because there will at least have to be a substantial quantity of wheat to enable an average figure to be taken.  It is at least £1, if not more, per barrel less.  The Lisbon route is now closed so far as North American wheat is concerned, because the American Government has suspended the sailings of American ships to those ports.  That action by the American Government has cut off a fairly important source of supply to us.  It has made it impossible to supplement the carrying capacity of our own ships by availing of the American ships' services to those ports, but we had in any event decided not to use that port for the importation of wheat. It was used up to recently for the importation of other goods which could <Col N="276" /> more easily carry the very considerably higher charges involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister started off by talking about nagging.  Now, I must say that, when the Minister goes on in that way, he does not convince me in any way that he is speaking honestly.  But what shocked me and what is much more serious is that yesterday we had the Minister for Agriculture here, who, with a sort of naiveté and simplicity that ought to be charming, seems to be quite honestly outraged and shocked that the people of this country were so impossible as actually to let their minds register any judgment on Government action.  The Minister talked about nagging here.  Nagging I always associate more with tone of voice.  If gramophone records had been taken of the two speeches already made, a person not knowing the language but listening only to the sound of the voice would have assumed that the word &ldquo;nagging&rdquo; applied to the second speech and not to the first. I do not know whether the Minister was just a bit careless and loose in his thought, but at one time he became quite eloquent on the duty of Ministers to communicate to the people when there were grave dangers; he talked about the people's co-operation, and used a whole lot of words about danger and so on.  What I was waiting for him to do was to explain how it is the duty of an Irish Minister, when this country is in grave national danger and requires the rallying of our own people, to address them through a provincial English organ which circulates only in Yorkshire.  It may be that the future of this country depends on the people of Yorkshire and their rallying to the service of Ireland at the moment, but at least if that is so the Minister might have said something to prove it to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to ask that Ministers never open their mouths except inside the legislative Houses.  I am not going to ask that Ministers should never speak on the wireless, or that they should never give interviews to the Press, or that they should never give interviews to the foreign Press.  Far <Col N="277" /> from it.  But the Minister's case rather destroys itself.  With regard to the statement he made to this English provincial newspaper, as far as I remember it, that it may be necessary to ration bread here, he tries to prove that there is nothing new in that because he had said in the Dáil that it may not be possible to have our loaves consisting exclusively of wheat.  That is not the same thing at all.  If the difference in the position between the making of the statement in the Dáil and his addressing the people of Yorkshire was the difference between a doubt as to having loaves consisting entirely of wheaten flour and a doubt as to having sufficient loaves for the people, that is a very big difference. It does seem to me that, if the position has changed to that extent, and if the Minister realised, as he seemed to do, that the Dáil or the Irish people were the right recipients of information, they were the right recipients of that piece of information.</P>
    <P>In the latter part of his speech he came out with this business about a blockade.  If the German papers announced that the Irish Government were participating in a blockade of Great Britain, would the Minister attribute the same connotation to the word &ldquo;blockade&rdquo; there as he attributes to it in his speech?  The word &ldquo;blockade&rdquo; means taking action to impose hardship on another country by interfering with their receiving of supplies from outside.  We do not allow the export of quite a number of commodities to England.  Quite recently we had the Taoiseach talking about those anti-Irish articles in papers outside.  If an English paper or an American paper said that we were helping to blockade England, the Taoiseach would get up and talk about this diabolical, outrageous and lying slander upon our people.  But the Minister here can get get up and talk about the English blockading us: &ldquo;We are the most blockaded country in the world, by force of circumstances or by deliberate design.&rdquo;  It might be suggested that he has not said there that anybody is blockading us by deliberate design, but he goes on to say: &ldquo;although, in the case of Great Britain, action by design <Col N="278" /> has only recently occurred.&rdquo;  I think that merely shows incapacity to think clearly, but if a person with a trained mind tried to work that off on me I would say he was most patently and outrageously dishonest.  He uses the word &ldquo;blockade&rdquo;.  He says we are very much blockaded, and then he indicates that it may be by force of circumstances or it may be by deliberate design.  Then he says that in the case of Great Britain, &ldquo;action&rdquo;&mdash;he does not say &ldquo;blockade&rdquo; there, but the word &ldquo;action&rdquo;, by reference back, means the action of blockading &mdash;by design has only recently occurred.</P>
    <P>Then here he gets up to prove his case by saying that, whereas there had been a sort of open licence for all exports to Ireland from Great Britain, the British Government suddenly revoked that and tended to curtail exports.  But we do it.  Why do we do it?  Is it an act of hostility to England?  It is nothing of the sort. The first duty of the Irish Government is to the people of Ireland, and the first duty of the English Government is to the people of England.  It may well have been&mdash;I cannot cast my mind back to last January to know exactly what the circumstances were then&mdash; that the English Government would have been failing completely in their duty to their own people if they had failed to do that.  But the Minister's speech on that occasion to his compulsorily educated or literate Fianna Fáil body could mean nothing to them but that the British Government were trying to impose hardship upon them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I suppose they are at least compulsorily literate.  Now, that is the type of dishonest speech that to me is completely intolerable. This idea that, when we desire to retain our butter here for our own people it is quite right for us to do it, and that nobody must say a word about it, but that when England, with her own people facing enormous difficulties, takes steps for the preservation of her own people, it is a sort of <Col N="279" /> outrage to us, shows at least an incomplete mind.  It shows that enormous national arrogance and ignorance which is such an affliction in this country.</P>
      <P>Now on another matter.  Wireless is a comparatively recent invention and, therefore, I suppose there has been no codified protocol as to what is good manners with regard to it.  About Christmas time I listened to an ill-conditioned address from the Prime Minister of this country to the people of America over the heads of the American Government.  Nobody here was a bit shocked by it.  But if Mr. Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of England, made a broadcast purporting to be to the citizens of this State, then you would have the Taoiseach and all his Ministers going around saying that this was an outrage that was not to be tolerated and that we could read nothing into it but proposed aggression by England.  This idea, that the standard of conduct to be expected from our Ministers must necessarily be assumed to be lower than we demand from Ministers of other countries is, to me, nationally degrading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see what right the head of the Government of one country has in relation to another except to communicate according to intelligence or affection with the Government of another country, which is the vehicle and the mode of expression of the people. Instead of that, regularly every year, and especially this year, after the United States of America had been attacked in war, from Dublin here the Government and the legal authority of America is neglected when a Minister of this country purports to speak into the homes of all the American people.  You may say that that is all right, but if it is, Mr. Winston Churchill or any English Minister has a right publicly to broadcast to the people of Eire, or whatever is the name of this State&mdash;I have never been quite clear on that since the Consituation was messed about with.  What is our position?  We are like the touchy inferior person who always feels he is not being treated fairly.  That is innate in the person who is consciously inferior. <Col N="280" /> We can do these things.  It is all right for us to talk to people in America; but it would be an outrage for somebody to do it to us.  We can talk about blockading us by design, but if anyone said that we are participating in the blockade of England we would say that was outrageous.</P>

It does seem to me that a thing which is quite all right up to a certain point can become harmful when it is done to a very large extent.  If anybody wanted to read the history of the variations in Fianna Fáil policy within the last ten <Col N="281" /> or 15 years he would find that possibly more important than the official records of the Legislature here would be such papers as the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> and other papers in England.  I would be very far from suggesting that Ministers should never give interviews to pressmen; but I deny the right of Ministers of this country to speak to the people of other countries over the heads of the Governments of those countries.  That is ill-conditioned behaviour. I do say that the Minister's statement to the Institute of Journalists, that we were the most blockaded country in the world, was a statement which more properly should have been made to the Dáil, because in the Dáil he would be called upon to justify the statement that he was making.  At the Institute of Journalists, he gets up at a dinner and makes a speech and it is all over the papers the next morning and the people of the country are led to believe&mdash;there is no good playing with words; it conveyed nothing else to the majority of minds in this country who did not analyse the sentences, or even if they did analyse them, it would not have changed the connotation&mdash; that he meant that the British Government were trying to act vindictively towards us by blockading us.</P>
      <P>As to the Minister's other form of argument, Senator Hayes referred to the fact that, while he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. MacEntee had said that once we got the turf there would be no difficulty about transport.  The Taoiseach afterwards stated that the real difficulty was transport.  Now, the Minister went into a long account of that.  His explanation of that can only prove one of two things: either that Mr. MacEntee was wrong or that the Taoiseach was wrong.  Everyone who listened to him can tell us which of them was wrong.  Was it the Taoiseach or was it Mr. MacEntee?</P>

      <P>The debate seemed to deal largely with the condition of supplies in this country.  I remember some time during last year we moved that a national register should be taken.  Now the Minister says that the Government is taking a national register.  It may be that circumstances had disimproved so remarkably that what was completely unnecessary in the early part of the year had become necessary in the latter part of the year. I remember a month or two ago when we received the forms that we had to fill.  That, I think, is the census he referred to.  The objection to it in the early part of the year was that it was not necessary and would cause enormous expense.  I should like to know what it has cost.  The Minister got up and denounced the &ldquo;black market&rdquo;. He explained that in an outside place by saying that this was a case in which you wanted the co-operation of the people to get them to realise the enormity of the operations of the &ldquo;black market&rdquo;.  The Government apparently, could not take action. Again, here I am going to speak diffidently, I have seen in newspapers advertisements saying there were so many cases of such-and-such a type of brandy for sale and asking &ldquo;What offers?&rdquo;  That was a public advertisement in the <i>Irish Times</i> on a number of occasions a few months ago.  I am not going to purport to lay down the law here, but I have an idea if a person has not a licence to sell alcohol to another person he is actually breaking the law.  If the &ldquo;black market&rdquo; were such a national evil&mdash;such an enormity, I think that was the Minister's word&mdash; and the police had ample grounds for assuming that the ordinary law of the country was being broken, they could have gone to the newspapers and demanded the correspondence with that box number and they could have dealt with the people who were trying to sell alchosol without being duly licensed.  I am not aware that they ever did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many years ago one of the greatest Irishmen of our time told me that this country has always been divided into two sects&mdash;those who wanted it run <Col N="283" /> from England and those who wanted it run from America.  As far as the Government is concerned, it seems to me that it almost combines these two sects&mdash;not that it wants it run from England or America, but Ministers have consistently shown themselves to be more worried and more concerned about public opinion in those two countries than at home.  Ministers have a perfect right to give interviews to newspapers of other countries, but what they have done, to an extent which becomes an evil, is to make pronouncements which, in so far as they are true, are of vital interest to the people of this country and of less interest to the people of other countries, and they have been tending towards an abuse by making that a general practice, instead of an occasional practice for which each occasion would demand its own justification.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to me, in his speech, consistently to mislead, to befog our minds, to change the usage of words and to get away from the fact that he made an important pronouncement, of vital interest to our people and of very little interest to the people of another country, to the representative of a newspaper which circulates only in one county in England, and what he had to say only became known to the people of this country through the accident of an Irish journalist calling attention to it in an Irish paper, a thing which might very easily have been overlooked.  The Minister has completely evaded the whole issue put before him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share Senator Hayes's dissatisfaction with the various methods taken by the Government and Ministers to keep the public informed about developments, or possible developments, in this country in recent times.  As far as I am concerned and as far as my knowledge goes of the country, these methods of informing the people, for instance through the radio or through speeches at public meetings or at specially convened conferences, meet with the utmost approval by the <Col N="284" /> people.  Complaint has been made here this evening that sometimes these statements tend to shock people.  Any person who has examined the position carefully and fairly will, I think, agree, that if these statements could be worded somewhat differently&mdash;more strongly, in fact&mdash;than they are, in order that the people might really be shocked into a realisation of their position and their responsibilities, it would be all to the good.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister to be good enough to convey to the Minister for Agriculture that he might make statements more often to the people with whom he has to deal. From time to time it is necessary for the Minister for Agriculture to make orders which are published and just left at that.  More than a week ago the Department of Agriculture saw fit to impose a curtailment on the export of certain classes of live stock.  The matter was covered last night by Senator Baxter's motion on the adjournment. Farmers and certain responsible citizens&mdash;for instance, some parish priests&mdash;have mentioned to me that it would be advisable if the Minister for Agriculture, when he is making an order of that kind, would accompany it with a statement setting forth, as completely as he can, the reasons for such an order.  As a matter of fact the particular order in question gave rise to a good deal of rumours and uneasiness, and that uneasiness has not been allayed and will not be allayed until the people will have read the statement made by the Minister last night in reply to Senator Baxter's motion. So I would like that the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;and indeed every other Minister&mdash;when an order affecting the mass of the public is to be made, should accompany it by a statement over the radio or by means of a Press interview or in some other way that may occur to the responsible Minister as being proper at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also appeal to the Minister and the Government to consider the necessity of the appointment, both in Great Britain and America, of competent Press attaches, in order to keep our position before the citizens of those two countries.  Anybody interested <Col N="285" /> and studying some of the articles, comments and statements appearing in journals in America and Britain&mdash;for instance, in Britain only two days ago, a very dangerous type of article appeared in a certain daily paper&mdash;will realise how important it is that we should have competent Press attachés in those countries to keep every aspect of our position properly before the citizens of those countries. Otherwise a state of affairs may be brought about in those countries which would have unfortunate consequences for us here.</P>
    <P>The Minister need not feel uneasy with regard to anything that Senator Hayes may have said here this evening. The public does appreciate this method of informing them of essential facts, or informing them with regard to possibilities. For myself, the only complaint I have to make is, as I have already said, that on some occasions statements are not worded strongly enough in order to shake the people more quickly into a realisation of their responsibilities.</P>

      <P>There is one point to which I think it is no harm to call attention.  Senator Hayes asks that, when any pronouncements are being made, they should be made before the Dáil or Seanad.  We are living in very strange times&mdash;times when new situations arise from day to day, situations that may very seriously affect the welfare of the people of any country. The Oireachtas has been in recess for quite a number of weeks: in that period things have changed, mostly for the worse.  Matters affecting the economics of this country have changed for the worse.  Does Senator Hayes suggest that the Dáil and Seanad should be called, so that Ministers could first say to them what steps, in their view, should be taken immediately?</P>

Anyone who hears the talk between the local shopkeeper and the local people, on account of the scarcity of certain goods, would realise that some people think that there is no scarcity&mdash;that it is a conspiracy between the shopkeeper and the Government to conceal the goods, and that they imagine they should be living as they were living five or six years ago. It is no harm to shock the people out of that attitude of mind.  Any action which any Minister may take, whether by way of interview to a foreign newspaper representative or by way of a talk before any body, which results in publicity in this country, is desirable. Senator Fitzgerald dealt at great length with the word &ldquo;blockade&rdquo;.  We would need a copy of the <i>Study of Words</i> here to define &ldquo;blockade&rdquo;.  You can have blockade by design or by accident.  This country has been blockaded as practically every country in the world has been blockaded by the accident of war.</P>

      <P>When international war is raging, all sorts of accidents are likely to happen.  Amongst these accidents is the blockade of countries not actively involved in the war.  That is what happened in our case.  We have been blockaded.  None of us says that we have been blockaded by design by any country.  Ministers did not say that but the effect of the war in which Great Britain and other countries are involved has been a blockade of this country, so that we are deprived of certain things we were in the habit of getting.  I take it that the object of this motion is to secure that any Ministerial pronouncement should reach the Irish people first.  We all agree with that.  Notice of any danger likely to arise in this country should be given first to the people who will be involved. <Col N="287" /> I do not know if it is wise to make any reference to Senator Fitzgerald's remark concerning addresses to the people of America.  I do not think that any international discourtesy is involved in action of that kind.  After all, if Mr. Winston Churchill chooses to address the Irish people, or if somebody here desires to address the Russian or the German people, I do not think that any international discourtesy is involved.  However, that is beside the question.  What we are discussing is the best way of getting knowledge of important facts to the people.  I hold that it is a matter of indifference whether that knowledge is passed on through the newspapers or at meetings, so long as it reaches the people.</P>

I want to deal with the last speaker's reference to &ldquo;blockade.&rdquo;  What the meaning of &ldquo;blockade&rdquo; is may seem of little or no importance, but what is of extreme importance is the meaning conveyed to our own people and the people of other nations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I am submitting to you is that the proper interpretation of that is that, irrespective of whether the pronouncement of a Minister or of the Taoiseach is, in the view of his opponent, imbecile or idiotic, it is not relevant to discuss the imbecility or idiocy.

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite unable to see what my reference to the word &ldquo;blockade&rdquo;, so far as I was allowed to go, had to do with the point of order which has been raised.  I was proceeding to develop my point on lines which would make for greater relevancy in the debate.  By making that point, I was hoping to bring the debate more closely to the terms of the motion.  I was saying that the exact meaning of &ldquo;blockade&rdquo; might not be of any great importance but that the meaning conveyed to the people of nations with whom we desire to remain on friendly terms was of considerable importance.  If that reference to blockade had been made to Parliament there would immediately have been a question as to what was in the mind of the Minister.  A couple of days after, I happened to be in a neighbouring country and I found that great attention had been paid to a reference made by the Taoiseach to a &ldquo;blockade&rdquo;.  It was taken to mean hostile action to this country.  I doubted that meaning, but I obtained a copy of the Oxford Dictionary and found that that meaning was perfectly correct.  There is no such thing as an accidental blockade.  However, that is not my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point is that, if that reference had been made in Parliament, it would have been challenged and something such as has been said here to-day would have been drawn from the Minister.  I took an early opportunity when I came back of drawing attention to the matter to which I have referred, <Col N="289" /> and I received an explanation from the Minister for Finance which put a different complexion on the utterances of his colleagues.  I believe that that was all to the good.  My object in referring to blockade was to bring the debate back to this question of utilising the Oireachtas for these pronouncements. Even if we could, I do not think we ought unduly limit Ministers in their pronouncements, but I, for one, view with a good deal of uneasiness what, I think, is the growing disregard of the authority of Parliament, not so much on the part of Ministers as on the part of the people of the country. When there is an important change Parliament should be called.  We have too long periods in which neither House is in session.  In a period of emergency, we should not have these long periods.  Ministers should, when possible, make their statements to Parliament.  When the matter dealt with is of importance Parliament should have the preference.</P>
    <P>I cannot follow the Minister in his statement that the most suitable way for getting the greatest amount of publicity was by the medium of speeches made at a club where the Press was present.  There is no evidence that you will get more publicity anywhere for a speech than in Parliament. I hope that that will always be the case.  I am not satisfied that our newspapers are giving as much space to Parliamentary debates as they should but, to do them justice, they do give space to Ministers.  If we are to maintain the idea of democracy, particularly during a time when there will be a limited amount of ordinary legislation and when a great deal of legislation must be of an administrative character, effected by means of orders, it is desirable that the fundamental essence of democracy&mdash;the responsibility of the Government of Parliament&mdash;should not be forgotten. One thing I have greatly admired in Great Britain during the war is the lack of objection to criticism.  The people there have said that they can face criticism and that it will make them strong.  While I am against unfair criticism and do not knowingly indulge in it, I believe, at the same time, that criticism is helpful even in <Col N="290" /> an emergency and that, if it were not for the criticism from the Opposition here and in the other House, our State would be much weaker than it is to-day.  At present, the only kind of discussion which is given the proper amount of space in the Press is that led by a Minister.  The only way you can get people to remember that Parliament is the Government and that what we call the &ldquo;Government&rdquo; is the Executive of Parliament is by taking advantage of every opportunity to have important statements made in Parliament.  It should be the place in which such statements would be most frequently made.  If one picks up any of the three Dublin daily newspapers, and compares the space given to Parliament with football notes, racing notes or even the stock exchange, it will be seen that at a time of emergency like this, the fundamental government of the country is not being properly reported at all.  If there is some stupid or relatively unimportant criticism it will be reported, but quite serious criticism which may take place in this House will not be.</P>
    <P>We had a very good instance of the correct way of dealing with such a position.  After detailed, and what I admit to be strong criticism, of a certain order had taken place the Minister concerned did not quite see it in that light at the time, but promised to look into it.  He came back to Parliament yesterday, and made another statement and suggested that members of this House should have an opportunity of carefully considering and possibly criticising it before he made an order.  In my opinion that is the proper democratic method and one that should receive approval.  That is not always possible.  I am glad that this motion was brought forward.  I want to make no point about particular speeches, but I am not satisfied that the authority of Parliament is being maintained at the present time in the minds of the people.  The Minister stated that he was astonished that anyone should be shocked at the idea that bread or gas might be rationed.  I completely share his view.  It was no shock to me, and it should be no shock to anybody who kept in touch with the situation.  The fact is that nine people out of ten <Col N="291" /> failed to get hold of the idea as being serious at all.  I am not at all sure, having regard to the mentality of our people, that the Minister succeeded in &ldquo;getting it over&rdquo; to them.  I agree with Senator Goulding that many of our people are living in a fool's paradise. They imagine very often that there is some sort of conspiracy between the Government and the Opposition for the purpose of keeping back supplies, of which quantities are available.  My criticism of the Government is that they have been too slow about rationing, and have waited until the position was too bad.  At no time have I ever said anything by way of criticism of the Government for instituting rationing.  If there is a reasonable danger of shortage it is only fair to the poor and to the people generally that there should be rationing.  I hope I will not be taken as one who criticised it on any grounds.</P>
    <P>In the main I agree with the motion. I am glad that it was brought up.  I want to draw attention first to the need of more frequent meetings of Parliament, and to the desirability of having free discussions, such as took place about the compensation to be paid for injuries by bombing.  As Senator Buckley wisely suggested, we might also have explanations of orders followed by brief discussions in Parliament.  If the Dáil is too busy then this House could be made available for that purpose. The Minister described certain speeches which were made here as &ldquo;nagging&rdquo;. I entirely disagree with him that that is a feminine privilege.  I say without hesitation that the record of this House during the last couple of years has shown that there has been a great deal of serious and detailed criticism, of which Ministers in many cases took advantage, and if we had more frequent statements here, with the opportunity of asking questions with a view to clarifying the position, they would get better publicity.</P>
    <P>It would be far better if more use was made of this House in that way. At any rate, Parliament should have first place when Ministers have statements to make.  They should only <Col N="292" /> make them elsewhere when they find it impracticable to make them in Parliament. That does not mean that they should never make statements elsewhere, and does not exclude interviews intended for publicity in other countries or particular types of propaganda, although propaganda in the case of small neutral nations is a two-edged weapon which we would be wise to avoid.  I do not agree with Senator Buckley's suggestion about Press attaches.  I think that would be a danger.  I am convinced that it would be a serious danger to have somebody busy replying to anything published outside Éire that might be considered undesirable.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the wording of the motion which suggests the way in which Ministerial or Government pronouncements should be made.  Every speaker, and even the proposer, stated that what is suggested would be ridiculous as they did not want to deprive Ministers from speaking outside the Oireachtas. Everybody here understood that that portion of the motion was irrelevant. Even the proposer admitted it.  The second part of the motion suggests &ldquo;that suitable legislative or administrative action should precede rather than follow Ministerial statements likely to cause alarm among citizens&rdquo;. Nowadays Governments can legislate overnight by way of emergency orders, and administrative action can be taken by a Department.</P>
      <P>To my mind, the only sense that can be taken out of the motion is that the Government should become dictators and that we should not have a democracy at all.  We are told that suitable legislative or administrative action should precede rather than follow Ministerial statements.  Therefore, Senator Hayes recommends that you do a thing first and talk about it afterwards. I cannot see that there is any sense in the motion.  I think it is perfectly ridiculous.  These are the only remarks I shall make upon it.</P>

      <P>When I read the motion, to be quite frank I did not think that Senator Hayes was really serious about having a very long debate or about having, as it eventually developed, a sort of general attack on the Government.  I did not think that that was his idea.  I thought it was merely brought forward for the purpose of giving such Minister as might happen to be present an opportunity of explaining Government policy on matters directly concerning the nation at present.  I would almost go so far as to say that I interpreted the motion as an invitation to the Minister to do things in the way that Senator Hayes would like him to do them, in other words, to avail of sittings of this House or of the other House to make such <Col N="294" /> statements as the Minister might think necessary.  The discussion has certainly taken a very different course to that anticipated by me, and I am definitely sorry that many of the statements which we heard have been made. Senator Hayes made several references to such things as the transport of turf, and suggested that statements that were made by the Taoiseach did not prove true.  If the Taoiseach made the statement with which he was credited by Senator Hayes, that is that the transport of turf presented an insuperable problem, and if it did not prove to be such subsequently, then I think instead of having a full dress debate about it, Senator Hayes should, like the rest of us, be quite pleased that things did not turn out in the way that was anticipated, if they were anticipated as badly as the Senator suggested they were by the Taoiseach.  I think we should be all very grateful that the position is as explained to us here by the Minister for Supplies, that whatever other worries we may have, we at least have eliminated one worry which was uppermost in the minds of most of us not very long ago, namely, the prospect of a fuel famine in the City of Dublin.  We should be thankful to God that that danger has disappeared and give credit wherever it is due.  Where it is due is not for me to say.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general idea that statements should not be made at public meetings, particularly if these meetings are held under the auspices of any political organisation or section, I am in entire disagreement with any such suggestion.  I believe that Ministers and the Taoiseach would be lacking in their duty if they did not avail of such occasions to make statements on matters of importance.  If we arrived at the stage where the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers would be so scared of the criticism of their political opponents that they would not dare to make statements of national importance or avail of such opportunities to make such statements at a political meeting, when that political meeting coincided with the necessity for making the statement, then I say we would have got into a very serious position indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> With regard to Senator Fitzgerald's speech, I am afraid that he is at least very inconsistent in his statements.  He pointed out various things which had been done which should not have been done.  Amongst other things, he said that we should expect from the Ministers of our own Government at least the standard of decency that we would expect from the Ministers of another country.  All I have to say in that connection is that because of the standard of decency and because of the outstanding ability and general conduct of our Ministers, the reputation of this country has been raised in the opinion of thousands of people scattered all over the world and that the Taoiseach's conduct in general has done credit to this country whereas the conduct of Senator Fitzgerald has done it anything but credit.

      <P>The Senator never wants to be offensive, but if some Senators are in the unfortunate position that the cap fits them, I cannot help it if they insist on wearing the cap.  In any case the principal grievance Senator Fitzgerald had was that the Taoiseach regularly every year purports to speak to the American people, ignoring the American Government, while Mr. Churchill or no other foreign Prime Minister has the right to speak to the Irish people.  Well, I do not know who said they have not.  If they say they have, who could stop them?  We have people broadcasting to this country every night of the week from England and from Germany.  Whether they be Lord Haw-Haw or anybody else, we cannot stop them, but they are acting in a very different capacity to the capacity in which the Taoiseach acts when speaking to the Irish people in the United States.  When he speaks to our people in the United States he is speaking on the direct invitation of Irish agencies in America, speaking on the direct invitation of people who <Col N="296" /> want to hear how things are going in what they call &ldquo;the old country&rdquo;.  I think that every time the Taoiseach has spoken, he has done a good job for the people of this country as well as doing good for the people of Irish descent who are scattered over every part of the United States and every other country for that matter.  The Senator denies the right of Irish Ministers or the Taoiseach to speak to the people of other countries over the heads of the people of these countries. I am not aware that the question has ever arisen or that the Governments of other countries have objected to the Taoiseach's addresses to the people of the Irish race scattered all over the world on those occasions.  If Senator Fitzgerald is aware of any such objection he should have told us.  I do not believe that such objection has been raised, and I believe that if there was any such objection the question would be considered very seriously before such action would be taken.  Senator Fitzgerald is one of those people who cannot hide his political bitterness.</P>

      <P>I have no political bitterness to hide.  I am completely devoid of any such bitterness.  In any case, people who win do not want to be bitter.  I suppose there was a time when we had bitterness, when we were getting kicked around and nobody would tolerate us, but, thank God, that day has gone.  The fact that we do not treat people in the Opposition in the same way as these people treated us when we were the Opposition should be sufficient to remove all political bitterness.  There is no necessity for it at all.  As I say, there are other people who can hide their political bitterness better than Senator Fitzgerald. It is a pity that he would not take the cue from them and we would all get along much better.  It is quite evident to anybody listening to Senator Fitzgerald's speech that he was not particularly troubled because the people of the United States were being addressed regularly, as he put it, once a year, by any particular Minister in <Col N="297" /> this country.  What was really troubling him&mdash;and it was just as obvious as the nose on Senator Fitzgerald's face&mdash; was that a man called de Valera was addressing the people of the United States on behalf of the people of this country, including Senator Fitzgerald. That is really what is troubling him. We have passed through more than ten years in this country in which de Valera has got an increasing number of people on his side.  There are more people on his side to-day than there were yesterday and it is time to eliminate that twopence halfpenny bitterness and to accept the position and to bring about in reality the position which we all say exists here, that is, that we are all united, at least during this emergency, for the welfare of the country.  I do not think there is anything else I have to say except to appeal to Senator Hayes to be consistent and not to be carried away by such speeches as that made by Senator Fitzgerald.  I suggest, with all due respect to Senator Hayes, that he has had a full and complete explanation of the situation generally from the Minister and that he should gracefully withdraw his motion.</P>

      <P>I will try to relate the few remarks I have to make on this motion to the terms of the motion set out on the Order Paper and not to indulge in the type of argument we have listened to here by some Senators supporting the motion before the House.  I do support the principle embodied in the first part of this motion that Ministerial or Government pronouncements should, if possible, first be made to either House of the Oireachtas.  I think that is a cardinal principle we ought all agree to accept, more particularly at this time, when democratic institutions the world over are rated so low.  I think we should concentrate on that and I say that with an entire trust in the Minister who is before the House this evening. I am not like Senator Hayes who is one of those who never trusted the <Col N="298" /> Minister.  I have as much trust in the Minister doing his job to-day as I would have in his predecessor in the former Government if he were doing the same work to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is none, I think. Is it not?  I think the Senator had no trust in the Minister's predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no trust in him. I said I would have as much trust in him if he were in the same position as the Minister here to-day.  However, I just want to emphasise the fact that I believe the institutions of Parliament ought to be maintained and that, if possible at all, pronouncements that have to be made should first be made in this House or in the Dáil.  If that is not possible, there is a medium adopted in other countries which I think might well be adopted in this country to which nobody here has referred at all: that is, that at least the Press of this country should be taken into consultation.  If any pronouncements affecting the social and economic life of the people of this State have to be made, they should be made through the Press of this country, both the metropolitan and provincial Press.  I think that is a very effective medium of putting over anything that the Government want to put over.  I think it is more desirable to do that in the present emergency, when the Government is receiving a certain amount of support from all Parties in this House. I think it is much more desirable to do it by that method than to do it by purely political Party meeting.  If it has to be done, I think it should be done through what I may call that neutral medium, notwithstanding the fact that the policy of the Press of this country may be different from that of the administration in power at the present time.  I think with a few notorious exceptions, the Press of this country is very fair to any Government in office.  I think they are actuated by a desire, at least in the present emergency, to be helpful, notwithstanding what may appear from time to time in leading articles in some papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in little agreement with the arguments put forward by members on this side in support of the motion.  I do not approve of them.  Reference <Col N="299" /> has been made to the question of supplies and shipping, but if Senator Douglas could prevail on his colleagues on this side to grow more wheat&mdash;and when I say to grow more wheat I mean to grow it at an economic price to the farmers&mdash;there would be more shipping space released for the importation of other essential raw materials for the maintenance of industry in this country.</P>
    <P>In regard to the particular incident that I imagine gave rise to this motion, namely, the Minister's interview with that very pro-Irish organ the <i>Yorkshire Post</i>, I have some knowledge of that particular paper for a long period of years.  It has never been very friendlily disposed to this country, but when I was expressing my views last night on this matter to a man who is not a politician but purely an industrialist, he put a point of view to me that changed my opinion, and I think the Minister adverted to it in a slight way this evening.  My friend suggested that the Minister was probably replying to propaganda against this country, contained in organs such as the <i>Yorkshire Post</i>, and that the Minister conceived that was the most effective way of countering that propaganda.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that is true or not but the Minister this evening adverted to it in a slight way.  I had changed my mind since last night in that regard and having heard him I got the impression that he had some idea in his mind that he was controverting propaganda against this country and that he thought that was the best medium of countering that propaganda.</P>
    <P>Our supercilious, inflated, egotistical friend, Senator Fitzgerald, referred to the Taoiseach's &ldquo;ill-conditioned&rdquo; address to the Irish in America each year. I think that comes very poorly from Senator Fitzgerald.  Senator Fitzgerald did not feel bound here this evening to denounce the ill-conditioned pronouncements of Senator MacDermot during last autumn.  I am quite certain Senator MacDermot's pronouncements were not made in favour of this country and I think people who live in glass houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What may be ill-conditioned in the Taoiseach may be very admirable and highly approved of in other people.  That is only by the way. I want to make the point that I deplore Senator Fitzgerald's reference here this evening.  It comes poorly from a man of that type to make a reference of that kind, from one who poses as being highly educated, not semi-educated like some of us who sit on these benches.  However, while approving of the motion in principle, I want to say that I would suggest seriously to the Minister here that if any pronouncements of that type have to be made and if it is impossible to have more frequent meetings of the Dáil and Seanad&mdash;and I do not think it is impossible; I think the House ought to urge that more frequent meetings be held&mdash;the Minister ought to avail of that medium which I suggested earlier, that is the metropolitan and provincial Press of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that I ought to explain to the House and to Senator Douglas that my interruption of him, on a point of order, was in essence a compliment to Senator Douglas, for I sat with patient endurance, without opening my lips in protest, to a very long spate of irrelevance, and it was only when I feared that he was about to follow the bad example that I interposed, because Senator Douglas is the one member of the House who has received from me the most frequent complimentary allusions for sanity of view and moderation of expression.  Both he and the <Col N="301" /> last speaker approved of what is not on the Order Paper.  In their own minds, they amended the resolution and applauded that amended resolution. I should say that Ministers and the Taoiseach would vote willingly for a resolution that important utterances of policy, that declarations of State would find their most appropriate place of utterance in the Legislature. If it were Senator Hayes's intention to declare that doctrine of Parliamentary government, I think he would have the support of every one of us without demur; but what he has asked us to do is to declare that a Minister is to be deprived, by the fact of Ministerial office, of that freedom of speech, of comment and of criticism about public affairs which we lesser individuals claim for ourselves at all times.  If there is any meaning at all in the resolution, that is what it amounts to.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, those who have spoken in approval of the resolution have forgotten what the Senator himself appears to have forgotten, that this is a double-barrelled, or, using more respectful language, a two-clause resolution, and he said nothing whatever in support of the second clause.  He abandoned it from the very beginning. &ldquo;That suitable legislative or administrative action should precede rather than follow Ministerial statements likely to cause alarm amongst citizens&rdquo;&mdash;we have not heard a syllable as to that, as to how such a thing is to be secured.  We have not heard how legislative or administrative action is to precede a statement that might cause alarm.  Cause alarm amongst whom? &mdash;it might be asked.  I take it that he means among the public in general. How is legislative action to be taken before making statements likely to cause alarm?  Surely if legislation is introduced an explanatory statement will be made as to why it is introduced, and for what purpose, and what benefit to the State is to accrue from its enactment. How could there be any debate of any value whatever with the suppression&mdash;the total suppression, according to the sentiment of this&mdash;of statements likely to cause alarm?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose some further legislation is introduced with regard, say, to the defence <Col N="302" /> of the country.  Would not every member of this House ask that we should be told what new menace has arisen, or what new event has occurred, which has necessitated appeal to further legislation, and that exposition of the measure proposed would undoubtedly cause alarm to the people whose hearts are fluttering over every statement a Minister makes, and would cause alarm amongst those who, notwithstanding the pretended truce of God between the Parties, are on the look out for matters on foot of which to attack the Government.  After all, what was Senator Fitzgerald's characteristically incoherent and inconsistent speech but an attempt, at the cost of all relevance, to parse every utterance of the Taoiseach and Ministers for quite a considerable period past?</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes told us an amusing story.  He recalled another story to my mind&mdash;that of the Jew, who, forgetful of the requirements of his code, was indulging in a little pork, and, by a strange coincidence, a thunderstorm occurred simultaneously, and he was heard to exclaim: &ldquo;What a fuss about a little piece of pork.&rdquo;  I feel that this motion is a fuss about nothing.  It is a fuss about the fact that the Ministers take the public into their confidence. Remember, if you can, that amongst the various irrelevant things Senator Fitzgerald said&mdash;I find it difficult myself to remember&mdash;was the statement that Ministers ought to take the public into their confidence, and immediately he rates them for taking the public into their confidence on occasions when the House is not sitting, and on occasions when something has arisen which is not of sufficient importance to inflict upon the country the expense of calling the House together.</P>
    <P>In my own boyhood, there was a book to be seen in almost every bookseller's window, and even in what are called stationery shops, entitled: <i>The Polite Letter-Writer.</i>  Senator Fitzgerald apparently feels himself fit to produce a similar sort of aid or guide for the polite speaker, especially addressed to Ministers and men in office to tell them what to say on a particular occasion, the exact formula with which to begin <Col N="303" /> and with which to conclude, and he prescribes these formularies in the name of liberty.  It is very unfortunate for the country that he is not a Minister, because then, in his Ministerial utterances, he could set such a fine example to his colleagues that they would be inflamed with the desire to do as he did.  I think this debate is a gross waste of the time of this House and a gross waste of paper which will be necessitated in the printing of the Official Report of this debate, and I believe the time has come for the issue of an order, in the interests of the paper supply, limiting speeches.</P>

      <P>I wonder is Senator Hayes keeping back what he has to say on the second section of his resolution for his reply?  I take it from the movement of his head that he does not intend to do so.  Very well; the motion is then reduced to this:</P>
      <P>That the House is of opinion that Ministerial or Government pronouncements on supplies or other aspects of the present emergency should be made to Dáil Eireann or Seanad Eireann.</P>
      <P>The Senator is sufficiently a master of English, notwithstanding his proficiency in the vernacular, to know that if he says &ldquo;Ministerial or Government pronouncements&rdquo; he is repeating the same thing.  What is a Government pronouncement but a Ministerial pronouncement?  He says it should be made to Dáil Eireann or Seanad Eireann.  He does not say that all pronouncements should be so made, but that a pronouncement upon important aspects of the emergency should be so made.  Who is to decide what is of sufficient importance to necessitate the calling of a meeting of the two Houses?  I think that if the Senator will take time to consider his resolution he will see that it is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>Since this debate has stressed the importance of the fact&mdash;especially at this time&mdash;that we are defending democracy as well as the importance of Parliamentary institutions, I think it has served a very <Col N="304" /> useful purpose.  I agree with Senator Douglas that Parliament should play a more important part than it has been allowed to play, and I think this debate is useful in emphasising that.  I would like to bring to the Minister's attention the very important consequences of Parliament meeting more often even if that causes some inconvenience to the Government and some expense to the nation.  It would have this effect that it would help to do away with a great crop of rumours, which is perhaps one of the greatest dangers that we are exposed to at present.  If we met more frequently, in the quiet atmosphere of this House, I think that a good many of those rumours would be scotched at birth.  By meeting here and seeing our Ministers we would know that they were not negotiating behind our backs and were not in jail or doing the other things that we hear so much of.  Even if it were for nothing else except to see our Ministers, I think Parliament ought to meet more frequently.  On the other hand, if Parliament does meet more frequently and wishes to play the part it is meant to play in democracy, there is a great responsibility on members of the Oireachtas not to take up the time of the House or of Ministers with speeches that would be all very well in the leisured atmosphere of peace, but that are quite out of place in present times when the country has serious problems to face.  No matter on what side of the House we sit we should all be ready to help our Ministers to face up to those problems because they are not the problems of a Party but of a nation.  We should not be fighting old battles at the present time.  There may be a serious battle before us, and hence we should join our forces for that battle.  The tone of the speeches should be as practical as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the suggestion of Senator Campbell that the Minister should consider using Press conferences to a greater extent.  They might serve a useful purpose.  I did not read the alleged interview which the Minister is supposed to have given, but I read the references to it.  For dealing with a matter of that kind, Press conferences might, I think, serve a useful purpose. It is important, as the Minister has <Col N="305" /> said, that the people should know what they have to face.  They are living, as has been stressed repeatedly, in a fool's paradise.  I was coming from Mass one beautiful summer's morning some days after the Taoiseach had delivered a speech to the country, and met a woman on holiday in Salthill who said: &ldquo;I wish he would leave us alone to enjoy our holidays.&rdquo;  It is all very well to enjoy our holidays, but in these days we should all be prepared for every kind of test and should rally our forces for that purpose.  It would be all to the good that the people should know the exact position.  The motion does not say that all the statements made by Ministers should first be made in the Oireachtas.  It does ask that the people should be informed through the Oireachtas.  That, I suppose, would be the normal way of doing it since the people read the Parliamentary debates as far as they are reported.</P>

      <P>Senator Hayes referred to the meetings addressed by the Taoiseach and other Ministers, as well as by officials of the Department of Agriculture, in the food and fuel campaign.  What has struck me very forcibly is that members of what one might call the Opposition Party have not appeared on any of these public platforms to urge the people to grow more food and to cut more fuel, although they have addressed public meetings urging our young people to join the national forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The public meetings with regard to the food and fuel campaign have been called together by the county committees of agriculture or by county commissioners.  They are not political Party meetings.  If the county committees of agriculture have failed to invite the members of the Opposition Party to those meetings, then I say they have failed in a very serious obligation to the country, because at the present time nothing would be better for it than to see the <Col N="306" /> people on the opposite side rise above Party politics and go out, as they have done in the drive for recruits for the national forces, and encourage our people to grow food and cut the amount of fuel the country needs.  If, as Senator Hayes has stated, they have not been invited, then I suggest to the Minister that he should take the matter up with the Department of State concerned, and see that they are invited to future meetings.  If they are invited and do not attend, we can then say that they are not big enough to overcome Party politics.</P>
      <P>If this motion were passed, it would mean that no statement on Government policy could be made by the Taoiseach or any member of the Government except in the Dáil or Seanad.  It really asks the House to confine them in a kind of prison. Surely any statement made by the Taoiseach or members of the Government must be taken as a Ministerial statement.  Last year, or the year before, a rather long period elapsed without any meeting of the Dáil being called, and, because no statements were being issued by Ministers, rumours were circulated to the effect that the reason for their silence was that they were in jail.  I think it is a very good thing that Ministers avail of the Press, the radio, and every other means available to them, to make statements for the information of the people.  I agree with Senator Campbell that, where it is possible, announcements should be made to the Dáil or Seanad, but there are times when, I am sure, none of us would advocate calling the Dáil or Seanad together over some really trifling matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald, as he has done on a number of occasions, has objected to the Taoiseach broadcasting a message to the Irish people in America. This broadcast is relayed with the permission of the Golumbia Broadcasting Station and I assume that American corporation would not arrange to relay the broadcast unless it had the American Government's approval.  I think we might take it for granted that that approval was got before the message was broadcast.  The Senator <Col N="307" /> objects to the Taoiseach speaking to the people in America, but he forgets that the people in America made a very large contribution when this country was making its fight for freedom and the Irish in America are anxious to know how we are getting on here.</P>
    <P>I think some of the statements that were made by Senator Fitzgerald were not very helpful, and they could certainly lead to a lot of trouble with Ministers on the other side of the water.  I should like Senator Hayes to see that members of his Party will throw their whole weight into this campaign that is being carried on.  When addresses are being delivered by various Ministers, if members of Senator Hayes's Party attend there will be no fear that the Ministers will use the meetings for any other purpose except that for which they are definitely called.</P>

But, as Senator Hayes has pointed out, Ministers have one very great advantage over the rest of us; they can be sure of their utterances appearing in full, uncensored and authentic, and, bearing that in mind, I suggest that followers and admirers of the Government should be careful in their criticisms of those who do not have the same advantage. I understand that while I was absent from the House to-day somebody referred to alleged utterances of mine.</P>

I will also say that when a serious order is made affecting the majority of the people of this nation, there should be some statement by way of explanation of it.  Let me take one item discussed here last night, the recent cattle order. Certain people who may be very well up in the cattle trade took advantage of that order.  They discussed the position with people who might not be as well up as they are.  They pointed out the position of the cattle trade last year, when there were no exports.</P>

      <P>In a way I regret this motion should have taken so long. I did not think it would have occupied so much time, but at the same time I think it has done a certain amount of good and has brought out a certain measure of agreement.  The terms of the motion have been criticised.  I admit the second part of the motion is peculiarly defective and the word &ldquo;precede&rdquo; should certainly be &ldquo;accompany&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Senator Goulding, Senator Quirke and others are quite mistaken in thinking that I desire to restrict Ministers' speeches to the Dáil and Seanad.  I know that would be quite impracticable.  I used the word &ldquo;pronouncements&rdquo; advisedly&mdash;pronouncements on supplies or other important aspects of the present emergency. Wherever it is practicable, a statement of policy or a statement on behalf of the Government should be made in either House.  That would have the advantage that such a statement could be elucidated and even questions asked in the Dáil or Seanad in order to make the statement made by the Minister quite clear.  I think the Minister for Supplies will agree with that, both from his experience in Opposition and as a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a feeling abroad that the Dáil spends nearly all its time in a futile wrangle.  That is not so.  It was not even so when Fianna Fáil was fresh in the Dáil and on the rampage, breaking up everything, and the Minister will realise that himself.  Even at the worst fever point in the Dáil, when Fianna Fáil wanted to know about everything, there was some useful work done and the Dáil does <Col N="311" /> spend a great deal of time on matters which do not cause any bitterness at all, but where, across the House, considerable clarification comes of what Ministers mean and, very often, considerable improvement of what Ministers are going to do.  I make that statement now, irrespective of particular Governments in office.  For that reason I think that in the present emergency it would be better for the people if, in the case of an important pronouncement, they heard of it in the setting of a Dáil or Seanad debate, where they would hear the pronouncement, where it could be explained, and where further action could be recommended by the House if it seemed necessary.  I think that would be good not only for Parliament but for the people, for the Government, and for the whole of us, in this particular emergency.  That is the point I wanted to make.</P>
    <P>Now, I think it is quite a mistake to make strong speeches of the kind which Senator O Buachalla said should be actually made for the purpose of shocking the people.  I think it is an outrageous idea to think that Ministers should go around the country endeavouring to shock the people into a realisation of what is happening, because, remember, the more you do that the less you will shock the people, and that is perhaps what is wrong with the Minister for Supplies.  The Minister to-day referred to Bismarck who, he said, divided the races of the world into two classes, the masculine and the feminine, and put the Celts among the feminine races.  Bismarck was, of course, a Teuton.  Now, one of the Celtic qualities was imagination, and in that respect the Minister is peculiarly Celtic.  A Teutonic characteristic was downrightness of strong statement, and in that regard the Minister is peculiarly Teutonic because nobody that I know of has excelled him in making, with apparently all the appearance of absolute sincerity, downright statements which hardly contain a single word of truth.  I often admired his facility in that way when he was in opposition, and he is even more adept since becoming a member of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>And he gets away with it very often, and there is something in it, of course.  Now, to-night he pursued an old device: instead of debating the motion he dealt with the newspapers and what they said about him.  I was not particularly interested in the question of his giving an interview to an English newspaper. What I was doing was something more positive.  He dealt with newspapers and he dealt with supplies.  There has been some talk about relevancy.  The Minister gave us a speech on supplies, and naturally he is full of information and argument about his own position as Minister for Supplies.  He has more arguments than he has supplies, but that is another question.  I made no thesis and I put forward no argument that no statement should be made except in the Dáil or Seanad.  I know that that is not practicable, but if rationing is to come to a particular commodity I think the decision to do so should not be reached by means of the process which is at present being resorted to, where Ministers go down the country and, apparently, think out loud on the public platform and ramble off from point to point, or where they do the same thing in connection with an English newspaper or with any newspaper.  It should be possible to find a more rational scheme to come to a decision, and let the scarcity and the action proposed to be taken, be announced together in the Dáil or Seanad.  The public would then know where they were and would know what hardships might have to be faced.  They would have the united knowledge that suitable steps were being taken about the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our experience, however, has been that we first have comforting statements from Ministers saying that everything is all right, then warnings in the public Press, then statements and denials, and then belated action. Tea is a good example of that.  The Minister said that this time 12 months he was being abused for rationing tea and that now he was being abused for not rationing things.  What happened about tea was this: that at a particular <Col N="313" /> moment&mdash;about June, 1940, I think&mdash; the Minister said that they laid in ample stocks.  Later on he said that there was a fair supply, and then he proceeded to ration tea, and all that happened, so far as those who opposed him are concerned, was that he was asked to reconcile these statements. That is all the fuss there was.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Minister says that there is a great difficulty in preparing the register, because it involves the printing of 3,000,000 ration cards, the mobilisation of supplies of paper, and other difficulties.  Surely, that is an argument for accepting the proposal last March to prepare a register. Surely, the delay and difficulty in doing the job was an argument for accepting the proposal in March rather than beginning it in November.  Then, in December, the United States was in the war and, on the 30th December, we are told that we may have to ration bread.  I do not think the Minister ever told the Dáil that bread would be rationed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another difficulty, but surely it is one that could be got over.  Now, somebody said that Ministers should be encouraged to take the public into their confidence.  I quite agree, but they do not do so. Take as an example the Taoiseach's speech last Monday.  How can anybody say that that was taking the people into his confidence?  All he said was that certain foreign papers were threatening us, but that merely gives the public a disagreeable suspicion of the whole situation, and they have no accurate knowledge by which to judge where they are going. However, what I feel is that it would <Col N="314" /> be much better that we should have these matters debated in Parliament where it is possible and where steps could be taken when a statement has been made, rather than that there should be a long interval between the shock, as Senator O Buachalla would say, and the taking of the action.  I do not think Senator Quirke is as innocent as he sounds.</P>

      <P>On the motion which was adjourned last night, I take the same view as Senator Baxter, but I approach it on rather different lines.  My approach is this: that on the figures which have been made available by the Department, and from the Minister's own pronouncements, the acreage which has been asked for is too low and the barrelage which it is expected will be produced by the farmers is infinitely lower than will be obtained and, as a result, the provision of food for the next year is definitely inadequate. There is also the probability of not being able to import some 80,000 tons of wheat which we still require for bread.  Now, from the Minister's figures in the Dáil we get two things fairly clearly, and that is that we want 370,000 tons of wheat, and that this implies 600,000 acres at seven barrels to the acre.  No figures at all have been given as regards what supplies are available for animal feeding outside of oats, which is not a substitute for maize or wheat and their offals, and no provision has been made for seed.  In fact, the question has been handled in a very slip-shod way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me almost incredible that we, in a purely agricultural country <Col N="316" /> with a small population, should be considering even for a moment the possibility of a partial starvation of our people, that Ministers should be speaking in the country and that the Press should be sending out S.O.S. messages on the growing of wheat, and that we farming representatives in the Seanad and in the Dáil should be urging the Government to make provision for those people in the country who cannot grow it for themselves.  I greatly regret the absence of the Minister from a debate of such very great importance. Yesterday he intervened early in the debate with what I would call a superficial and unconvincing speech on a question of such great importance to us all.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Baxter that the main factor in further production is price.  The farmer, any more than any other business man, will not produce at a disadvantage, and I say that the present price, on the costings which are available for different types of land, is inadequate when the barrelage falls below a certain point.  The whole crux of this question is the interrelation between price and production.  The farmer who, before the tillage scheme, had a different economy on his farm, worked on other lines because it suited his market, it suited his pocket and it suited his land better than tillage; otherwise he would have tilled.  When he changed his economy, he suffered several very important consequential losses.  In the first place, he had to take his best land, where up to that he had been rearing stores and fattening cattle.  He suffered another great loss, the loss of his oat straw, which is 200 per cent. better than wheat straw for feeding; in fact, very few people use wheat straw at all if they can help it.  Over and above that, he suffered the loss of the hay consequent on the increase of tillage, with the exception of those portions of his land which were under first and second grass seeds.  Add all those together, and you will find that the consequential losses were very considerable.</P>
    <P>Again, he suffered from the exhaustion of his land through tillage when farmyard manure&mdash;which never goes far enough on anybody's farm&mdash;<Col N="317" /> and an adequate amount of artificial manures were absent.  I will not develop any of the minor consequential losses, but I think all those disabilities should be added up when you assess a price which will not only pay the farmer for growing wheat for the nation but will leave him a reasonable profit to keep his own family and pay his way.  If the price were right, there is no doubt at all that you would not only get without difficulty the 80,000 tons of which we are apparently short, but also the quantity necessary for providing the animal food which we have been importing from other countries on account of the price being lower than that at which we could grow it here.  The standstill order to the malting industry came as no surprise.  On top of that, we had this warning, which we now know is only a temporary one, with regard to the exportation of stores; we were urged to push them out on account of the shortage of feeding stuffs.  That in itself points to a great want of prevision in the last two years.</P>
    <P>As to costings, the Minister in his quick speech here chided Senator Baxter for not producing any figures. A good many of us are to speak to-night, and I think before we have done the Minister will have got all the figures he wants from various farmers on different types of land all over the country.  In spite of what the Minister told the Dáil&mdash;it will be found in the Dáil report of 10th December&mdash;to the effect that he had no costing figures whatever with regard to wheat, I think there would have been very little difficulty in getting the average cost of production if his Department had only followed the scheme which other countries have followed for years past. I may say that the science of keeping agricultural costings, accurate down to decimals, is a thing of very long standing. In our case, the cost will vary on farms in different parts of the country, but it is a figure which can be arrived at without any serious difficulty by people who are experienced in accounts.  Take a group of farms from the Statistical Abstract.  You have every type, and I see absolutely no difficulty in being able to tell a farmer <Col N="318" /> in any part of the country what it is going to cost him to grow wheat.  Then he knows that if he gets a certain number of barrels he will make a profit, but that if it goes below that number of barrels he will make a loss. He can make his calculations accordingly, and if he has to incur a loss the price must be raised to compensate him.  Without figures, the Minister cannot say whether or not it is going to pay the farmer to grow wheat at 45/-, and it amazes me that any Minister should have stood up in the other House or in this House and not be taken to task for suggesting, in an agricultural country, like this, that he had no costings of any kind.  He knows no more to-day whether 45/- is the right figure than he did some years ago.</P>
    <P>When the Tillage Order originally came before this House, Senator Baxter and I criticised the principles on which it was based.  The Minister admitted since then in the other House that he had no figures whatever.  His answers to questions on that subject will be found in volume 78 of the proceedings of Dáil Eireann, page 580. To every question with regard to whether he had made any inquiries as to what the tillage scheme was going to mean in the shape of acreage or in the shape of capital expended by the farmer, the answer was &ldquo;no&rdquo;&mdash;a straight &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is no satisfaction to either of us that the results have proved us to be correct.  But I think it is right to record the fact that the advice we offered was disregarded.  I think the fact that this whole business was taken on in a slipshod manner is a matter which should be recorded.</P>
    <P>Still it is somewhat difficult to know where we stand in this matter.  Yesterday, and in the Dáil on the 10th December, the Minister stated that he had no figures to give&mdash;that figures could not be got.  But on the 18th April, 1928, he put his hand to an exhaustive Minority Report of the Economic Commission on this very same subject.  In that report he told us that, after sowing on manured and cleaned land under the best possible <Col N="319" /> conditions, and after using artificials, which everybody cannot get to-day&mdash; there is not a scrap of lime to be got by anybody in my county&mdash;the net amount of wheat suitable and available for milling purposes, that is, after deducting seed and small corn, was 16 cwt., or 6.4 barrels per acre.  To-day there is an average of seven barrels given and last year eight barrels.  That cannot be the case.</P>
    <P>There is this point about that, and it is a very big one: if, instead of the seven barrels which the Minister is reckoning on at present, it should be 6.4 barrels, as it was under his signature then, the 600,000 acres which he is asking for in order to provide the necessary bread for the people will be short by a minimum of 65,000 acres.  It is a very clear and simple mathematical point and I hope the House will realise it.  That figure does not take into account the fact that a great deal of land, which Griffiths would not have looked at for growing wheat, has perforce been taken into cultivation by people who hoped to make it pay and since then have found it would not pay. I know one farmer who for three years running has had to plough up his winter wheat.</P>
    <P>Then we have another point, and this is the acid test to my mind.  A big wheat experiment was undertaken by the Department of Agriculture in the year 1925-26.  It was called a Large-Scale Wheat Experiment.  This again gives us further proof that you will not throughout the country get a production of seven barrels to the acre.  The evidence of the Department before the Tariff Commission mentioned an average yield of nine barrels of dressed wheat from 197 centres, which they stated were &ldquo;above the average in fertility.&rdquo; They were provided with manures and good seed and the whole process of growing the wheat was supervised and nursed by the agricultural instructors.  What was the result?  An average of nine barrels to the acre from 197 centres.  I will say that some centres produced as much as 17 barrels but others produced less than three.  Of course the 17 barrels were few and far between.  But there <Col N="320" /> was one important point, that 92 centres outside those, that is one-third of the whole experiment, were not weighed at all for various reasons.  All of these were also &ldquo;above the average in fertility&rdquo;; they were nursed in the same way and provided with the same seeds and manure; but for various reasons they were not weighed.</P>
    <P>Those various reasons, in my opinion, are going to make themselves more and more evident as time goes on and more wheat is grown on the only land which is available, with a continuous reduction of artificial manures and the spreading of what farmyard manure we have over a larger area.  When 92 centres, or one-third of those centres were not weighed, it is obvious that the average given for the remainder of the experiment of nine barrels is going to be reduced right down to six, or even less than that, and I for one cannot accept either seven or six and a half barrels throughout the country under present conditions.</P>
    <P>Averages are a rough-and-ready guide, but they are apt to be misleading and in this case particularly so. The acid test is the price an article makes in the market.  In ordinary times it is only possible to grow wheat at a profit on very good land, but as the price increased so did the acreage expand.  People began to extend their experiments to see whether they could not grow it on other land.  But we have now reached the position in this country where such land as can be spared from other parts of our economy and on which wheat can be grown at a profit is not sufficient for our present needs.  From now on, if you want to make up the balance, you will have to use land which is not such as a farmer would normally put under wheat.</P>
    <P>It has been said before now that there is a prejudice against growing wheat.  That is not the case at all.  It is only a question of having the proper land to do it.  It follows, therefore, that if you want to persuade people to grow wheat on land which is not really suitable to produce wheat at the profit which a farmer should have, then you have to put up the price to <Col N="321" /> make that profit.  I am not trying to help the bigger farmers because, even with their rents and rates, their produce is so big that they will make an excellent profit out of it.  But, if you want to increase the acreage, you have to make it attractive to the men who are farming on the light land and poor land and the small farm.  We want to persuade the man who gets a small return to grow.</P>
    <P>The Minority Report gave costings which showed a profit, but they very airily ignored rent and rates and a great proportion of the labour costs on the farm.  They did not put in any costings as regards family labour at all, and they showed a profit.</P>
    <P>The figures I propose to give you now are for a farm of lightish land, without taking account of all those consequential costs which I have suggested to you already and without taking account of any insurance against risks such as those I have referred to.  In this particular case the costings were £14 4s.  At seven barrels to the acre, allowing for 2 cwt. of small corn and for the wheat straw at not more than 6d. &mdash;in fact, in most places there is no market for it at all, unless you happen to be near a town&mdash;a man makes a profit of £3 6s.  At six barrels to the acre he makes a profit of £2 17s. and at five and a half barrels to the acre&mdash; which is the figure I think correct&mdash; he makes a loss of £1 2s.</P>
    <P>How does that compare with what the Minority Report originally suggested that a farmer should get from feeding an ordinary bullock or producing milk?  In the case of bullock feeding, they gave a figure of £5 12s. 5d., and in the case of milk, £5 19s. 0d.  All that is under the Minister's signature in an official publication to-day.  The Minister has made some other statements&mdash;one of them was that soil exhaustion from wheat growing is a thing which is greatly over-estimated.  I am quoting from a publication which everyone knows.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Wheat can, in fact, be grown continuously on the same soil, without any intervening crop and without <Col N="322" /> manure of any description for half a century or more, if need be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, nobody will contend that that method is economic, and it can only be done in practice as an interesting experiment.  It is obviously undesirable that the Minister should broadcast statements of this kind to the country, and to the effect that there is no soil exhaustion from growing wheat, particularly in the present circumstances, when we all know that the average farmer may not be able to pay for the artificials, if he can get them at all.  Probably what was in the Minister's mind when he made the statement was the classic example&mdash; which a great many of us know&mdash;of the Broadbank field at Rothampstead where wheat has been grown on the same field continuously for the last 70 years; but if he has that in mind he should have added to his statement that, in that particular case, not only has the yield fallen to microscopic proportions, but the greatest difficulty in maintaining the experiment is the battle against the weeds, which have grown so that you can hardly see the corn at all.</P>
    <P>We agree that the best way to grow wheat is following a well-manured root crop.  The main use of a root crop today&mdash;I am not including potatoes&mdash;is the cleaning of the land for the cereal crop, and that cleaning is done at an additional cost.  If you add the work of cleaning, manure and labour, it is a very considerable loss, and if you have any system of cost accounting to show the farmer what he is really going to get out of growing an acre of wheat, that cleaning process in a four-year rotation should be taken into account, and a definite amount of expenses added on account of it.  If you intend to give the farmer a fair deal, you must allow for the consequential cost, and finally&mdash;what nobody has even suggested&mdash;you must give him a fair trading risk and say just what he will get on the minimum average which land will produce.  You must remember that the farmer is not always growing wheat on well-manured and beautifully clean land.  He is often ploughing up old pasture, which takes a very long time and great expense to restore, and <Col N="323" /> he is releasing the pent-up fertility of the land in so doing, and the expense of restoring it will be very considerable. The wise farmer knows this, and before he decides to tackle that he thinks twice, and the Minister should think twice and provide him with reasonable compensation.  It really amounts to using up his capital to get a return in the first two or three years which is immediately dissipated when the emergency is over and he has to lay it down again.</P>
    <P>I think there is a very sound case, as some of the other speakers will show, for an increase in price.  We have to get this wheat which is absolutely essential to the country, and we would be very wise to put this question of importation out of our minds entirely, and try to grow what we can in our own country, releasing shipping for other purposes, and making ourselves secure on the lines of the self-sufficiency which has been preached for many years past.</P>
    <P>At the price which has been suggested, I think that the farmer can make a fair profit, and I suggest that every farmer should be asked to grow a proportion of wheat in his tillage and to contract, with reasonable safeguards&mdash;I will not develop them now&mdash; against the failure of his crop through circumstances which are not under his control.  At the end of the season, he should deliver to the Government or the miller at the rate of five barrels&mdash; I am conservative on this question, but not very&mdash;of millable wheat and let him then, if he grows more, sell to the Government if he wishes or keep it and use it for his stock.  If you get an acreage which will produce our human food on that basis, you will incidentally get a very large amount of the animal food and the seed, for which no provision has been made.  The farmer should be paid at the rate of 50/- a barrel and he should get cartage and the loan of sacks, and last, but not least, he should have his contract over a period of four years.</P>
    <P>Now, my friend Senator Sir John Keane, who invariably criticises any suggestion I make&mdash;more or less on principle, sometimes without any <Col N="324" /> guiding principle, and generally in an unprincipled way&mdash;will, I feel perfectly sure, say that no Government could stand over a contract like that, but I ask the House what business firm in this country would undertake to alter its economy, put in new machinery and start a new industry for the country without, at any rate, some assurance of a degree of permanency. I am only asking for four years.  Possibly, Senator Keane may add that no capital is required for this operation of growing wheat, that the farmer has only got to borrow a spade from his neighbour and start.  I do not quite agree with that.  As regards how to get this wheat grown, it was suggested that farmers should be compelled to sow wheat, but I prefer to appeal to them in the way the Minister and the Government have done.  I suggest that, as in England, a scheme of this kind should be decentralised to the agricultural committees of the county councils.  Their co-operation should be asked and a certain definite quota of land to be put under wheat should be allotted to each of them.  I think that much of the apathy in this and a lot of other matters of national life arises from the fact that these local authorities are not consulted or brought into co-operation by the Government.  In fact, most local bodies regard Dublin as the centre of everything, and the place from which they get refusals of everything they want and a stream of sealed orders.  I believe that, if the agricultural committees were used, you would get the co-operation of the very best farming element, people who are 100 per cent. closer to the growers of wheat than anybody in a Dublin office can possibly be.  These people have other preoccupations and their perspective extends only across Merrion Square. You have set up these local authorities and you have given them authority in many other ways as a necessary complement to the central administration. Now is the time to use them to the full. If they fail, I shall throw my hands up, but I am perfectly certain that if their co-operation is sought they will not fail you.</P>
    <P>Those who read An Taoiseach's broadcast at the end of last year and <Col N="325" /> followed it up by reading the British Prime Minister's address to the Congress of the U.S.A. must begin to realise the difficulties which we will have to contend with in the near future.  They should realise that the time for undignified haggling with the farmer is past.  I was told by a very important person in this country a few hours ago that this was the most important matter before the country to-day, that it was worth paying anything up to 90/- to make absolutely certain that under no circumstances would the people go short of food.  I am not going as far as that.  I am convinced that, by a proper scheme, you will get the proper results.  This haggling has been the more undignified because the farmer is the biggest employer of labour in this country and the only real producer of wealth on a large scale. As a result, he pays for everything.  It is on the welfare of the farmer that the weal of everybody else depends. Though I may be fighting the battle of the farmer, I am also fighting the battle of those for whom he is paying, and I feel that it is very important that all of us should take responsibility for seeing that he gets the fruits of his labours now and security in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion but my support is qualified.  The farmers have, I think, justified this proposed increase of price from 45/- to 50/- a barrel.  I want to mention, in this connection, the almost forgotten men in agriculture&mdash;the agricultural <Col N="326" /> labourers, of whom there are a great number in this country.  Fortunately, there are more now than ever there were and, apparently, there will be greater need still for trained agricultural labourers.  In that connection, there is very considerable opposition from across the Channel, where they are very anxious to get our skilled labourers.  If I read the signs of the times aright, there is a movement to help a number of our agricultural labourers to get out of the country. That is an aspect of the situation of which serious notice must be taken.</P>
      <P>Under the Wages Board regulation, a Grade I agricultural labourer receives the munificent wage of 30/- a week, on which he is expected to rear a family and lead a Christian life.  In Grade II, the agricultural labourer is paid 31/6 and, in Grade III, which covers the area around the City of Dublin, he is paid 36/- a week.  In these figures is to be found my main reason for supporting this motion.  I believe, with Goldsmith, that the farming community ought to be helped and ought to be assured of a reasonable standard of living.</P>
      <P>When I talk about the farming community, I include, of course, the agricultural labourers.  My main purpose in rising was to call attention to the position of these people.  Under present conditions, they have a very miserable existence.  It has been said that farmers are better off than the people of the cities but the position has been the other way round.  By comparison, city people were much better off than the farming community.  The future of this country depends more than ever on the farmers.  We have to realise that and provide a reward for them commensurate with their efforts. If that is to be done by raising the price of wheat, provided all engaged in agricultural pursuits share in the benefit, it will have the wholehearted support of the people I represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to impress on those who are advocating the interests of the farmers that the labourers must be taken into account in whatever increase is given in the price of wheat&mdash;and the farmers must get an increase in the price per <Col N="327" /> barrel.  As I have said, there are agents here who are trying to induce our agricultural labourers to migrate. If you compare the minimum wage of 36/- per week here with the minimum of £3 which such labourers have across the water, you will see that there is a very big inducement to our labourers to migrate.  On top of that, there are very large bonuses and grants for these people.  We have got to counteract that in some way and the best way is to provide a reasonable standard rate. It will be argued that the farmers are paying more than the minimum rate already.  If they are, the raising of the minimum rate will not affect them at all but it will give the agricultural labourer a legal standing in their claim for a higher wage.  I do not think anyone in this House will contend that the present minimum rates for farm labourers are sufficient to maintain a man in a reasonable standard of comfort. The marvel is how these labourers can possibly exist on such a wage.  If the farmers are going to get benefits&mdash;and I hope they will&mdash;in the immediate future, the least they might do is to share some of these benefits with the agricultural labourers.</P>
    <P>I want to say further that I am not at all in favour of the amendment.  If compulsion were an effective method to secure anything, we would not be meeting in this House to-day.  I am not in favour of compulsion unless it can be shown that the farmers are neglecting their duties and up to now that has not been shown.  I believe that, given reasonable encouragement, they will engage in an all-in effort to produce all the wheat they can on land that is capable of producing it.  I say: give this increased price to the farmers provided they, in turn, share it with their labourers.  The increase can only be given by means of a subsidy.  It must be done by means of a subsidy because the Government have taken steps to ensure that the purchasing power of town workers cannot be increased.</P>
    <P>Any attempt, therefore, to increase the price of bread to the industrial workers will lead to disaster or, alternatively, to the doing away with the infamous Emergency Order (No. 83).  As I say, I support the motion with the <Col N="328" /> qualification that the minimum rates of wages be immediately tackled to give them an upward trend.</P>

      <P>Before I enter into the discussion on the motion itself, I should like to say that with the possibility, in fact the probability, of this debate being carried on past 9 o'clock and of its then being postponed until a future date, in the interests of the country it should go out from this House that we are all agreed, and that it is definitely understood, that we are discussing in this motion, not the price of the present crop, but the price of next year's crop.  If there were any confusion on that issue it might result in the holding over of still greater supplies of wheat.  I think Senator Baxter will agree with that suggestion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but the trend of the discussion seemed to take another line.  So long as that is clearly understood, the matter will be all right.  With regard to the motion itself and the amendment, I feel more or less like the last speaker, Senator Foran, in so far as I am somewhat confused.  I think it was quite obvious from Senator Foran's statement that he also was confused. First of all, we have the motion from Senator Baxter that in the opinion of the Seanad it is an urgent national necessity that the Government should increase the minimum price of the 1942 wheat crop to 50/- per barrel and should make an immediate announcement to that effect.  As a farmer, as a member of a county committee of agriculture, and as a man who has grown wheat for years and who still grows it, naturally I should be the last in the world, and I would be the last, to object to the farmers getting a remunerative price for wheat.  But as far as I have heard in this debate or in any other debate on the subject it has not been proved that the present price offered, 45/- a barrel, is not a remunerative price.  That is not the argument which has been put up. Various other arguments have been put up but that argument has not been put forward and substantiated.  If I were <Col N="329" /> to be satisfied or if we had a statement from the Minister that it was possible to make the price 50/- a barrel without increasing the price of the loaf to the consumer it would be a different matter altogether, but Senator Foran, I am afraid, is like a man who wants to have his loaf and eat it.  He would like to increase the price and, of course, not bother where the increased money was to come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>He will not eat the loaf if he has not got it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  In his speech Senator Baxter was, to my mind, quite inconsistent.  First of all he said that there was no reason why we should not be able to provide food for the people of this country and that if we were not able to supply that food it would be because of limitations which we imposed on ourselves.  I cannot see that at all.  I cannot see that any limitations have been imposed which have prevented production of wheat.  I think every encouragement has been given for the production of wheat, and if Senator Baxter claims as a limitation which has prevented the provision of food for the people of this country the price which has been offered by the Government then I would ask Senator Baxter what limitation, if any, would he impose or does he say the sky is the limit?</P>
      <P>As he went along in the debate he said&mdash;and said foolishly to my mind, from his own point of view&mdash;that 60/- a barrel would be quite unreasonable. Of course, I think that 60/- would be quite unreasonable at the present time, but if I were in Senator Baxter's position I would look forward to the time when, perhaps, yields would be lower and costs of production higher, when the value of the pound might be lower, when it might be necessary for Senator Baxter or somebody else representing the Opposition to put it up to the Government that 60/- was a reasonable price.  If we were to go on that scale there is no limit to where we would get.</P>

    <Col N="330" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I know we are dealing with the 1942 crop but I am quite satisfied that this is not a matter of price. In fact, I think price has very little to do with it.  I refuse to believe that the patriotism of the farmers of this country can be bought for 5/- a barrel on the price of wheat or 10/- or 15/- a barrel.  I believe, as other speakers have said, that there is a certain number, a small percentage, of the farmers of this country, who have a decided objection to growing wheat.  Some of them, perhaps, have an objection to growing wheat for political reasons. They would be a very small percentage. I am not going to suggest for one moment that the growing of wheat has been confined to people who have in the past been Government supporters. That is not so.  If that were so we would not have got the supply of wheat we have at the present time.  For instance, Senator McGee, who has been a supporter of the Party now in opposition for a number of years, did not allow his political affiliations to prevent him from growing wheat.  I say, all credit to Senator McGee, and if we had a few more men like him in the country we would be in a much better position than we are in to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the price, I cannot see how Senator McGee can stand up and support Senator Baxter in this motion which indicates that 45/- a barrel is not a sufficient price.  Senator Baxter in his speech is not dealing with the people who let their land in conacre, or he does not pose as a spokesman of the people who let their land in conacre.  He poses as the spokesman of the regular, honest-to-God farmer who tills his own land, sows his crop and threshes it and sells it.  If Senator McGee were in agreement with him, I cannot see how Senator McGee could go out all over the country, buy land in conacre and pay £5 and £6, and I am not sure if he did not pay more than that, per acre for that land and still make a profit.  Therefore, in my opinion, some other argument should have been put up rather than the argument that the wheat cannot be produced at that price.  Senator Baxter, further on in his speech, resented the suggestion that farmers were holding their wheat.  In <Col N="331" /> fact, he said that farmers were not holding their wheat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they are either.  That is, I do not think farmers are holding their wheat to any great extent.  I think a small percentage of farmers are holding their wheat and holding their oats the same as they held it every other year.  Some farmers have a habit of threshing late in the year and, because of shortage of coal, they have been putting it off a little bit longer this year than other years.  In addition to that, a certain number of farmers, because things were a little bit more plentiful, have held over more of their wheat than they would have held over in an ordinary year.  In addition to that again, there are some farmers who, because of the price fixed for seed wheat, have said to themselves: &ldquo;We have the wheat threshed and we may not need all that seed, but, if there is any left over we may sell it to our neighbours and even if we cannot sell it for seed we can get the extra shilling for it.  We can get 41/- a barrel.&rdquo;  That would account for a certain amount of the wheat being withheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further on in his speech though, Senator Baxter apparently departed from the conviction that farmers were not holding their wheat, and he said the reason why they were holding their wheat was that the price was not adequate.  I think I am right in making that statement.  If I am not right I am open to correction.  Senator Baxter cannot have it both ways. What I am afraid of is that this motion, instead of having a good effect, and instead of having the effect of getting people to go more seriously into the production of wheat, might have quite the opposite effect.  It might have the effect of bringing farmers around to the line of thought: &ldquo;Well, those people in the Seanad probably know what they are talking about, and if they are convinced that wheat cannot be grown at this price and that it is not an economic proposition maybe we, who do not keep any accounts, are not right and maybe we <Col N="332" /> had better grow something else&rdquo;.  I hope that will not be the effect of it, but I think there is that danger, and I think Senator Baxter will have to agree that there is that danger.  He went on to paint a very gloomy picture for us, and, in fact, he holds out no hope whatever that sufficient wheat will be got to carry us over the coming year, and he says there is a serious danger of a shortage.</P>

      <P>I have as much experience as Senator Baxter or anybody else, and I put this also to Senator McGee, whose name is attached to the motion: the family who can handle four acres of a grain crop of any description can, with very little effort, handle seven acres.  It is just a matter of working perhaps a half-hour longer in the day.  There may be a big difference between handling 400 and 700 acres, but when Senator Baxter addresses himself to the average small farmer, the man upon whom we have all to fall back in the long run, I say that he is taking a wrong line in this matter, if his policy is to have production here, and I give him credit for saving that is his policy.</P>
      <P>He went on to tell us the reasons for the failure to get the estimated yield from the crop.  He searched, everywhere for the reason, ignoring the very obvious reason.  The principal reason, in my opinion, for it is that we got a couple of bad weeks in spring last year which seriously affected the wheat crop, and, as a result of these couple of weeks of bad weather and east wind, the progress of the crop was retarded, and, except where there were reasonably good conditions, the crop was very seriously damaged.  That is the chief reason and there is no use in trying to attribute it to any other cause.  He went on then to find fault with the Minister and the Department and said that their statistics were all wrong.</P>

      <P>The calculations of the Department were all wrong, when they calculated on the basis of 400,000 or 500,000 acres, but Senator Baxter's calculations in respect of his own acreage &mdash; I do not know what it was, but let us say it was 20 acres &mdash; were all wrong.  In respect of his own field, which was under his eyes every day, he could not give accurate figures of the yield, and he they expects the people in the statistics branch of the Department to be 100 per cent. accurate in their calculations in respect of the whole country.  The only basis on which they could work is the average yield over a number of years, and the average yield was eight barrels per acre.</P>
      <P>The Department, to be conservative, estimated on the basis of seven barrels and because they were a little over the mark, they must now be brought to book.  I think that quite unreasonable. The greatest possible credit is, I think, due to the officers of the Department, to the Minister and to everybody who had anything to do with it for the results they got under very trying conditions. It is only right also that we should pay a tribute to the farmers who, many of them with no experience in the growing of wheat and very few facilities, put their shoulders to the wheel like men when called on in this crisis, and produced the crop, and that rather than throw cold water on their efforts &mdash; and that is what it amounts to &mdash; we should encourage them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> Senator Baxter could not give a decided answer on that question.  I promise the Senator that I shall try to get in touch with him on the phone and reassure him as to Senator Baxter's position, having consulted his colleagues in the matter, and I am sure he will sleep easily then.  It is unfortunate that the members of the Opposition will not agree on something and will not have an agreed policy.  I am prepared to give credit to Mr. Cosgrave for the stand he took at a recent meeting of the Shorthorn Breeders' Association at which he spoke on farming generally and on the production of wheat, and I am prepared to take the advice he gave on that occasion.  He said he hoped that in any questions that might arise in the future, the farmers would not be used by any political Party.  I am not suggesting that Senator Foran was inclined to use the agricultural workers for his own political ends, and I do not propose to go further into that matter. If Senator Baxter feels that he might be misinterpreted with regard to it, it is his own business.</P>
    <P>As to the amendment, I cannot see that it is any improvement, and in fact the motion would be better without the amendment.  The amendment certainly would be better without the motion, so that the result, whatever it may be, will definitely be worse than if we adopted either the course suggested by Senator Baxter or the course suggested by Senator Byrne.  Senator Byrne's idea is that we cannot get the required acreage except by compulsion.  I am very doubtful about that and I should hate to believe that that was so.  I believe we can get it, and I believe it would be much better if we could get it by voluntary methods rather than by the methods suggested by Senator Byrne or Senator Baxter.  Senator Byrne said that a price of 50/- per barrel will not get us the wheat and went on to suggest that the alternative method of getting it is by insistence on a certain acreage under wheat on every farm.</P>
    <P>I may eventually be forced to vote for the amendment, but, before we go any further, I want to point out that the amendment is scarcely workable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> Let us take a farm in South Mayo, or in Donegal &mdash; or even in County Tipperary or Cavan &mdash; and let us go into a backward mountain farm there.  Can we vest some official with the duty of saying that Pat Murphy &mdash; he is very popular at present &mdash; must till so many acres, and that, of that acreage, so much must be wheat, without knowing whether his farm is capable of producing wheat or not?  That cannot be done.  I go further and say that, even if it could be done, it would still be a bad line to follow: It will mean having a re-survey and doing many things which would really retard rather than speed the growing of wheat.</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared to admit, for the purposes of this discussion, that Senator Baxter, Senator McGee and Senator Byrne were all sincere when they started our with their motions and amendments, and believed they were going to contribute something to the national wheat drive.  I am also quite convinced that the Minister for Agriculture is very sincere, and was very sincere in the statements he made here last night, but I am more convinced, and have been for a long time, that in certain circumstances neither the motion to increase the price even to what Senator Baxter is prepared to admit is his limit &mdash; 60/- a barrel &mdash; nor action on the part of the Government to turn our half a dozen Emergency Powers Orders insisting that a certain percentage of every half-acre of land should be put under wheat, would to effective.  That is the point that I want to stress here to-night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <P>I hope to be able to convince.  Senator Baxter that even if he were to put his limit at 120/- a barrel that, in certain circumstances, the wheat could not be got, and the circumstances which I am going to suggest would affect the growing of wheat is a complete stoppage of tractor fuel. I would like to strike a warning note here to-night, and it is this: we can talk as long as we like and produce all the statistics we like, but if there is a complete stoppage of tractor fuel in the coming spring or in the coming <Col N="337" /> harvest, we are living in a fool's paradise if we think that we are not going to face starvation here.  I have been preaching for a long time the policy of back to the horse.  I think that several Senators thought, to put it mildly, that in doing so I had a screw loose somewhere. We are facing a situation at the present time in which I think it is quite on the cards that we may not have sufficient tractor fuel even to put in the crop for the coming year.  I hope we will, and I think we will, but, at the same time, I think the man who believes that there is no danger of a shortage of it in the coming harvest is not sticking anyway closely to the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>We may sow more than we can reap, and we may not be able to sow as much as we can eat, which is a far more serious matter.  If Senator Baxter will bear with me for a few minutes I may convince him&mdash; not the Senator alone but, between us if he agrees with me we may convince the country and the Government &mdash; that certain steps can be taken which will ensure that we can not only reap as much as we sow but reap as much as we can eat.  If, as I have said, we have a complete stoppage of tractor fuel we will find ourselves in a terrible position. I want to make it quite clear that I have no grievance whatever against the tractor.  I have hired and used tractors when I needed a job done quickly.  I will be very willing to hire a tractor in the coming year if it is advisable, but what I want to point out is this: that the one-unit farmer to-day who finds himself dependent on a tractor and with no horses is not quite so sure of himself as he was a year ago.  If he considers his position he will say to himself: &ldquo;Well, after all, I am a bit of a gambler.&rdquo;  Now while we cannot, and nobody should dictate to the individual farmer, I say that we cannot afford to be a country of gamblers.  We cannot afford to gamble as to whether or not we are going to be able to sow or to reap or to thresh our wheat crop.  The argument will be, and has been, put up that we have no alternative: that the horses are not <Col N="338" /> in the country.  I say they are.  We have practically as many in the country to-day as we had on the average over the past 25 years.  If the average were taken a year, a year and a half or two years ago, it would be found to be down something like 10,000 horses, but there has been no drastic alteration in the number of horses in the country over the past 25 years.  In 1940 we had something like 458,000 horses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we have one anyway, and as long as we have one we may possibly continue the breed.  If we cannot breed asses we can breed a few jennets.  We have the horses, so we will be all right.  Senator Johnston can make his mind quite easy on that.  If we want to breed mules we must change around the other way.  In 1924 we had 459,827 horses.  I am merely giving those figures to convince the House that it is still possible to ensure against a complete stoppage of our agricultural work.  Somebody may say that the horses we have are not suitable for tillage.  There may be a good deal in that argument, but my answer is that if you have not an overcoat you may be very glad to have an umbrella, and if you have not the typical draught horse you may be very glad to have the next best thing.  I am certain that if we were to take the opinions of members of the House as to the right type of horse to work on the land we would get at least a dozen different suggestions.  Senator Baxter and people in his part of the country would probably say that the hairy-legged horse was the most suitable, and you might have Senator McGee, Senator O'Dwyer and Senator Kehoe urging the claims of the clean-legged horse.  Experience, at any rate, has shown that in the tillage counties the clean-legged horse, or if you like to call him the half-bred horse, is capable of doing the work and has done it for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The old mares that produced the best horses in this country were really the old Irish type of horse or, as some people call them, the Irish draught. Whatever description you give him, he is the typical half-bred horse.  In view <Col N="339" /> of the serious problem which is facing us, if we went seriously about it we could give the horses we have some kind of training, and if we put them into work the work will be done.  The situation, however, is far more serious than that because certain counties have gone practically completely over to mechanical transport.  Unfortunately, that is the position.  I know that in four or five counties a stoppage of fuel oil for mechanical transport would spell disaster.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If there is a complete stoppage of fuel oil, it will apply to the lorries on the roads as well as to the tractors doing agricultural work. It will apply to everything.  The reason why I want to stress the importance of getting back to the horse is that we appear to be following the hands of the proverbial clock for a long time, and I would like to know where it has been leading us.  The position is so serious that, in some counties, the horse has been completely pushed out.  In those counties it will need a complete revolution to get back to the horse.  Somebody will say: &ldquo;Give the farmers facilities to buy horses, or give them horses for nothing.&rdquo;  Even if we gave them horses for nothing, what is going to happen?  The position is really alarming and the peculiar thing is that in the counties where you think all the horses are, there are practically no horses by comparison.  I have taken some figures, at random for the year 1940.  In that year, if you were to ask anybody what Kildare was noted for, the reply would be &ldquo;horses.&rdquo;  The number of horses in agricultural work in that county in 1940 was 6,784, in Tipperary the number was 23,896 and in Wexford the number was 17,606.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>But Kildare is a much smaller county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of growing wheat, Kildare is a very important county.  In Westmeath the <Col N="340" /> number of horses was 7,482.  If a complete stoppage comes it will be up to the Department of Agriculture or some such body &mdash; no individual could handle it &mdash; to see that horses are provided for those counties where the tractor will be put out of business.  I have no objection to tractors; in fact, I think the tractor has saved our lives so far and it will be a God-send to us if we can keep them going this year.  But I shudder to think what might happen if we cannot keep them going.</P>
      <P>In connection with horses, you have to consider such things as the men to follow the horses, the ploughs and the harness.  All these things will arise, and I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture to take necessary steps now to ensure that horses are distributed more liberally over the country and that, as far as possible, necessary equipment will be provided so that the horses can be put to work.  It would be possible, given experienced men, to use the tractor implements by increasing the size of the horse team, but I realise that that is a difficult proposition.  Practically any type of horse will do the work, if we are put to the pin of our collar.  I appeal to all Senators to throw their weight into this policy of getting back as quickly as possible to the horse. The only sure way of guaranteeing that next year's wheat crop will be sown and harvested is by doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I have listened with great interest and much appreciation to the very vigorous speech which Senator Quirke has made, in the course of which he gave us a vigorous defence of Government policy with regard to wheat and a vigorous advocacy of the claims of the horse.  With the second part of his speech I must confess I have a certain sympathy.  But a defence so vigorous seems to call for an indictment of some kind.  I think, generally speaking, the indictment should precede the defence. In this case I feel inclined to supply the deficiency by making a few remarks which may sound rather like an indictment of something or other, but I am not at all sure what it is I would like to indict, whether it be Government policy with regard to wheat and <Col N="341" /> other agricultural matters in the last ten years, or the perennial cussedness and lack of adaptability of the Irish farmer, or whether it be the notorious failure of me and the likes of me to educate my fellow-countrymen in the way of economic wisdom.  In fact, I feel inclined to take upon myself and the likes of me &mdash; in which I may include my colleague, Senator O Budchalla&mdash; full responsibility for failing in the process of so educating our fellow-countrymen.</P>
      <P>I hesitate to speak in a purely destructive way, because I am a good enough democrat to believe in freedom, of criticism, and yet I feel that criticism, as such, is liable to bring the Government into disrepute, while at the same time, as a good democrat, in a time of national emergency I would hesitate to bring the Government as such into disrepute; so I will try to steer as straight a course as I can between those two opposing considerations. If I were to say nasty things about Government policy in the matter of wheat and other agricultural matters, I would be inclined to say that their whole procedure in the last ten years reminds me of a quack doctor who goes about equipped with a bag of rather dangerous drugs, all of them poison, but some of them, fortunately, antidotes to the effect which others have.  After applying one drug and observing the patient in a state of disstress, the Government, by a kind of silent instinct rather than by any conscious wisdom, have occasionally applied the antidote drug and the patient has hitherto managed to survive by the process of being poisoned and anti-poisoned in successive doses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may or may not be a fair description of Government economic policy in the matter of wheat and other things, but I hope to illustrate more concretely the application of that parable to wheat.  Perhaps I might say their whole procedure over a number of years reminds me of the American doctor who was called in to examine a patient.  After examining the patient the doctor said: &ldquo;I do not in the least know what is wrong with you, but take this powder, it will give on fits, and I am hell on fits.&rdquo;  We have been taking powders and we have <Col N="342" /> been having various policies advocated and carried out with reference to wheat, and the fact remains that we now stand in serious danger of starvation in the course of the next few months.  Looking at it from a purely academic point of view, I would say it is a national disgrace that in a country where agriculture is the primary industry, and having land which is on the whole about the most fertile land of its kind in Europe, we should be faced with the danger of anything approximating to national starvation, or even of the loss of such an important element in our foodstuffs as wheat.</P>
    <P>We have 12,000,000 acres of agricultural land &mdash; 12,000,000 acres of crops and pasture &mdash; in the country.  I have seen somewhere a statement that 500 acres of average land, well and adequately cultivated, is enough to provide 1,000 people with all the requisites of a complete diet.  If that be so, it would follow, arithmetically speaking, that 1,500,000 acres of agricultural land, as good as our land is on the average, should be enough to supply 3,000,000 people with all the requisites of a complete diet.  Actually, we find that in normal times we seem to need or use about 6,000,000 acres of our agricultural land in providing food for ourselves, and only the produce of the other 6,000,000 acres is available for the production of export products. But if our agriculture had reached the degree of efficiency which it should have reached by this time, I would say that we should be able to feed our 3,000,000 people quite adequately with the produce of 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 acres of land and have produce of the rest available for export.  Apparently, however, having all, our and to play with, and having slipped by degrees&mdash; well, not completely, but to a certain extent &mdash; out of the export market altogether, we now find, ourselves in considerable danger of not being able to provide ourselves with an adequate diet.</P>
    <P>Now, much has been said about the price of wheat and the relation between the price proposed for wheat and the area which would be cultivated to wheat, but surely it is elementary that <Col N="343" /> different grades of land, from the point of view of wheat production, require different prices if the owners of those grades of land are going to bring them under wheat cultivation.  If the Government had fixed a price of, say, 30/- a barrel, it is possible that there are certain portions of land in the country which it would have paid the owners to grow wheat on, even for as low a price as 30/- a barrel.  At a price of 35/- a barrel, rather more land would have been cultivated to wheat, and so on, until we come up to whatever price is necessary in order to bring about, by means of a price inducement, the cultivation of what the economists would call the marginal portion of wheat land which is necessary to provide ourselves with a complete wheat ration.</P>
    <P>I do not know in the least what amount of land the price of 45/- a barrel is going to bring under wheat cultivation, but I do know that a price of 50/- a barrel will probably bring a greater area of land under wheat cultivation than a price of 45/-, and that seems to be the effect that price will have on the area cultivated.  If it were purely a question of price, then the Government will have to estimate what area of land a given price will cause the cultivation of, and will have to fix a price high enough to bring about the cultivation of that area of land, and then hope that the produce of that area of land will be sufficient to feed our people with wheat in the coming year.  There are, however, certain matters which I think ought to be adverted to in this connection, because in many ways we are, in this matter of wheat, heirs of the past and of the very recent past.  The Government takes pride in the fact that they have had a wheat policy ever since they came into office, and so they had but their wheat policy reminds me of the story of the man who was &ldquo;bet&rdquo; that he could not drink a quart of ale without setting down the tankard from his lips.  He took on the bet, and the stakes were duly handed over to the bar-tender. Then he slipped out, came back in about five minutes, and proceeded to take up his tankard and drink his quart, and he won his bet.  The other man said: &ldquo;Well done, but what were <Col N="344" /> you doing when you went outside?&rdquo; He answered: &ldquo;I went into the pub next door just to see if I could do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The point of that story is that from an ordinary point of view the man was less able to drink a, second tankard because he had already largely filled himself with the first tankard.  Similarly, with regard to the wheat policy, because we grew so much wheat on so much of our land unnecessarily during the years 1933 to 1938, we are now less able to grow as much wheat as we should like to grow and as we need to grow on the land of our country, and if we had grown less wheat in those years we could have grown more and better wheat at less expense for ourselves now.  Another aspect of the wheat policy that was pursued in those years was that it was not based on a solid foundation of profitable live-stock agriculture, because it was utterly uneconomic to stall feed cattle then.  Nobody outside an asylum was going to spend 3d. worth of grain in producing 2d. worth of beef.  The relationship between the price of oats and beef was such as to make the stall feeding of cattle utterly uneconomic, and, consequently, people who grew wheat in the tillage areas in those years did so without a foundation of stall feeding and, consequently, without an adequate foundation of farmyard manure.  They were able to do so with the help of artificial manures, and in that way were able to turn a cash profit for themselves out of the situation which was created for them in those years.</P>
    <P>Now, however, they have got to grow wheat without an adequate supply of artificial manure, and without any tradition in the recent past of adequate stall-feeding, and without adequate farmyard manure, they find themselves faced with the impossibility of growing a proper wheat crop in the tillage areas, and the Government has had to appeal to the farmers in the grass areas to come to the national rescue and plough up their most fertile grass lands with a view to releasing the fertility of that soil in the form of wheat.</P>
    <P>Now, there were owners of large grass lands, who were being penalised for being pasture farmers or ranchers during the years 1932 to 1938, who ploughed up portion of their grass <Col N="345" /> lands in those days in order to profit by the guaranteed price for wheat, but, in the events which happened since, the true patriots and the people on whom we must now rely mainly for the national salvation are not the ranchers or owners of these grass lands who ploughed up their grass lands for wheat in the years 1932 to 1938, but the stout fellows who maintained their land in grass, fed bullocks on it during the uneconomic years, and who now have the unexhausted fertility of that land which they can turn to in the national emergency and upon which they can grow wheat for us all.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of inconsistency in Government policies is that while their professed policy has been to encourage the growth of wheat and other tillage crops at all times since they took office, in actual fact another policy of theirs, the policy of dividing up large farms has had, incidentally, the effect of making us now less able and less adapted to the rapid increase in the cultivation of wheat than we would have been if we had allowed the former number of large farms to continue in existence in the country.  The fact is that wheat is not a crop which suits the economy of the small farmer of 30 acres or less.  It is essentially a crop which can be grown on a commercial scale with economy and efficiency only by the farmer of 50 to 100 acres or more.  If you look up the statistics in the official volume <i>Agriculture Statistics</i>, 1847 to 1926, you will find on page 121 a comparison of the amount of wheat grown in, 1917 on farms of 30 acres or less and the amount grown on farms of 30 acres or more.  In 1917 there were 106,000 acres under wheat, and of that total 29,000 acres were grown on farms of 30 acres or less and 77,000 were grown on farms of 30 acres or more.  In other words, in those years and, I believe, in these years, wheat growing, if it is to take place, at all must take place, largely if not entirely, on farms of 30 acres or more, and if you analyse the returns of our existing acreage under wheat I think you will probably find that at least 300,000 of those acres are on farms of 50 acres or more and only about 100,000 on farms of 50 acres or less.</P>
    <P>The small farmer has his points, and <Col N="346" /> I am not saying that there is not room in our agricultural economy for farms of every size.  In fact, I am saying that there should be farms of all sizes not only in the country as a whole but in every region of the country, because I think our economy as a whole will be stronger and healthier if we have suitable gradations of farms distributed throughout the whole country.  I do not say that it has been the Government policy to harass the owners of large farms as such, and to acquire their land for division among alleged landless men.  To the extent to which that policy has succeeded, the Government has created a situation in which less wheat is likely to be cultivated than if they had not pursued that policy.  I am aware of one concrete instance recently in which a farmer on a 500 acre farm in County Louth, who had gone to every trouble and expense acquiring tractors and other machinery, and ploughed up a considerable portion of his land in order to play his part in the wheat campaign, had, by a recent decision of the Land Commission, about 300 acres taken from him, with the result that all his agricultural activities have been completely disorganised. The land will be divided up at a time when much of our national effort should be devoted to growing wheat, and it is extremely unlikely that that land next year or the year after will grow as much wheat as if it had been left in the undisturbed possession of the former owner.</P>
    <P>The fact is that it does not suit the policy of the smallholder to go in, to any, serious extent, for a wheat crop. In saying that I speak as a smallholder, the owner of some 20 acres of land.  The smallholder is always conscious of a shortage of grass and hay and other food for his animal population. If he extends his cultivation of oats he may have to carry a smaller stock of animals in the summer, but he will at least have the straw and perhaps the cracked oats, if he chooses to use some of it in that way, to feed a larger animal population in the winter time, and, on balance, he will not have to cut down his animal population at all.  But, if you ask him to grow two or three acres of wheat on a 20 acre farm, he will not have any <Col N="347" /> straw worth talking about fit to feed to his animals in the winter time, and he will almost certainly have to cut down the number of animals that he carries on his land.  There is the additional consideration that if the smallholder grows an oat crop he need not necessarily plough up the field for oats until the spring-time and he has the grazing of that lea field all the previous winter &mdash; even winter grass is a useful thing to have in these days when cattle feeding is short&mdash; whereas if he had to prepare a field for wheat cultivation he would have to plough it up in the previous October, and consequently lose the grazing of that portion of his land during the whole of the previous winter, as well as having to face all the problems of bringing it back again into a suitable state of cultivation and laying it down in grass after a suitable rotation in the future.</P>
    <P>It is true &mdash; no matter what any expert advising the Taoiseach may say &mdash; that wheat is a more exhausting crop on land than oats, and, the smallholder is very wise in taking care not to expand too much his cultivation of wheat, but, if he must increase his cultivation, to specialise in such things as potatoes and oats.  That is the elementary commonsense of the thing from the point of view of the 20 acre farmer and less, and statistics bear out the fact that in a time of national emergency like this the only part of our agriculture which is capable of substantial elasticity of expansion in the way of increasing tillage is that part which is represented by farms of 30 acres or more.  Again referring to <i>Agricultural Statistics</i> 1847 to 1926 you will find on page XLVI an analysis of the percentage increase in the area of land ploughed for every thousand acres of crops and pasture, comparing, the results in farms of different sizes for the years 1912 to 1917.  In farms of 30 acres or less, between 1912 and 1917, the area ploughed increased by 21 per cent.  In farms of, 30 to 50 acres the area ploughed increased by 29 per cent.  In farms of 50 to 100 acres the area ploughed increased by 36 per cent.  In farms of 100 to 200 acres the area <Col N="348" /> ploughed, increased by 47 per cent.  In farms of over 200 acres the area ploughed increased by 83 per cent. Considering that, we have now a situation in which the nation's salvation seems to depend on the willingness and ability to exert itself of that section of our agriculture which it has been the policy of the Government to harass almost out of existence in the course of the last ten years.  I hope their patriotism will prove equal to the occasion, and I hope the Government will have a more rational outlook on the problems of our agriculture than they possibly had during their first eight or ten unregenerate years.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps also appropriate to suggest that, given a somewhat different policy, it would not be out of the question to import the deficiency of our wheat crop by co-operation with our British neighbours, but at the same time I am only too painfully aware that our economic bargaining power in our dealings with our British neighbours is nothing like as strong as it should be, and nothing like as strong as it would have been if a policy of a, kind which I would have recommended had been in operation during the last ten years.  The economic bargaining power of one nation dealing with another depends on what the nation in question has to sell and on what it would like to get in exchange.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that it is important that we should get, by hook or by crook, enough wheat to feed ourselves; that if we cannot get it by paying 45/- a barrel, then we should be prepared to pay as much as 50/-; and, if we cannot get it for 50/-. we should be prepared to pay 55/-.  But we should also be prepared to consider the possibility of getting the additional wheat we might require from <Col N="349" /> other sources besides our own agriculture, especially as our own agriculture has been rendered less capable of producing wheat now than it would have been if it had not produced so much in those years to which I have referred. I suggest from that point of view that, if we had not reduced ourselves to the position in which we have practically nothing left to export, if our exports of things like pigs, bacon and butter were of more serious importance to our neighbour, then we would have been in a better position in which we might say: &ldquo;Unless you help us to get wheat we may, unfortunately, be unable to supply you with as much bacon, butter, and so on, as you would like.&rdquo;  But, unfortunately, we have not got sufficient of these things to make it of any importance in the eyes of our neighbour, and as to the cattle we have got, they say: &ldquo;You have to sell them to us anyway, and we know that you cannot do anything else with them,&rdquo; so that they do not constitute any bargaining factor.  I think it would have been altogether preferable if we had pursued the policy of expanding the production of live stock and live-stock products during the last ten years, thus giving us a stronger position and a greater bargaining power in export markets and the possibility, in a time of national emergency, of switching over virgin soil to the production of wheat to whatever extent might be possible, and whatever surplus wheat we could not produce at home we could have been able to obtain by arrangement with our neighbour.</P>

      <P>I should like to say in the beginning that I have a good deal of sympathy with the motion, and I have a good deal more sympathy with the motion plus the amendment; I sympathise with it mainly because I like to see everybody get as much of this world's goods as he possibly can. I sympathise with it because it would give me the greatest pleasure to see the farmer getting more for his wheat than he is entitled to under the present regulations.  But, at the same time, there is a difficulty, and that difficulty for me, at any rate, is in deciding what is a fair price.  That difficulty has not been smoothed out by the discussion <Col N="350" /> on the matter in the Dáil nor its discussion here in the Seanad.  As a matter of fact, the views of the sponsors of the motions for increasing the price for wheat in the Dáil and in the Seanad have left me in very grave doubt as to what is a fair price. Deputy Belton fought a hard fight in the Dáil.  Were it not for the able replies of the Minister and some Deputies whom I know to be first-rate farmers, he would have convinced me that 60/- was a reasonable price. Senator Baxter comes along and puts the figure at 50/- and makes a great fight, and even suggests that 60/- would be quite unreasonable and would in fact amount to a fleecing of the public.</P>
      <P>I am not a farmer, but it is part of my profession to deal with accountancy as well as economics.  It is, perhaps, unfortunate for me that I have to try to relate everything to cost.  Be that as it may, I am entitled to ask for some reasonable evidence as to the cost of production of this particular commodity before I am asked to plump for this price or for that price.  Now, when Senator The McGillycuddy started to speak this evening, if I understood him correctly &mdash; it was rather difficult to follow him owing to that peculiarly foreign accent he has &mdash; I gathered that he was going to drench us with details of costs.</P>
      <P>He also assured us that the speakers who would follow him would deal with that same question of costs.  He told us in a general way that there are statistics available &mdash; he was referring to the Statistical Abstract, I expect&mdash; and that by making certain calculations we could arrive at costs of production. Well, all I can say in reply is that if that type of costing satisfies the Senator it certainly does not satisfy me, nor would it satisfy any student of accountancy.  Unfortunately, the costs are not available, and if the costings are not available what is a person like me to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that there is any very grave dissatisfaction throughout the country with the price that has been fixed for wheat.  At 40/-, I do not think I came across anybody who said it was unfair.  I met a good many men from County Louth to County Clare, and from Tipperary up to Leitrim during <Col N="351" /> last autumn, and I know that these men did not keep costings.  As to the few of them who did keep costings, on examination it was quite easy to show that they were not fair costings.  Even so, on questioning these men as to the results of their production, they were satisfied that they had come out, as they said themselves, all right.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to say that if it were necessary to pay more than 45/- to secure an abundant supply of wheat, I would not be in favour of giving it.  That does not say that if it were possible to provide 50/- or 60/-, or more, for the farmer, that I would not be in favour of giving it to him.  If any man in this country has my sympathy, the farmer has it, and when there is anything that could possibly be put in his way, I should certainly plump for giving it to him.  But, at the same time, we have to ask this: supposing we decide he should get the 50/-, the difference between the price offered now and the suggested price being 5/-, we have a right to ask from what source it is likely to come.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, when this motion was being discussed, somebody referred to the possible source from which the increase might come.  This source was not discussed in detail.  There is one lesson that we should have learned, and learned well, in the last 12 months here in Ireland &mdash; if we were not prepared to make the necessary study of that same question as it arose in and as it affected European countries following the last war &mdash; and that is the meaning of money.  Money cannot be taken out of a hat.  If we are to increase the price of wheat to the farmers, in present circumstances, it must come from somebody.  It can be done only by transferring wealth from one section of the community to another. We have gone pretty far as it is in the transference of wealth from certain sections to other sections.  We have made up our minds pretty well, according to the statement of the Minister for Finance yesterday, that in certain eventualities we will go still further. It may be, and I am sure it is, true that the section of the community off whom we have been levying the <Col N="352" /> wealth for transference to other sections can stand further levying.  If it is necessary in the interests of the nation, I should plump here also for levying further taxation on them and transferring it to the farmers.</P>
    <P>Candidly, my view is that wheat in Ireland is a crop which should be subsidised &mdash; permanently subsidised, if needs be.  It is a business rule &mdash; perhaps not in all businesses but generally so &mdash; that certain lines must be disposed of at cost price, or even less, in the interests of the business as a whole; and it seems to me that, in the interests of agriculture and the national economy as a whole, we would be well advised to make up our minds that wheat is a product which should be subsidised &mdash; and subsidised permanently &mdash; if necessary.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Johnston on this question of wheat production here at home.  He thinks it was a mistake that we should have gone into it at the time we did, that we would be in a better position to produce what we want now if we had not gone into it then.  My conviction is that the mistake we made is that we did not proceed faster and more determinedly in the development of our wheat policy. That brings me to an important point. I am not an agricultural scientist, but I am certainly &mdash; whatever Senator Baxter or Senator Johnston may say about me &mdash; prepared to accept the advice of the expert.  If one is not well I believe one should go to a doctor.  If I want technical information regarding agriculture I believe I should go to the expert. To deride the efforts of those men is the greatest disservice that can be rendered to this country as a whole and, above all, the greatest disservice at the present time.</P>
    <P>Reference was made here last evening to statements made by Professor Caffrey.  He is one of the first line men in his profession, he is a man who has come off the land; his work is known not alone in Ireland but on the Continent.  Every test he has made is tried out, all his work is tried and tested under extreme conditions as well as under normal conditions and it is only after his tests have been made that he publishes his conclusions.  His conclusions are that wheat does not <Col N="353" /> take more out of the soil than any other crop, and that this country is capable of producing an abundant supply of wheat for its needs.  We would the better serve our country and serve agriculture if every one of us would take the advice of that man &mdash; a good Irishman and one who desires the well being of this country and of the people from whom he sprung &mdash; and carry it to the people who stand in need of it.</P>
    <P>The production of wheat here is possible &mdash; our full supply is possible &mdash; and the great mistake the Government has made &mdash; lay the blame where you may, at the doors of the Land Commission or any other body&mdash;is that since 1931, we did not push ahead faster with wheat production.  We could get ample supplies of wheat from 750,000 acres. We have, according to the statistics, approximately 400,000 holdings, taking them by and large an acre and a half of each holding would give us all we want.  At any rate, if 6 per cent.&mdash; a generous allowance perhaps &mdash; of our cultivable land were put under wheat, we would get an abundant supply, and if we make up our minds that this country should produce a reasonable acreage of wheat to give us the amount we want, I do not see why we should not make up our minds to demand that every man holding land should produce his fair share of that wheat.</P>

      <P>The question of compensating the farmer for producing that wheat is all-important.  As I say, I would like to give him every possible penny I could.  If we can get him to produce all the wheat we want, we must see that he gets adequate remuneration. I suggest we might secure that in this way.  There are millions of pounds going into the various branches of agriculture in one way or another at the present time.  I would transfer a reasonable amount of those allowances &mdash; whether they be agricultural grant, subsidy, dole, and so on&mdash; to the production of wheat.  That is to say, I would withdraw those allowances from the various branches of agriculture to which they are at present <Col N="354" /> devoted, and would concentrate them on wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I would concentrate on wheat production and I will explain why.  If we can secure that our full requirements in wheat are produced here at home, it will mean that, say, 750,000 acres of the land will be cultivated and devoted to wheat.  That, in turn, would mean that, in the ordinary course of economy, if proper rotations are followed, an adequate area will be under total cultivation&mdash; wheat, roots, hay and so on.  We discussed here last year &mdash; it was referred to in the debate last night &mdash; the question of guaranteed prices for such crops as oats, and some of us were not particularly keen on it at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not keen on it and felt, as I said then, that in view of the particular economy that we had followed here the oat crop would look after itself.  The farmer could be trusted to know what his requirements were likely to be and would produce to meet such requirements. He may not have produced as much as we would like but at any rate there is no very great shortage.  If there is a difficulty with regard to the price of oats it has arisen because of the special advantages accruing as a result of the prices which are being obtained for stock.  There, perhaps, we may find the key to some of the difficulties we are experiencing at the present time in securing adequate supplies of wheat.  The tendency and the <Col N="355" /> hope is that prices for livestock will become better and better.  At times the hope has been realised.  Livestock is something that the farmer has gone into very much, it pays him on the whole.  He sees that it is to his advantage to concentrate more on foodstuffs for stock than for humans.  Now, 80 per cent.  of our livestock is being exported to feed our friends on the other side. I grant you that they are paying for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Minister says, in exchange for the goods we cannot secure for ourselves.  The Minister said that in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>It amounts to this: not wilfully, but due to the particular tradition which has grown up in our farming system, considerable quantities of particular kinds of food are being made available here for another country, and there is a danger that our own people may, in consequence, go short of an essential.  I do not advocate that we should reduce our live-stock population.  If we plump for wheat and decide on, say, a 20 years' plan for it, we will naturally assure the farmer of a reasonable price for it over that period.  I do not see how that will interfere in any way with the numbers of live stock which we may carry, except, indeed, that it would enable us to carry more, as a more intensive cultivation of the land will be brought about, a more abundant supply of feeding stuffs will be produced, and, consequently, we will be able to maintain a much larger live-stock population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just the same, it may be no harm to issue a word of warning that this concentration to the extent that we have concentrated on live stock, may not be all the blessing that some of us think it is.  The lesson of the last war, its consequences, ought not readily be forgotten.  I agree that if we decide to insist on 750,000 acres for wheat, compulsion will be essential.  Compulsion does not frighten me in the least. Compulsion, like freedom, has its limits.  It can be carried too far.  But there is compulsion in every walk of life and in every branch of industry. What do &ldquo;Factory Acts&rdquo; mean but compulsion?  What do &ldquo;The Conditions <Col N="356" /> of Employment Acts&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shops Act&rdquo; mean but compulsion for the industrialists and the traders?  There is no reason why we should baulk at a little compulsion in agriculture.  But if we were to decide that we should introduce compulsion I agree that there are certain areas where exemption might justly be claimed.  There should be no great difficulty about that.  There is no reason why, if the Land Commission or the Department of Agriculture as a result of investigation, or from knowledge of the various areas, considered that wheat growing in these areas would not be profitable they could not be scheduled for exemption. There is no reason why that should not be done.  Exemptions are allowed in regard to many of the Acts and orders passed from time to time.</P>
    <P>To come back to the question of price for wheat, there is this difficulty in fixing it, that it might be that certain types of farmers would get away with more than their fair share of profits. Senator Johnston referred to the matter in another way.  When there was no guaranteed price for wheat roughly 30,000 acres were under cultivation. Then we decided to guarantee a price which was considerably higher than the price ruling beforehand.  The effect of the guaranteeing of that price was that certain extra land was brought under cultivation.  Because they were producing on superior land the people who had been producing before were bound to reap a special profit known to economists as a rent. Time after time the price of wheat was raised, each time with the avowed intention of bringing in more of the marginal land.  Each time the price was raised those already in production were reaping a higher profit than before.  It could be and I am sure it is quite true to say, that the more we raise the price the more we wish to bring in some of the poorer or marginal land.</P>
    <P>The more we do that the more profitable we make it for those already in production.  The more we raise the price the more we will make it possible for those who have good land to bring it under cultivation and reap high profits.  The more of the good land brought into cultivation at the higher <Col N="357" /> price the more those who are not entitled to it tend to get away with undue profits, so that, in effect, if it were possible, I should like to see something in the nature of a sliding scale for wheat prices.  It may be said that such a scale is not possible.  At any rate it is a, matter that should be investigated.  Here I should like to make the suggestion that the Government would be well advised to set up with the least possible delay small bodies of experts to consider problems tending to arise out of the emergency, and likely to face us as the result of the war.  These bodies should be set up to deal with every aspect of the national economy and, above all, they should be set up to deal with problems relating to agriculture.  The possibility of varying rates for wheat according to the size and quality of farms, is a problem that might be investigated by such a committee.  One could come to a conclusion on it only as a result of very close investigation.  I make the suggestion for what it is worth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>There would have to be a soil survey before doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  That brings me to the next point to which I meant to refer.  I have stated more than once with regard to the question of wheat that every farmer who could possibly do so should produce his quota of the wheat necessary for the country. I believe that would involve a survey of the farms.  It might be said that a survey of 400,000 farms is an impossible task.  In Britain they have decided, not merely for the emergency but as part of their long-term planning policy, that every farm is to be individually surveyed, and that the quantities of the crops which it is considered are essential to the life of the nation shall be calculated, and quotas fixed for each individual farm.  It means planning, and, whether we like it or not, planning is a need which is staring us in the face.  We may not plan, and suffer the consequences, or we may face facts and plan, and come out of things as we should.  Senator Johnston was worried again about the question of breaking up grass land.  I am not an expert, but, as I said, I do pay attention to the opinions of experts, and their <Col N="358" /> opinion is that lands generally are better for a periodic breaking and resowing.</P>

      <P>We know that some people get frightened when highly trained agricultural instructors, poultry instructresses and dairy instructors try to convince them that things might be done somewhat differently to their advantage.  If that gives anybody any satisfaction, then they are welcome to it.  I was dealing with the question of breaking up grass land. I read not very long ago a very short but a very fine article by a well-known practical farmer.  He is a man whom some of us knew on the Agricultural Commission, and whose views were very much respected.  In, this article he pointed out that the views of the experts with regard to the breaking up of grass land are that the possibility of bringing it back again into good heart for grass production, without much delay, is not remote; that he himself had broken up land and had been able to bring it under grass again with very gratifying results.  That land in every way was the better of such treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal has been said with regard to wheat being held up by farmers. Last evening the Minister gave his reasons why farmers were holding up certain quantities of wheat, threshing <Col N="359" /> difficulties, for instance, being one reason.  I have seen recently quantities of wheat in haggards waiting to be threshed.  It is not that one told me so, I have actually seen it.  There is also this further reason which may be advanced why wheat is not coming to the mills as quickly as we would like. According to Deputy Belton, when speaking in the Dáil recently, he was offered a price, if I remember rightly, of 60/- for wheat to be used for feedingstuffs.</P>
    <P>I just mention that to show that there is a possibility of considerable quantities of wheat being withheld. Deputy Belton, from what I could read in the Dáil Reports, is a man to whom various people pay tribute for his knowledge and ability as a farmer and apparently he knew what he was talking about.  In any case, he said that he had been offered 60/- for wheat as feeding-stuff.  If such a price as that is being offered, it is quite understandable that quantities of wheat should be withheld by the farmers in the hope of getting that price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am just advancing this argument in support of the view that there may be considerable quantities &mdash; how much I do not know &mdash; withheld.  Another thing to which my attention has been drawn, in connection with the production, of wheat and the tillage policy generally, is that in many instances farmers with large holdings are not tilling in the strict sense of the word.  Recently I was brought to a very big farm and I was shown the area that had been cultivated.  The law had been complied with but, in effect, this particular patch of land had been merely scratched and a handful of grain thrown over it.  There was no intention of reaping; there was no sincere intention of carrying, out the law in regard to cultivation.</P>

      <P>That is the danger with compulsion, I agree.  There is a case of a holding of excellent land but the farmer had a prejudice against cultivation, and by selecting for cultivation the worst patch he could find on the land, not caring what became of it, he was able to evade the law.  What was worse still, he was able to deceive the Minister whose responsibility it was to see that we were provided with adequate supplies of an essential crop such as wheat, and other crops besides.</P>

      <P>I hope not &mdash; I cannot say &mdash; but it is something to which my attention was drawn.  It was the case of a holding to which I was brought, and the person who took me there assured me that he had seen other cases of the kind.  To what extent it has happened I cannot say.</P>

      <P>I understand that there has been general agreement that the House should adjourn at 9 o'clock. If that is the case, there is no reason why Senator O Buachalla should not continue his speech on the next day the House meets.</P>

      <P>The normal hour of adjournment according to Standing Orders is 9 p.m.  Perhaps the Senator would now move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
