      <P>Is é is priomh-chúis don scéim leasuighthe seo deireadh do chur le leath-trom d'fhéadfaí do dhéanamh ar mhúinteoir ar bith, tré oibriú Mhír 9 den Phríomh-Scéim &mdash; leath-trom do thárla cheana féin do dhá mhúinteoir ar a laighead.  Faoi théarmaí na míre sin, má chailleann múinteoir a phosta tré ádhbhar ar bith agus, tríd sin, é do stad de bheith ina bhall den Scéim Pinsean, níl sé ion-ghlactha ath-uair sa Scéim, má tá sé ós cionn 50 bliadhan d'aois agus má tá níos mó ná dhá bhliadhain caithte ó stad sé de bheith ina bhall.  Os a chomhair sin, má tá a leithéid de mhúinteoir faoi 50 bliadhain d'aois, d'fhéadfaí a ghlacadh isteach sa Scéim ath-uair, mura mbeadh níos mó ná 10 mbliadhna caithte ó stad sé de bheith ina bhall. Le n-a rádh i bhfocla eile, do ceadóchthaí bearna, nach mbeadh ós cionn deich mbliadhan, do bheith i seirbhís mhúinteoirí faoi 50 bliadhain d'aois, ach ní ceadóchthaí ach dhá bhliadhain de bhearna do bheith i seirbhís mhúinteóirí ós cionn 50 bliadhan d'aois.  Do cuireadh an coingheall seo isteach sa bhun-scéim ionnas nach leigfí isteach ath-uair sa seirbhís múinteoirí meadhon-aosta do bhéadh tamall fada as an seirbhís agus ar dhócha a n-éifeacht do bheith laghaduighthe dá bhárr sin.  Do measadh, freisin, go <Col N="1326" /> mb'fhéidir posta eile do bheith le fagháil taobh istigh de dhá bhliadhain ag múinteóir ar bith do chaillfeadh an posta do bhí aige.</P>
      <P>Acht, le linn oibriú na Scéime, do fuarthas amach go ndéanann an coingheall seo leath-trom ar na seanmhúinteóirí, óir do thárla nach dtáinig le cuid aca sin postaí nuadha d'fhagháil taobh istigh den spás ama do bhi orduighthe.  An leasú atáthar anois ag iarraidh a dhéanamh ar Mhír 9, d'athróchadh sé teóra na bearna seirbhíse ó 2 bhliadhain go dtí 10 mbliadhna, agus dá réir sin, d'fhágfadh sé múinteóirí do bheadh ós cionn 50 bliadhan d'aois ar aon-téarma leis na múinteóirí is óige ná iad.  Mar atá baint ag coingheallacha na scéime seo leis na sean-scéimeanna, ní misde míniú gearr do thabhairt ar na míora éagsamhla, ionnas gur fusaide tuigfear a gcuspóir.  Míora I&mdash;IV, níl ionnta ach na gnáth-choingheallacha maidir le teideal na scéime agus leis na mínighthe.</P>
      <P>Mír V, ghní sí roinnt leasuighthe ar an mbun-scéim, agus atá siad sin luaidhte sa Sceideal.  An ceann is mó tábhacht aca sin, is é an leasú úd atáthar a dhéanamh i Mír IX é, .i. spás deich mbliadhan do bheith dhá chur isteach i n-ionad spás 2 bhliadhan maidir le bearna seirbhíse i gcás múinteóirí ós cionn 50 bliadhan d'aois.  Na leasuighthe eile atá luaidhte sa Sceideal, atáthar ghá ndéanamh ionnas go n-aistreóchthar, ón Aire Airgeadais go dtí an tAire Oideachais, cúram riaracháin an chisde pinsean agus neithe eile bhaineas le hoibriú na scéime.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Mír VII, is é is cuspóir di direadh do chur le hádhbhar beag gearáin do thárla ann i gcás beagán múinteóirí. B'fhéidir nár mhisde dhom a mhíniú nach éigeantach do mhúinteóirí bheith ina mball de'n Scéim, gur tré n-a n-iarratas féin leigtear isteach iad, agus go gcaithtear fiadhnaise áirithe fé n-a sláinte, etc., d'fhagháil uatha sul a leigtear isteach iad.  I gcás gnáth-mhúinteóirí Meadhon-Scol a leigtear isteach, do socruigheadh go <Col N="1327" /> bhféadfaí a seirbhís in-phinseanta d'áireamh ó dháta nach mbéadh os cion 15 míosa roimh dháta a n-iarratais chun ballraíochta&mdash;ar choingheall gur híocadh a síntiúis do'n Chiste Pinsean le haghaidh na tréimhse sin. I mbliadhain a 1935 do rinneadh Scéim Leasuighthe do bhain le cás Mhúinteóirí Meadhon-Scol a raibh seirbhís in-phinseanta déanta aca roimh ré mar Mhúinteóirí Náisiúnta.  Ba riachtanach do na múinteóirí seo a ughdarú, taobh istigh de dhá mhí dhéag ó na-a leigint isteach sa Scéim, go n-aistreóchthaí a síntiúis pinsin go dtí Cisde Pinsean Mhúinteóirí na Meadhon-Scol.  Do thárla dá bhárr sin, gidh nár chuspóir é, nár bh'fhéidir níos mó ná 12 mhí de spás ama do bheith idir dáta a leigint isteach sa Scéim agus dáta a n-iarratais chun a leigint isteach. Mar sin de, do bhí sé de leath-trom ortha sin nach raibh ach 12 mhí de spás aca-san, gidh go raibh 15 míosa ag múinteóirí eile.  Táthar ag iarraidh deireadh do chur leis an éagcothromacht sin agus na múinteóirí go leir do chur ar aon-dul sa scéal&mdash;rud a dhéanfadh an leasú atáthar a dhéanamh ar Mhír 5 de Scéim 1935.</P>
    <P>Mír VII, is é cuspóir di ughdarás d'fhagháil maidir le húsáid na síntiús do'n Chisde Pinsean do bhí íoctha ag Múinteóirí Meadhon-Scol do ceapadh ina gcigirí agus ar ceaduigheadh dóibh a seirbhís mhúinteoireachta d'aireamh mar stát-sheirbhís bhunuighthe le haghaidh pinsean.  I mbliadhain a 1929, nuair do rinneadh Scéim Pinsean na Múinteóirí Meadhon-Scol, ní raibh ughdarás dleaghthach ar bith ann le seirbhís mhúinteóireachta d'áireamh le n-a aghaidh seo mar stát-sheirbhís, agus do rinneadh riaghail do chuirfeadh i gcumas cigirí mar iad siúd a mballríocht sa Scéim do choinneáil, ionnas go bhféadfaidís pinsean moillighthe do tharraingt tar éis a n-éirghe as an stát-sheirbhís.  Ina dhiaidh sin do socruigheadh, i n-Alt 21 de Scéim Pinsean 1936, go bhféadfaí&mdash;faoi choingheallacha áirithe&mdash;seirbhís mhúinteóireachta d'áireamh mar stát-sheirbhís, agus atá úsáid dhá dhéanamh de'n tsocrú sin ag cigirí áirithe do bhíodh ina múinteóirí.  Do réir na gcoingheall faoi n-ar ceaduigheadh sin dóibh, do chaithfidís na síntiúis do bhí íoctha aca <Col N="1328" /> le Cisde Pinsean na Meadhon-Mhúinteóirí d'aistriú chuig an Aire Airgeadais, agus is é is cuspóir do'n mhír seo an t-aistriú sin do dhéanamh dleaghthach.</P>
    <P>Mír VIII, is é is cuspóir dí gan an tréimhse chéadna ama do leigint dá háireamh le haghaidh pinsin mhúinteóireachta agus pinsin mhíleadhta, agus, freisin, chun socrú do dhéanamh le haghaidh cáis ar bith ina mbéadh in dá chineál sin pinsean saothruighthe ag múinteóir.</P>
    <P>Is dóigh liom go mínigheann an ráiteas seo agam gach nidh dá bhfuil sa scéim leasuighthe, agus táim ag súil go nglacfar léi go lán-toilteannach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Micheál O hAodha Micheál O hAodha">
      <NameTxt>Micheál O hAodha</NameTxt>
      <P>Nílim i gcoinne an rúin seo agus sílim gur ceart dúinn glacadh leis.  I am not opposing this motion.  I would like to see certain other things in it, and I would like to be allowed to make a few remarks upon the subject of teachers' pensions in general, and upon the register upon which teachers' pensions are necessarily based.  I was thinking, while the Minister was making his statement in Irish, that there are times when the Irish language is more satisfactory than the English. &ldquo;Ta an smacht dhá fhágáil ag an Aire Airgid mar do bhí sé&rdquo; seems to be somewhat better than the mere bald English that the Minister for Finance still retains control of the scheme.  &ldquo;Smacht&rdquo; appears much more suitable for the strong hand of the Minister for Finance than the more polite and less vigorous word &ldquo;control.&rdquo; These alterations in the scheme &mdash;for the benefit of those who have not understood the Minister&mdash;are, in all cases, satisfactory to secondary teachers, their grievance being, in so far as they have a grievance, that certain other things are not included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teachers' pensions scheme is on a contributory basis, and, as the Minister said, is voluntary.  Four per cent. of the registered teachers' salaries are deducted as a contribution to the scheme.  The scheme itself is by no means generous, nor are the salaries of the secondary teachers, particularly when one considers the immense rise in the cost of living in recent years. <Col N="1329" /> Apart from the amount involved, the scheme itself has one very grave defect not shared by the pensions scheme for university teachers, primary teachers, or civil servants.  A secondary teacher on retirement gets no gratuity, although I think the amount he receives is calculated on 80ths of his years of service.  The teachers themselves would be willing, since that gratuity is of great importance to them, to make a small additional contribution to the scheme if a gratuity could be arranged, and I wonder if the Minister could give that matter his attention and see whether he could do anything with the Minister for Finance about it.</P>
    <P>There is another point, that the pensions scheme could not have been put in operation but for the existence of the register, and I can remember well &mdash;I was at that time a secondary teacher myself&mdash;when the register was arranged.  It was thought that it would have two excellent effects, that it would provide that the bulk of the teachers in the schools would be properly qualified.  That would, of course, be a good thing for education in general in the country.  It would be for the national good, and, as well, the register would effect an improvement in the status and pay of secondary teachers themselves, and more particularly in the status of lay teachers in whom I was naturally peculiarly interested.</P>
    <P>The number of pupils in secondary schools has, I think, been going up for a number of years, particularly in girls' schools.  The number of registered teachers has been increasing also, but I am not able to get any figures on that matter except from the very full table which the Minister for Education supplied in answer to a Parliamentary Question in the Dáil on the 15th April. I would like to say that that reply gave the maximum information possible.  I wonder if the number of registered teachers is increasing as fast as the number of pupils in the schools, especially in the girls' schools?  I hear that there are a number of unqualified teachers.  Perhaps it should be said that the teachers in secondary schools who have entered since the register was established must have a degree and a higher diploma in education. <Col N="1330" /> Other teachers qualified to be on the register are those who have a university degree, and who could get the higher diploma in education and go on the register; but there are other teachers not qualified at all and not registered, and, presumably, not on the road to being qualified for registration.</P>
    <P>I think that it is true to say that a number of teachers who have the qualification are afraid to go on the register lest the school might not be able to pay them the basic salary.  I should say that the basic salary is paid by the school and the increments by the Minister.  Unless I am mistaken in my reading of the original scheme&mdash;I should like the Minister to correct me if I am wrong&mdash;the position is that a school must pay the basic salary for one registered teacher for every 30 pupils, the registered teacher being either lay or clerical.  Outside that number, a registered teacher may be employed but may not be paid the minimum salary prescribed by the registration provisions.  If he is employed, the State must pay the increments. I think that it would be possible to increase the number of registered teachers without increasing the strain on individual schools.  I should like the Minister to say whether or not it would be possible to increase the number of registered teachers. Looking at the return made to the Dáil on the 15th April, this year, one gathers that, amongst the lay male teachers, 111 out of 708 are not qualified. For the Minister's information, I may say that I am taking teachers who are registered and also those who have university degrees and are, therefore, qualified.  About 14 per cent. of the laymen employed are not qualified for registration and are, therefore, not registered.  In the case of lay women, the figure is much higher&mdash;165 out of 587.  About 28 per cent. of lay women teachers are not qualified.  In the case of male religious, the number is 202 out of 809.  That is much higher than in the case of laymen. In that case, 25 per cent. are not qualified.  In the case of women <Col N="1331" /> teachers belonging to religious orders, the number unqualified is 410 out of 1,075 or about 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of education, generally, and the efficient running of the schools, it would be desirable if a greater number of qualified and registered teachers could be employed. That was, I think, the original idea in putting the scheme into operation. From the Minister's point of view, and from the point of view of any Minister for Education, that would be regarded as a desirable object to pursue.  Even if a certain amount of expense were involved, I think that very few things would repay expense better than the provision of properly qualified staffs in the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>One other point, not so relevant, I crave your indulgence to make, so that we shall not be raising it later&mdash;on the Appropriation Bill, perhaps &mdash; and bringing the Minister in specially for it.  These teachers&mdash;I refer particularly to the lay teachers&mdash;are paid their salaries monthly by the schools, as a general rule, but the increments from the Government are paid quarterly.  In the present state of affairs, to people on small salaries who have to live, in the main, in cities and large towns and who are compelled, in the nature of things, to keep up outwardly a certain standard of living, the difference between getting their money quarterly and monthly is very great.  I notice that, in reply to the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the Minister stated in the Dáil that the cost of changing over to a monthly basis of payment would be £18,000.  I do not understand exactly how that figure is reached.  Surely, it does not mean that it would cost £18,000 annually to pay about 1,800 teachers a sum of money monthly instead of quarterly.  It would appear to me that a couple of writing assistants could do the job, and that the only other cost would be the cost of postage.  Perhaps I am wrong in that.  There may be some over lapping of payments or there may be some initial difficulty.</P>
    <P>In every case in which payments are made quarterly and an effort is made to have them made monthly, there is <Col N="1332" /> an objection.  The same objection was made in the case of national teachers long ago.  I knew national teachers in the old days who walked the streets of Dublin without a penny for a tram because they could never make their money reach from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter.  The younger people were oftentimes dependent on the generosity and forbearance of their landladies towards the end of the quarter.  There was an immense fuss about the matter but, eventually, the Lords of His Majesty's Treasury agreed to the payments being made monthly.  That did not bring down the State, as it then was.</P>
    <P>In University College, Dublin, where statutory officers were paid quarterly, there was some difficulty in getting the payments made monthly but they have been paid monthly for quite a long time now.  In the case of the lay teachers in this list, which applies from the 31st January of this year, surely an effort might be made, in the present emergency, to give relief to the 817 lay teachers, as against 1,050 religious teachers, by paying their increments monthly instead of quarterly.  The £18,000 which has been mentioned would thus, I presume, be reduced to £9,000 and I can hardly believe but that a considerable portion of that sum would be involved for the first year only.</P>
    <P>I am not good at the intricacies of finance but I have conducted constant arguments with the Department of Finance, who are never in favour of anything in the beginning.  The Minister for Education and I would be in agreement on that.  Nothing is ever put up with which they are in agreement and nobody is more expert than they are in showing that action proposed will cost an immense sum of money when, as a matter of fact, it can very often be brought down considerably by the application of commonsense. When a small number of secondary teachers&mdash;817&mdash;who are poorly paid are struggling very hard to live in a period of high prices and great shortages, an effort should be made to give them their money monthly instead of quarterly.  Even if certain costs were involved initially, the annual cost <Col N="1333" /> of the change should not be substantial. With that reservation, with regard to certain matters which arise out of the question of teachers' pensions I recommend wholeheartedly to the House the adoption of the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the nature of documents like these Statutory Rules and Orders that they are rather difficult to follow.  I am afraid the explanation given to the House by the Minister as to what this Order contains might be appropriately described as an explanation of what is obscure by what is more obscure, so far as the majority of the Seanad is concerned.  My attitude towards this Order is the same as that of Senator Hayes.  We both come before the Minister rather in the position of Oliver Twist: we consider the fare we have got so far is on the poor side, but we are prepared to take it and we want some more.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the Order is satisfactory, but it does not go at all far enough to meet the requirements of the secondary teachers.  There are deficiencies in this pensions scheme, as compared with practically all others pension schemes, and it cannot be regarded as a complete scheme until those deficiencies are supplied.  In that connection, it is a pity that the Minister should proceed to make these arrangements without any consultation at all&mdash;so far as I understand&mdash;between his Department and the secondary teachers themselves.  There are many organisations connected with education in this country, and there is a very strong and flourishing organisation of lay secondary teachers; and it is a great drawback to the whole situation that schemes like these are devised in the Department, put through the Oireachtas and put into force without any opportunity being given to those concerned with them to put forward their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, there are very serious defects in this pension scheme and this Order does but little to make up those defects.  In the first place, there is the lack of a gratuity on retirement for teachers who come within the scheme.  In practically every other pension scheme&mdash;in the Civil Service, <Col N="1334" /> for instance, and in the universities&mdash; provisions of this kind are contained. I understand that the teachers themselves have indicated that they are prepared to increase their contributions, so as to go some part of the way to provide for those gratuities, which are badly needed.  It is a great pity the Minister has not consulted the teachers, in order to see how far he could meet them in that respect.  That is, perhaps, the most serious grievance the teachers have, but there are other minor grievances in regard to this particular scheme.</P>
    <P>Most other schemes of this kind contain provisions for a gratuity of some kind being paid to the representative of a contributor in the case of the contributor's death.  It is a very normal provision, and everyone will agree that it is just and natural.  There is no such provision in the case of secondary teachers, and it is a great pity that the matter could not have been discussed and some attempt made to cope with it.  Again, there is no provision for the payment of interest on the contributions of a teacher who comes under this scheme and who retires before the pensionable age.  He gets back exactly what he has paid into the scheme, with no interest whatsoever.  That seems almost an injustice.  The teacher's money is taken for a number of years and is used by the Department for the purpose of this scheme; yet, if the teacher retires and claims his own property, he cannot get the benefit of the use made of that money for those years.  It would seem that the teachers have the right to have that little grievance considered and adjusted.  The widow of a teacher does get interest on such contributions, but teachers as a whole have the grievance that, if they have to retire for any reason before reaching the pensionable age, they simply get back the sum paid into the scheme.</P>
    <P>The condition of our secondary teachers is still very far behind that of their brethren in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Indeed, the position with regard to the qualifications of teachers and the financing of our secondary education as a whole is still very much in need of discussion and improvement.  We all seem to accept <Col N="1335" /> the position as the work of nature, and to carry on with a state of affairs that everybody connected with it knows to be highly imperfect.  It is said that nothing can be done about it, whatever the obstacle is and whether it comes from the State or from the other authorities concerned with secondary education.  In any case, those who have contact with the schools know that the position is far from satisfactory. I would not say that all the grievances are on the side of the lay secondary teachers.</P>
    <P>The diocesan secondary schools do wonderful work at an extraordinarily low cost.  They are able to do that largely because the clerical teachers in those schools are mulcted of whatever official salaries they are supposed to earn, for the benefit of the schools. That is a fact well known to anyone connected with the schools, and I submit it is a state of affairs which should not be allowed to continue, in justice to those teachers and for the sake of the efficiency and progress of our secondary education.  The problem is largely one of finance.  As compared with other branches of our education, the secondary system has been financed in a very niggardly fashion, both under the British Government and under our own Governments.  A great deal of money has been spent on preparatory colleges and so on, but the finances still remain highly unsatisfactory, and it is a great pity that there has not been some effort long before now to put them on a better basis.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to which I should like to refer, of which mention was also made by Senator Hayes.  It is the question of the qualifications of teachers.  There again the position is anything but satisfactory and is not at all as good as in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  As far as the qualifications of our secondary teaching staff are concerned, we are in one of the lowest positions in the whole wide world.  I think there is no other country in the world where the method of registration and qualification is such that it secures such a poor quality of teacher in many cases.  That is a fact <Col N="1336" /> recognised, not only by parents and others but by the secondary teachers themselves.  The system of registration is such that it puts a premium on the pass man in secondary education. If a man has an honours degree he finds it not merely harder but, by comparison, almost impossible, to get work in a secondary school, while the pass man, though not as highly trained, is in a much better position.  We are very much behind both Northern Ireland and Great Britain in that respect.  In Northern Ireland teachers are not allowed to teach in secondary schools without having strict qualifications in their special subjects.  Our system is such that almost anyone can teach almost anything in a secondary school, whether he or she is qualified or not. As long as that continues, there will be no progress at all in our secondary education.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes mentioned one important point&mdash;the raising of the number of teachers.  The problem is whether the number of pupils has not risen more rapidly than the number of teachers. That problem is bound up with the question of qualification.  If you have poorly qualified people, struggling to teach a large number of pupils, under very poor financial conditions, with very poor remuneration and very poor conditions of employment, how can you expect to get the best out of that most important part of our whole educational system?  How can we boast about anything in that most important part of our education?  That is well known to be the state of affairs, and I submit that while an Order like this does a certain amount of good in itself it only goes a fraction of the distance the Department will have to go before we have any real improvement in our secondary education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the other speakers have pointed out this particular Order is to be criticised more for what it does not contain, than for what it actually contains.  I wonder could the Minister explain how it is that the teachers are in a worse position in regard to pensions or in a less favourable position than any other class of public servant.  Senator Hayes mentioned that secondary teachers <Col N="1337" /> were alone with regard to this disability. That is not so.  Primary teachers are in the same position.  A civil servant or a servant of a public authority gets a pension, in the case of full service, equivalent to two-thirds of his salary.  If he does not get that by way of actual pension he gets a pension of half his salary plus a lump sum on retirement.  The same thing applies to the servant of a local authority or the Gárda Síochána and often these pensions are given for much less service than the teachers give.  The secondary or primary teacher must have 40 or 45 years' service before he gets the full pension.</P>
      <P>The teacher, whether primary or secondary, gets only half his salary at 45 years.  The civil servant gets half his salary, plus a lump sum equal to a year's salary.  The teacher does not get that lump sum.  I should like to hear from the Minister what is the explanation, if there is any explanation, why teachers are put in that invidious position as compared with other public servants.  It may be said that, so far as national teachers are concerned, they suffered from a similar disability when our own Government took over from the British.  That is so, but the same was the case in Northern Ireland and the disability has been set right there, and teachers, secondary and primary, are now entitled to get this lump sum, and are put in the same position in that respect as other public servants.  The secondary teachers' pensions were introduced by our own Government.  They had no pensions in British times.  But in making the scheme the Government here refused, and still refuses, to insert a provision whereby the teachers would get a lump sum upon retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is something that the public ought to know that the teachers suffer from this disability.  There is another point in the scheme to which I should like to draw attention.  The secondary teacher who has served for some time as a national teacher gets credit for his service as a national teacher when he goes over to the secondary branch, but there is no retrospective arrangement.  If a secondary teacher goes over to the primary <Col N="1338" /> branch, he does not get credit for service in a secondary school.  It only works one way, and I think that that deserves to be put right.  I do not know whether many secondary teachers go over to the primary branch, but some have gone over, and they do not get credit for service in the secondary branch.  I agree with the other speakers as to the deficiency in the scheme.  Senator Tierney complained that the teacher who leaves the service gets back his pension premiums without interest.  The Senator said that the teacher got back exactly what he paid in.  As a matter of fact, he does not, because he gets it back minus income-tax.  I am particularly anxious that the Minister should tell us if there is any good reason why teachers should be placed at a disability compared with other public servants.  When a teacher retires, a lump sum is very useful to him at that time.  The change from full salary to half salary is a big break, and very often he has to set up a new home and go to live in a different district.  A lump sum of a year's salary, or something over, would be of great benefit.  It is the practice to give this in all other branches of the public service, and I see no reason why it should not be done in the case of teachers.</P>

      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on bringing forward this amendment of the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Scheme not only because it remedies a very real hardship but also because it has occasioned a most useful discussion on an important aspect of our national life.  Senators who have spoken&mdash; Senator Hayes and Senator Tierney especially&mdash;have pointed out the ever-growing numbers of pupils attending secondary schools.  The lesson we should draw from that is that the secondary schools are playing an increasingly important part in the life of the country.  The secondary school is the university of most people.  Therefore, it requires a good deal of fostering and it is just that the teachers who are employed should be highly qualified, well paid and contented.  It is not very easy to achieve that.  It seems to me that the whole question of secondary education&mdash;and this has been stressed by other speakers&mdash;is of such importance that it would need special consideration.  It is not too soon to give it such consideration because it is on the quality of our people that our existence as a nation will depend. There are difficulties connected with the secondary school that do not arise perhaps in the case of other schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> As Senator Tierney has stressed, it is really owing to the very unselfish services given by the religious orders, the clergy in the diocesan colleges and the Sisters in the convent secondary schools, that it has been possible to carry on secondary education on the present basis.  It is looked upon as work for God's sake more than for profit.  Secondary education was made available to a great many people under conditions which people in other countries would never have thought of aiming at.  That means that secondary education does not belong to the State.  The State contributes to it but these private schools are, I suppose, private property.  That makes it difficult to solve all the questions that arise in connection with the teachers.</P>
    <P>The great difficulty that I see about it is the insecurity of tenure, as regards teachers, which economic conditions sometimes impose on the schools.  As a consequence there is insecurity of tenure for the teachers, especially women teachers.  A good many of them lose their positions at a time when they are entitled to a fairly good salary.  The conditions in the schools are such that the services of these teachers are dispensed with and they find it hard to get other positions or even to qualify for a good pension. It is a difficult thing to settle.  There are a great many difficulties of a similar nature, but once we recognise the important part which secondary schools play in our national life, we shall face up to these difficulties and, with goodwill on the part of all Parties, we shall arrive at a satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to join in the debate, but some Senators seem to be labouring under a misapprehension, judging from what Senator O'Connell stated.  Officers of local authorities get no lump sum on retirement and the officer of the local authority who dies in harness is merely paid salary up to the date he dies. They do get a maximum pension on the basis of two-thirds of their salaries but they get no gratuity.  As I have said, the pay of an officer of a local authority who dies in harness stops on the day he dies.  His dependents <Col N="1343" /> receive nothing in the nature of a lump sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that perhaps I should explain to the Seanad that the secondary teachers' pension scheme was framed in 1929.  It was not then possible to determine what the probable cost of granting pensions to this very deserving body of public servants would be. The scheme was voluntary in its membership, and it was extremely difficult to give any reliable forecast of the numbers of teachers who would avail themselves of it.  It was arranged to have an actuarial inquiry into the working of the scheme after five years' experience of its operation, and that in the meantime, the State should pay the cost of the pensions from the contributions paid to the fund by teachers and schools.  The actuarial inquiry was held in 1936 and the report showed that a sum of about £380,000 would be necessary to place the pension fund on a solvent basis, that is to say in a position to meet all its liabilities at that date.  I need not pursue the matter of the recommendations which were made by the actuary in that connection.  Anybody who has experience of pension funds knows that a very heavy annual contribution or subsidy is necessary to make a pension fund of that character actuarially sound and solvent beyond question.  It would <Col N="1344" /> have taken a good many thousands, say, £19,000 for 30 years or £16,000 for 40 years, to place the fund on the sound actuarial basis that the actuary would like.</P>
      <P>It was decided, however, that that would not be done, and that contributions would be made to the fund by the State from time to time, according as the additional charges came to fall due and further commitments had to be met.  Up to the end of the financial year 1938-39 the contributions from teachers and schools were sufficient to meet the cost of the pensions.  Since the year 1939-40, a sum has been included in the Vote for secondary education as a contribution to the pension fund.  It amounts to £4,000 in the present year. It will increase annually, and it is believed that, when the pensions reach their maximum, a contribution of £10,000 annually will be necessary on the Vote.  The contribution paid to the fund by teachers and schools during the year 1941 amounted to £10,600.  The cost of pensions and gratuities during that year amounted to £14,000, but it is estimated that this cost will increase annually during the next 30 years to a maximum of about £21,000, of which a little over half will be borne by contributions from teachers and schools, and the remainder by the Government. The anticipated increase in the cost of pensions arises from two causes, an increase in the number of pensioners and in the amount of each pension paid.  The teachers who came in for pensions since the scheme was established had not the service which would entitle them to the larger pension. They were non-contributing to a very large degree, and the value of their service was based on a lower figure than in the case of those who had contributed. When all pensions are calculated on contributing service, that is to say after 1969, it is estimated that the average annual value of pensions will be at least £200.  The maximum pension will be £240 for men and £187 10s. for women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the contributions, at present those are as follows: Each teacher pays 4 per cent. of his salary, and the school in which he <Col N="1345" /> is employed pays 2½ per cent. of his basic salary, £200 for men and £180 for women.  It is estimated that those contributions, if paid throughout the whole period of a teacher's service, would defray about 7/12ths or slightly more than half of the cost of the pensions, and the balance, of course, is borne by the Government.  Many of the existing members of the scheme had teaching service before 1929, but no contributions were paid on that service, and, as I said, the Government had to bear the cost, with the result that a very heavy burden was thrown on the fund since its inception.  I will refer to that matter again.  I want to say with regard to gratuities that the only gratuities for which provision is made in the scheme are: (a) a short service gratuity which consists of a refund of the contributions paid by the teacher to the fund.  This gratuity is paid to a teacher who retires from the scheme and is ineligible for the grant of a pension; (b) a gratuity paid to the representatives of a member on his death. This consists of his contributions to the fund together with compound interest at 3 per cent.  This gratuity might amount to a year's salary or more, but the teacher would need to have very long service&mdash;30 years I think&mdash;before the gratuity would reach that amount. As has been pointed out, the gratuities under this scheme are short of the Civil Service gratuity.  In the Civil Service, a gratuity amounting to a year's salary is paid to the representatives of a civil servant who dies while actually in the service, and also in the case of retiral a civil servant is given a lump sum amounting to one year's salary.  If we were to consider giving the same type of gratuity to secondary teachers, it would mean a big additional cost on the scheme, and the State would have to make further financial provision.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any possibility of the rather large financial provision which would be necessary being made available at present, owing to the war situation.  Even in normal times, I think the history of the fund will clearly show even those who are most sympathetic to the claims of the teachers&mdash;I should like to be classed amongst that section&mdash;that a very <Col N="1346" /> strong case could be made, from the actuarial point of view, against putting additional charges on the fund unless we are absolutely satisfied that we are making arrangements for additional contributions accordingly from one source or another.  If it is claimed that the teachers would be willing to pay for this gratuity, all I can suggest is that, so far as one particular gratuity is concerned&mdash;that is the gratuity applicable in the case of a teacher who might die while actually in the service &mdash;the matter might be further considered, but, as Senator O Buachalla has pointed out, it would probably be shown that, if the teachers were to approach a good insurance company and ask them for terms for endowment insurance, they would probably get terms which would compare very favourably with what even a generous Minister for Finance, if there be such&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would be prepared to grant.  It is forgotten, and I am glad that the Senator pointed out, that one does not get back from the insurance company or from the State what one has paid in.  If we were to include the other type of gratuity, where the teacher retires from the service and would get a year's pay, say, if he were to get the same treatment as a civil servant, that would involve a big financial consideration, because that body of teachers, which is so very ably represented by Senator O'Connell, would be very likely to ask a question as to why they should not get what the secondary teachers were getting, and in that case it would probably run into six figures, so that as regards the gratuity on retirement I do not think it is practicable.  Any assistance I can give in making the case, if it is put up to me, I shall certainly give, but I see no hope whatever of anything being done while the war lasts, even if the teachers show that they themselves are prepared to bear heavy additional contributions to secure this concession. Perhaps the question of a gratuity in cases of death in the service might be examined further, but I should like to make it clear that that, of course, is not a matter for me.  There is the <Col N="1347" /> question of what the teachers are prepared to do, and there is the question of what the Minister for Finance is prepared to do at the present time.</P>
      <P>There have been complaints that consultation was not made with the representatives of the teachers.  Actually, although no formal consultation took place about the introduction of this scheme, the fact is that the particular amendment to which I have referred&mdash; the amendment to Section 9 of the main scheme, permitting teachers over 50 years of age to re-enter the scheme; where, for some reason or another they had ceased to be members, on the same basis as teachers under 50 years of age &mdash;arose from representations made to the Department of Education by the secondary teachers, and it was to meet the case of two teachers that this amending scheme was brought in.</P>
      <P>Any Minister who has to deal with pension schemes will, therefore, always be faced with this position that, if, as in this particular case, he brings before the Oireachtas proposals for the amendment of the main scheme to cover particularly hard cases which are few in number, he will be immediately told from all sides of the House: &ldquo;Oh, this is nothing, nothing at all.  You are omitting this, that and the other.&rdquo; The fact is that the scheme was brought in as a result of representations with regard to a small number of cases, and if I had left the matter so, it would have been left so.  If I had tried to get the Minister for Finance to put in all these proposals which we now hear of, of course the scheme would probably never have seen the light, and, in any case, it was only when we sent a copy of the scheme to the teachers, early last month, that this complaint was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you are amending a scheme to cover hard cases, you cannot amend it <i>in globo</i> without having regard for the whole character and history of the fund.  I had a great deal of experience of the troubles that arose in connection with the national teachers' fund when the new scheme of salaries was brought in&mdash;and a very worthy step it was under a foreign Government&mdash;improving greatly the salary rates of the teachers.  Corresponding changes were <Col N="1348" /> not made in the rates of contribution, with the result that the national teachers' pension fund got into an insolvent condition.  Once these funds start going wrong, they seem to go wrong at a rate of geometrical progression, falling very rapidly over a period of a few years until they become so lop-sided as to be almost completely insolvent.  We have taken the whole of that responsibility on the annual Estimate for the Department of Education. It is a very substantial proportion of the annual cost of education and, by the time it reaches its maximum in the 1960's, I think, the Exchequer will be bearing a cost of £540,000 annually, which keen financiers or actuaries might describe as, to a certain extent, uncovenanted benefit, and that is an annual charge.</P>
    <P>The trouble with these annual charges without funds or satisfactory contributions to meet them is&mdash;it has been a source of worry to me, at any rate&mdash;that if we were going through a very catastrophic period and slashing economies were being made in all directions, it is a very bad thing from the point of view of education, as well as from the point of view of strict finance that these should be solely dependent on annual provision by the Exchequer.  It was most unfortunate that the funds of the Intermediate Education Board were dissipated and not kept for this purpose.  However, future contingencies cannot be provided for, and, no doubt, there is a strong case against providing funds of this character to meet the entire actuarial commitments.  But, at the same time, it is unsatisfactory that the whole burden should be thrown on the annual Estimate.  I merely state that so that Senators will see there is another side to the case and that is the side, of course, that a Minister for Education or any of the secondary teachers themselves will have to bear in mind when they are making a case for additional benefits.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes referred to the question of the register, and Senator Tierney is not satisfied with the method of registration.  He thinks, perhaps, it is the lowest in the wide world.  I do not know whether we are quite as <Col N="1349" /> badly off as that, but, in any case, the matter is receiving attention, and we are examining the question as to whether a standard qualification, such as a university degree, cannot be fixed for all teachers in secondary schools. We are in touch with the schools in the matter, but it will be recognised that a certain amount of time must be given when a decision is reached, to enable the schools to make arrangements to carry such proposals into effect, and we are not taking any decision at present, because I do not think the time is suitable, nor would it be right to inflict what might be claimed to be disabilities or serious inconveniences on schools which have their own troubles arising out of the war situation.  Nevertheless, we are examining the matter and we have asked the schools to supply us with information in future, particularly as regards the qualifications of new teachers entering the service.</P>

      <P>I am glad to be able to inform the Senator of the latest figure, since I gave the answer in the Dáil, of the number of registered teachers employed in the schools. It would be no harm to have them on the official record.  The number of registered men teachers was then 927, and women, 867, a total of 1,794.  I think that represents roughly the same percentage increase&mdash;about 21 per cent., but I have not worked out the figures for the previous year. With regard to unregistered teachers, I find there is a definite improvement for 1940-41 in the case of men.  The number has fallen from 610 in 1939-40, to 565 in 1940-41, with the result that <Col N="1350" /> over the period since 1932-33 it would now seem there is an actual decrease in the number of unregistered men teachers.</P>
      <P>In the case of women, the position is different.  There has been a further increase, and for the last year, 1940-41, the figure stood at 814.  The total number of unregistered teachers was 1,279, which represents a decrease over the corresponding year in the total number of unregistered teachers, owing to the rather substantial fall in the number of men, but there is still an increase in the number of unregistered teachers, the gross number, over the 1932-33 period.  I think the percentage, however, will go down on account of the fall in the number of unregistered men teachers.  I should, perhaps, explain as the matter has been raised that a large number of the unregistered teachers are part-time teachers. For instance, in the year 1939-40, out of a total of 1,402 unregistered teachers, 865 or 61.7 per cent. were part-time teachers.  These teachers are for special subjects such as physical training or music, and they have not the qualifications to enable them to be registered under the existing conditions.</P>
      <P>We are endeavouring, as I have said, to discourage the employment in future of teachers who are not properly qualified, and we intend to urge upon the schools that they should not employ persons as teachers who have not the necessary academic qualifications for registration.  Senator Tierney may be interested to know that there are 642 graduates with honours degrees out of a total of, roughly, 1,800.  As Senator Concannon has pointed out, secondary education is under the control of the Church in this country.  The only function of the Minister is to provide grants for the schools in accordance with conditions laid down by him, and also to prescribe certain regulations regarding the qualifications of teachers, the courses to be followed, and examinations, so that the question&mdash;a rather vexed one&mdash;of security of tenure is not very relevant and is not a matter for me.  A discussion on it might lead us very far afield.</P>

      <P>If a teacher's service is broken it affects his or her pension rights.  I should have mentioned, perhaps, that Senator O'Connell's teachers have the advantage in that, since the 1934 superannuation scheme, in the case of teachers dying while in the service one year's salary is allowed, or a refund of pension premiums plus 2½ per cent. compound interest, whichever is the greater.  This amount is paid to the teacher's dependent if the teacher had at least five years' pensionable service at the date of death. That was given because we were trying to make a final settlement of this terribly vexed question of national teachers' pensions.  The secondary teachers' scheme, which was introduced in 1929, has come up for amendment now, and, as I explained, the principal reason this motion has been introduced is to deal with a small number of hard cases.  However, the House may like to have the information which I have given.</P>
      <P>I should like to explain to Senator Hayes that the £18,000 additional cost which would result from paying the incremental salaries monthly instead of quarterly would arise only in the first year in which the monthly system of payments would be introduced.  There would, however, be no possibility whatever of getting that additional provision made during the present year&mdash; or even in coming years.  While it may be said that it would be to the advantage of teachers to get their payments monthly and that payment on that basis should not involve a large amount of staff, it would involve the employment of some staff.  Leaving that question aside, the Minister for Finance would object to increasing his liabilities under the Budget by £18,000 even though, from the Senator's point of view, it would be merely bringing forward the payment.</P>

      <P>I think that the salary of staff would be the only addition, apart from bringing the payment forward, but there is the difficulty, even if this concession were granted&mdash; I do not think it will be&mdash;that the returns do not come in from the schools until the first quarter of the year is well advanced, with the result that the payments could not be made monthly in the first quarter.  Even if staff were provided and the Minister for Finance were agreeable, it would be only at Christmas that we could do what the Senator desires.  If the position is that teachers are not paid monthly, I would suggest that, since the schools are responsible for the major portion of the salary, an approach ought to be made to them in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I have just been informed that the Taxes and Duties (Special Circumstances) Bill, 1942, has been passed by the Dáil and has been certified to be a Money Bill.  I understand that the Bill is being forwarded to us this evening.  Under Standing Order No. 69, if a meeting of the Seanad has not been arranged for within seven days of the receipt of such a Bill, the Standing Order enjoins that the Seanad shall be forthwith summoned to meet within seven days after such receipt.  That would necessitate a meeting of the Seanad next Wednesday. I may say that it was not my intention to suggest to the House that it should meet before Wednesday, the 17th June, when we will have two&mdash;and possibly three&mdash;other Bills, and there will probably be a motion left over from to-day.  In the circumstances I think it would meet with the convenience of the House if we also postpone the Second Reading of the Taxes and Duties Bill until that date.</P>

    <P>If the House would be good enough to make an order that the Second <Col N="1353" /> Stage of the Bill be taken on the 17th June, then there would be no necessity for a special meeting on next Wednesday. Perhaps the House would be agreeable to that course.</P>

      <P>I fear I shall not be as comfortable in speaking on this motion as I was when speaking in Irish on the pension scheme with which we have just dealt.  Nevertheless, the motion is one of very great importance and, arising out of it, there are a few points with which I should like to deal. For that reason, I must brace myself to the task and say what I proposed to say.  In the first place, I want to declare that I agree with the main theme of the motion&mdash;that is to say, that the Government should encourage wheat production over a number of years.  I should like to say, also, how glad I was to notice the names which were attached to this motion.  I welcome those Senators into the ranks of those who believe in wheat growing as a national policy.</P>
      <P>Three people have spoken already whose views are of outstanding importance. Perhaps I will not be blamed if I mention them&mdash;Senator McGee, Senator Byrne and Senator O'Callaghan. Each of them has wide public experience. They are known to us all as being very practical farmers.  The pleasing feature of their speeches was that they agree on essentials&mdash;they agree especially that wheat growing in Ireland is feasible, that it is sound national policy and that is in the best interests of the farmers as individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am in agreement with the proposal contained in the motion and in the amendment suggested, there are a few points with which I do not agree or rather about which I am uneasy.  In the first place, I would much rather that the motion had been framed so as to avoid the idea of prescribing a restricted period over which the national wheat production policy should be pursued. I agree with Senator Byrne and Senator O'Callaghan that in this House <Col N="1354" /> we should unite in a declaration to the effect that this country should never again allow itself to get into the state of affairs similar to that which has existed in regard to wheat and flour supplies during the past two years.  On that ground alone, we should make up our minds that wheat production should be a fixed, determined, long-period policy.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to declare in favour of the price set down in the motion.  That is not because I consider the price too low or too high, but because I believe it is unwise for us to declare for any definite price in respect of any term longer than a year, or say two years at the outside.  I believe in an adequate price.  I believe in a fair price. Anything more than a fair price to the farmer or to anybody else for the produce means inflicting on the general body of consumers an unfair burden, a burden which ultimately will involve the farmer himself in difficulties.  When people find they have been mulcted unduly, they will rise against it and end it.  On the other hand, we certainly should be determined not to allow the farmer to be put off with anything less than a reasonable return for his labour and services.</P>
    <P>If it is true, as Senator McGee pointed out last night, that farmers are being deprived of what is their due, of what is the fixed price for millable wheat, I hope the Minister for Agriculture will pursue the people responsible with the same determination that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is showing in dealing with delinquents in other directions. There is no point in declaring for this named price&mdash;it is the weakness of the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>My conviction is that once we get over the difficulties surrounding the initiation of a national wheat policy, once we get a wheat tradition established, the economic consequences will be so beneficial to the farming community as a whole that reasonably cheap wheat and flour <Col N="1355" /> will ultimately be made available to the community.  Perhaps I should explain that idea in a little more detail. Senator McGee pointed out last night the need for great care in the matter of seed selection.  He dealt with the advantage that must follow our going to the utmost limits to find out the particular kind of seed best suited to different soils and different districts. We can rely on men like Professor Caffrey and those associated with him to do all they possibly can to improve seed strains and develop perhaps new strains which will be particularly suitable to this country.  The system of trial and error will have to be dominant for some time and, consequently, there is bound to be cases of loss here and there.</P>
      <P>Senator McGee dealt with his experiences of seed failures.  I am familiar with cases where seed has failed, but I am also familiar with cases where the crop has succeeded very well indeed.  I am familiar with cases of growers, men who certainly did not vote for or support the wheat policy at the last elections, but who have been very enthusiastic wheat producers for some years past.  As soon as we get over the initial difficulties, the production of wheat must tend to become more and more efficient and, consequently, more and more economic. Again, it is generally accepted that grass lands improve very much as a result of ploughing and as a result of their being put through proper rotations.</P>
      <P>The eminent authorities&mdash;Hall and Stapledon across the water, and Caffrey and Twomey and others on this side&mdash;are agreed that that is so.  There are practical farmers, members of this House, like Senator Byrne and Senator O'Callaghan, and there are also men outside the House, like Mr. Green, another well-known farmer, who are agreed also that it is sound policy to break up those grass lands, put them through a proper rotation, and then put them down to grass again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that in the train of a good wheat policy there must follow many decided advantages to the other branches of agricultural production. Good grass lands mean that stock will <Col N="1356" /> develop and mature quickly.  Good grass lands mean lush and luxurious feeding for dairy stock, with improved milk yields; and what is very important, they mean much better general health for the stock, and what is still further important, a better chance of reducing the calf mortality which is such a very unpleasant feature of the stock-raising branch of agriculture. Now this must result in a great improvement in the incomes of the farmers, and this in turn must reflect itself, in my opinion in more advantageous prices being fixed for wheat and flour, from the point of view of the community.  Further, I think it is agreed that the carrying capacity of our grass lands leaves a good deal to be desired.  I am not going to trouble the House with comparative figures as between this and other countries, but I think if you take the figure for pasture alone, we carry only about 1¼ head of stock to the acre while, if you include hay, you will find that the figure is considerably less.  That is hardly satisfactory.  Senator Byrne raised the matter in the course of his speech and he pointed out that a large increase in live stock is quite consistent with an extended, and if necessary, a compulsorily extended, tillage area, including compulsory wheat cultivation.</P>
    <P>In this connection it is interesting to recall that accompanying the expansion of wheat growing which took place during Grattan's regime as a result of Foster's Corn Laws of 1784, a very considerable expansion also took place in the numbers of live stock in the country.  If that happened then, there is no earthly reason why the same thing should not happen now.  A development of this kind from its beneficial effect on the whole industry, provided always of course that the market will be there for live stock and live-stock products, must contribute in its turn towards making wheat production more and more an economic possibility and must result eventually in wheat and wheat products being made available to the community at reasonable prices. In view of this, I think it would not be wise to fix a definite price for wheat as is suggested in the motion, that is a price to cover any period longer than <Col N="1357" /> a year or two years, because one can visualise the farming industry being in a position up to a certain point to provide wheat at decreasing prices once the initial difficulties are got over. Again, the factor of a decreasing fertility of the soil may have to be contended with though, as far as I am concerned, I certainly take the view of the authoritative evidence that has been put up to us that there is not much danger in this regard.  That is, that given a proper approach to this problem, declining fertility of the soil should not cause any undue worry for many years to come.</P>

I do not know if he said that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Baxter for drawing my attention to the matter.  All I can say is that if I have misquoted Professor Caffrey, I should like to withdraw what I have said.  It has been put to me that the statement has come from the Department's authorities.  These gentlemen I would consider as authorities whose word should receive every consideration.  I put most of the officials of that Department in no position that would be inferior to that occupied by Professor Caffrey, and his is undoubtedly a very eminent position.  Apart from that, it is quite possible that manures may not always be as scarce as they are at present.  The war will hardly last as long as the period during which the reserve fertility of our soil can be <Col N="1358" /> relied upon to last.  It could last as long or it could last longer, but I am inclined to the view that it will not last as long.</P>
      <P>A further argument against declaring for a fixed price ahead, that is for a price for longer than a year or at the outside two years, is the possibility of a serious change occurring in the value of money.  The tendency to inflation is there.  Most Senators are familiar with the evidences of it.  Remittances are coming in to poor families, and they are being spent almost immediately; they are being spent in full.  At the same time, many other people believe that they should have a good time while they can, and so are spending all they can, as quickly as they can.  In fact, &ldquo;spending&rdquo; is not the word; &ldquo;dissipating&rdquo; would be really the correct word.  Those factors are there, factors which the Government is forced to battle against day in and day out.  It is those factors that gave rise in recent times to a series of Orders of various kinds, all of which are proving very unpleasant and irksome.  I may remind the House that we have heard advocated&mdash;I sometimes wonder whether it was advocated seriously or not&mdash;by Senator Johnston and Senator Tierney, for instance, that we should go in for something like an official inflation policy.  As a matter of fact I think a figure of something like £4,000,000 was suggested.  I cannot visualise the Irish people supporting such a suggestion, yet there is a real danger of inflation, whether voluntary or involuntary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry for detaining the House so long on what might seem a very small point, that is of declaring definitely for a certain price, 50/- in this case.  I do not intend to discuss it any further, except that I want to suggest this, that in view of what I have said I think it ought to be clear that we should be very slow to declare for the price mentioned or far any fixed price for longer than the period I have mentioned. If, as Senator the McGillycuddy has suggested just now, or rather has implied, the insertion of the figure <Col N="1359" /> of 50/- was merely to indicate a call for a reasonable price for each year's crop, then I for one would be prepared to let it go.</P>
    <P>But even if, in the last analysis, wheat could not be produced in this country except at a price that would, apparently, compare unfavourably with that obtaining in other countries, we would still be justified in paying that apparently higher price, granted that there was no abuse.</P>

      <P>If we paid a premium for 25 years for a sure and steady wheat supply, and, at the end, we were faced with a war anything like approaching what is being waged at the moment, we would consider we had come out of it very cheaply at the price we would have paid.  The amendment put down by Senator Byrne appeals to me very strongly.  It is not so very <Col N="1360" /> long since we were debating this subject before, and the arguments for compulsion were then fully stated.</P>
      <P>In the case of the small farmer there is little need for compulsion. There is little need to compel him to till generally, or to produce wheat specifically.  It may be, notwithstanding the appeals that have been made and the energy that was put into the campaign to bring home to the agricultural community as a whole the urgency of providing in full for our wheat supplies, that we may be short when this harvest comes to be reaped. I hope we will not, but I would say this, that I join with other Senators in appealing to the Minister to go into the matter immediately, and to consider whether he should not seek even far more drastic powers than he has at the moment to compel certain types of landholders in this country to do their proper share during this crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth while noting that in certain parts of the country there is a very strong tillage tradition, while in other parts of the country there is little or no such tradition.  For instance, I think of the people in the west of Ireland, placed on the inferior lands.  I think of the people in some of the Ulster counties, who are in the same position, and I can recall the energy they put into their work and the extent to which they go in for tillage.  I recall with a good deal of pride the success with which those people have ridden whatever storms beset their industry in recent years. I also think then of other holders, small holders in a way, in other parts of the country, and notice the lack of tillage tradition there; I notice the slowness with which they are prepared to take the advice that has been tendered to them.  I wonder is there any reason for it?  I often wonder whether the small men of the west and of other parts of the country who were driven off good lands, to Hell or to Connaught, are not, when all is said and done, in all truth the more really representative of the old Irish agriculturists. I think the influence of the large estate holders seems to have affected very strongly many of the men among whom those estates have been divided.  I am not finding fault <Col N="1361" /> with them.  They came into a tradition hundreds of years old, and it is very hard to break a tradition, but it is interesting to note that, where there are bad lands, you have no difficulty in the matter of getting the people to till or even to change over to something new, whereas, where the lands are good, there is considerable difficulty in getting them to do so.  It seems to me that the influence of the landlord is still to be felt in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say about the motion specifically, but there were a few further points made in the course of the debate to which I should like to refer.  For instance, I should like to compliment Senator McGee on stating as he did his approval of the work of the agricultural instructors.  That is what I would expect from a man of his experience and breadth of vision.  He mentioned the advisability of articles in the newspapers regarding developments in agriculture, and I agree with that.  I should like to see a stronger bias being shown in our newspapers towards agriculture, but at the same time I do not think we should overlook the fact that in the Press&mdash;that is to say in the <i>Irish Press</i> in particular&mdash;from time to time very good accounts have been given of particular farms and of the methods adopted to get good results.  Articles appear, to my own knowledge, every week in the <i>Irish Press</i> and in the <i>Irish Independent</i> relating to agriculture. Again, there appears every year from each county committee of agriculture, an annual report which contains a first-hand account supplied by their agricultural instructors of the experiments they carry out and of their results.  I wonder to what extent these annual reports are circulated and to what extent they are studied by the agricultural community.  Anyway, I want to say that I thoroughly agree with the suggestion of Senator McGee that we should go in more and more for the publication of reports and accounts, such as he mentioned, in the daily Press as well as in the weekly Press and in periodicals.  That is a very important matter, if we are to develop as quickly, as surely and as safely as we can a tradition which it now seems we all believe to be desirable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" /> He mentioned also a very important matter, and I think Senator Baxter underlined it for him.  That was the advisability of an insurance scheme for crops.  I remember I was not very long here when a Bill was introduced&mdash;I think Senator Counihan had a good deal to do with it&mdash;the object of which was to provide an insurance scheme for stock in certain circumstances, and I then expressed the hope that it might be the forerunner of a series of important insurance schemes to cover agricultural activities generally.  We should consider it, but I think that the man who really might set the ball rolling would be Senator McGee himself, because I think I am right in saying that he is a man with considerable experience in insurance matters.  Between himself and men like Senator O'Callaghan and those connected with the Beet Growers' Association, a scheme might be formulated and put up to the Minister, as Senator Counihan and his friends did in regard to the particular matter in which they were interested. I think if they did that there would be no very great difficulty in our getting an insurance scheme applicable to crops and, I believe, to other departments of agricultural endeavour.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane made a point which was interesting, and that is that it would be a good thing if we had not exactly State farms but model farms, run by the people themselves throughout the country.  Incidentally our aim should be to make every farm a model farm.  Some years ago I was anxious to get a first-hand insight into the conditions obtaining in agriculture. I admitted here before that I would not be a good judge of land or of stock, and I took the very necessary precaution of getting help.  I almost kidnapped one of our best-known Deputies, a man whose knowledge of stock and of soil and agriculture generally is above question.  I made him come along with me.  We came across some examples of well-run farms&mdash;farms, believe it or not, on which the owners declared they had made money.  In one case, where the owner had come into business on the crest of the 1931 crisis and battled through what is now called the economic war, he had cleared himself <Col N="1363" /> of his debts, purchased some valuable machinery, and had something to credit over and above.</P>
    <P>But I asked: &ldquo;Do your neighbours come to see how you get on?  Do they ask you questions, or do they take any great interest in your methods?&rdquo;  The answer I got was that they did not, they did not seem to mind.  Our aim should be to raise the level of every farm to that of a model farm, but I mention this point only in order that Senator Sir John Keane might know that throughout the country there are excellently-run farms and that their influence, generally speaking, is not as great as might be expected.</P>
    <P>I listened last night to a severe but unfair attack being made on the Taoiseach and on the Minister for Agriculture. I agree with the very vigorous and proper protest made by Senator O'Callaghan.  I am glad that it was he who made the protest because he is a farmer, a man, as I said already, of wide experience and a very practical man.  I think that that protest made by Senator O'Callaghan&mdash;I am sorry it did not get the publicity to which it was entitled&mdash;would be endorsed by every right-thinking Irish farmer.  That classification would include every small farmer and a good sprinkling of the bigger men.  On the other hand, it may be no harm that these attacks be made on Ministers and be made as vigorously as they are made.  It may be that they do a great deal of good.  We can remember the attacks hurled at the Taoiseach for a long time.  These attacks had the effect of causing people to think.  They had the effect of getting people to ask questions and that was just what was wanted.  The result is that no man stands higher in the estimation of the Irish people to-day, both for his character and for his capacity as a statesman, than the Taoiseach.  The same can be said of the Minister for Supplies. He has had a rough passage, but I doubt if his stock was ever as high as it is to-day.  Why?  Because these attacks cause the people to inquire more than ever: &ldquo;Who is this <Col N="1364" /> man and what is the implication of these attacks?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In Belfast the other evening I met some business men, men with a reputation for hard-headiness, and we talked about conditions in this country.  I was interested to hear what was practically an echo of a remark I once made myself with regard to the same Minister for Supplies. That was, that his great fault was that he was too good for his job.  If he had been less competent, if he had shown less ability in the early days of the war, those responsible for carrying on certain branches of the trade and industry of the country would have realised their own particular responsibilities earlier, and we might have been saved a good deal of what we were let in for.  I think that the Minister for Agriculture would be wise to look at the attacks that are hurled against him in much the same way.  The more he is attacked, the more people are asking: &ldquo;Who is this Minister for Agriculture, and to what extent does he deserve these attacks?&rdquo; The more they ask that, the more they will realise the service that man has rendered and the service he has attempted to render but which was sabotaged during this emergency.</P>
    <P>During the debate, I heard a great many inconsistencies.  We heard, for instance, the work of the last Government praised and the work of the present Government derided.  No man would be more willing to compliment the last Government on what it did and what it attempted to do than I.  I realise that the members of that Government did their best according to their lights.  I wish they had acted differently but I, certainly, agree that the Minister for Agriculture of the time, Mr. Hogan, put his heart into his job, believed that he was right, and did all that a man could do to carry out his work well in the interests of the Irish people.  I do not agree that he was right, but I must give honour where honour is due.  But then to tell me that the work of the present Government has been to land this country into difficulty is just a little too much.  It means treating us as if we do not see the advantages conferred by the present Government <Col N="1365" /> on all sides and as if we could not realise how much better off we might be if the people who charge them with incompetence had not played the part they did and had not acted as saboteurs in the work which they should have been helping and to which they should have bent all the energy they could.</P>
    <P>Senator Crosbie made a speech last night and I wonder if he was in earnest or if he realised what he was saying.  He suggests that our difficulty to-day in obtaining our full complement of raw materials is proof that nature did not intend that this country should engage in industrial activity, that it was decreed by nature that this country should just be a ranch or a back-garden for another country.  I wonder if Senator Crosbie was in earnest.  Does Senator Crosbie mean to tell me that it was nature decreed that the great cattle industry of the 17th century should have collapsed as it did?  Does Senator Crosbie mean to tell me that it was an act of nature that the infamous ordinances of 1663, 1666 and 1668 should have been passed to cripple and strangle that great industry and throw the people of this country into the direst poverty, Catholic and Protestant alike, rob them of their national wealth and reduce them to the status of beggars? Does Senator Crosbie mean to tell me that it was nature decreed that the woollen industry should have failed, as it failed?  This country whose people had been held up as master craftsmen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It has to do with the speech made last night.  It has to do, also, with the question of wheat production and industrial policy.  Does Senator Crosbie mean to tell me that it was nature decreed that our linen and glass industries should have gone as they went?  Does he mean to tell me that it was nature decreed that clauses should be inserted in whatever leases were granted during the 18th century forbidding tillage?  Does he mean to tell me that it was nature decreed that tithes should be transferred <Col N="1366" /> from pasture to tillage?  The only people engaged in tillage were the unfortunate people driven off the good lands on to the bad lands.  They were faced with the terrible task of eking out an existence as best they could on those bad lands, with high rents, and these tithes on top of them.  Was it nature decreed that our agricultural community should have been plundered as they were plundered by the imposition of higher and higher rents every time a man took his courage in his hands and attempted to improve any holding he was allowed to have?  Was it nature decreed the infamous Act of Union, which it was believed would bring about the ruin of the Irish people economically and culturally?</P>
      <P>I wonder if Senator Crosbie was sincere, or if he has considered it is better ultimately for the Irish people that we should export our men and women rather than import certain raw materials to give a living to as many as possible in their own country.  He says we should not engage in industry, because we have not all the raw materials.  I wonder if he knows anything about Irish economic history over the past 250 years.  I wonder to what extent he would hold that other countries should give up their industrial activities because they have to import certain raw materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nature has not endowed us with an undue proportion of the world's wealth, nor with a vast territory; it has, on the other hand, given us a reasonable share of natural resources, a small but fertile country, with a favourable climate.  It has given us a good people, even though we may find fault with them when they do not do things as some of us would like or as rapidly as some of us would like.  When one considers the treatment meted out to our people, and the terrible conditions under which Irish agriculturists had to live during the 18th century and during most of the last century, and when one considers that our people were denied every access to education &mdash;even to the language of their homes, for speaking which many were put to death&mdash;it is really marvellous that the men of to-day should be as good as they are.  If these people <Col N="1367" /> get half a chance, if the agitators will let them alone, I believe they will not hesitate to accept the lead given to them by Senators McGee, Byrne and O'Callaghan, when those Senators, in the course of their speeches last night, agreed on the essentials necessary to the country's progress and well-being.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will accept the motion and the amendment proposed by Senator Byrne.  I believe that, as far as Senator McGee is concerned, he desires that we should push ahead with the wheat policy; and, as far as Senator Byrne is concerned, he realises there is a certain opposition which it may be impossible to get over in a voluntary way and for the overcoming of which we may have to adopt pretty severe compulsion.  The acceptance of the motion and the amendment will give a most advisable lead to the country at the present time.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to cover anything like the ground covered by Senator O Buachalla.  Notwithstanding his cool and collected manner, and his calm method of addressing the House, I consider him to be a very astute politician, and I think he has made a very astute political speech.  I do not know that he was altogether in order when he went away from the subject of the motion and the amendment to give us a eulogy of An Taoiseach, of the Minister for Supplies and of the Minister for Agriculture, of course. From the statements he made, the rumours about the possibility of an early election seem to have something in them.</P>
      <P>The Senator was not satisfied with the eulogy, without having a rap at the leader of the Opposition.  Possibly I am not in order, but I think the Senator was not in order, either.  However, he made a statement that Deputy Cosgrave made some speech somewhere last night.  I did not see any record of it, and do not know anything about it; but to state that anything said by Deputy Cosgrave meant that he was in favour of this country being turned into a ranch must be regarded as having no foundation whatever.</P>

      <P>My principal reason for rising in connection with this matter is that Senator Ó Buachalla stated he was very strongly in favour of the amendment, and I am very strongly opposed to it.  Some months ago a motion was put down by Senator Baxter advocating a minimum price of 50/- per barrel for wheat.  Senator Byrne put down an amendment, similar to the one he has down to-day, advocating that compulsory powers be taken for the growing of a certain area of wheat by each farmer.  On that occasion I and a number of others were opposed to that amendment.  Having voted against it, we were in a very awkward position when the motion, with the amendment, was put to the House.  As a matter of fact, Senator Baxter was so much opposed to the amendment that he had to vote against his own motion.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinConlon" hpid="Mr. Conlon Mr. Conlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as amended.  I think this is within the Standing Orders, as being relative to the subject, but I do not think it is fair.  Personally, I am in favour of the motion but I am against the amendment.  On the last occasion, I voted for the motion as amended, because I was in favour of paying the 50/-, which the farmers got subsequently.  I am in favour of the motion, however, and I think it is not necessary to say much in favour of it, as the case made by Senator The McGillycuddy is an excellent one.  I listened to Senator Johnston and was not quite clear as to his attitude.  I think he must be opposed to the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time I think that some of the arguments put forward by the <Col N="1369" /> Senator against the motion would seem to me to be arguments in favour of it.  For instance he said there was likely to be a glut of wheat in several countries such as Canada, the United States, Australia and other places after the war, and that this wheat could be obtained very cheaply.  I support the motion in order to prevent dumping of large quantities of wheat, in case the war ends quickly and in order to keep up the guaranteed price for a period.  If Senator Byrne were present I would appeal to him to withdraw his amendment and to let the motion stand on its merits.  It should be put to him that it would be fairer to the House that he should withdraw the amendment, because practically everybody is in favour of the motion. I know that Senator Buckley put up an argument in favour of the amendment but that is debatable.  I want to hear the Minister dealing with the terms of the amendment.  It could not be put into operation until there would be a survey of all the silos.  That would take a considerable time and the cost of inspection would be expensive as a number of inspectors would be required.  We should wait until we see what the result of the wheat return for this year will be.  The farmers do not need compulsion to grow wheat.  They realise the situation as well as anybody else.  I am against forcing the farmers unless it is shown to be absolutely necessary to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, Senator Buckley, I think, misunderstood some of my arguments. Nothing was further from my mind than to attack the Taoiseach whose name I only mentioned once, or the Minister for Supplies whose name I did not mention at all.  I consider the Minister for Supplies has sufficient to do without my getting up in this House or anywhere else and attacking him.  I am sorry the Senator did not deal with the points of my remarks which made suggestions for the propagation of wheat.  I did not suggest we should scrap the industries we have.  We have many industries including one of the most important, the <Col N="1370" /> woollen industry in which the raw materials are native of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this motion with regard to wheat production, it is only right that we should first pay tribute to those farmers who answered the call last year and produced sufficient wheat to meet our requirements, or at least to carry us over to the middle of July, and to those farmers who have increased their area under wheat.  Also we should not let the occasion pass without paying a tribute to those brave men of our merchant fleet who are risking their lives day after day bringing wheat across the seas under very difficult circumstances. They deserve a high tribute from this House and from the people for saving us from a very awkward position in which we might probably jeopardise our neutrality.  I am glad to hear from the Minister that our supplies are quite safe up to July or August, and I hope these men will continue to help the Irish people to pass safely through the period of the war. I am in the position of not agreeing either with the motion or with the amendment.  I do not agree with the motion, because it does not specify the period over which this guarantee of 50/- a barrel to the farmer is to operate.  We all agree that farmers must get and should get sufficient remuneration for their efforts on the land.  At the same time, the motion is too vague.  A period might be three, five, 15 or 20 years, and later on some Government might be accused of breaking faith with the farmers on the ground that this House passed a resolution guaranteeing a minimum price for wheat.  But what is the period which Senator Crosbie and the other Senators asked us to guarantee that price for?  That is one question I would like the Senators to deal with before we take a vote.  One Senator suggested three years, but I would like to have it in writing.  There is nothing as specific as what is put in black and white.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like to know exactly what is in the Senator's mind, so that any Government could not be accused of breaking faith with the farmers on the ground that a resolution had been <Col N="1371" /> passed guaranteeing 50/-.  There are some politicians who are always anxious to avail of the farmers difficulties and who would tell them in later years that a resolution was passed guaranteeing this minimum price of 50/-, and that whatever Government might be in power had broken faith and violated the obligation that they undertook by the passing of this motion.  Any motion we pass should be very specific and we should know exactly what the agreement is and what period it covers.  So also should the farmer.  We know that there are certain areas of land where it is not practicable to grow wheat.  After all, we must have some respect for the resolutions we passed previously. There is no use in passing a resolution unless there is some hope of putting it into effect.  Now if our decisions are practical, we must be definite about what we want done.  I think we should specify in what type of land we want wheat grown.  There are various ways of doing that.  Probably the most practical is by the valuation per acre, because land is valued per acre for what it is worth.</P>
    <P>If a farmer had a certain number of acres valued at so much an acre and he was compelled to grow wheat in proportion to his valuation, on the average you would find you were not asking that man to do anything that was a terrible hardship on him.  We certainly must be more definite that the terms of this motion or of the amendment indicate.  I do not pretend, as many Senators do, to be so terribly detached from political activities. I have attended several meetings in my county and I find that in the West of Galway where there are many very hard-working farmers they are entirely in sympathy with this amendment. They want to see the man with the large ranch, the man who has land that can produce wheat, compelled to produce wheat, and that those whose land is not capable of producing wheat, should not be asked to devote as large an area to a crop which would not give them the same return as it would to farmers on the rich lands of Meath, Westmeath, Limerick and other fertile counties.  Senator McGee stated last <Col N="1372" /> evening that the poor tillage farmer never got sufficient remuneration for his work on the land, but if we examine the matter, we find that the tillage farmer is the man who is in the soundest position to-day.  There is no tillage farmer who has to approach the Agricultural Credit Corporation for credit, nor is there any tillage farmer who finds it necessary to approach the banks for loans.  There are no motions put down here on behalf of the tillage farmer asking for increased facilities for credit, because the man who is engaged in mixed farming is the man who can best live on the land to-day without any assistance from Government or other sources.</P>
    <P>I have one grievance and it is a grievance which is shared by the people of West Galway with whom I have associations.  That grievance is against the Land Commission for their failure to take over these large ranches from the people who, even at the present moment, are hesitant about providing sufficient food for the people of the country.  There are many people in the country who are prepared to produce the necessary food, but they have no land to produce it.</P>
    <P>Yet we have these large areas held by ranchers, by people who are looking for credit and every other facility, by people who say that 50/- per barrel does not pay them to produce wheat. We find that when the Fianna Fáil Government came into power there were something like 20,000 acres under wheat.  That has been increased to something like 500,000 acres at present. Still, we have Senator The McGillycuddy getting up here and saying that &ldquo;clever offensive verbiage may be all right for the cross-roads but it cuts no ice in higher debate.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Senator, prior to that, gave details of the position as he saw it, and said that we were short of bread.  He then went on to say that was the collective responsibility of the Government and of the Taoiseach as its head. &ldquo;One and all, &rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;they must have been aware of the decline of our economy and collectively they should have taken adequate and drastic steps to settle it.&rdquo;  Does the Senator not admit that he accused the Taoiseach and the Minister of being responsible for what he termed in the debate &ldquo;our shortage of bread&rdquo;?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator might get away with that on a point of debate, but facts are facts.  Surely the Government which by its policy of guaranteeing prices increased the area under wheat to such an extent, at a time when we could import wheat into this country, is not to blame?  The matter was even raised in the Dáil and, if my memory is correct, the leader of the Opposition put down a motion or a question asking why the Government should pay a subsidy for the storage of imported wheat.  Some time later a member of the Opposition&mdash;he has since left the Party; he was asked to leave and did not like to refuse&mdash;stated all over the country that he would not be found dead in a wheat field.  That was the kind of propaganda that was <Col N="1374" /> carried on.  I am glad that even at this eleventh hour we have members of the Opposition taking their courage in their hands and recognising that the Fianna Fáil policy was the right policy for the country.  I am glad that they are coming along and asking the Government not alone to go ahead with that policy during the war, but to continue it after the war is over.  Surely that is what they mean by putting their names to the motion?</P>
      <P>Senator McGee, I understand, is a large farmer, and when he was speaking last night I began to ask myself which side of the House was which and on which side of the House he was speaking.  To my mind if there was any vindication needed for the Fianna Fáil policy, Senator McGee, as a practical farmer, a man who had a large experience of growing wheat on an extensive scale, has provided that vindication and has proved that the Government policy was right.  He asked also that instructors' of agricultural committees should be given an allowance of petrol to enable them to carry on their duties.  If I am not mistaken they are already getting that allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here, again, I think there is a question which will have to be dealt with. While the officers and members of county committees of agriculture are very efficient and very fine men, I am convinced that the ordinary farmers do not follow all their instructions or avail of their assistance in the way they should.  I am further convinced that that situation will exist until such time as we create in our schools, particularly in the rural national schools, some co-ordination whereby we can bring into line those agricultural instructors and the local youths, the sons of the local farmers, so that they will recognise the advantages of the instructions given by those people.  For that reason I should like to see an allotment attached to every national school in a rural area, for the growing of vegetables, fruit trees and so on, and I should like to see the agricultural inspectors and instructors going around from time to time, taking out that class, and instructing them.  I think, if you started in that way, the young <Col N="1375" /> farmer would grow up with the instructor, and when he in turn became the owner of a farm he would be inclined to look with some faith and confidence on the advice and confidence of the instructor; otherwise, I am afraid that their activities are wasted in many areas.  In this tillage campaign, we should make more use of our county committees of agriculture.  In the case of a large county like Galway, one or two inspectors cannot be expected to see that every farmer in the county complies with the Tillage Order.  If the matter were handed over to the county committee of agriculture there would be a chance that the different members of the committee would be representative of the different areas, would be interested in them, and would report the slackers in the area to the county committee of agriculture.  In that way, you probably would get more efficient enforcement of the Compulsory Order.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer, and that is in relation to the petrol and kerosene made available for threshing and other forms of agricultural work.  I have no hesitation in saying that amongst no group of people in receipt of any fuel oil, either paraffin or petrol, is there more abuse than there is amongst the people who are supposed to be engaged in agricultural work.</P>
    <P>To my own knowledge there are people who have got supplies of kerosene and petrol to enable them to carry out tillage operations, ploughing or threshing, or whatever it may be, but that fuel oil was not used for the purpose for which it was allocated by the Department of Supplies.  I think it would be very interesting if the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Supplies would tell us the number of gallons of fuel oil issued in respect of ploughing tractors.  I should not be surprised if the number of gallons so issued exceeded entirely the amount necessary for the acreage under cultivation, allowing for the area cultivated by means of the ordinary horse-plough.  In order to rectify that position, I think there should be a check-up.  In regard to threshing in particular I would suggest <Col N="1376" /> that, where an allocation of fuel oil is made available, the owner of the threshing mill should be compelled to get the man for whom he has worked to sign a declaration to the effect that on a particular date he threshed so many barrels of wheat for him, and that that be countersigned by the local Civic Guards or L.D.F.</P>

      <P>I do not like to interrupt the Senator in any way, but the statement which he has made, if allowed to go uncontradicted, is exceedingly serious, and one that many of us feel should receive the fullest consideration.  He states that something should be done by each individual who receives kerosene to prove that he has devoted it to the service for which it was intended.  Such is already the case in marked detail.  For my own part, those whom I have accompanied to Ballsbridge, or on whose behalf I have written, have received remarkable courtesy, and, to my certain knowledge, fair play.  That there are others who have not had the same consideration extended to them may be due to the fact that they did not present their forms in proper order. Every gallon must be signed for, and I am sure that, if the Ministry demanded an affidavit, that system would be equally well implemented.  The matter is of such tremendous importance, and so many difficulties arise, that I think it is the duty of any Senator who knows of an abuse to supply the name of the person concerned to the Ministry, instead of branding the whole tillage scheme and the allocation of kerosene as a subject of abuse. The officials concerned are very painstaking, and have a difficult job.</P>

I have found that the Department of Supplies are helpful at all times, but, surely, the mere fact that the farmer who gets a supply of kerosene or petrol signs a return that he will use it for ploughing or threshing only is no guarantee that he used it for the particular purposes for which it was granted by the Department.

I do not like to interrupt Senators, but a brief reference to a subject like this would, perhaps, be enough.</P>

      <P>I submit, of course, but the terms of the resolution are so wide that in order to produce wheat we must plough the land, and in order to plough the land we must have tractors.  In order to run the tractors we must have kerosene.  I think it is very important that fuel allocated to tractor owners should be used for the purpose for which it is given, and it is with that in view that I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to something that is happening in the country.  No matter what anyone may say about the statement made by a man who gets kerosene for a particular purpose, such a statement is not proof. He may make a return to the Department of Supplies that he did use the kerosene, but that is no use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could give the name if necessary in one particular instance where there was a farm of 300 acres, a certain proportion of which had to be tilled to comply with the Tillage Order.  The owner said: &ldquo;How can you expect me to till the land when the Government will not make kerosene available for me?&rdquo;  I investigated the case and found that together with his usual allocation of kerosene, the man concerned had already got an additional supply for the particular work concerned.  He had been allocated 80 gallons of kerosene, and had not done the work for the farmer concerned, and the Government was blamed.  If that farmer were taken into court by the Minister for Agriculture for not putting the necessary acreage under tillage, his excuse would be that the man he had employed did not get the necessary allocation of kerosene although, according to the return of <Col N="1379" /> the Department, he had got it.  It is to try to stop that kind of thing, and to ensure that kerosene made available for agriculture is used for that purpose, and that purpose only, that I have brought up this subject.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Supplies&mdash;it would be necessary for the two Departments concerned to meet&mdash; added up the number of gallons of petrol allocated to different people who have tractors, and tried to relate that figure to the total number of acres of land put under tillage, there would be a surprising result.  I would not be at all surprised if there were more acres of land cultivated by tractors than the total number of acres there are entirely under the plough, although at least one-third was done by horses.  I hope something will be done to check these abuses, and to see that kerosene is made available and kept in reserve for essential services.</P>
    <P>I suggest that where a man has a tractor, the farmer who employs him for ploughing or threshing should be compelled to sign a certificate that he ploughed so many acres or threshed so many barrels of wheat, and at the end of the week or the month the form, countersigned by the sergeant of the Guards, would be sent to the Department of Supplies.  That would have two effects.  It would stop this traffic, this black marketing in kerosene allocated by the Department of Supplies for agricultural purposes.  There may be some collusion between the farmer and the local tractor owner, but it could not be on the big scale it is at present. It would have another effect, that the farmer would be cautious, knowing the Department was aware he had tilled so many acres or threshed so many barrels on a particular day, that the Government would have the knowledge that John Brown threshed or ploughed so many barrels or acres for John White, because there was a possibility that the Government might ask John Brown what he did with his wheat.  In that way, you would probably do two things at the same time.  You would probably counteract the feeding of wheat to <Col N="1380" /> animals and I think that it would be well worth considering.</P>
    <P>I know in the County Galway, that while there are people in possession of lands who comply in a half-hearted manner with the Tillage Order, the last thing they want to grow on their farms is wheat.  They probably have the idea that it takes more out of the land than any other crop.  This land is quite capable of growing wheat, and I think it is to meet cases such as this that Senator Byrne has put down his amendment. I think the country at large would welcome such a decision, but it may be asked how is it going to be carried out?  It would take a lot of inspectors, and while every motion and Bill we pass here calls for the appointment of more inspectors, when it comes to finding the cash to pay them, we all grouse and say that the present Government have increased the Civil Service and the number of inspectors yet at the same time we are continuing to cry out for still further increases.</P>
    <P>We could do it, I believe, without much increase if we transferred the duty of having the Tillage Order carried out to the county committees of agriculture.  When we were faced with the terrible problem last year of providing sufficient fuel&mdash;I am not going into the fuel question&mdash;the Government, in its wisdom, transferred the responsibility to the only people who had the organisation&mdash;the county councils.  They were very wise in that, I think, even though lately we had some people who did not agree with their wisdom, complaining that they produced bad stuff, and so on.  Since the Government did transfer that terrible responsibility, as it was at the time, of producing 4,500,000 tons of turf to the county councils, I do not see why the responsibility of carrying out the Tillage Order which, of course, would be less responsible than the production of turf, should not also be transferred, because, after all, I do not believe that in any county there would be more than three or four farms which the council or committee of agriculture would have to take over and till themselves, unlike the number of turf banks they had to acquire.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> When we gave the responsibility to the county councils, they produced the goods.  The goods might not be the best we would all like to see but, at any rate, the councils produced sufficient fuel.  If you gave them the power to enter into lands to enforce the Tillage Order, even if the return from the crop they produced would not be in proportion to the same acreage cultivated on an ordinary farm, they would, nevertheless, produce a certain amount.  The job of one or two inspectors in a county is almost impossible, because they have to concentrate on the large holdings.  I hold no brief for people with large farms, because I believe the right thing to do is to take the people who are willing to cultivate the land and put them on the farms which other people are not prepared to cultivate.  While the inspectors are looking after the large holdings, where they will get the greater production, 10 or 20 or 30 people on holdings of from 25 to 30 acres may be overlooked. They would make their contribution if the matter were left to the county committee of agriculture or some such body.  If left to the county committee, it might be found that, in a number of counties, the members could not be said to be capable agriculturists, while they might be very good landowners. There, again, we would probably be up against a difficulty.  We are often accused of looking to the other side for guidance and the enforcing of the Tillage Order on the other side is left to the county committee of agriculture or some local body.  I think that these bodies could do the job here better than any inspector appointed by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of either the motion or the amendment, because I think it is asking too much to ask the Government to guarantee a price for wheat over a period of years.  A very able Senator, a Senator with whom I should not like to cross swords&mdash; Senator Johnston&mdash;told us last night that there was a possibility that, after the war, the millions of bushels of wheat lying in Canada and other countries would be dumped in here and they would be asking us to take it for God's sake.  Whatever Government <Col N="1382" /> would be in power, whether Labour, Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, would be in a very awkward position if there were a guaranteed price of 50/- per barrel for wheat while boats in Galway and Dublin were offering it at 10/- per barrel, as forecast by Senator Johnston. I should not like to see a Labour Government in that awkward position.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Byrne's amendment, we are at the same disadvantage. If we are to compel the farmer to grow a certain number of acres of wheat, we must be more specific about the type of land on which we expect him to grow it.  What I suggest is that regional committees be set up.  We had a discussion some time ago on the Agricultural Wages Board, and this board is based on regions.  The amount of wages they decide to pay is based on regions and on the ability of the farmers in these regions to pay the wages.</P>

      <P>It would not be fair that the people of Connemara&mdash;very few of them would come under the Order&mdash;should be compelled to grow wheat on land unsuitable for wheat-growing. I do not want it to go out that these people do not grow wheat. The majority of them do grow sufficient wheat to do them over a period on any patch of land which is suitable but, when you come down to a regulation, a different question arises.  The terms of the motion are too broad.  The period is not specified.  While I welcome the conversion of the Senator to wheat-growing, the best thing we could do would be to give him an opportunity to state more specifically in a motion in the near future what number of years he wishes to cover rather than pass a motion which could be extended, more or less, on the Kathleen Mavourneen system&mdash;&ldquo;it may be for years and it may be for ever.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have advocated before that, in regard to wheat, regional areas should be specified for its compulsory growth.  I voted against compulsion for the farmers on the last occasion, and did so because I had in mind many places along the seaboard that were not suited for the continuous growing of wheat.  I exclude those areas where they have supplies of seaweed to help them out.  I know parishes in Kerry and Cork where wheat has been tried and found impracticable and uneconomical.  I voted against compulsion for the farmer.  For the most part, the farmers have done their duty loyally, but, as far as I can observe, it is those who have always done their duty, who, for the most part, have been using the by-products of their land for the feeding of poultry and pigs.  If I am convinced that compulsion is necessary in this matter, to provide wheat for the people, I will vote for it, but I have no information on the point and I shall await the statement of the Minister in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After a year's experience and with the limited information that comes my way, I think compulsion will be necessary. Those who, for the most part, always tilled their lands, are giving loyal service to the State.  There are large tracts of the best wheat-growing land, not alone in Ireland but in the world, as yet unexplored.  There was a time when County Meath supplied all the northern mills and the whole of Ulster: one county alone, about 1850, I think, was able to do that.  In the adjoining Counties of Westmeath, Kildare <Col N="1384" /> and portions of Longford, not to speak of Minister at all, there was excellent wheat growing.</P>
    <P>It should not be a difficult thing for the inspectors of the Department to tabulate the types of land we have in Ireland.  They know them.  An analysis of the elements of the soil suitable for wheat, which is not a difficult process, would show them, at very small expense, what lands are capable of wheat growing; and it is on these lands that it should be grown.  We need not be a bit afraid about those people on the seaboard in small holdings.  For their own self-preservation, those farmers will have to cultivate, and do cultivate those lands.  We talk about lush grass, but lush grass is not a food. Grass ceases to be a food when it is not cropped regularly; it becomes so useless that it is a fibre.  Any amount of land is covered with fibrous material that is of no use for anything except coarse feeding for horses or bronchos.</P>
    <P>I support wheat growing, and if I find from the statement of the Minister that compulsion is necessary to bring those rich lands under cultivation, I will not hesitate to vote for it, though a short time ago I was not in favour of it.  I dare say the Minister cannot make a statement on that matter until this year's supply is cut.  The only difficulty is the period for which the price should be guaranteed.  The farmers will not be too exacting about the period.  The Government could state that it would be for the period of the emergency, and that would be a matter for legislation by the Oireachtas. If that period were specified there would be no difficulty in guaranteeing that 50/- to the farmer.  I do not think the farmer will hoard that 50/-; he will make good use of it and will pay wages.  On the subject of wages, I wish to express great disappointment with the decision of the Wages Board in regard to the wages for agricultural labourers.  That matter may be ruled out of order if I refer to it, but the agricultural worker is part of the agricultural machinery and he should be considered in this scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1385" /> There is no difficulty about feeding the nation with wheat if we have some plan of scheduled areas of the kind I mentioned.  The county committees of agriculture can easily give the information required.  Senators on the other side of the House said that those committees should play an important part in this work.  Another educational institution is the vocational schools. They are, for the most part, situated in the towns, and, strange to say, it is the boys and girls from the rural districts who are the principal elements in these schools.  The programme in these schools is not sufficiently agricultural in its bias.  The agricultural committees should be more closely linked with these schools.  I am not speaking of the schools in the large towns such as Cork, Limerick and Dublin, but of the schools in the small towns of 4,000 or 5,000 inhabitants which are rural in their nature.  Their bias should be more agricultural.</P>
    <P>Instead of spending portion of the day hammering iron, leather work and fancy work, garden plots and the land should be cultivated, and there should be instruction in the preservation and cooking of the various products of the soil.  Attached to every vocational school should be a plot of land where the various farm crops should be cultivated. Horticulture by itself will never be a great source of production of food.  The production of food will come from the broad acres.  When the vocational schools are being set up in the country, a reasonable plot of ground, perhaps an economic holding of 15, 20 or 30 acres, should be attached.  Some people will say that this is a big problem, and that this is not the time to enter upon it.  I say it is the time.  Why postpone it when you will have to do it sometime?  While the fever of wheat-growing is upon us, I think there is no better time to undertake it.</P>
    <P>I am alarmed at the disappearance of rural workers from the land.  Something should be done to take the position into consideration.  Not only are they disappearing, but the heirs of the land, their sons and daughters, are disappearing, <Col N="1386" /> because farming is not paying. I am not going to blame the Government for that.  We do not know who is to blame.  Perhaps it is world conditions, or what is happening between here and England.  We have been treated badly by the English people in regard to the economic life of this country.  There should be some system of barter for the tea and other things we want, and even for the bread we want.  The men working on the bogs are short of bread; they require bread if they are to carry on production. If there is any wheat to be released, much more should be released to these people.</P>
    <P>There should be a balanced system of agriculture.  The Minister says he has advice on agricultural matters.  That advice should be related to the growing of potatoes, wheat and other crops, and the rotational work necessary to keep a balanced system of farming.  I cannot agree with the speakers who say that wheat is not hard on the land. Wheat is a unique crop in many ways. Other corn crops are generally sown in the month of April, they become ripe in July or August, and they are cut down before the weeds have shed their seed.  It is different in the case of wheat.  Wheat is sown early.  Weeds grow up with the wheat, and you have winter weeds as well as those that germinate in spring time, and they have eight or nine months' growth before the wheat is cut.  They have shed their seed, with the result that you have scutch grass.  It is not the wheat that is hard on the ground; it is the ravenous feeding power of this nine months' growth of weeds.</P>
    <P>I believe that it has been suggested that some farmers actually mow the wheat crop at an early stage&mdash;Senator McGee can tell us if this is done in his county&mdash;for the purpose of getting rid of the weeds and that then the wheat crop develops again into a much stouter and better crop.  Whether the practice is scientifically approved of I do not know, but I am informed that it is generally followed in certain areas for the purpose of getting rid of the weeds.  I should like to ask some information from the Minister on that point. <Col N="1387" /> Wheat is hard on the land in that way, not that the crop in itself is hard on the land, but that the weeds which grow along with it combine to exact a heavy toll from the land.  I think that the experts who examined the constituents of the wheat crop should also have examined the elements containing the weeds which grow with the wheat crop.  For that reason farmers are loath to grow wheat on their lands, and those who let land in conacre would prefer to let it for potatoes or any crop other than wheat for the reasons I have stated.  If one goes to an auctioneer to ask him to let land in conacre, he will say: &ldquo;Do not let it for wheat.&rdquo; It is not that he is antagonistic to the growing of wheat, but he will tell you that after a few crops of wheat have been taken off land, it will be left in a debilitated state and that it will be very hard to restore it to its former fertility. I am not, of course, speaking on this matter as an expert, but I speak from observation and to some extent as the result of experience.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to make is that the Land Commission's functions should not cease when they take over land.  The Land Commission should have done more when they entered on these large ranches that at present are howling wildernesses in the midst of a fertile country.  I think these lands should be brought under the plough and that instead of making inspections to see if small farmers have done a half-acre of tillage here or a half-acre of tillage there, the Land Commission should go in on lands that are known to be rich in food producing qualities and see that they are devoted to food production.  It is true that the wheat crop has not been so successful when grown for a second year without manure. It would seem that manure of some kind is necessary and unfortunately farmyard manure is no longer available, owing to the decline of dairying in the south of Ireland, to the extent which it formerly was.  That is a very unfortunate aspect of the problem but it has to be taken into consideration.  Senator Johnston has pointed out that with an 85 per cent. extraction from wheat, a very valuable <Col N="1388" /> offal of 15 per cent. would be available for the production of pigs and the promotion of dairying which is the foundation of all our agriculture.  These sidelines are very much neglected.</P>
    <P>In regard to artificial manures, my information is&mdash;and it is information which I have for some years&mdash;that we have got in this country the raw materials for superphosphates as rich in content as anything that came from North Africa or Central Europe formerly. The difficulty I understand is that it has not been found possible to supply these materials in the form required by the manufacturers to enable them to produce superphosphates.  If these materials are available in such generous quantities, as I understand they are in more districts than one, I submit that the possibility of exploiting them should be explored.  Possibly it has been explored but I have never heard any announcement from the group that has been set up to inquire into the possibility of utilising alternative raw materials to help us over this emergency.  That is another point on which I should like to have some information from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I understand that in order that this material should be capable of being utilised by a certain firm in the South of Ireland, it must be reduced to a size that will enable it to pass through a ring of a certain cubic content&mdash;that is, that the pieces must be reduced to a certain thickness.  The difficulty was that the rock was found to be very hard, and that machinery could not be found to crush it into those fine pieces. I do not know whether that is true, but I should like to have some statement on the matter.  I think that if fertilisers could be made available that there would be no difficulty&mdash;not alone during the present emergency but in the time to come&mdash;in supplying us with all the food we require at an economic rate without imposing a burden on anybody. I am in favour of the motion, and I would be also in favour of the amendment if I had an assurance that certain people&mdash;a small percentage I belive&mdash;who own large tracts of land were not doing their duty in this crisis.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to prolong this debate which has already occupied a considerable time.  Even if I had any desire to be alarmingly discursive, I am afraid that my profound ignorance of agricultural matters would deter me from embarking on that course.  I do not want, however, to give a silent vote.  I wish to say that I am in favour of the motion and also in favour of the amendment to it, and I should like to explain in as brief a manner as possible why that is so.  I do not think that, in this period of emergency, I should consider any effort too drastic or any price too high to ensure an adequate supply of food for our people.  Statements have been made that there is no food shortage, and when I refer to a food shortage I mean mainly a shortage of bread. Now, there is a shortage of bread in this country.  While I do not like the idea of compulsion in regard to any matter, I think that, notwithstanding the efforts made by the farmers during the past season to provide us with wheat, even yet some form of compulsion is necessary during the emergency. I do not believe that after the period of emergency has passed it will be necessary to concentrate so much on the compulsory growing of wheat, although personally my own association with particular movements in this country would urge me, at any rate, to advocate the growing in this country of sufficient food for all our people.  I just want to say that that is the reason why I am in favour of compulsory tillage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hawkins in his statement that where the motion is defective is in fixing a price of 50/- per barrel for millable wheat over a period of years.  I think it is defective in this respect, that it may probably cost more next winter to grow wheat. I think that the promoters of this motion are stultifying themselves in stating that it should be merely 50/-. Of course, I know it is supposed to be a minimum price, but I do not see that they are making any provision for an increase in the price of wheat.  I understood Senator Hawkins to say that the farmers in the country had grown sufficient wheat last year to <Col N="1390" /> meet the needs of the country up to next July.  Of course, the fact is that considerable quantities of wheat have had to be imported, and the fact that it has been imported has made it possible to space out the supply up to the end of July.  In that connection I want to advert to another matter.  I know that in this House mine is probably a lone voice in referring to it.  Most Senator come from agricultural districts and have no great interest in the industrial arm of the country. Some Senators, judging, at least, by their statements, did not seem to regard it of any great importance, but many of our secondary industries are languishing at the present time; others are in a very parlous condition and are on the point of closing down because shipping space is not available to bring in the raw materials to keep these industries going.  I think it is nothing short of a crime against this country, a country which, I understand, has sufficient land to supply all our needs, that in those times some drastic steps are not taken to ensure an adequate supply of food, and to release that shipping which is available to bring in the raw material necessary to provide employment for those people who purchase the products of the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>I am not too keen on compulsion, but I understand that it takes 750,000 acres of wheat to supply our needs in flour, and I think it is not beyond the wit or the competence of the Government, in conjunction with the farming community, to evolve some scheme whereby that could be done.  I am not well enough informed to know the type of lands suitable for the growing of wheat or other crops, but if it is necessary to till 750,000 acres to produce wheat, I cannot see any reason why the Ministry, in conjunction with the farmers&mdash; without having perpetual motions in this House&mdash;cannot devise some scheme whereby that 750,000 acres will be made available for our people.  From my four years' experience in this House, listening to experts like Senator McGee, Senator Baxter, Senator O Buachalla and others, I know that the lot of the farmer is not a happy one.  I think that the farmers, when <Col N="1391" /> they claim a fair price for their products, are only doing justice not only to themselves but to their families. They are entitled to a fair price, and I think they should get it.  They are fulfilling a great task at the present time, and I only hope that any remarks I make here will not be misinterpreted by the farmers.  I am all out for giving the farmers a fair price not only for wheat but for any other commodity they produce.  Following that, I think the agricultural labourers should receive a fair wage for the work they do.  I do not want to enter into that, but my colleague, Senator Crosbie, made reference yesterday to the wages endured by the agricultural labourer, and contrasted them with the wages enjoyed by the Dublin Corporation labourer.  In that case, I think, comparisons are odious.  He suggested, of course, that the agricultural labourer was a producer, and that the corporation worker, who has the very distasteful and dirty job of producing a condition which maintains the good health of the people, was not a producer. I think those comparisons do not prove anything.  I am in favour of the motion, and I am reluctantly compelled to vote also for the amendment moved by Senator Byrne.</P>
    <P>I do not do so with any degree of pleasure, but, circumstances being what they are, no other option is open to me.  If it is necessary that compulsory methods be employed, let them be employed in some less harsh fashion.  I suggest that the Ministry and the agricultural representatives of the country might get together and try to solve that problem, without dragging it up in this House every few months and devoting to unnecessary discussion here a lot of time which might be more profitably employed.  I think the whole matter is one for organisation, and I agree with Senator Baxter when he said that we ought to have some long-term plan for dealing with agriculture. As he rightly said, after this war there will be a scarcity of food in Europe, and I think every effort should be made here in this country to see that we at least will not make any demands on the food supply available to feed the starving <Col N="1392" /> peoples of Europe.  We have the land available to produce the necessary food for our own people, and we should develop that land to the full.  I do not think I have anything more to say.  I think this debate has gone on long enough, and, as the Chairman has said, it has been alarmingly discursive.  I am in favour of the motion, and I will vote also for the amendment.</P>

      <P>Although Senator The McGillycuddy commenced his speech by a declaration that he was unlike the rest of men inasmuch as he did not intend to indulge in personal abuse, I think the other speakers more or less proved that they too are unlike the rest of men in that way.  As far as that is concerned, we had a very pleasant debate, and although I will show, perhaps, that I do not agree with everything which was said, I think that the debate took place in very good part, and may have good effects one way or another.  Senator The McGillycuddy pointed out the shortage of bread here and the shortage of flour and so on as a justification, I suppose, for an argument in favour of the motion which he put down on the Paper.  As I listened to Senator The McGillycuddy I said to myself: &ldquo;Well, if the Senator had made that speech in 1933 when I came in here with the Cereals Bill, I would have got the surprise of my life.&rdquo;  But he did not make it at that time, nor indeed, I think, anything in line with it.  In the year 1929, the Senator himself said we were feeding and exporting at a very high figure.  We produced 1,800,000 cwts. of offals and we were importing 470,000 cwts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had those figures quoted both here and elsewhere over and over again.  We pointed out at the beginning of the war that we needed 1,000,000 acres of extra tillage.  We may be blamed by Senator The McGillycuddy and others for not being more vigorous, but I felt at the time and I advised the Government that we could not possibly, by compulsory Order such as the Compulsory Tillage Order, get that 1,000,000 acres in the year 1940, because it does take some time <Col N="1393" /> for the great majority of the farmers in the country to organise their economy and get into tillage.  It would take a few years before they would be fully into tillage.  There will probably be more tillage this year than last year; there was more tillage last year than in 1940, and there was more tillage in 1940 than in 1939, but it had to be a gradual process.  If I had come before the Seanad in September, 1939, and told them that I was going to see that there would be another 1,000,000 acres of tillage in the year 1940, I should not be surprised if Senator The McGillycuddy and others told me that I was being unfair to the farmers in expecting that, so it is not very clear to me what steps we should have taken to see that there was more wheat; it has not been pointed out very clearly by Senator The McGillycuddy or anybody else.  I am quite prepared to say that, if we have not got it, it is the Government that is responsible, and the Government must take the blame. The Government is prepared to take the blame, but we should like people to be helpful to us.  It is not enough to say that we are to blame; if people want to be helpful they ought to point out to us how this matter is going to be remedied, or how it should have been remedied in the last couple of years.  I was rather appalled, I must say, when I heard the Senator here speak about the feeding of wheat to animals.</P>
    <P>I waited until I got the Official Debates, and I think it is rather disappointing, to say the least, to have any responsible person saying here: &ldquo;I must say I find it extremely hard to blame those farmers who have fed wheat to their animals.&rdquo;  I think it is a criminal thing to feed wheat to animals when we are informed in the same speech that human beings have not enough bread or flour.  Yet we are told by the Senator that he finds it hard to blame the farmers who feed wheat to animals.  If people in responsible positions take that view, it will be hard to blame the farmers in future, but I think it is an appalling thing to say.</P>
    <P>I would not think it so bad if the Senator said that human beings had <Col N="1394" /> plenty of bread, and, therefore, he did not blame the farmers for feeding wheat to animals, but he did not say that.  He did say that it was his belief that human beings were not getting enough bread or enough flour, and yet he says that he does not blame the farmers for feeding wheat to their animals.  &ldquo;It is in the present situation rather like jailing a woman for stealing to feed her starving child.... The very thing that is going to cause the starvation among children is the thing the farmers are not being blamed for.  None of us would have this anxiety about the feeding of wheat to animals if we were not afraid that it would leave starving children on our hands.  Some other Senator expressed the opinion that we had no drastic powers in this connection. There is a Bill coming before the Dáil in which I hope we will be given much more drastic powers in this matter of feeding to animals, that is, if the wheat is necessary to human beings.</P>
    <P>The Senator said, later on, that the obvious thing was to put under cereals a sufficient acreage to meet all our requirements without considering recourse to imports.  He said: &ldquo;Instead, we have had a half-hearted policy of voluntary tillage....&rdquo;  First of all, it is not voluntary.  We have a Compulsory Tillage Order.  I do not know if it is half-hearted.  I think that everybody, as far as the Government is concerned, as far as my Department is concerned and as far as everybody in my Party is concerned in the other House &mdash;there are no Parties in this House&mdash; has done everything possible to push this scheme of wheat-growing.  I do not see how anybody could refer to it as half-hearted.</P>
    <P>There may be others who did not look too favourably on our policy of wheat growing.  I was never half-hearted on the question of wheat-growing. I have been in favour of wheat growing for a number of years, and there is nothing I agreed with more in the Fianna Fáil policy than that part of it relating to wheat growing, and to refer to our efforts as half-hearted, is I think, very much away from the mark.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> After talking about half-hearted methods, the Senator goes on to speak of our failure to produce the wheat that was necessary for the people.  He then explained to us why there should be a period of years as set down in this motion and says this further period is to allow for readjustments in the event of post-war conditions calling for a change of economy.  Reading the speech up to a point one would become convinced that the Senator had been converted into an advocate of native wheat, but I see the Senator says, by way of implication, that when the war is over he will revert to the policy of imported wheat again.  He foreshadows a change of economy when the war is over, which can only mean to me that the Senator believes that it may be good policy to allow foreign wheat to come in, and, naturally, if that occurred, and goes on for some years to come, we will find ourselves, if another war comes along, in the same position, and some Senator sitting in Senator The McGillycuddy's place will attack some Minister sitting in my place for not taking enough steps to ensure a sufficiency of bread and flour for the people of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope not.  There is only one other point in Senator The McGillycuddy's speech to which I wish to refer.  It is a thing that has been said very often by Deputies and others. He says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, we are asking no more than the security of the capital invested in what amounts to a new undertaking on a large scale, and only on terms similar to those which have been accorded broadcast to a very large number of industrial concerns which have been born, and have lived, and died&mdash;some of them, not all of them&mdash;in this country during the last few years, and which the agricultural community have paid for <i>in toto.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> That is a thing which is very commonly said, but I want to know what precisely is the security accorded to any industry which has not been accorded to agriculture.  I think that is the sort of statement made by Senators and others which is repeated over and over again without any foundation.  I do not think this Government has ever given any security, protection or help of any kind to industry that has not also been given to agriculture.  Wherever we had hoped that an industry would make itself self-sufficient&mdash;take, for instance, the leather or boot industry&mdash;we have given very full protection.  Whenever we have believed that the agricultural industry can give us self-sufficiency, we have also given full protection.  For instance, there is a tariff of £28 a ton on potatoes.  I do not think you could beat that in any other industry&mdash;it is about seven times the value, in other words, a 700 per cent. tariff.  There is 6d. per lb. on mutton, 6d. per lb. on beef, 6d. per lb. on bacon and something like 1/- per lb. on vegetables, because we realise that we had enough of those things here and we did not want anything to come in. Have we done better than that for any industry, or have we done as well as that for any industry where we did not expect to get self-sufficiency&mdash;as I mentioned already in the case of leather and boots where we realised we were going to fulfil our requirements?</P>
    <P>The case of grain is different.  We thought, and we were right in thinking in 1933, that we would not grow enough wheat for our requirements.  If we thought we should grow enough wheat in those years, we would have put a prohibitive tariff on imported wheat, but we came to the conclusion that we could not grow enough, and we dealt with it in a different way.  We said the price of wheat would be so much, and in fact, 30/- per barrel was paid for Irish wheat when foreign wheat was coming in at 13/- per barrel.  There again, if you like, it amounted to a tariff of over 100 per cent. in the case of wheat.  What industry <Col N="1397" /> has Senator The McGillycuddy in mind where we gave more security than that?  After all, if he has not got some industry in mind that got more security than wheat growing, why make the statement?  He says he is only asking for the same security as we gave to a number of other industries. Somebody may say we went further for industry than tariffs by putting on quotas.  So did we put on quotas where they suited for agriculture as well.</P>
    <P>There were certain commodities in agriculture like onions and tomatoes, which we were growing on a small scale and we came to the conclusion that the only way to deal with them was to regulate the imports by quota so that our home products would get a good market.  That was done in their case. It is also being done in the case of root seeds.  There was a quota on wheat coming in, if I may put it that way, because the flour miller had to buy a certain proportion of Irish wheat.  In that way, he was limited in the amount of foreign wheat he could bring in and that constituted an indirect quota.  Therefore, we had extremely high tariffs, quotas where they were suitable and subsidies when they were suitable.  I do not know if the Senator could name any industry for which we did more in the way of protection, quota and subsidy than we did in the case of agriculture.</P>

      <P>Take the cement industry, as one example.  They can pay 10 per cent. on their ordinary shares.  Taking the whole farming complex, and not confining the matter to wheat, can the Minister say that the industry is now paying 10 per cent. or 17 per cent., as the Kilkenny boot factory is paying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Senator has quoted a very fair example. If, in the province of Munster, we could get no farmer to take up a certain crop and if we had to rely on Belgians or Dutch, who would only come in on the understanding that they would get 10 per cent., we might <Col N="1398" /> very well agree.  The cement industry was a very big proposition.  These people were prepared to come in on a certain tariff.  We did not think that that would be good business.  We wanted to limit profits rather than give protection and we limited their profits to 10 per cent.  They cannot make more.  We have not put any limits on farmers' profits, so far.  I think that exaggeration in the case of agriculture, not by farmers but by their advocates, is very hurtful to agriculture in general.  I meet farmers every week.  They come to me or I go down to them.</P>
      <P>I do not receive any very unreasonable complaints.  I did not hear any farmer say that the price of wheat was too low.  They are all satisfied with it. No farmer said to me that he wanted a guarantee that this price would last until the war was over or for a period after the war was over.  Those who come here, and to assemblies like this, and advocate the cause of the farmer are very often inclined to exaggerate the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pass on to the speech by Senator Sir John Keane.  I do not at all agree with the Senator that, if you cleared a certain area here of Irish farmers and their families, and replaced them by Danes, you would obtain a much better return.  I have been in other countries and have seen how farmers work.  I have never seen farmers work harder anywhere than our farmers work.  I was in Germany under the present regime.  Everybody is supposed to work very hard there.  I stayed in a farming district there the year before the war.  If you stopped at a ditch to look at a piece of land, the farmer would come over and talk to you as long as you would talk to him &mdash;very much the same as our farmers do here.  I never saw the farmers there worker harder than they work here, and I do not believe that Danes, Germans or Dutch would do a bit better here than our own farmers are doing.  I may be asked how it is that the Danes have beaten us in the British market.  In passing I may mention the case of butter.  They were <Col N="1399" /> in the market before us, unfortunately. They had worked up a taste for their particular form of butter.  We cannot get the price that they get.  We may in time get it, but it will take a long time.</P>
    <P>Senator Byrne said, very truly, in his speech that there was traceable here, in some cases, almost a distaste for tillage.  That is true.  There seems to be a prejudice against tillage in certain quarters.  People are afraid to till. That is a prejudice against which we have to work and it is a big handicap in the campaign to get sufficient of our own food grown.  Senator Byrne referred to the price of wheat, oats and barley in 1931.  Prices were very bad at that time and there had been a continuous decline in tillage.  It is quite possible that, if that policy of allowing tillage to take care of itself, had continued until 1939, even the knowledge of tillage would have disappeared from a great part of this country.</P>
    <P>I agree absolutely with Senator Byrne when he says that more tillage means more and better cattle.  That is obvious to anybody who thinks over it. People talk about the good pasture land of the midlands which is such an asset to this country for taking the cattle from the smaller men and finishing them off before they are exported. We must remember, however, how these cattle are treated before they go to this pasture.  Unless these graziers, if we may so describe them without offence, get well-bred and well-fed cattle, they are not going to be such an asset to them or to the country.  In the other parts of the country where these small cattle are bred and reared up to the age of 15 or 21 months, they cannot be properly cared for unless there is tillage.  There must be roots and oats if we are to look after these cattle properly unless we are to go back and depend on imported feeding stuffs.  There is hardly any necessity to make the case that more tillage, instead of being an injury to the cattle trade, will help it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1400" /> Deputy McGee made the point that the 50/- fixed this year should be paid for all millable wheat.  He said that, last year, when the price was 40/-, some farmers whose wheat was taken and which, therefore, must have been millable wheat, were paid less than 40/-.  I do not think that could be avoided.  One thing we are doing this year is to fix the same price for all wheat down to 57 instead of 59 lb. bushel-weight.  Senators will realise that, if wheat is saved in a bad condition and if there is a lot of moisture in it, it will be poor in bushelling. If a dishonest farmer&mdash;and there are dishonest farmers as there are dishonest people of other occupations&mdash; has wheat that is not very well saved, and if that wheat is going to bushel poorly, he will not go to much trouble to dry the wheat if, by drying it, he will get less for it, as would be the case if the same price were to be paid for all wheat.  In fact, we tried so to arrange that the farmer would get the same price for his wheat, leaving the water out.  That is how the prices are fixed this year.</P>

Senator McGee also said that every creed and class can get petrol but that agricultural instructors cannot get it.  That is not quite correct.  The fact is that every creed and class cannot get petrol but the agricultural instructors are getting it.  If the Senator thinks over it, he will see that he is wrong in both statements.  Some classes get it, and <Col N="1401" /> the agricultural instructors are in one of the classes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, but no one is getting enough.  Another question the Senator asked was wheather we are getting enough for our wheat here as compared with foreign wheat.  The point is whether we should be influenced by the price of foreign wheat at all.  We did not take any account of it when fixing the price of Irish wheat from 1933 to 1939.  When speaking to the city people and the city consumers&mdash;some Senator here represents them&mdash;we tried to convince those people it was a good insurance.  We said: &ldquo;When the war comes, we will have Irish wheat for you, but in order to give you that insurance you must pay the premium, you must pay a bit more for your wheat in peace times.&rdquo; Supposing we were foolish enough to let the farmers take the war price, when the war would be over the city people would say: &ldquo;Why insure against another war?  When it comes, you will not give us wheat at a fair price&mdash;in fact, you will not grow it for us.&rdquo;  The farmer has to keep his bargain now with the city consumer, by giving him wheat at a fair price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Crosbie commenced his speech by saying that the policy of the late Government was vindicated by what we find now.  If what he finds now satisfies Senator Crosbie that the late Government is vindicated, I can understand why Senator Crosbie and others believe in that policy, but I cannot see how it vindicates them.  That is what puzzles me.  It would be extremely difficult, for instance, if the policy of the late Government had been pursued, or if the late Governmnt were still in office.  With 20,000 acres in 1939 under wheat, I do not think it would be up to 460,000 acres in <Col N="1402" /> two years, as there would not be enough seed.  My experience, through the technical men of the Department, was that there were many farmers who started growing wheat in 1934 and 1935 who did not know how to grow it.  They made some very big mistakes and had to be taught the business.  It was well that they were taught before the war commenced.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Crosbie that it is very inadvisable to have these annual impasses on the price of wheat every autumn.  We must try to avoid that. We must try to see that the farmer is given a fair price, and that he will be satisfied with a fair price and will go on growing wheat.  At the moment, we are trying to see how that can be done.</P>
    <P>I agree also with the Senator that the germination of seed wheat was unsatisfactory in many cases.  We have found that the cause of that was often improper drying and improper storage. We are taking steps to see that every licensed assembler of seed wheat next year will dry and store his wheat under proper conditions.  Unfortunately, we cannot store all the seed wheat that is required in the country through these licensed assemblers, but, at any rate, farmers will be told that fact, and they will be free to buy their seed from one of these people if they are not satisfied that the seed they are offered locally is in good condition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister leaves that point, would he explain if it was discovered that the germination was bad in the harvest or if it was considerably lower in the spring, in January and February, than in the harvest? Do I understand that the germination was all right actually in the harvest, as far as we know it, but that it fell considerably in the spring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I need hardly tell the Senator that it varied a lot.  In a great number of cases, it germinated fairly well in February but got very bad by April.  I am now talking of the late varieties.  There were causes of that&mdash; it was stored under bad conditions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That wheat was threshed the following month.  In the case of winter wheat we need not be so particular, as it does not go wrong so quickly from moisture and bad storing.  Another thing the Senator mentioned was rye.  We have been attacked in the Department for not developing rye cultivation.  In fact, we have been developing rye for many years in certain districts.  I admit we have not gone outside those districts, considered by the Department to be more suitable for rye than other districts.  Rye is not a great success.  We have not got a very big acreage under rye: only about 2,000 acres last year, I think.  We would find difficulty in getting a large amount of seed now.  The Senator appears to have some doubt, but I have no doubt, from the reports I saw, that rye is, for some reason, much more liable to disease here than it is in the North European countries.  It may be that the particular virus that attacks rye thrives better in our mild atmosphere than it would in Northern Europe.  At any rate, that is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Crosbie also went back to the point of this Government favouring industries rather than agriculture. It is a pity that anybody should think you must favour one or the other.  I do not see why we should not favour both.  Senator Campbell talked about his associations with certain movements. I came into the Sinn Féin movement myself many years ago, when very young, but principally I think&mdash;if I could bring my thoughts back to it&mdash;on the economic teaching of the late Arthur Griffith.  He thought that the country should have two arms &mdash;the industrial arm and the agricultural arm.  That teaching was generally accepted.  It does no good, either to agriculture or to industry, to try to persuade the farmer that, if he is to be prosperous industries must close down or, <i>vice versa,</i> to try to persuade the industrialist that, if he is prosperous, agriculture must be in a bad way. I think they should go hand-in-hand, <Col N="1404" /> and that both could be made prosperous in the course of time.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan made the point &mdash;as did other Senators&mdash;that it is a pity that the ships which we have must be used in the carrying of wheat and that, if our own wheat were there, they could be used in the carrying of agricultural manures, agricultural machinery, and so on.  I am not sure that we could bring in manures, even if we had the ships, but I think that we could get agricultural machinery.  We hope we may be in a better position, as far as that is concerned, next year&mdash; that is, if we are able to spare the ships for other things than wheat.</P>
    <P>We may want to bring in some wheat, of course, but I hope we will not need to bring in as much as in the present year.  Senator Johnston was very inconsistent.  One might excuse a Senator who has not been trained in economics for being inconsistent, but one would imagine that a man that gives his whole time to thinking upon these subjects would reconcile his theories. For instance, he said that what was ruining agriculture has been the unsatisfactory relation between live stock and cereals, meaning that the cereals were too dear; and then he said that he would deprecate any scheme that would raise the price of raw materials&mdash;that is, the raw materials for feeding poultry, pigs and so on &mdash;and in the same speech he said he would advocate a higher price for barley and oats.  I do not see how he can reconcile these things at all, although I admit that they are all desirable&mdash; that is, that we should get a better price for live stock, a better price for barley, and should do nothing to injure the small farmer.  But Senator Johnston wants to raise the price of barley and oats at the same time, knowing that we cannot improve the price of live stock because live stock are being exported.  He blames the Government for being pro-British because they have not exposed the British policy of low prices for live stock.</P>

What is more I do not think it would rectify the position. We told the Minister of Food on the other side that his price was too low.  He replied&mdash;and these are practically his exact words&mdash;&ldquo;I am a business man; I will buy where I can buy cheapest.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;You are going to put us out of the market.&rdquo; We have gone out of the market as far as bacon and butter are concerned, but we have not yet gone out of the market as far as cattle are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe if he told them we are pro-British it might help.  I do not think another thing said by Senator Johnston is true.  He said that it was waste of good food to take out 100 per cent. of flour from wheat because the human being can only digest 85 per cent., but the remaining percentage taken out could be digested by pigs, chickens and so on.  I do not think that is right.  I think the human being is capable of digesting just as much as the pig or chicken, so that whatever one cannot digest the other cannot. Senator Baxter said that wheat is the most fickle of our crops and that much of the technical advice which is given is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every technical man may vary his advice sometimes, and every technical man in agriculture, which is such an inexact science, has to give a lot of advice which is his own opinion.  He cannot be dogmatic and say: &ldquo;That is the teaching.&rdquo;  He can tell you that that is the teaching to a certain extent. <Col N="1406" /> He can say: &ldquo;If I were doing it, that is what I would do.&rdquo;  He will admit he may be wrong in it.  He can just tell you what he would do if it was his own case.  That is all you can expect in the case of agriculture. That being so, wrong advice may have been given at some time.  The yield last year was low but not altogether due to the continuous cropping of wheat.  There was a very unsatisfactory yield in Great Britain, where they had any amount of artificial fertilisers. Therefore, the unsatisfactory yield must have been to some extent due to the bad year.  We can only wait and see what is going to happen this year. We can only hope that it will be better.  Senator Ó Buachalla spoke of reserve fertility.  His point was that we should not be discouraged by the plea that we have only a certain reserve of fertility and that when that goes we are finished as far as wheat growing is concerned.  I think the Senator is right and that too much is being made of this reserve and of the suggestion that, as years go on, we will get less and less of a return.  It has been said already that if we take the arable land and take the full acreage we need for human food it will be found that no farmer need sow wheat in the same field more than once in 12 years.  In other words, we have 12 times as much arable land as we need for growing wheat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is assuming that all the arable land is suitable for wheat.  Does the Minister accept that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not exactly.  If I had taken all the arable land it would have been 18 to 1 and I am allowing a rough margin and making it 12 to 1. Under the Compulsory Tillage Order they take the arable land.  As far as we can make the calculation the arable acreage is about 11,000,000.  We want about 600,000 or 700,000 acres of wheat so that there is the sum to be done.  Apart from that altogether there is the fact also that we have 600,000 or 700,000 acres under root crops, potatoes, mangolds and so on. Practically all that land has been <Col N="1407" /> manured, and generally, if our farmers would&mdash;I do not say all, because some farmers must continue to grow root crops&mdash;sow wheat after the manured crop, we would have quite good crops of wheat on manured land.  We are not speaking of this great reserve of old pasture which has such a big reserve of fertility.  Looking at it in various ways, we can afford to be a bit more optimistic than we should be if we thought we were facing in four or five years' time a period in which we could not possibly grow wheat for ourselves.  I do not think that is going to happen.</P>
      <P>Some Senators talked about an insurance scheme.  Senator Ó Buachalla mentioned it in his speech.  I think an insurance scheme is not going to do a whole lot of good.  I suppose the idea is to insure the farmer against partial failure through bad seed or bad germination of seed or from a bad season. There would be a lot of claims under a scheme like that and of course where the claims are high the premiums also are very high.  Administration is very costly and there would also be a good deal of inspection necessary.</P>
      <P>The farmer would really be paying a high premium, a great part of which would go to the upkeep of the company or whatever organisation would administer this scheme.  Taking it over the years, he would get back part of the money but only part of it.  It is not like insuring bloodstock where the risk of accident or death is small, the premium being accordingly small while if such an accident occurred it would be a very serious thing for the farmer concerned.  On the other hand it would scarcely ever happen that there would be a total failure of a crop.  There might be a failure of four acres out of 24, or some small percentage of the total acreage and it would be much better that the farmer in such a case should carry his own insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins also spoke of the desirability of getting the owners of <Col N="1408" /> threshing machines to make returns. The Senator, I take it, had two points in mind in making that suggestion&mdash; firstly, to ensure that the owners of such machines were using their paraffin in a proper manner and secondly, so that we might have a return of the amount of wheat threshed.  That is a matter we have had in mind, to ascertain whether it is practicable.  It would be a very good thing if we had returns which would give us a rough idea of the amount of wheat threshed in each case.  If the farmer did not account for all that wheat, either by showing that he had sent it to the mill, kept it for seed, or used a certain quantity for his own family, we could at least ask him what became of the quantity which he had not accounted for.</P>
    <P>Senator Cummins asked two questions. The first was in regard to phosphates. I do not think the position is as good as Senator Cummins appears to think.  There are raw phosphates in this country but they are very hard to get at&mdash;to quarry or to mine as the case may be.  They are very hard and insoluble.  They are more difficult to manufacture than the imported phosphates and they are not as high in phosphate content as the imported article.  Taking one against the other, if we were to assess their relative values, a ton of raw phosphate at the mine ready to send to the factory would be worth less than a ton of raw imported phosphate at the port.  I could not say exactly what the difference in value would be.  Of course we are doing everything possible to utilise the native material.  As the Senator stated, a company was set up and that company is trying to get as much as they can of the native material because it would be well to have it, even though it is lower in phosphate content than the imported material.  Of course, by the time it reaches the farmer it does not matter to him how hard it was to quarry it because he gets his analysis and he can compare it with the imported phosphate.  That is all he is concerned with.</P>
    <P>Senator Cummins also asked for my opinion about the amendment.  The last time this amendment was before <Col N="1409" /> the House I remember saying that if I were a Senator I would vote against it.  Although I say to the Seanad that I still think Senators should turn it down, I quite admit that in a month's time I might have to come to the House and say that we should have compulsory wheat growing.  The difficulty I see about it is that there are many farmers whose land may be arable, but all of it may not be suitable for wheat growing.  You would therefore have to provide for some sort of appeal in a scheme of that kind.  That would be an enormous job because you would have an enromous number of appeals and the machinery would have to be very elaborate.  If we could get over that problem it would be on the whole fair to have a scheme of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">

      <P>The amendment does not make it compulsory; the Government would have to take the necessary steps themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that, but I take it that anybody who votes for the amendment votes for it on the assumption that the necessary adjustment will be made to make the scheme practicable. With regard to the motion itself, if I may take it as a measure of the anxiety of Senators with reference to the policy of wheat growing, I can only feel gratified that we are all so united so far as wheat growing is concerned. It is at least one plank that is common on every platform now, but I do not see what further encouragement is necessary. The price is satisfactory.  I do not think that there is a single farmer in the country who has been complaining of the price.  That being so, I cannot see that the putting down of motions like this in the Seanad or the Dáil, or having debates of this kind in either House, is going to improve the position.  After all, there are farmers in the country who have a great respect for an institution like the Seanad and I am sure a great respect&mdash;I might add, deservedly so&mdash;for the intelligence of Senators.  If they read that Senators think that they are not getting a <Col N="1410" /> fair price for the wheat, it is going to have a very bad effect on them.  I do not see how it could have any other effect.</P>
      <P>If things are well enough as regards price, etc., &mdash;and every Senator seems to think that the price is all right&mdash; then why not leave well enough alone? All this debate, in my opinion, is not going to do a bit of good.  As regards the question of a guarantee, I do not think a guarantee is necessary.  Surely to goodness any farmer in this country, whether he voted Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or Independent at the last election, realises one thing at least &mdash;that, as far as the Fianna Fáil Party is concerned, it spent years in pushing this policy of wheat growing.  The farmer will say to himself: &ldquo;That Government, at any rate, will surely do everything possible to see that there is no diminution in the quantity produced either during the emergency or when it is over.&rdquo;  I do not think any assurance at all is necessary as far as the farmers are concerned on this question of wheat growing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy The McGillycuddy">
      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing in which the Minister was extremely successful is that he has completely by-passed the main suggestions which were made in moving this motion, in regard to the decentralisation of the machinery to bring about increased wheat production.  Although the Minister finished his speech on a high note&mdash; he said that the price was all right and that nobody was complaining&mdash;it is abundantly clear that ships are still bringing in wheat, that we still have bread queues in the cities and towns, and even in the villages, and that people are sometimes forced to go away without getting bread.  The Minister has also told us that in my case, as in the case of many others, there has been a change of heart.  I admit that for years I thought that a grass policy was better than a wheat policy, but anybody who is not prepared to alter his opinion, according as circumstances alter, and to give credit, as I do, to the present Government for having raised the acreage under tillage <Col N="1411" /> to the present standard, is no more than a fool.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, there are numbers of people whose opinion does not change whatever be the circumstances.  I am not one of those.  Various Senators have made certain suggestions on what were thought to be constructive lines in order to encourage production and get the full amount of wheat which the Government, in spite of their efforts&mdash; let me put it that way&mdash;have not been able to get yet.  One of them was made by Senator Crosbie and was also dealt with by Senator McGee, and that was, that the county councils should deal with this question by personal effort.  Senator Crosbie was more concrete in his proposals than Senator McGee.  I do suggest to the Minister, in spite of his not having dealt with it here in the House, that he and his officials should examine whether the best could not be got out of the British tillage system; whether he should not decentralise the work and have it done in the counties instead of in Merrion Street.  The local people can pick out the land that is not arable, and avoid the numerous exemptions which, notwithstanding what the Minister says, still exist all over the country.  I am quite convinced that there is a great deal of arable land which is not being scheduled as such by the inspectors.  I could go a bit further and refer to a complaint to a county committee of agriculture in session by a county instructor that in certain parts of his district the inspectors were classing a lot of land which should come under the plough as not being suitable for the purpose.  I think a lot of those exemptions would be done away with if you appointed small committees, reinforced by the most active members of the county committees of agriculture, give them each a district, and see what they can do. If compulsory tillage is not wanted, there could be, at any rate, advice given as to the different types of cereals to be grown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Crosbie dealt with another point to which the Minister did <Col N="1412" /> not refer and that is the absorption of labour after the war.  That question is bound up with the suggestion we have made that there should be a definite price for wheat for some time after the war.  You will have some 150,000 persons coming back here, people who have been earning a very high rate of wages, people who have been sending money home, and whose services will no longer be required abroad.  Some employment will have to be found for those people.  They will have to be fed.  They have been accustomed to a higher standard of living, and, if there is dissatisfaction at a lower standard, that passive dissatisfaction may quite easily turn into active revolt, which in its turn might easily disturb the peace of our country just as it is beginning to progress.  All that Senator O'Callaghan said was very true and very sound.  I regret that he thought I made an attack on the Government and on the Taoiseach.  I had no intention of doing anything of the kind, and I am sure he understands that now.  Senator Johnston's contribution was entirely destructive.  Some of his remarks, in my opinion, were irrelevant, some were misleading and some were positively harmful.  He was prepared, at a moment's notice after the war, to import cheap wheat and leave the farmer absolutely stranded.  Imagine the inconsistency of that.  Would he have said the same thing about cement, boots, or the other things which we are protecting and the manufacture of which is giving employment to our people at the present moment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>He does say those things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy The McGillycuddy">
      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just referring to his inconsistency.  I think remarks like that are extremely harmful. He suggested co-operation with the British.  Well, anybody who has read British political history ever since the industrial revolution must know <Col N="1413" /> that the volume of votes in the towns returned to the House of Commons so many members who demanded cheap food that they were able to outvote the country representatives.  They will always go on outvoting them, and after this war you will have in England exactly the same drop as regards agriculture, in spite of the prophecies now, as you have had on every occasion after a war.  That is what we are trying to make our Minister guard against for a period of years.  We did not mention a specific period because we wanted all the Senators here to make constructive suggestions during the discussion. Not one of them, until we pressed Senator Hawkins, could make any suggestion as to whether it should be two years or three years or anything else.  Finally, Senator Hawkins differed from us by only one year. The period is very small; there is very little difference between us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may return to Senator Johnston, he criticised the British because they would not buy our cattle. It is quite obvious that the British would have bought our cattle if they wanted them, and if the prices were right, particularly now when their situation as regards shipping is so serious.  Finally, he referred to the movers of this motion as racketeers. That was the manner in which he referred to the people who came here to try to do what they considered best to increase the amount of bread available for the poor of the cities.  I think that was monstrous and grossly unfair to all of us who are doing our best in this matter without any political bias.  The Minister must admit that we are advocating exactly the <Col N="1414" /> same policy that he himself has been advocating for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some of the remarks which Senator Ó Buachalla made at very great length.  A great deal of his speech was merely a repetition of what had been said by the movers of this motion.  In fact it appeared to be a speech delivered quite regardless of what all the other speakers had said.  He began by talking about the question of what the price was to be and how long it would continue.  Senator Crosbie had already elaborated the matter at very considerable length.  I should say that he quoted Professor Caffrey in a way which I am perfectly certain Professor Caffrey never intended.  He generalised about land and its value.  You cannot generalise about land, or even about the four or five fields of any one farm as regards wheat growing or anything else. In conclusion may I say I regret that in spite of the efforts we have made that, at present, at any rate, the Minister has not seen fit to deal in any way with the suggestions we have made about decentralisation, but we have put our proposals on record.  We know that at present there is a shortage of bread, and that there will probably be decreasing yields, nor will there be anything additional for feeding to animals, and we hope that from whatever we have been able to say, the Minister may pick out a few items which may seem good to the country possibly in the future.</P>
