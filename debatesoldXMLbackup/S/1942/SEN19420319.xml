    <Title>Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1942&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The customary provision is made at Section 2 for the continuance in force of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts for another year, that is, up to the 31st March, 1943.  This year the Bill contains some additional sections, mainly of an amending nature.  The purpose of the majority of these is fairly clear from the context, but I shall explain them briefly.</P>
      <P>The number of acting promotions which has taken place in the Defence Forces since the commencement of the emergency has rendered it desirable that specific provision should be made in the Acts for this class of promotion. Existing legislation, while adequate, is of a general nature and does not distinguish between substantive and acting promotion.  It is also desirable to cover by legislation the question of reversion from acting higher rank, which has hitherto been dealt with in Army regulations.  Acting promotion carries with it, of course, the liability of reversion at any time.  The necessary provision in regard to commissioned officers is now being made at Section 4, and in regard to non-commissioned officers and men, at Section 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Section 6, the civil courts have had before them a number of cases in which irresponsible soldiers were found guilty of damaging civilian property in such ways as by breaking windows.  As the law stands, the courts in such cases are unable to make <Col N="666" /> orders in regard to compensation with the certainty that they can be met, although, in similar circumstances, a court martial or a soldier's commanding officer can order deduction to be made from the man's pay.  It would be wrong, however, that civilians injured in their persons or property by soldiers outside military quarters should have to look to military courts for redress. It is proposed, therefore, to give the civil courts the necessary power to deal adequately with offences of the nature which I have mentioned by the enactment of Section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 7, in so far as the main principle is concerned, is a repetition of a section in last year's Act which provided that no soldier or reservist would be entitled to be discharged during the emergency.  For administrative reasons, it is desirable that the method which has been adopted in practice of deciding the status of men held in Army service under that section when their ordinary engagements have expired should be covered by legislation and this is now being done.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is also a slightly amplified version of a section of last year's Act. The addition consists of the application of the procedure set out in the 1925 Act to officers of the Reserve of whom there is now a large number out on permanent service.  Last year's section related only to officers of the Forces.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 have for their purpose, mainly, to ensure that the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme, which refers to military ranks only, will equally apply to marine ranks and grades of rating and that persons holding military rank, on being transferred to the Marine Service, may be given the equivalent marine rank or grade of rating or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 are in the nature of qualifications of Section 57 of the No. 2 Act of 1940 and Section 8 of the Act of 1941, which provided that temporary officers, soldiers who enlisted for the period of the emergency and Reserve officers and men out on permanent service, would, on return to civilian life, be entitled, subject to certain conditions, to be restored to their former civilian employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="667" /> Those sections were enacted to protect the interests of the classes mentioned. The basis of such protection is, however, the State's expectation of receiving good and loyal service and it is considered that the State should not continue to extend its protection in this important matter to persons who do not give satisfactory service.  In addition, the former employer himself must receive a degree of protection.</P>
    <P>I feel that nobody will cavil at the proposal that dismissed officers and soldiers, discharged with ignominy or by sentence of court martial, should lose their right of reinstatement in civilian employment.  Where an officer is dismissed, serious misconduct is invariably involved and, since the officer has failed to give good and loyal service, he has forfeited his right to the protection of the State.  The soldier dismissed with ignominy or by court martial sentence is in an exactly similar position.  A further consideration is that the former employer could not reasonably be expected to reinstate such an officer or soldier, particularly if the dismissal or discharge was occasioned by an offence of a criminal nature.</P>
    <P>Neither, I think, can objection be taken to the proposal to deprive of their right of restoration to civilian employment soldiers discharged for having wilfully made a false answer on attestation, for misconduct or on conviction by the civil power.  Any doubts which Senators may have in the matter will be resolved on consideration of the following points: A soldier who, on attestation, makes a false answer of such a relatively harmless nature as giving a wrong age or address, is not, as a rule, discharged if that fact subsequently comes to light.  Discharge takes place only where a serious misstatement is involved.  A soldier who makes a wilfully false answer of such a nature that he must be discharged when that fact is discovered obtains a contract with the State by false pretences and puts the State to considerable expense for his training, maintenance, equipment and payment.  He has not, therefore, any right to State protection.  Again, a soldier discharged <Col N="668" /> for misconduct is invariably guilty of some serious offence or misconduct.  A record of discharge for misconduct, naturally, affects a man's prospects in civilian life and for that reason the military authorities are reluctant to discharge a man on that ground if such a course can be avoided.  Where there is no option but to effect a soldier's discharge for misconduct, it may be taken that he is definitely of an undesirable type and it would be most unjust to require a civilian employer to reinstate him in his former employment. A soldier is not as a rule discharged as a result of conviction by the civil power unless his offence is of a definitely criminal nature and, in such cases, again, the position of the former employer must be considered.</P>
    <P>I do not think that I need say anything about the third category&mdash; unapprehended deserters.  These are the persons mentioned in Section 11 as persons to whom Section 119 of the Principal Act applies.  Apprehended deserters are not specifically covered because of the fact that, on being apprehended, they are not as a rule discharged but, after having served the sentence imposed on them by the military authorities in respect of their desertion, are required to complete their army engagement with a period equal to the period of absence and detention added.  If, however, they are discharged on completion of the term of detention, discharge is effected &ldquo;for misconduct&rdquo; and Section 11 will apply in such cases.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, unnecessary for me to say more on this subject, except to add that the proposed sections will not prevent an employer from reinstating a former employee but will only remove the right to reinstatement. The employer may, if he so desires, take back into his service any person to whom Sections 11 and 12 apply, so that it is quite possible that many such persons, if the circumstances of their dismissal or discharge from the Defence Forces are not of a definitely criminal nature, may find it possible to secure re-employment in their former work or business.  That, however, is a matter for the employers to <Col N="669" /> whom the State will, through the enactment of Sections 11 and 12, have given a reasonable and necessary degree of protection against having to reinstate persons of clearly undesirable character.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 13, it has been found that, in the majority of cases, there is no necessity for the procedure set out in Section 54 of the No. 2 Act of 1940 in regard to persons arrested as suspected deserters, because the arrested person admits from the beginning that he is a deserter.  It is now being provided, therefore, at Section 13 that, in such cases, the arrested person will be handed over to the appropriate military authorities without any formalities, the existing procedure of bringing an arrested person before a district justice or peace commissioner for inquiry being retained for persons who deny that they are deserters or for cases where any doubt exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not present for the first part of the Minister's statement, but I presume that, inasmuch as this is new legislation, it was brought in because a change has been made in relation to what is provided for in this section.  I should like to know what change is being made by virtue of the sub-sections in this enactment. They state the Minister or any officer authorised by him in that behalf may promote or may reduce any member of the Defence Forces holding non-commissioned rank or grade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because of the fact that we had to bring in acting promotion. At present almost every promotion is of a temporary character. <Col N="670" /> Men are promoted from one rank to another in an acting capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Only in relation to officers.  Does it relate to non-commissioned officers also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applies.  Promotions at present are mainly in an acting capacity.  The time may come&mdash; I suppose it will come&mdash;when they will have to revert.  This gives power to revert in respect of officers or men in the lower ranks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister speaks of officers, they receive their commissions from the head of the State.  I take it that this also relates to non-commissioned ranks.  It would be a very serious matter if a lesser authority than the head of the State could actually commission a man.  I do not think that applies here and that this Bill relates only to non-commissioned officers.  Is not that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a very radical change if you were going to give power to commission to anyone other than the authority I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not apply here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seemed to imply that it did.  At present can a man ranking as a non-commissioned officer be promoted, in that way from corporal to sergeant?  To reduce an officer there should be cause shown and that would involve the Executive. What is the present machinery for reducing a man from the rank of sergeant to corporal, or promoting him from corporal to sergeant?  What difference arises out of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The question of reverting a non-commissioned officer is in the hands of the commissioned officer.  He promotes or he reverts as he deems prudent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this now would be that a lieutenant may promote or demote.  We will assume that a company officer decides that a man who is a corporal should be made a sergeant or that a man who is a sergeant should be made a corporal. The company officer would be, say, a captain.  Now this says that the Minister or any officer authorised by him may promote a non-commissioned officer.  I am trying to make out what is the purport of this.  I gather from that that it means that a lieutenant may also do so.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On this stage, I desire to raise a point analogous to that to which I referred just now. Section 4 says that the Minister may promote any officer to a higher substantive rank and that the Minister may promote any officer to a higher acting rank.  Then it goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An officer promoted to higher acting rank shall at any time thereafter, on a direction to that effect being given by the Minister, as published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, revert to his substantive rank or, as may be so directed, to an acting rank higher than his substantive rank.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does seem to me to be a very radical change.  The Minister will say <Col N="672" /> that a large section of the men in the Army now are on a temporary basis for the duration of the emergency, therefore there is something impermament about the ranks to which they are commissioned.  At the same time, this does not distinguish between temporary and permanent members of the forces.  I am not quite sure whether there is anything in the Constitution on this point but this Bill says that the Minister may promote any officer to a higher substantive rank or to a higher acting rank.</P>
    <P>The case of the officer promoted to a higher acting rank is fairly simple because the man is only performing functions normally performed by a man of a certain higher rank and he is not commissioned to such rank but, as I say, the Minister may also promote any officer to a higher substantive rank.  I am not quite sure what the practice is now.  I do not know whether it has been changed, but normally the Minister had not power to promote&mdash;it was an Executive act. Under the provisions of this section, the Minister&mdash;there are actually two Ministers at the moment&mdash;can take a second lieutenant and give him the rank of major-general.  Normally, both for the protection of the officers in the Army so that they would have a sense of security, and as a protection against injustice, the whole Executive Council was invoked.  If an officer has to be reduced or relieved of his commission it can only be done for cause shown. Now you are going to clothe the Minister of this Department&mdash;it does not even say that it must be done in consultation with the Minister for Finance although it would involve financial liabilities&mdash;with full power and put it entirely within his jurisdiction to give any substantive rank he likes or thinks desirable.  That does seem to be a very radical change in the Army Act.</P>
    <P>We are passing this Bill from its Second to its Final Stage without bothering about its implications but this is a very radical change, as far as I can interpret it, in the whole administration of the Army.  The Minister, as far as I can see, has offered no adequate explanation as to why this should be <Col N="673" /> done.  So far, the commissioned ranks in the Army have been jealously watched, not merely by the Minister but by the whole authority of the State.  They receive their commissions from the President.  Article 13 of the Constitution says: &ldquo;The exercise of the supreme command of the Defence Forces shall be regulated by law&rdquo; and &ldquo;All commissioned officers of the Defence Forces shall hold their commissions from the President.&rdquo;  Now the President acts upon the advice of the Executive Council but here this is taking power as far as I can read it to give the Minister the right to promote an officer on his own.  The Minister&mdash;I am speaking impersonally&mdash; rather likes the look of an officer and decides to promote him.  He does not receive the rank, of course, until he has received it from the President. The President acts by virtue of powers specifically bestowed on him or he acts on advice given by the Executive Council&mdash;not given by the Minister for Defence.  This does seem to me to represent a very radical change.</P>
    <P>We are given no guidance in the matter, and the Minister does not advert to it at all.  I may have misinterpreted the section, but it seems that henceforward the Minister may promote any officer to a higher substantive rank. Formerly the officer could not have higher substantive rank without being commissioned by the President.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I had assumed that Senators had a certain amount of knowledge of these Acts; therefore I did not go into them in very great detail. Section 11 (A) of the Act of 1924 states in very clear and specific language:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may from time to time promote officers and soldiers of the Forces in accordance with regulations to be made by him.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is absolutely no change whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That was under the 1924 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When was the present Constitution passed?</P>

    <Col N="674" />
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are acting in accordance with that very Act now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister can see that things which might be legal under the Constitution in force at the time the 1924 Act was passed, may be quite illegal to-day under the Constitution in its present form?  I read one passage which says that the exercise of the supreme command of the Defence Forces shall be regulated by law and that all commissioned officers of the Defence Forces shall hold their commissions from the President. That was not the case then. The President, of course, is only another name for the Governor-General. I cannot remember offhand exactly what was in the Constitution before it was amended but here you are passing this Bill in 1942 subject to the Constitution that was passed about 1938.  There is no good telling me what is in the 1924 Act unless I can be shown that the acts permitted under the 1924 Act are also provided for in the particular form of the Constitution as it now stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, there is absolutely no change.  The position is as it always has been.  The question of reversion is somewhat different. We have not had provision in legislation for reverting officers.  If a regular officer is not suitable, he goes out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On cause shown?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Here we have large numbers of officers who, in the course of time, receive acting promotion from lieutenant to captain, from captain to commandant, and perhaps from commandant to major.  The time will come when these men will have to be reverted to the next rank, or to a rank lower, or may have to go out altogether.  We are giving ourselves power to do that.  The form in which a man is promoted to the rank of officer is one which is very carefully considered.  There is a Council of Defence which examines the promotions, not put up by the Minister or by the Chief of Staff, but by the commanding officers of the various units. These promotions are examined very <Col N="675" /> carefully.  The general headquarters staff, when they submit them to the Council of Defence, presided over by me, get down to examine very carefully the qualifications of the various people put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister does not mind my saying so, I think that is irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to tell the Senator is the procedure.  I did not like to interrupt the Senator because I wanted him to make his case so that I could hear it and reply to it. When all this has been done, it goes one step further.  It goes to the Executive Council for its approval, and, when that approval has been secured, it goes to the President for his signature. The President signs the commission which is eventually handed over to the officer.  There is nothing sinister in this.  It simply gives us a power which we must have to revert officers when the time comes for reverting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is stressing revert officers.  I am dealing with this sub-section, which says that the Minister may promote any officer to a higher substantive rank.  The Minister tells me that the Defence Council meets and receives recommendations from the commanding officers, that it considers them and refers them to the Executive Council, which advises the President.  That is all right, but here we are changing the law as it stands, by setting out that the Minister may promote.  If the Minister may promote, he is endowed by law with a function which does not require him to refer the matter to the Executive Council at all. So far as I can judge, the Minister seemed to be arguing my point.  The Minister refers it to the Executive Council, which can then advise the President.  That is strictly in accord with Article 13, sub-section (5), of the Constitution.  If you pass a law now saying that the Minister may give substantive rank, that power is vested totally in him, and if he says: &ldquo;I do not feel like consulting the Executive Council&rdquo; or &ldquo;I do not think they will <Col N="676" /> agree to this promotion&rdquo;, he has this law to back him up and legally to empower him to forgo that which presumably will be a completely voluntary and gratuitous act on his part under the provisions of this Section 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to get at is the machinery and the form gone through.  A man is a cadet or a private, and is to be granted a commission. That is given to him by the President and it is understood that the Minister's advisers and so on may advise on the matter.  He is then a commissioned officer and from that point his commission remains only the commission of a second lieutenant, superadded from time to time, but the substantive commission is never anything but that of a second lieutenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to say that when the promotion of a regular officer is in the substantive form.  It is only the acting promotions we are worried about.  During the <Col N="677" /> emergency, practically all promotions are to acting ranks, but in ordinary peace times promotions are substantive promotions.</P>

      <P>May somebody who was never a Minister for Defence speak in this debate?  I thought this was a very simple Bill, but, having heard the Minister and the ex-Minister for Defence on Section 4, I am becoming less and less clear every minute. The only thing I noted with great satisfaction was the Minister's reliance on the Act of 1924 and apparently on the Constitution of 1924.  He even uses the terminology of the old Constitution and of the Act of 1924 when he speaks about the Minister and the Executive Council.  It does, however, seem to be clear that the commission, the substantive rank, must be given at the instance finally of the Government and not of the Minister alone, that the commission proceeds from the President, if we take this Article of the Constitution which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All commissioned officers of the Defence Forces shall hold their commissions from the President.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It does appear that this section does give a power to the Minister alone which was previously vested in the Executive Council, or the Government, which is a group.  I think, although, like Senator Foran, I am not very clear, that we are on the Fourth Stage of the Bill.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators are aware from past experience that the Central Fund Bill is required to implement the Ways and Means Resolutions passed by Dáil Eireann.  Generally the form of the Bill is stereotyped.  It is designed to authorise the issue from the Central Fund of the amount of the Vote on Account this year of £13,445,000 for the financial year to end on the 31st March, 1943, and also to cover the total of the Supplementary and Additional Estimates for the present financial year which were passed subsequent to the enactment of the Appropriation Act, 1941, and which amounted to £1,551,938.  The Bill also makes the usual provision for borrowing by the Minister for Finance and for the issue <Col N="680" /> by him of such securities as he thinks proper.</P>
      <P>I have already mentioned that the amount of the Vote on Account for the coming year is £13,445,000.  That is something slightly over one-third of the total net provision for the Supply Services, which, as Senators will have observed from the Volume of Estimates, is £39,112,301.  This figure represents an increase of £789,534 on the total net provision for 1941-42&mdash; that is including Supplementary and Additional Estimates; or an increase of £3,799,697 as compared with the original net provision for the current year.  The increase is attributable solely to the inclusion in the Estimates Volume for 1942-43 of a number of costly emergency services which did not appear in the Estimates Volume for last year.  I refer particularly to the Votes for Special Emergency Schemes, Food Allowances, Damage to Property (Neutrality) Compensation and Personal Injuries (Civilians) Compensation, which account for £1,935,000. In addition, the flour and bread subsidies, provided for under the Estimate for Supplies, are calculated to amount to £1,645,000.  Furthermore, the cost of food allowances provided for under the Estimate for Local Government and Public Health amounts to £200,000, while an additional £628,714 is needed for the Army.  All these extra items, which result directly from the emergency, amount to £4,408,714.  It will be apparent, therefore, that were it not essential to provide these new services there would be a reduction of £609,017 over the whole Supply Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to minimise, in any way, the formidable total of the Volume of Estimates for the coming year.  When we consider, however, that in addition to the £3,780,000 which is required for the new emergency services, a sum of £8,942,052 is required for the Army representing an increase of £7,170,331 over the 1938-39 provision for the Army service, it will, I think, be obvious that we are exercising rigid economy in connection with what may be described as our normal peace-time services.  If the increase of £7,170,331 in the provision <Col N="681" /> for the Army over the 1938-39 provision and the cost of the new emergency services be subtracted from the total of the Estimates for the coming year, the result will be that only £28,161,970 will be needed for our normal services.  This figure compares favourably with the actual expenditure of £28,248,822 during 1938-39, the last pre-emergency year.  As compared, therefore, with the actual expenditure in 1938-39, the Estimates for 1942-43, apart from the huge increase in the Army Vote and the cost of the new emergency services, show a reduction of £86,852, despite the rising cost of materials reflected throughout many of the ordinary services and the expansion of Governmental activity necessitated by present conditions.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for 1942/43 as compared with the current year's Estimates, including Supplementary Estimates, show increases on 37 Estimates and decreases on 35 Estimates.  Four Estimates show no change.  The total of the increases on the several Estimates is £2,376,726, while the total of the decreases is £1,587,192.</P>
    <P>I propose to comment briefly on the principal increases and decreases, other than those to which I have already referred.  Vote 7, Old Age Pensions, shows a decrease of £30,000.  An anticipated increase in the number of pensioners in 1941-42 not having been realised the Estimate for 1942-43 has been formed on a more conservative basis.</P>
    <P>Vote 10, Public Works and Buildings, is down by £84,013.  There are decreases of £38,500 on sub-head B&mdash;New Works, Alterations and Additions, of £1,000 on sub-head D (1)&mdash;Furniture, Fittings and Utensils&mdash;and of £6,400 on sub-head J (2)&mdash;Arterial Drainage.  A further decrease of £75,000 is due to the non-recurrence of the provision of that amount made by means of a Supplementary Estimate in 1941-42 for the purchase of Emergency Fuel Stores. These decreases are offset by increases of £22,000 under sub-head F&mdash;Fuel, Light, Water, etc.&mdash;of £2,997 under sub-head E&mdash;Rent, Rates, etc., and of £5,800 under sub-head J (5)&mdash;Arterial Drainage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> Vote 30, Agriculture, shows a reduction of £451,677.  The principal decrease, £464,029, occurs under sub-head N (1)&mdash;Diseases of Animals (Ireland) Acts, and is due, of course, to the expectation that the heavy expenditure necessitated in the current year by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease will not be repeated in 1942/43. The elimination of foot-and-mouth disease also accounts for a decrease of £14,780 on sub-head B (Travelling), while the suspension of the fertilisers scheme due to the non-availability of supplies provides a saving of £52,875 on sub-head G (3).  There are offsetting increases notably under sub-heads H and O (6).  Grants to county committees of agriculture under sub-head H are up by £42,250, due in part to an automatic increase in the normal grant following increased contributions by local authorities, and in part to an increase in the special grant for lime. Sub-head O (6) is up by £9,908 in respect of the provision of free seed, implements and instruction for allotment holders.</P>
    <P>Vote 31, Fisheries, shows a decrease of £16,965 due mainly to the non-recurrence of the provisions for special insurance of steam trawlers and for ex-gratia compensation to the former owners of the Erne fisheries.  The provisions for the Sea Fisheries Association are down by £5,500 mainly because fewer loans for boats and gear can be made available owing to the scarcity of materials.</P>
    <P>Vote 33, Gárda Síochána, shows an increase of £15,898, due mainly to an increase of £36,002 under sub-head O to cover the cost of a general issue of uniforms to the L.S.F.  Sub-head M is up by £8,462 owing to increased provision having been made for compensation awarded under the Gárda Síochána (Compensation) Act, 1941, in respect of death or injury sustained by members of the Gárda.  There are, however, offsetting decreases under other sub-heads, sub-head A being down by £13,015, as it will not be necessary to provide for a 53rd payday during 1942-43, while sub-head E shows a decrease of £22,003 due to an extension of the period of wear for <Col N="683" /> Gárda clothing.  Sub-head N is down by £6,451 due to non-recurring expenditure in the present year on wireless equipment and safes for official documents, while the absence of foot-and-mouth disease which, in 1941-42, occasioned abnormal police duty makes possible a decrease of £3,000 under sub-head C.  Appropriations-in-Aid are down by £4,293 owing to a fall in percentage payments from the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>Vote 41, Local Government and Public Health, is up by £100,889.  The bulk of the increase is accounted for by the provision of an additional £100,000 under sub-head J (4) to cover the cost during a full year of the special food allowances to recipients of home assistance.  The increases of £9,000 under sub-head J (2), of £6,000 under sub-head L (1), and £5,500 under sub-head N, are due mainly to rising prices, while the increase of £5,900 under sub-head T reflects the greater activity under the allotments scheme.  There is also an increase of £27,530 under sub-head S (1), in respect of contributions towards loan charges of housing schemes undertaken by local authorities. These follow more or less automatically on the additional housing schemes of local authorities. There is an offsetting decrease of £40,500 under sub-head S (2), due to a fall in applications for grants for private houses, etc., in urban areas.</P>
    <P>Vote 44, National Health Insurance, shows a decrease of £9,210, due mainly to reductions under sub-heads G (1) and G (2), in respect of statutory contributions to the National Health Insurance Fund.  The amounts provided under these sub-heads represent the estimated Exchequer liability in 1942-43 under the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1936.</P>
    <P>Vote 46, Primary Education, shows an increase of £11,162 which is due mainly to an increase of £9,400 under sub-head D to cover an increase in the number of pensioners.</P>
    <P>Vote 52, Lands, is down by £130,014. The main decrease of £128,600 occurs under sub-head I, Improvement of <Col N="684" /> Estates, etc., and is due in part to less activity in land division and also to shortage of materials.  The decrease of £2,033 on sub-head A, Salaries, etc., is due to the non-filling of vacancies, while the reduction of £6,000 on sub-head B, Travelling Expenses, is due to the resulting smaller activities and the secondment of staff to other Departments.</P>
    <P>Vote 54, Gaeltacht Services, shows a decrease of £28,510 due almost entirely to an anticipated increase in the receipts under Appropriations-in-Aid from sales of rural and marine industries' products.  Sub-head D (6), Materials, is up by £16,500 due in general to increased activity and to the rising cost of raw materials, while sub-heads E (3) and E (4) show increases of £4,542 and £2,550 respectively due to the greater amount of kelp and carrageen being collected and purchased.  There are offsetting decreases of £17,000 under sub-head H (3) due to the slowing down of housing activity, and of £5,100 under sub-head D (9) due to the non-availability of certain items of plant for the proposed new spinning mill.</P>
    <P>Vote 55, Industry and Commerce, shows an increase of £32,996.  Sub-head A, Salaries, is up by £4,561 by reason of the employment of additional staff in connection with the Food Allowances Scheme.  Increased provision for minerals development accounts for increases of £12,000 and £15,000 under sub-heads L (1) and L (3) respectively. Provision for the Turf Development Board is now made in the Vote for Special Emergency Schemes.  In 1941/42 the Industry and Commerce Estimate included sums totalling £19,000 for Grants-in-Aid to that board to cover portion of the year up to 12th June, 1941.</P>
    <P>Vote 58, Marine Service, shows an increase of £24,159.  Sub-head J, which provides for grants in respect of the equipment of ships for protection against magnetic mines, accounts for £22,200 of the increase.  There is also an increase of £3,000 under sub-head I (3) for pensions and allowances to crews (and their dependents) of ships registered in Éire who are killed or disabled as a result of the war.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> Vote 59, Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance, shows a decrease of £224,828.  The main decrease occurs under sub-head J, Unemployment Assistance, which is down by £215,000.  The figure for 1942-43 is based on the assumption that the conditions obtaining in 1941-42 will again obtain in the coming financial year.</P>
    <P>Vote 64, Army Pensions, shows a decrease of £57,540.  The decrease of £6,248 under sub-head E is due to the fact that the Referee and Advisory Committee are expected to complete their work at an early date and provision has been made under this sub-head for part of the year only.  The decreases of £6,866 and £43,830 under sub-heads G and K respectively are due to the fact that fewer claims are now being received and fewer pensions being granted under the Army Pensions Acts.  The main offsetting increase of £3,009 under sub-head L is occasioned by the larger number of pensions now being granted to members of the regular Army.</P>
    <P>Vote 66, League of Nations, shows a decrease of £8,328.  Only a token provision was provided in 1941-42, but full provision is being made for the coming year.</P>
    <P>Vote 67, Employment Schemes, shows a decrease of £250,000.  This reduction is due to the fact that the cost of certain schemes (e.g., farm improvement schemes) has been transferred to the Vote for Special Emergency Schemes.</P>
    <P>Vote 72, Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, shows an increase of £7,000, due to provision being made for an increased Grant-in-Aid of investigations and research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have on other occasions referred to the ineptitude of the Minister's statement, and even to his presence.  On this occasion, the document he read out, which I do not pretend to have listened to, contained details about sub-head D (3) of some Vote.  That is a typical product of a civil servant.  We are going to vote a sum of money which is calculated by ratio of proportion, roughly one-third of the total amount to be voted, <Col N="686" /> that is to say, we are voting one-third of the total Government policy and the total Government administration during the coming year.  It seems to me, to begin with, that the most appropriate Minister to be present on this occasion would be the Taoiseach because, I am not going to say that this sum is made up of exactly one-third of each Vote, but that is really the basis.  For instance, there is about £9,000,000 for the Army in the Estimates.  If that £9,000,000 were not there, we could assume that, instead of voting £13,000,000, we would now be voting £10,000,000.  Therefore, in so far as we consider this Bill, we consider the voting of this money in relation to the policy of the Government, to what the money is being spent on by all Departments. I say, therefore, the person to defend this Bill in this House is eminently the Taoiseach, not the Minister for Finance.  The matter of whether there is a decrease of £100 under sub-head D (3) in a particular Vote is rather unimportant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred just now to the Army. The document in relation to which this Bill should be discussed is the Book of Estimates.  If you turn to page 314 of the Book of Estimates you will see the Army Vote.  The Minister cannot tell us whether or not there has been an increase or decrease under any sub-head in the Army Estimates because there are not any Estimates.  We are still supposed to be a Parliamentary Government.  We have on a sheet of paper here a statement that something less than £10,000,000 is being spent on the Army.  We have no means of even asking intelligent questions about it. I know that this emergency is made to cover a multitude of sins, eminently of Governmental sins.  In England there is still&mdash;I will not say intelligent criticism of the Government&mdash;but there is very active criticism of the Government. One can only compare this country with other Parliamentary countries.  In England, the Government, fighting a war, vital for the very existence of its people, have to submit to enormous criticism.  When I get up here I feel that unless I, quite dishonestly, say how wonderful and perfect <Col N="687" /> the Government is and every Minister in it, there is going to be general indignation in Government circles and in the Fianna Fáil Benches.  At the same time I would be lacking in ordinary integrity in myself if I did not say a few things that I think.  I think that the Government, whether intentionally or not, is using the excuse that certain other countries are at war, which condition has certain repercussions here, to completely blanket down the whole idea of a legislative assembly here.  Take this matter of the Army.  I find my tongue tied. The most vital thing is to know whether or not the voting of this money is merely a quite way of robbing the Irish people or a way of providing for good service for the Irish people.  If I were to ask for certain information I should promptly be told that it was not in the public interest to give it.  I am not going to contest that, but I do say this, that when the Government finds itself in that position, there are other ways of meeting it.</P>
    <P>There is this enormous increase in the cost of the Army.  I agree that in the present condition of the world it is natural and normal that there should be an increase in the cost of the Army. I do not know that this increase that is being imposed on the people here is an increase that should be made.  I am not at all sure that it would not be just as well to fling the money down the gutter.  There is a way of providing that no information against the public interest would be made public and at the same time Parliamentary control would be maintained.  There is no reason why in relation to the various Estimates provided here the two Houses of the Legislature should not be divided up into a number of committees. A number of Deputies could go into one matter and a number of Deputies into another and occasionally certain Deputies could go into a number of matters.</P>
    <P>What is the position of this Assembly in relation to the Army for which £10,000,000 is voted?  With quite a flourish, there was appointed a thing <Col N="688" /> called the Defence Conference.  It was quite evident in the discussions on the Bill that if that Defence Conference had any function at all, it was not receiving the information that it had a right to have.  It was not receiving the information that every member of the Legislature would have a right to have if the emergency did not give the Government the excuse of its being against public interest to make that information public.  I do think that we must either face up to it that we have either embarked now upon the totalitarian system, upon the abolition of Parliamentary Government, or we must look around to see how that can be maintained without detriment to the national interest.</P>
    <P>I suggest a way that would do, first of all, to take the biggest Estimate here, the Army, that there should be a committee of members of the two legislative Houses appointed to go into the matter of the spending of that money, to examine the whole cost of the Army and see how far that money is wisely spent and how far that money is in fact providing for effective defence of this country in the case of attack.  Nobody knows.  The Minister in his speech, of which I only listened to bits, did refer to some increase or decrease arising out of the cost of uniforms for the L.D.F.  A man does not become a defender of his people by merely donning a uniform.  That is quite easy.  To wear a suit of one shape rather than another has nothing whatever to do with it.  We have a right to knowledge.  Surely the most vital thing to know is what position this country is in with regard to defence; how much of this £10,000,000 is going on warlike stores; what warlike stores are available; from what sources do we get them; what prospect have we of spending a proportion of this £9,000,000 to £10,000,000 on such war-like stores?  Of that, we are given no information at all.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister goes on to establish a sort of comparison between the total Estimate of this year and the total Estimate of 1938-39.  He assumed that, if the cost of the Army had not increased over that period, nothing can <Col N="689" /> be said against it, and that, if it has increased by reason of certain expenditure definitely attributable to the state of emergency, that answers all criticism. Just recently, the Minister implied in his speech that every possible economy is being effected.  With regard to some of the main items of expenditure in connection with the Army, we do not know whether it has or not. With regard to many other items, we are, in a certain way, able to form a judgment.  Just recently, certain questions were asked in the Dáil about the payment of directors of various companies and members of commissions set up by the Government.  In many cases I was not in a position to form a judgment, the names of the men being unknown to me, but there were many cases&mdash;I do not like mentioning names here&mdash;where I would invite the Government to state why the man appointed was appointed as distinct from anybody else in this country if it was not in payment for being a Party &ldquo;yes-man&rdquo;.  I do not like mentioning names&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, they have been published in the Dáil.  I am not suggesting that I do not like mentioning names because it would be out of order.  It is only just a natural reticence personal to myself.  In regard to the Army, I think&mdash;but I have no way of knowing&mdash;that the money is not being spent in direct relationship to services in the defence of the people of this country in the most effective way.  I think that; I am not in a position to judge.  I could propose to the Government a method by which the elected representatives of the people would be able to form a judgment and to vote for or against those moneys.  I could mention a hundred other things, but this possibly is not the appropriate time.  I have not the figures before me, but I think there is an item of £90,000 or something like that for wireless broadcasting. I think that is what it is.  It does not matter if I am £10,000 or £20,000 out, because personally I do <Col N="690" /> not know that anything should be spent on it at all.</P>
      <P>We have a Minister who is responsible for that.  Just within the last couple of weeks I noticed in the Press reports that he went down the country. Now, I am not going to attribute malice to the man because malice does require certain judgment and certain intelligence, and possibly malice would be most inappropriately attributed to him.  He may have believed&mdash;he could believe anything&mdash;in what he said.  He went down the country and said, with regard to speaking on the wireless in the way of propaganda, that all Parties were agreed that that should be entirely left in the hands of the Taoiseach.  I want to enter a protest against that immediately.  One of the reasons why I should like to see our broadcasting station closed down&mdash; apart from the fact that I am always ashamed when I think of people outside this country listening to it, because it has the distinction of giving the most outstandingly low-brow production of any wireless I have ever heard of&mdash;is that I think it has been used for broadcasting overseas statements that were detrimental to this country. Then the Minister goes down the country and tells the people that we are all agreed that the man who made those inept statements, those what I might call ill-mannered and ill-conditioned statements to external peoples, over the wireless, is the only man who should speak on the wireless.  I know that people may tell me that that large sum of money spent on that unnecessary and rather objectionable Department is drawn from wireless licences, but nobody can tell me that the people pay licences only because the only thing they want to hear is what they get from Radio Eireann.  I do strongly resent that my country should be misrepresented and presented in a bad light by the most important public representative in it, and that another Minister should then go and tell people that we are all agreed that nobody else should speak on those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Christmas, a broadcast was sent to the people of America.  I have questioned the ordinarily good manners <Col N="691" /> of the head of one State, by wireless broadcast, addressing the subjects of another Government.  That seems to me to be an outrage of the best traditions of international usage.  I know that we are entering into a period of ill-manners, but I do not quite see why we should be pioneers in the matter. The impression I got from listening to that broadcast last Christmas was this: here was an address to the people of America, to the Irish people in America if you like, and it seemed to me that it was almost as if you were trying to whisper to them that we were all heart and soul with them in a certain belligerent condition, but we did not want anybody to hear us putting it in such words that we could be challenged with having said it.  That, to me, was completely undignified.  The head of a State should get up and say outspokenly what he has to say, or leave it unsaid.  A couple of nights ago there was another broadcast.  There was a statement something to this effect, that he would have liked to have spoken to our people outside our country, presumably in America, Australia and places like that, but it was not possible. I wonder why it was possible last Christmas and not possible on 17th March.  What has happened to the ethereal waves in the meantime?  No new declaration of war has intervened in that period.  Having said it would be nice if that could be done, then by a sort of side-wind there was an attempt made to address people outside our jurisdiction.  I am quite prepared to believe that a case could be made for speaking to people outside our jurisdiction, but no case could be made for trying to speak to them while pretending that you are not doing anything of the sort.</P>
    <P>I refer first mainly to the Army. We are voting, presumably, £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 for the Army, and nobody here who is going to vote it can tell us anything about it.  Nobody can tell us how many men are in the Army. Nobody can tell us what equipment per man there is.  Nobody can tell us as to what reserve stores the Army has.  We are not at war.  Just yesterday, I think it was, or within the last week, one <Col N="692" /> heard a whole lot of information with regard to the condition of armed preparedness of countries actively engaged in war, but we are not allowed to know a word about it here.  Here we are this year voting about £40,000,000. I will agree that, normally, we had a way of judging that by relating the sum voted to the actual value of our annual productivity in the country.  That does not apply now because we, like practically every other country in the world, are spending not only the value of our production within the financial year, but the accumulated savings of our own and previous generations.  Always there is this excuse put up, that everybody else is doing the same thing.  The unfortunate thing is that we began doing it long before other people did &mdash;at the time of the economic war.</P>
    <P>I do not see the machinery for dealing with what I want to deal with here. We are voting now moneys to pay for the whole Government policy, both in its totality and in every minor detail. We are voting money to pay to Fianna Fáil adherents compensation as directors of companies and as members of commissions.  We are voting money for some of those voices that one hears on the wireless, and hastily turns off, just for the sheer cacophony of the voices.  We are voting money for the police.  Just the other day I saw a reference, if I remember rightly, to renewed recruitment for the police, and members of the Taca force, I think, can be made permanent.</P>
    <P>The Taca force, Senators may remember, was brought into existence a number of years ago, just after a political party had a rather late meeting in this building and a fire took place.  Suggestions, completely unsustained, and without a tittle of evidence, were brought forward that that fire was due to sabotage.  It was whispered, suggested, implied by the then head of the Government in the Dáil, but there was never one iota of evidence produced to prove that such was the case.  It is not unknown to Senators that, when this new force was taken into the police, within a very short time certain cases came up in court in which the men then taken into <Col N="693" /> the force admitted that up to the very moment when they became paid members of a force, paid by moneys voted by the Oireachtas, they had belonged to a criminal organisation, whose activities extended over an enormous range of crimes.  I need not go into them all, but I can say that their main function was the crime of murder.  They were taken into the police force and are still there, and they admitted in public court that they belonged to a criminal organisation before.  We are paying here for that force.</P>
    <P>Police are necessary at all times, and they may be more necessary in this time of emergency than under normal conditions.  But why should we pay for this particular force?  The very first right of a citizen is security of life, and the first duty of the police is to see that the citizen should have that security.  It is the duty of the police to promote and win that security, and to deal with everybody appropriately and in accordance with the law, instead of taking away that security and, in fact, taking life.  A short time ago I found it necessary to refer to this matter.  Look back at any time from 1932 onwards, and you will see what has been implicit in the Government policy, namely, that by belonging to a criminal organisation whose career is marked by blood, crime and perjury, in every year of that period, you benefit.  Certain men were taken into this Taca section of the police.  I am not saying they were taken in because they were members of that criminal organisation&mdash;I am not saying that all of them were&mdash;but I do say that, in so far as information was got with regard to them in sworn evidence in the courts&mdash;and they are the only ones I can tell you anything about &mdash;they belonged to that organisation.</P>
    <P>I referred recently to the fact that a detective was murdered in Cork.  He was in the service of the Government. That is one of a number of cases where the murderer was found guilty and sentenced to death and the Government used what is called the prerogative of mercy.  The normal thing is that the law should take its course.  A Government <Col N="694" /> must have the power of remitting sentences&mdash;that is agreed&mdash;but the Government exist for the well-being of the people and when the Government determine to intervene to prevent the normal functioning of the law they must take into consideration whether the well-being and safety of the people will be better promoted by their taking that abnormal action than by letting the normal law take its course. Within the last couple of years there was one case relating to the murder of a policeman where the ordinary law was not allowed to apply and the sentence of the court was not made effective. Apparently it did not matter about the murdered man, but it would be terrible if the murderer's life was cut short.  About the same time a man belonging to the same organisation was in prison and he purported not to take the nourishment that was provided for him there.  He was rightly imprisoned; the Government would not have him there if they had judged that the well-being of the country would have been better preserved if he were at liberty. But, because he purported not to take his meals, they let him out.  Why did he want to get out and what was the result of letting him out?  Another man acting in the service of the Government was duly murdered.  There was the case a few years ago of a man murdered in Dungarvan and was the man found guilty of the murder executed?  He was not.  Did he stay long in prison?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>I believe in paying for a police force, but my point is that what we are voting here is money to support the Government's policy with regard to spending the money of the Irish people, giving large or small sums annually to people who have no particular competence for any function, who have nothing to commend them for the holding of offices except that they have a sort of claim upon a political Party. That money I object strongly to voting. I object to pay for police in the service of the Government when the Government do not think it a crime worthy of death if these police are murdered.  I object to pay for police when those police, by the policy of the Party in power, are not allowed to have their <Col N="695" /> service fructified in the proper punishment of guilty parties.  I object to pay for an army unless I am satisfied that money is appropriately spent for the main purpose of an army&mdash;the defence of the State.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at this moment to follow the Minister into more minute details.  I do not accept as relevant the ratio between the expenditure this year and the expenditure in the year 1939 with regard to the Army.  The Minister said that the expenditure on the Army has gone up by £7,000,000. By how much has it gone up since 1932?  In 1932, the actual amount spent on the Army was about £1,100,000. Before the period of emergency arose the cost of the Army had been doubled. That would have been very good if as a result of the double cost we had an Army twice as efficient.  Was it so? I am not in a position to say definitely, but I do not think so.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Defence we bought war-like stores for the Army, nothing like the amount we should have.  We happened to buy them all from the one source for a number of reasons.  For one thing, the British Government, the ancient enemy as they were supposed to be, were the only people who would sell them to us.  For another, they sold them to us on the most advantageous terms, and they gave us the best value for our money. Every year when, as Minister, I brought in my Army Estimate, one of the present Ministers for Defence&mdash;nobody can say which is which&mdash;used to say that we were utterly dependent upon England.  He felt that so strongly that when I went out and he came in as Minister, he applied to quite a number of countries, Sweden, the United States, and Czecho Slovakia, to supply us with arms.  What I believe but I am not by any means in a position to prove it, and the Minister here probably cannot tell me any more than I know myself, is that instead of buying the appropriate armaments for our men on those occasions from the only place where they could be obtained and where the best value could be got, quite a long period went by without the normal <Col N="696" /> quota being bought, with the result that when finally they decided to revert to the only sensible course, and to buy from the only country that would supply us and give us good value, that country had then reached the stage when rearmament was urgently and abundantly necessary for herself, and she could not make all the armaments she required.  Like the prodigal son, we came back to her and took what she could supply us with.</P>
    <P>I can name a number of instances where I am satisfied this Vote should be reduced.  With regard to the Army, I think it is an insult to the Dáil and the Seanad that the Government have excluded us from all knowledge with regard to the mode of expenditure of such an enormous sum for such a small country and has not even tried to find another way whereby the requirements of Parliamentary control would be maintained, while at the same time the public interest would not be in any way jeopardised.  I think the theory that this Bill should be brought to us by the Minister for Finance is quite absurd.  I shall state again, as I stated, I think, this time last year, that the appropriate Minister to present this Bill to the Seanad, and to expound and defend it here, is the one who, above all, is responsible for the unity of Government policy, and that is the Taoiseach, and since he is not here I think we are just wasting our time without him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>One is always in the difficulty in dealing with this Vote on Account, particularly when one has to address oneself on matters relating to agriculture, that one is faced with a Minister whose way of life, whose residence, and whose contacts have been permanently in the cities of the world, our own and others.  But, Sir, the Government here, while not as militantly engaged as Governments elsewhere, have, none the less, grave responsibilities thrown upon them in these difficult days.  All of us, I think, would be happier&mdash;I, personally, anyhow, would be much happier&mdash;if we had more confidence that the money which we voted for government had been better <Col N="697" /> spent in the past and that it is going to be better spent than we fear it will be for the coming 12 months. Government policy this year represents only the fruits that are being collected from what has been sown over a number of years through which we have passed.  The great problem in this country to-day, the problem that is going to be most worrying for the Government, is the problem of supplies.  A great many of our people now are very worried with regard to supplies of all kinds. Worst of all, they are very worried with regard to those supplies which we could provide for ourselves, which we ought to have provided for ourselves, and which we would have available to-day if the Government of the past had been better than it was and if it had been wiser than it was.</P>
      <P>Now, while defence of the country in the military sense, the establishment and equipping of an army, is part of the essential function of government, there are various ways, other than by the sword, in which peoples defend themselves.  The trouble with this country for a number of years past, and the difficulty that most of us had confronting us in dealing with Government policy, was that the people who had the physical capacity to provide our people with their needs, particularly in the matter of food and fuel, were the most neglected citizens in the State.  Time after time, on this Vote on Account and subsequently, I raised my voice with the Minister's predecessor, pointing out to him that in my judgment the primary producers in this country were not fully or anything like adequately equipped for their task.  There is ample evidence to-day of the truth of that, and either the Minister who is present to-day or his predecessor can do very little to-day to aid us in the difficulties which confront us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We preached, time and again, that the industry of agriculture was understocked in every department.  We wanted more money, we wanted all our equipment renewed, our machines and so on; we wanted our land restored to a higher level of fertility, our stocks improved and their numbers increased. <Col N="698" /> From every side of the House&mdash;perhaps in a weaker voice, it is true, from the Government side than from elsewhere&mdash;this was pressed upon Ministers, but Ministers were always deaf, and if to-day there is less wheat and less flour, less stocks and stores of essential foods than are requisite and necessary for the maintenance of the health and well-being of the people of our country, the fault is due mainly to that lack of vision and that stubbornness on the part of Ministers in the past in their resolution that they would not listen to those who came from rural Ireland and who did their best to impress on them the requirements of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Now, we were turned into this war with agriculture in a very ramshackle state.  I do not know to-day just exactly what the difficulties are with regard to the better capitalisation of the industry, but I do know this quite well: that probably we could now get money to buy the equipment that we cannot obtain.  I know this also, that if we had got the money in time, to enable us to increase our stocks, to restore and improve our lands, and to increase the fertility of our soil&mdash;in other words, if we had been given anything like a decent chance&mdash;there would be no shortage of the foods that are essential for our people in this State to-day.  That, however, could only be achieved by a Government with the imagination that the present Government did not possess, as far as the industry of agriculture was concerned.  I think it is a matter, not alone of supreme regret on the part of all our people, but one over which Ministers to-day should be in sackcloth and ashes because of their want of understanding of the situation in the past.  It is true that when we urged on the Government in other days that you cannot carry on an industry without its being properly capitalised, that shops with empty shelves or half-filled shelves are not going to give the same level of life to the people who are engaged in trading as they would if the individual had his shop fully stocked with wares, we were told that to advance capital to farmers, to put them into <Col N="699" /> competition with one another, buying capital goods at inflated prices, and to have to repay this money when the war was over and when the price level had fallen very considerably, was only going to bring further disaster on the people of this country.</P>
    <P>When you see the position which confronts us to-day&mdash;we are told that in the matter of fertilisers there is a reduction of the amount spent by the Government in its subsidy this year of £52,875&mdash;it simply means that had the Government spent much more than was made available in the years before the war, we would have this stored fertility to-day; we would be able to draw on it, whereas now we are not able to draw upon it, and it is not available, and, in consequence, the provision of the essential foods for our people is a much more difficult task than, I believe, the Government realise.  Here we are coming into the spring, and demands are made upon farmers everywhere to till more than we have been asked to till for a generation.  Only those who live in the country know of the difficulties and the impossible demands which are being made upon farmers in this respect.  Equipment of all sorts is in short supply.  Power of every kind, machines, horses, fuel for machines, ploughs, and everything like that, are in short supply everywhere in the country.  That is the sort of situation which is the fruit of the Government's lack of interest in agriculture for the past ten years.</P>
    <P>The Government, I have no doubt, were much better informed than any of us about what the prospects of peace or war were.  The Government ought to have known and did know, I am sure; they had information available to them which we had not and they should have taken time by the forelock, if it were obvious to them&mdash;perhaps it was not&mdash;that the day would come when we would have to fall back on our own resources to provide our own essentials of life, and that that was not possible unless our people were fully equipped to perform the task.  They took over £25,000,000 out of agriculture in the form of capital goods and they will not <Col N="700" /> put anything back.  Now farmers are expected and have been expected for the last two years to do what, in my judgment, is physically beyond them, and to do it under the additional difficulties imposed on them, which they should not have to bear or experience.</P>
    <P>We are short to-day of flour because we are short of wheat.  I will not go into a long discussion as to whether the supply position would have been better served by building up stocks of foreign wheat rather than by exploiting our own soil for its production.  My view at the moment is that if the war continues for another year or two or as long as the Taoiseach apparently believes it will continue, whatever chance we have of being able to supply ourselves with our wheat requirements from our own soil is dependent entirely on the extent to which we did not use the soil for the production of wheat for the last four or five years, and, to the extent we have grown wheat on our own land, whether that has restricted our capacity to provide supplies for ourselves.  I know of my own knowledge and I know from men who have been intensively engaged in the production of wheat that on their lands the yield last year was much lower than on other soils where wheat had not been grown before.</P>
    <P>We must find fault with the Government's calculations.  Whether it is the fault of the statisticians who prepared the statistics, apart from the Ministry of Agriculture, or where the fault lies, I am not quite clear, but I think the Government made a considerable miscalculation with regard to the yield from wheat last year.  What I dislike is Ministers trying to put the blame on the farmers because the wheat yield has not brought the return which the Government anticipated and suggesting, openly on some occasions, and in an oblique way on others, that our wheat and flour supplies are short to-day because farmers have been using wheat to feed to animals.  Farmers like the truth as well as anybody else. I do not know any farmers who used wheat to feed to animals.  I do not know any of these in my county and in my county they probably go in for pig production <Col N="701" /> in a bigger way than in any other county.  I have heard it stated, and Ministers have been saying it, that farmers have been using wheat to feed to animals; trying to convey the impression and to let it go abroad to the people in towns and cities that if we are short, and will have to go short perhaps in the months to come, they may blame the farmers who feed wheat to their pigs.  I think that is an unjust slander upon the farmers.  I have not heard any Fianna Fáil Deputy or Senator repeat it.  I do not know any of them who will stand up and say they know people who did that.  I will not say that there are not individuals who did it, but I say that was not representative of what was happening in the country, and because it is very unrepresentative it is a slander which ought not to be repeated.</P>
    <P>Of course, somebody will tell me that they actually examined the stomachs of pigs and found wheat there.  I discussed that with somebody else whom I regard as having a good deal of information, and the answer was: &ldquo;Yes, some of my own pigs I discovered were eating some of the straw in the beds, and then I realised that the threshing had been done rather badly.&rdquo;  That is the sort of thing you get, and on facts like that you get a case built up against the farmers which annoys, irritates and does considerable damage in the farming mind, especially when these statements are repeated by Ministers. I do not know how much wheat may have been fed to animals, but I believe it would be a very small quantity indeed.  In the principal pig-producing counties, wheat growing was only carried out on a very small scale. In counties like my own, and in western counties, like Mayo, Sligo and Kerry, the area under wheat would have been very limited.  The total amount available to put on the market from these counties would have been very small.  I do not believe that the feeding of wheat to animals has been to any extent responsible for the position which the country is in with regard to the shortage of supplies.  It is due to the miscalculation made by those responsible, and then to the lack of energy on the part of the Government <Col N="702" /> when they realised what the position really was.</P>
    <P>If the position is as serious as Ministers indicate, I cannot understand why this was not discovered in November or December when the stocks of wheat coming to the mills were obviously dropping and why at that time action was not taken by the Government.  Why did they not go to the market and buy what oats and barley they could obtain then, hold the wheat and make a blend of these grains, which would have made it possible to distribute flour throughout the country which would be nearly adequate to our requirements? Like in other things, they left everything until the last minute.  Why did not the Government think of the situation with which they will be confronted if our supplies run out much earlier than perhaps even at the moment they anticipate?  I suggest that action ought to be taken by the Government.  They may find difficulties now in obtaining supplies of oats and barley.  But the oats and barley were in the country and could have been bought if a Government authority wanted to secure them as a standby for human food.</P>
    <P>There is to-day a considerable quantity of potatoes available.  But the Government ought to realise that if the people in the towns and cities are to be short of carbohydrates, if wheat and other grain are not available and they want some substitute, and potatoes are the one substitute which can meet the situation to a considerable extent, they had better not wait too long about making provision to have stores of potatoes laid by or they will be going to the country looking for them when they are used up or wasted, because farmers cannot keep pits of potatoes in the fields when they want to prepare and manure the land for wheat, oats or barley.  The potatoes must be got away and potatoes that were grown last year will not be very much good as animal food in July or August next.</P>
    <P>If the Government, who have the responsibility for seeing that none of our people goes hungry, think that they are not going to have enough <Col N="703" /> grain this year, they should go into the market now and buy and store as much of those potatoes as will ensure that the people will have something with which to fill themselves if grain is not available.  The Minister may not know that, for weeks past, the potatoes are growing in the pits. They are growing much earlier this year, even with us in the north, than they did last year.  To the extent that they continue sprouting, their value as food is deteriorating.  They will be much less valuable by June of this year than potatoes of 12 months ago were last June.  The farmers must get rid of them if they are not to be wasted.  If potatoes are to be left with me and with my neighbours and if we do not know whether or not they will be wanted as human food, we must make provision for using them up now.  You may find at the end of May that people in the cities and a great many people of the bigger towns will not have supplies. What I suggest may involve loss but the risk ought to be taken.  I do not know who can take it but the Government.  It may be that they will act as they did when a group of responsible people, who were prepared to buy supplies of tea which would carry the country on for three years, sought a guarantee from them. They were told that the Government were not prepared to give any guarantees.  The Government washed their hands of responsibility for seeing that the citizens would have a reasonable supply of an essential food and we see what the position to-day is in regard to our supplies of tea.</P>
    <P>The Government do not desire to be reminded of these matters, but these are facts.  If the people are short of many commodities to-day, it is largely due to the fact that the Government had not either the imagination or the courage to face up to the proposition of laying in supplies in time.  When these considerations were urged upon the Government, in the other House and here, those doing so were told that they did not know what they were talking about, and that the Government were so competent that they were looking <Col N="704" /> after everything.  Then we find ourselves catapulted into the present position. It was not that we had not the money to lay in stores.  The money was either here or in Britain, and little good it is in either place now, so far as the provision of essentials is concerned.</P>
    <P>Apart from what the Government may do to meet any shortages from now until the next harvest, there is, with regard to the whole position of our food and fuel supplies, need for complete reorganisation of our manpower if we are not to be worse off 12 months hence than we are to-day.  In sections of the Press, great fuss is being made about people leaving the country.  Neighbours of my own cannot find men to do a job on the land. Several of my neighbours have asked me if I could do anything to find labour for them.  They are expected to till, as they have always tilled.  That is the position throughout the country in spring, when we are only commencing to make provision for the sowing.  As we go into the months of summer and harvest, what the plight of the farming community will be is beyond my imagination.  I believe that we shall not have anything like adequate numbers of men to help us in the fields.  It is easy for people to take a detached view and say that this is the farmers' job and that he should get on with it. There are limits to what the farmers can do.  They see all sorts of inequalities in the whole system of industry and labour in this country and, unless the people in the towns and cities are prepared to accept their share of the responsibility, there are grave dangers that the crops grown will not be harvested because we are not making any effort, in time, to organise our manpower and utilise it in the fields.</P>
    <P>We have in the city here, and in the towns, a considerable number of unemployed, and a large number who will be unemployed because of shortages of different kinds.  I do not think that that type of labour ought to be permitted to go across to England and send back money here to buy goods that are not available.  Goods are essential at all times, but the type of goods we <Col N="705" /> require now are those which will fill our stomachs, keep our toes warm, and cover our bones.  These are the sort of things we want if we are to keep any sort of order in our little community. If there are men who want to run away from toil and labour to get paper £'s in other kinds of employment, who want to shirk their responsibilities, or who want to go because there is no organisation at home to put them into productive effort, then there is need for complete reorientation on the part of the Government of the whole problem of production in the State.  In the next 12 months, we should not only try to provide enough food for ourselves, but a surplus.  There is land enough for that, and we could carry out that task if our people were more fruitfully employed than they are.  We have altogether too many passengers in our economic system.  There are too many people anxious to spend their lives passing on goods when they ought to be putting some effort into the production of goods.  A great many of these people will be out of employment during the next 12 months, and they will have to be fed somehow. These people should be made realise that they will have to make some contribution to the effort of production, and that the things most essential to us are the things we have to eat, the fuel we are going to burn, and the clothes we require for wearing.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert on the subject of raw materials for industrial goods but I know a good deal about raw materials for food and fuel.  Not alone is there need for a new and fresh approach on the part of the Government to the whole problem of agricultural production but there is need for a much more courageous approach.  They should try to get greater co-operation and co-ordination between our farmers and there is an urgent necessity for getting these men in the cities and towns into closer relation with the work that is to be done in the fields and in the bogs. There is no use in waiting until next August or September to do this.  If we wait, we shall be short of supplies as we are to-day.  If you could turn these men into the green fields now to <Col N="706" /> encourage those who are trying to do more than their best, I believe that when the time came to reap our harvest we would not be appalled and staggered by the magnitude of the task that would confront us.  We would be encouraged by the knowledge that we would be backed by hundreds and thousands of men and that, no matter what crops were put in, they would not be lost to the farmers and to the nation by reason of shortage of man-power.</P>
    <P>If that is to be attempted, the Ministry must think about it now. What I fear is that they will not attempt to grapple with it with the vigour and courage which it demands. I am not talking Party politics.  What I say is known to every sensible farmer of the Fianna Fáil Party just as it is known to me.  They are grumbling as much as I am about it. Their problems are my problems.  If there is not to be a shortage, the Ministry had better become wide awake now and, as Deputy Hughes urged in the Dáil, try to get all the machinery available in rural Ireland into those fields where machines can work.  They should try to get co-operation and co-ordination amongst the farmers themselves and they should try to get the people in the cities and towns, who will be hungry if the fields do not produce the requisite food, to realise that there is a big problem ahead of the people now in the fields and that they ought to go to their aid.  These are the considerations which, to my mind, demand attention at the present time. I do not want to pass judgment on Government policy in the past or in the future.  I think it is better to deal with our present problems constructively than to hark back to the past.  It is right that the consequences of the mistakes of the past should be pointed out because they are not making things easier for us at present but we should not dwell upon them too long lest we be discouraged by them.  I believe we can succeed in mastering our problems but we are not going to succeed by sitting back in armchairs and trying to make calculations as to the amount of food which can be produced, while leaving the <Col N="707" /> farmers without the help requisite to put in the crops or to take them out.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Baxter that this is not a time for going back on the past, but it is sometimes essential to go back so that one may arrange for the future. This annual debate is always used for the purpose of attacking the Government&mdash;it does not matter what Government is in power at the time.  The Opposition takes advantage of the debate to point out the omissions and mistakes of the Government, to explain how such a thing should have been done, or why something should be done that was not done.  They say that if they had been in power they would have acted in a different way.  It is interesting to hear these arguments in view of the attitude of many members of the farming community when the tillage policy was introduced some years ago.  Those of us who have fairly retentive memories recollect the determined fight the Government had to make to enforce its tillage policy.  It had to carry on a campaign of persuasion and, finally, had to resort to compulsion in order to see that the amount of land necessary to feed the people was tilled.</P>
      <P>Every day we see in the papers where heavy fines are imposed on men with land suitable for production of food who had refused to grow that food.  I do not say that the majority of Irish farmers are of this type.  The majority of farmers have risen to the occasion and will, I hope, produce enough food to keep us from the fate that Senator Baxter fears&mdash;starvation.  These charges against the Government, of neglect and want of foresight are somewhat overdone because if the Government's advice had been taken three or four years ago, we should now be in a much better position to produce all the food we require than we are.  The absurd argument was used in the Dáil that it was actually the wheat policy of the Government which prevented enough wheat being grown last year to supply our wants.  The Deputy responsible for that argument pointed out that the land had become impoverished&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The speaker will find very few people to agree with that.  If it was not for the insistence of this terrible Government on wheat-growing, we should be in a far worse position than we are to-day.  I do not desire to dwell on these things but the critics of the Government to-day are the people who determinedly opposed any attempt to increase tillage.  They fought the wheat and beet policy determinedly and many of them said: &ldquo;We will not grow wheat or beet.&rdquo;  Criticism from them comes very ill to-day. I am not classing Senator Baxter amongst those to whom I refer.  He has been very helpful and has endeavoured at all times to give good advice.  That, however, does not hold for many of the critics of the Government in the Dáil and in the country.</P>
      <P>The Army has been criticised.  I wonder if there is any neutral country in Europe which is not spending enormous sums on its army.  Other neutral countries are spending more in proportion to their revenue than this country is spending.  I speak subject to correction, but I think that that holds for other neutral countries.  It is impossible to avoid this expenditure in this period of the world's history.  We are in the midst of the greatest war the world has ever seen, and, but for the mercy of God and the wisdom of those guiding us, we would probably have been involved in that war by now.  We all hate expenditure upon war and war materials.  Expenditure on them is wasteful and extravagant, and it is a terrible thing to have strong, able young men in this country, as in other countries, waiting to be attacked or to attack.  But what could be done? It is the foolishness of mankind that brings these terrible conditions about. We cannot escape their effects.  Expenditure upon the Army, much as we detest that expenditure, is unavoidable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing, may I remark that these debates should be more constructive than they are?  A debate of this sort is generally a mass of adverse criticism and very little advice is given as to <Col N="709" /> how things could be improved.  We are told that the Government did not do this and did not do that.  Why did not the critics formulate a policy, put it before us and explain how these difficulties could have been avoided?  We are asked why the Government did not import hundreds of thousands of tons of coal, tea, wheat and sugar.  What would have been said two or three years ago if the Government came to the Dáil, or this House, asking for millions of money to buy wheat, sugar or coal?  One can imagine the outcry that would have taken place.  The present critics would have said: &ldquo;Why put this terrible tax on the people; why not grow this wheat and produce this sugar ourselves?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You can imagine the letters to the Press and the criticism there would be all over the country of this wasteful, extravagant Government which wanted to spend our money on imported foreign foodstuffs to store them up uselessly.  It is very easy to be wise after the event.  We are now living in times of great scarcity and we can all point to the necessity there was to provide for this scarcity a few years ago, but I think Senators can easily understand the criticism the Minister would have had to face in this House if he had put forward such a policy at that time.  It is very easy to criticise now when the whole unthinking mass of the people are criticising.  A vast number of people in this country, as in every other country, who never bother except to live from day to day are now criticising everybody because such things were not done.</P>
    <P>Many problems will arise for solution in this country after this war is over. At the moment, for instance, an enormous quantity of timber is being cut and when the war is over, we shall have to face a vast expenditure on re-afforestation. I wonder if the Government were now to make an attempt to initiate a re-afforestation scheme, how much support it would get in the country?  Senator Baxter tells us that we ought to take the people from the towns, the unemployed at the moment and even those who are engaged in distributing trades, and put them working <Col N="710" /> on the land.  It takes many years to train an agricultural labourer.</P>

      <P>I agree they could. There is one criticism that I myself shall make.  We are spending quite a lot of money on education in this country, but amongst the young people of to-day, those who have gone through our schools during the past 20 years, and who are now the young men and young women of the country, I think we must all agree there is a great absence of any national spirit.  I am not going to say what the cause of that is, but my own opinion is that, to a great extent, it is due to lack of teaching of, shall I say, patriotism in the schools.  I agree with those who say that one of the root causes of the trouble in the world to-day is the growth of excessive nationalism.  I do not agree with narrow nationalism either.  I think that the first duty of any citizen is to the country in which he or she lives.  It is said that one of the causes of the downfall of the French nation was that the young <Col N="711" /> people in France had lost all sense of nationality, that they had ceased to be good French patriots.</P>

We are all citizens of the world but, first and foremost, we are citizens of the country in which we were born and live and our first duty, we should be taught, is to that country.  If that were taught to us, there would not be so much necessity for the criticism we hear to-day.  If the young people of Ireland were taught to consider, firstly, the interests of their country, and of their neighbours in their country before their own selfish individual interests, I think we could avoid a lot of the trouble which we are experiencing at the moment.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to appear to have been wandering from the subject of the debate but these gentlemen keep me going.  I was dealing with the expenditure on education and I think that this country should get more of that sort of teaching in return for this expenditure.  I have always been an enthusiast for the Irish language but I am afraid that, in concentrating so much on the Irish language, we have failed to teach these young people the reason for the Irish language.  If these young people who are being taught Irish now, are not taught the necessity for Irish and are not taught the reason for learning the native tongue, then I say that teaching will fail and the Irish language will die, because the first essential for success in the teaching of any subject of that kind is that the students should understand the reason for it, why they must learn Irish and why they must spend all these hours endeavouring to acquire a knowledge and a mastery of a second language. There is only one reason for that and if that reason is not taught to the young people in the schools, all the expenditure on the teaching of Irish will be fruitless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it necessary to say anything further on this matter but I should like every speaker who follows me to point out, not merely the failures of the Government to meet the situation, but to indicate what <Col N="713" /> better could be done to cope with the terribly serious situation with which we are faced because it will take the united wisdom of all our people to avoid the results of the mess in which the world is at the moment.</P>

      <P>We were talking of the wages of agricultural labourers. Senator Baxter thought that farmers could not afford to improve on a wage of 30/- for their labour.  I do not want to pose as a prophet in this matter, but, on the outbreak of the war, I forecast in this House the steps that would require to be taken to meet the situation arising out of the world war.  I said that it could only be met by a National Government, and I feared at that time that no Party Government could take the drastic steps that would be necessary, and I think I was right in that. The Government have failed to take the very necessary drastic steps to deal with the situation, with the result that we see around us in this country to-day a horrible situation.  We see the cost of the Army up by £7,000,000.  That expenditure is necessary in order to anticipate invasion by some foreign Power, but if you increased your Army Estimate by several millions, it would not prevent the operations of the enemy which is inside the country already&mdash;a horrible enemy, a ghastly enemy, an enemy which can destroy any country.  It is abroad in the land, and all your armies, with all their modern equipment, cannot prevent it. Nothing but reason and a proper appreciation of the needs of the people can deal with such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hunger stalks this land to-day, and no great imagination is needed to realise that in a very short time this <Col N="714" /> hungry army will be substantially increased, notwithstanding the fact that great numbers of the best and healthiest of our young people are emigrating.  Hunger is abroad in the land and we have ample evidence of the fact in the bread queues around the City of Dublin where the common people have to queue up to get their ordinary supplies of bread.  The complaint is that there is not equality of sacrifice or suffering.  I am informed that people whose bread is brought to their door by vans are not feeling the shortage to any great extent, but when one pictures a wife, a daughter or son of a working man standing in a bread queue for hours, waiting to get a certain limited supply of bread, and when one sees the windows of these shops piled up with fancy bread, one wonders if we are back in the time of Marie Antoinette.  All that is necessary is money to buy these things, and the Government has taken steps to ensure that the working classes will not have the money to buy them.</P>
    <P>To ensure that they shall not have the money to buy these necessary things, they have instituted the infamous Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order.  Nothing the Government have done that I know of has done more harm to the country as a whole than that Order.  Somebody called it a standstill Order on wages, but there is no standstill Order on prices.  Every time prices go up, the working people's supply of food becomes less. I know that the Government have realised the error they made in initiating that Order and already I think eight changes have been made in it. I wonder if, even now, they would be wise in their generation and abandon or cancel that Order, and let the working classes have an equal chance with other classes in the community of getting their share of what is available, or will the Government go another step and control all the supplies in the country and ensure a fair and equitable distribution of the necessaries of life?  That, in my opinion, would be a proper step for the Government to take.  Senator Goulding asked for constructive suggestions.  There is a constructive suggestion&mdash;take control of <Col N="715" /> all the necessaries of life and ensure a fair and equal distribution to all the people of the State.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter deplored the possible shortage of agricultural labour for the harvest.  There will surely be a shortage of agricultural labour for the harvest, because, if the people can get away at all, they are not going to stay here and starve, notwithstanding Deputy Goulding's appeal to patriotism.  They are not going to stay here and starve, while other sections live in luxury.  If there is to be sacrifice, there ought to be equality of sacrifice.  I have no complaint whatever regarding the amount of money budgeted for, but I should like to know from the Minister where or how he is going to get it.  Petrol taxation was a very great source of revenue, and we see that drastic steps are to be taken to stop private motoring.  We can see losses at both ends in that respect&mdash; loss of revenue and creation of unemployment&mdash;unless steps are taken to organise transport on a sound basis.  I am glad to see in that connection that some slight effort has been made to get control of transport.  I hope it is not going to stop with the appointment of one man, but that the Government will listen to reason now, and will call in some council of advisers such as has been advocated by the Labour Party.  Surely, their conceit in their own ability should stop now, when we are facing this great crisis, and some of the best and most capable people in the country, who are willing to come in and co-operate with the Government, and to advise them on certain plans and schemes, should be called in.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that this emergency cannot be outlived with any degree of success on present economic ideas.  We see, on the one hand, the banks deploring the lack of opportunity to exploit their capital, or what is called capital.  We have assets in this country, such as our agricultural stock, that are of great value. We ought to ensure, when we sell cattle for export, that we get in return coal or something that we require for immediate use and that is absolutely <Col N="716" /> necessary for us.  If we were to proceed on these lines, I think it could be said that they were contructive.  A system of that kind would mark a big departure from the one that has been in existence, the one which has created so much misery in this and in almost every other country.  In my opinion a bold and drastic step will be necessary to save our people from the effects of the great crisis which is almost immediately upon them.  Things are getting worse every other day.  We should try to make better provision for the difficulties ahead than we have done in the past.  We have had almost three years to prepare for the situation which we now realise is almost upon us.  In my opinion we have not, to any great extent, taken steps to minimise the sufferings which our people will be faced with.  Even now, I would appeal to the Government to change their policy, and to drop their great conceit in their own ability to manage things.  The situation is getting beyond them.  It is getting too big for any Party Government.  We have a great number of people in the country who are not only capable but willing to contribute something to get over the situation I speak of, or at least to help to minimise the sufferings which our people may be called upon to endure.</P>
    <P>I cannot recall any case in which more stupidity has been shown than that of the Department of Local Government and Public Health in its attitude towards communal kitchens in the City of Dublin where the machinery for them has been provided by the Corporation, which governs this city, and is willing to put its scheme into preparation.  The scheme would provide hot meals for the people in the slums who had no fuel during the winter to enable them to do any cooking on their own.  The meals could be provided for them at very little cost. It is all very well to talk about pauperising the people, but what is pauperism compared to starvation and hunger which, to my own knowledge, have been rampant in this city?  In Gardiner Street and other densely populated areas the majority of the people are unemployed.  Quite a number of them have fairly large <Col N="717" /> families.  They have no fuel to cook a meal for perhaps the one member who may be working, or even to heat milk or some other food for a child.  If some of those people go into a building and take a few pieces of timber to make a fire to cook a meal and are brought before the courts and convicted, they are sent to jail and penalised very severely.  The machinery for the communal kitchens is there, and why is it not put into operation? The Minister responsible appears to have some notions in his head on the matter.  I wonder if he were living in one of these slum areas and saw children going around cold and hungry, and at the same time saw one of these kitchens in operation under the auspices of the Dublin Corporation where food could be provided for those hungry children, how he would feel about it, and what he would do if he were hungry.  Would he allow his pride to overcome his hunger?  I hope sincerely that something will be done to enable those people to avail of the services of these communal kitchens which are ready to provide for those in the greatest need.  Citizens of goodwill have put up a lot of money so that meals may be provided for people who are in a position to pay for them and who, at very little trouble, might be able to cook hot meals in their own homes.  That class is being provided for, but the unfortunate people who are in dire need must be saved from the stigma of pauperism !</P>
    <P>I have no complaint to make about the sum of money that the Minister for Finance is asking.  I do not envy him his job.  As far as I can see, the main sources of revenue are drying up while the call and the need for more expenditure are becoming more persistent. As I have said, it will need the taking of very drastic steps to get us out of the predicament we are in. The unemployment figure, at the moment, is very high and is growing daily.  It would be very much higher were it not for the increased strength of the Army plus the number of people who are leaving the country.  That is not a very healthy sign.  While I have not felt it necessary to go through the <Col N="718" /> various items in the Vote on Account, I hope that, in the remarks I have made, I have contributed something worth while to the discussion on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <P>Senator Goulding, as he very frequently does, contributed a very interesting speech.  May I say that, while I agree with a good deal of what he said, I do not believe it is possible, by any form of teaching in the schools, to inculcate a spirit of unselfishness and a feeling of genuine patriotism in children if it does not already exist in their homes and is not to be found in their parents and in the adults who are in a position to influence their lives?  A very fine spirit of unselfishness was to be found all over this country before we got our own form of Government, but since then, I am afraid, we have grown soft and selfish and have worked for Party rather than for the State, the net result being that there is a great deal of truth in what Senator Goulding has said.  I say that <i>en passant</i> arising out of the remarks the Senator made which, I think, were both interesting and valuable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the main matters I want to deal with, let me say at once that I find myself almost 100 per cent. in agreement with what Senator Foran has said.  In fact, the lines on which he commenced his speech were the lines on which I had intended to open mine.  Senator Goulding says there is no use in dealing with the past except in so far as it may help one with regard to the future.  I have no sympathy with those who indulge in past recriminations simply for the purpose of making points against some person.  At the same time, I do not think you can get away from the past, and particularly the recent past. I, personally, believe that we in this country are faced with a far more serious crisis than we imagine.  I do not believe the crisis is as much a military one as it is an economic one.  Two years ago, and again, with much more emphasis, a year ago, I tried to draw the attention of this House to the fact that the only <i>bona fide</i> efforts on the question of national unity were to be <Col N="719" /> found in relation to military defence. While that was the position, I emphasised that the future of this country depended just as much, if not more so, on the existence of proper economic measures as it did on military measures, and pointed out that I failed to see that any proper steps were being taken to meet that situation. I believe&mdash;as I said two years ago and again a year ago&mdash;that it is not possible, adequately, to face the kind of situation which we have had in this country in the last two years, and that we are going to have in a much more acute form in the near future, with government controlled by a Party.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Foran.  I stated then and I still believe that the kind of requisitions or demands which it would be necessary to make could not be made simply in the name of any Government which was only a Party Government with the same measure of success as they could be made by a Government representing the nation as a whole.  Senator Goulding has explained that the Government advised certain things.  He has said it is not fair to criticise certain things that were done.  My answer to that is that that kind of criticism is inevitable when you are working with a Party Government. If the advice had been national advice and given in a united manner I believe it was possible&mdash;and that it is still possible&mdash;to get a very large measure of united effort.  It will always be less possible to do that as time goes on and as we continue to leave our business under Party control. One cannot get away from the fact that a Government acting for a Party will be more reluctant to take unpleasant measures promptly and immediately.  A Government representative of the various Parties will not be subject to the same criticism and will not have to justify itself in the same manner.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that a very good instance of that is found in the general question of supplies and rationing.  The Government have failed to organise the business ability of the country to deal with the situation which we have to face.  There are excellent people in <Col N="720" /> the Civil Service, and able men in the Government and in the Fianna Fáil Party, but they have not got them all and have not enough to deal with the situation.  I do not pretend to know much about agriculture, except in a casual way, but in the case of trade the Government have failed to get the assistance and advice of any other than those individuals acting for separate trades.  There has been no attempt at unified action by a council.  There has been a lot of energy and hard work, but that has been done from the State rather than organising the nation as a whole on a war basis.  There is no use in &ldquo;codding&rdquo; ourselves that we have not to be organised on a war basis as far as economics is concerned.  The sooner everyone gets on a war basis the better.</P>
    <P>It is more than heart-breaking to see the bread queues in Dublin and to come in contact with some of the poorer people.  It is easy to say that bread rationing is difficult.  I know it is, but it would be better than what we have got.  I live in a district where the houses are fairly good.  Why should not the allowance of bread in such areas be half or quarter the usual amount, by the very fact of the address?  It would be perfectly reasonable. The arrangement may cause hardship to some people, but nothing like the hardship that exists at present.  A way could be found if there were a will.  Some of the difficulty is due to the extreme reluctance to provide a national register in time.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be a scaremonger, but I believe that clothing should have been rationed long ago. It could not be done because there was no register.  Rationing by the shopkeepers may prove workable in the case of a few things, but it never works easily or fairly.  The rationing of sugar seems to mean that some get a pound, others get a half pound, others three-quarters of a pound.  With the best possible will in the world, no shopkeeper can work a scheme like that fairly.  The Government found themselves in the position that they should <Col N="721" /> have taken decisions which they dare not take because of the criticism with which they would be faced.</P>
      <P>Senator Goulding referred to coal.  I do not believe in saying now what this country should have done in 1940, when there was a large quantity of coal available.  I am chairman of a company, and at that time we put all the resources we had available into obtaining coal, and so it is only now that we are getting short.  So, if I say we should have done it, it is only saying what I practised at the time.  I admit that, if things had gone differently, the Government would have been criticised, but that would not have been a national disaster.  A Party Government does not take the kind of action which lends itself open to great criticism if it is unsuccessful.  The same thing could be said of other matters. Speaking generally, I believe this is all due to the fact that we have been working on Party lines.  Rationing has come too late.  It has been the motto &ldquo;better late than never&rdquo;.  While that is good when you are late, it is extremely bad when you have not the foresight which was essential.</P>
      <P>In this House again and again I have urged the Government in the last two years to provide some type of war risk insurance.  I warned them that failure to provide that would mean less purchasing, and less possibility of purchasing, supplies when available.  When you leave it entirely to the individual, he goes a long way in taking risks; but if he is left in the position that he may get in stocks and borrow almost to the very limit from the bank to do that, and then find that he has no security in the event of war&mdash;which the Government has been telling us for the last two years may come at any time&mdash;it is only the law of human nature that he should restrict that buying somewhat and feel that he cannot go beyond a certain burden.  That is one instance of the effect of being too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still urge the Minister to consider some system of war risk insurance.  It should be adopted even now.  It could be a contributory one, with a not too high annual contribution on the person who has stock or property insured. <Col N="722" /> Possibly these people would have to go on paying for ten or 15 years until the total amount required had been paid.  I know it would be virtually in the nature of a tax.  I am proposing one in this case, though that may seem extraordinary to the Minister, as I believe that it would be one of extreme value in the form of insurance.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that I am now going on the old line of talk.  From my point of view, I have deliberately and definitely come to the conclusion that, as far as business and industry are concerned, the Minister cannot tax them any more without reducing the actual yield which he would get.  I would like to urge upon him not to delay his Budget this year longer than he can help.  Appeals have been made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;very properly&mdash;to firms to keep their staffs as long as they can.  The position will be very acute if increased taxation is to be taken out of the money available.  It simply means that staffs cannot be kept on.  If it is going to be reduced or left where it is it will be possible to do it to a certain extent.  There is an assumption that it will be increased and that an effort must be made to try to take more taxation out of industry.  If that is done, the result will be more or less inevitable unemployment.</P>
    <P>I pointed out a year ago that I believed that in certain cases the operation of the corporation excess profits tax would prove disastrous to some of our newer industries.  I do not propose to take up the time of the House in giving the details.  I think the Minister has had details given to him.  I am not particularly interested in one of the never industries but I have had details given to me of some which make it perfectly clear that if that taxation applied for two years consecutively the prospect of losses in industry in the next two or three years, if they can carry on at all, means that at the end of the emergency the industry will have disappeared or, if it should survive, will be so crippled financially that its prospects of success will be very small and its capacity for employment will be drastically reduced.</P>
    <P>There is another matter about which <Col N="723" /> I feel a considerable amount of concern. I believe that whereas we cannot expect to maintain the standard on which we were living, we have the capacity and the resources and the possibility of exchange which ought to enable us to get through this crisis but I am extremely uneasy&mdash;and I believe I am speaking for a number of other people&mdash;at the rumours, if they be only rumours, that our relationship with the two countries that are our neighbours is not as good as it was.  The Taoiseach told us that he was very much concerned at certain statements that were being made in other countries which were detrimental to our interests and unfair to us.  I have seen a few of them, very few.  The Taoiseach thinks &mdash;I completely disagree with him&mdash; that it would be unhealthy for us to know what these unpleasant statements are.  I believe it would be healthy for us to know them and that we ought to know them.  At any rate, it is his responsibility, not mine.  The fact is that we do not know these statements and there is that uneasiness.</P>
    <P>It is generally assumed that the United States, our neighbour on one side, though a long way away, and Great Britain on the other side only want from us that we should go into the war.  I do not think we have any right to assume that that is so.  I cannot help feeling that part of our difficulties is due to the fact that since this war commenced we have made&mdash;I will not say no attempts because I am not in the secrets, but we have not succeeded in making&mdash;any kind of exchange trade treaty.  Most other nonbelligerent or neutral countries have made trade treaties with their neighbours on either side of the war.  They have done so because of necessity.  That did not necessarily involve approval of the particular policy adopted by those countries in matters outside the trade agreement.  We know recently of a trade agreement with Portugal.  We know Sweden made one.  Switzerland made one.</P>

Instead <Col N="724" /> of allowing the idea that our relationships with the United States and with Great Britain are to get worse; that there is a feeling against us; that they do not understand us and are not being fair to us, to go on much longer we ought to adopt the attitude that, for good or evil, the Government, backed by a majority of the country, no matter what certain individuals may think, have decided on a policy of non-belligerency; that within that we want to live on the best possible terms with our neighbours; that we have goods which we could give.  In that way we could organise our industry very much better.  If people rather than starve are going to another country, that could be part of a scheme for which we might get something in return.  I am not suggesting that we should offer to exchange commodities for labour, but we should try to make general trade agreements.  I would like to feel that this State was adopting an attitude towards our two neighbours; that we would tell them quite frankly: &ldquo;Neutrality is our policy; that is what our people want; we cannot budge from that.&rdquo; While keeping strictly to that, is it not possible for us to make a trade treaty of mutual helpfulness?  For my part&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;I would have great hopes that that would lead to a better relationship both from our point of view and from the point of view that we might be able to help others while at the same time benefiting ourselves.</P>
      <P>May I repeat that I think the time has come when we have got completely to forget old allegiances, old ideas and Party allegiances and that if you are going to ask the people to do that, you would have to start at the top?  The idea that old divisions are to go underneath, but the top must remain one Party Government is bad.  I think it is responsible for some of our troubles. I am not at the moment attending Party meetings of any particular Party.  It is said the Opposition would not agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add, if possible, to the collective wisdom of the House, as expressed in the speeches that have preceded mine, and to do so in a spirit, I hope, of constructive criticism and with not more than the necessary minimum of recrimination&mdash;in fact, with no recrimination at all, because I think the present situation is one which calls for constructive action and suggestion on the part of everybody in the House and criticism should be, as far as possible, devoid of recrimination. This Bill seems to give scope for any amount of discussion on general financial and economic policy, and it seems to be almost impossible to go out of order in discussing any of these questions.  But I do feel, with Senator Foran and other speakers, that, in a time of real emergency like this, we should put what I might call the financial <Col N="727" /> point of view in the very subordinate position where it really belongs, try to approach our problems from the point of view of economic and human realities and treat financial methods simply as a handmaid for the realisation of the most desirable economic and social policies.  In my opinion, countries can be ruined by a combination of sound financial policies and unsound economic policies.  In fact, if I had to choose, I should prefer that sound Ministers should apply unsound financial methods in a time of national emergency rather than that unsound Ministers should use, perhaps with inadequate judgment, sound financial methods in a time of national emergency. The worst situation of any would be one in which unsound Ministers would apply unsound financial methods.  I am not specifying whether the Minister falls into any one of these three categories or whether there is a fourth category in which he himself would like to regard himself.  I am saying this by way of emphasising that I regard financial policies and methods essentially as a means and as something which, in a time of revolutionary emergency such as the present, should be treated not with a kind of breathtaking respect and reverence, but entirely as something which is amenable to human policy and human control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is open to any criticism at all in the department of pure finance in the past couple of years, it seems to me that he is open to the criticism that he has relied too much on taxation and on borrowing from the capital market and not enough on the inflationary financial method of borrowing from the banking system.  Inflationary finance is, of course, a deadly poison but so are opium, cocaine and strychnine, and all these deadly poisons, in the right hands and administered in doses appropriate to the occasion, may tide an individual over a difficult emergency. In the same way, in a time of national emergency, some small dose of inflationary finance is a desirable method of swinging the national economy into the new orientation <Col N="728" /> needed by completely unforeseen circumstances. Inflationary finance is, of course, if carried to excess, disastrous but if Government resorts to borrowing from the banking system in circumstances in which the banking system finds a diminished outlet in other directions for banking funds, I doubt whether that kind of borrowing from the banking system is inflationary at all.  Even if Government borrows from the banking system in circumstances in which the banking system still finds a normal outlet for banking finance, if the effect of that is to increase, or prevent from diminishing, the money income of the community and if that increase in the money income of the community is, at the same time, accompanied by a tendency for unemployed factors of production to be brought into production, for economic processes to be brought back into employment, such inflationary methods of finance, up to that point, so far from being dangerous, are positively advantageous.  Until the moment has arrived when inflationary finance tends to increase the real income of the community, that method can be used without serious danger.</P>
    <P>I do not think that our economy has yet reached the stage at which all available factors of production are absorbed into productive employment, and I think that some measure of inflation would have been a helpful means of bringing that about.  Of course, I am aware that inflationary finance tends to cause an increase in prices, tends to create dangerous bottlenecks in production, but these are dangers which wise Government policy would take proper measures to safeguard.  They would prevent the persons concerned in the bottlenecks of production from exploiting that situation to hold their fellow-countrymen up to ransom, would rigidly control all prices, especially the prices of the elementary necessaries of life, and ration all supplies so that there would be little possibility of prices getting out of hand.  In that case, then, with a little does of graduated inflation, you would have a situation in which taxpayers would have, in the <Col N="729" /> aggregate, larger incomes than they were able to find an outlet for in the purchase of real goods.  Consequently, they would afford a suitable market for the Minister's tax-gathering and loan-gathering activities at a later stage.  Until our economy has reached the stage where all available factors of production are fully occupied and the stage where real income has risen to whatever is the maximum possible limit under emergency conditions, I think it is not good public policy to be too active and too progressive in raising the level of taxation.</P>
    <P>In a situation such as we have had for the past two years, it is necessary for many individuals, both as private individuals and as business men, to incur capital expense in adjusting their lives to new conditions&mdash;by procuring A.R.P. equipment, by buying bicycles where, perhaps, they owned an old motor car, by obtaining producer-gas plant for their motors where they formerly used petrol.  All these things involve a drain on the capital and credit of the private individual. Consequently, it is not sound policy to diminish that capital and credit of the private individual too much by excessive Government action in this transitional stage of the national emergency. In fact, excessive taxation at that stage, so far from supporting or maintaining the credit of the State, to my mind, might undermine that credit if it had the effect of preventing the economy from adjusting itself to the new conditions and preventing that increase of the national wealth, under those new conditions, which would otherwise be possible if private credit was left unimpaired.</P>
    <P>It seems to be agreed&mdash;at all events the statement is made by a Cambridge professor&mdash;that at present, and for the last two years, Great Britain has been acquiring, by the method of issuing new money&mdash;in other words, by downright inflation&mdash;as much as one-twentieth of the real income of the nation for Government purposes, and that the effect of that moderate degree of inflation was to raise the money income of the community only by some 20 per cent., after two years of war. Now, one-twentieth of the real income <Col N="730" /> of the United Kingdom at present is a sum of the order of magnitude of £400,000,000 or £500,000,000, and one-twentieth of our real income, if we take our national income to be £160,000,000, would work out at £8,000,000.  I would not go so far, however, as to suggest that we should acquire as much as £8,000,000 of the money necessary for Government purposes by a downright inflationary method, but I would go so far, however, as to suggest that we might perhaps acquire something of the order of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000, or even £4,000,000, for a year or two, of that necessary finance, by downright inflationary borrowing from the banking system until we have reached that stage where all available factors of production are fully occupied and pulling their weight.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, multiply 20 by £400,000,000.  But of course, in that connection, we must bear in mind that the national income in Great Britain, even if three-fifths is takes for Government purposes in time of war, still leaves a national income available for civilian consumption, per head of the population, which is not so very different from ours, because in their country it was more than £100 per person before the war, and in our country it was £50 per person.  There are also certain reservations and qualifications that ought to be applied before one takes too literally even my suggestion that we might risk acquiring £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 of the necessary Government finance by direct borrowing from the banking system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to make some remarks about the attitude which a State <Col N="731" /> should have towards the agricultural adjustment necessary in the present emergency, and in that connection I should like to correct a certain figure which I mentioned on the last occasion that I spoke in this House, when I said that after making allowance at the rate of 5 per cent., for the interest on the capital values associated with Irish agriculture, the amount available per head as labour income among the 600,000 persons employed in agricultural production only amounted to £50 per head.  Now, I should have borne in mind, in making that statement, that some £120,000,000 of the capital values concerned was the amount I estimated as the value of the dwelling accommodation which occurs on farms, and consequently I should only have taken the interest on the difference between £120,000,000 and, say, £480,000,000, which would have yielded at 5 per cent., not £24,000,000 but £18,000,000, and subtracting £18,000,000 from £54,000,000 would have left £36,000,000, to divide among 600,000 people as labour income, instead of only £30,000,000.  In other words, the labour income should have been £60 per head, and not £50.  However, let that serve as a warning to me and to other Senators not to do arithmetic in one's head here, especially when one has a cold in one's head, as I had on that last occasion.</P>
    <P>Now, in the last two years it has been necessary for our farmers greatly to expand the area under tillage, and, in doing so, I estimate that in the season 1940-41, for example, as compared with the season two years before that, £6,000,000 more had to be invested in the processes of cultivating the land.  In other words, to finance the additional tillage necessary, somebody somewhere had to find £6,000,000 more.  I should like to know who put up the money.  Did the farmers themselves put it up?  Were the farmers concerned well enough off to finance that extra production out of their own capital resources, or did some considerable share of it come from borrowing from the banks, or, in some mysterious way, did the State make that money available, or any considerable share of <Col N="732" /> it?  My own impression is that not much of that £6,000,000 came by way of productive loans from the banking system, although there I speak subject to correction and, if I am wrong, I am sure Senator Sir John Keane will enlighten me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Another factor would probably be that the people were working harder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is a question of additional finance in one form or another, but what I am really coming to is this: In many cases, the persons owning land, which had to be tilled under the Compulsory Tillage Order, let that land for tillage, on the so-called conacre system, to various speculators and contractors, who have been tilling that land, generally, for corn crops, and taking all they can get out of it.  Now, the reasons why farmers let their land for tillage or other purposes are various, and I do not know to what extent that land has been let in that way, because the farmers owning it did not have the necessary capital and credit to cultivate it themselves, but I do know that that was the case in some significant proportion of the persons concerned, and I do know that year after year land is being let in conacre for tillage purposes.  What is the most sinister aspect of the whole thing is that the same land is actually being let for cultivation of the same corn crops year after year.  You see in the local papers advertisements for the letting of so many acres of second-sod stubble for corn crops, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I suggest that the same land is being let for cultivation of the same crops year after year.  But that reminds me of the story of a tramp who called at a big house at Christmas and asked for a gift of clothing or bread.  The lady of the house said to him: &ldquo;Are you not the same man that I gave some Christmas pudding to last Christmas?&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;It is true, ma'am, that you gave me some Christmas pudding, but I will never be the same man again after eating it.&rdquo;  It is equally true that a lot of this land, now growing corn crops on <Col N="733" /> the conacre system, will never be the same again, and, in fact, is being devastated, by the present method of cultivation by persons other than the owners of that land, more completely than if that land were being trampled upon and destroyed by a hostile army. It is really a problem that affects the fertility of the soil in the case of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of acres of land now being put under cultivation under the worst possible conditions, not by the owners of the land, but by people whose sole interest in the land is to get all they can out of its permanent fertility and cash in on that permanent fertility, leaving the land derelict when finished with it.  That, to my mind, is one of the indirect and perhaps unforeseen consequences of the way in which the 25 per cent.  Compulsory Tillage Order has actually worked out in practice.</P>
    <P>That Order had no compulsory effect whatever on those parts of the country where tillage was most appropriate to their local conditions and where the habit of tillage was most widespread. In other words, in Wexford and Louth, and perhaps Carlow, where anyhow they always cultivated 25 per cent. of their arable land, the Compulsory Tillage Order had no compulsory effect whatever by increasing the area under the plough.  If they did increase the area under the plough in those counties, as doubtless some have, it was due to sheer public spirit or the prospect of making additional profit and was not due to anything in the Compulsory Tillage Order.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the flat rate compulsion to till 25 per cent. enabled persons owning grass land, who wanted to comply with the letter of the law, to comply with it by saying: &ldquo;There is 25 per cent. of my farm.  I let it in conacre and I made up my mind to sacrifice it for all future time, and when it is finished I do not care a hang, the Land Commission can have it.&rdquo;  By doing that they are complying with the letter of the compulsory law, but they are not complying with the spirit of the law and they are not complying with the principles of sound cultivation.  In so far as the owners of grass land were driven to adopt <Col N="734" /> that policy of letting the land in conacre because they had not the capital or the credit available for its proper cultivation and putting it through a proper rotation, then I think to that extent the Government policy has failed to provide for one of the most pressing necessities of the agricultural situation.</P>
    <P>I think the English system by which people were paid £2 an acre by the State for ploughing up old pasture is a much better one and one which we might have adopted here with considerable advantage.  I think we might even have improved on that system, and instead of saying to the farmers: &ldquo;We will pay you £2 an acre for every acre of old pasture land that you plough up,&rdquo; the Government should have said: &ldquo;We will give you vouchers for artificial manures to the value of £2 an acre for every acre of land you plough up, but those vouchers will not be transferable into artificial manures until after the emergency when manures are available at a reasonable price again.&rdquo;  In that case, a farmer who had care for the future fertility of his land would know that, if he took a risk and cultivated it without manure for a year or two, he would be able to look forward to getting from the Government artificial manures which he presumably would apply to the land that he had temporarily allowed to run down.  This problem of maintaining and preserving the fertility of land that has to be cultivated without any proper rotation is one of the most serious problems we are confronted with, and I think the Government should not spare what looks like expenditure in trying to face this problem and should consider every reasonable means of bringing that land back again to fertility and permanent productiveness as soon as the emergency is over.  In the meanwhile I am afraid we will have to resign ourselves to the probability of a declining yield per acre in wheat cultivation and that is why we have to cultivate so many acres of wheat.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a policy for the permanent improvement of our agricultural economy as a whole seriously considered, and not only in Government <Col N="735" /> circles.  In my view, perhaps the best test of the efficiency of agriculture is the number of people that each person occupied in our agriculture somehow manages to feed.  There are some 500,000 or 600,000 persons occupied in agriculture and, according to the most recent figure, we export some 37 per cent. of our agricultural output, which means that 63 per cent. of our agricultural output is consumed at home.  If we assume that we are now at the stage in which we do provide at all events nearly 100 per cent. of the food requirements of our own people by the produce of our own agriculture, then I think it follows from those figures that the activities of our 500,000 agricultural producers manage to feed 3,000,000 people at home here and some 2,000,000 people outside our shores, in other words, about 5,000,000 people altogether.  If 500,000 producers are feeding 5,000,000, that looks like each agricultural producer feeding ten persons. In British agriculture about 1,000,000 persons are occupied, and, before the war, it was calculated that they provided the food requirements of one-third of the population, which is roughly 45,000,000.  So that it looks as if one person in British agriculture, in spite of many deficiencies, was feeding 15 persons, and it should be our aim to develop our agricultural production in such a way that we reach the British standard by which one person feeds 15 persons.  If we did that, I think we would greatly increase the productiveness of our agriculture.</P>
    <P>By increasing the employment of labour on the larger and better-equipped farms, I think we would make a substantial contribution to the output of agricultural wealth in the present time of emergency.  The difficulty there is that agricultural labour is becoming extremely scarce throughout the country and something will have to be done by way of organising and even controlling all the available man power of the nation if we are to ensure the safety of the State and the maintenance of necessary activities of any kind on large farms employing agricultural wage-paid labour.</P>
    <P>In fact, I am not sure whether we will not have to go several steps in the <Col N="736" /> direction of a kind of communist economy and conscript labour as well as wealth if we are to take the steps appropriate to the present very serious emergency in which we find ourselves. I am not in favour of excessive State control of things in the ordinary way, but at a time of emergency such as we are in at present, unless a State will firmly take control and do the things which the realities of the situation require, then that nation is liable to drift about like a rudderless ship in a stormy sea.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the State that takes control should not go out of its way to discourage the efforts of private enterprise, especially private enterprise of the public-spirited kind which we associate with The Guild of Goodwill, Ltd.  In that connection, I should like to ask the Minister why, in the name of fair play, he forbade The Guild of Goodwill, Ltd., arranging to cut turf with local labour on bogs on which The Guild of Goodwill, Ltd., had already incurred the expenditure of preparing and draining.  The reason given, according to my information, was that one of the Minister's Departments proposed to cut turf in somewhat the same area of country and was under the necessity of importing labour from outside and housing it locally, a thing which was entirely proper for the Government to do and which can only be done by an institution such as a Government.  The proposition put up to The Guild of Goodwill, Ltd., was that they might only cut turf if they were prepared to import labour from a distance and that they may not in any way use the local available labour.</P>
    <P>To my mind, equity and common sense suggest that The Guild of Goodwill, Limited, should be allowed and encouraged to go ahead and organise the use of local labour for their turf-cutting enterprise, whereas the Government, who alone have the facilities for importing labour from a distance and housing them on the spot, should confine themselves to labour imported from a distance.  There seems to be ample room for both forms of activity in the cutting of turf, and to allow a body of that type, which is a private enterprise of the best kind <Col N="737" /> in which not a single individual will make a profit on the capital invested, to incur expense in preparing a bog for development and turf-cutting and then to say &ldquo;you cannot cut turf in that bog&rdquo; seems to me to be downright confiscation.</P>
    <P>I think that if we want to get through the food crisis of the next few months, we will have to rely a good deal more on potatoes and diminish the pressure on wheat and flour.  One of the reasons why we are so much a wheat-eating people now is because we have become so much more urbanised in the last 20 years than before.  The urban population notoriously consume far less potatoes per head than the rural population.  I think that the problem really amounts to this, how we are to ensure the maximum human consumption of the available potatoes in the country, which will not last for ever and which will go bad if not used before May or June?  To bring all the potatoes to the cities and have them cooked would involve a difficult problem of fuel and transport.  It would be much better if the Government would arrange for a partial evacuation of our large population centres.  There are about 100,000 more people in Dublin now than there were 20 years ago and I think there are, with reference to the existing food and fuel situation, about 100,000 people too many in Dublin at the present time.  If people who have no real necessity for living in Dublin could be persuaded or compelled to take rooms in the Parknasilla Hotel or some other place appropriate to their means, and if sections of the unemployed who would probably be healthier and better off in a country environment could be evacuated with their families to a country environment, then it would be quite feasible to feed them to a greater extent on potatoes which country people already eat to a large extent, and the demand for bread would be greatly diminished.</P>
    <P>With regard to those who still remain in Dublin and who are likely to continue to remain there, a great deal of pressure would be taken off the acuteness of the fuel problem if the Government would go ahead with arrangements <Col N="738" /> for the communal feeding of school children and others.  The action of the Government in preventing this desirable method of feeding large numbers of the people from being carried out by other agencies is incomprehensible. Communal feeding would not only make possible the consumption of large quantities of potatoes and vegetables by people who have no means of cooking, but it would also diminish the intensity of the fuel problem because it would mean a much less consumption of fuel per cwt. of food cooked.  From that point of view the Government should develop a really active policy of promoting the communal feeding of large sections of Dublin's population.  Communal feeding and evacuation seem to be two practical methods of getting over the difficulties of the next two or three months.</P>

      <P>The larger issues of Government policy, such as defence, economics, agriculture and education, have been so energetically discussed by my predecessors in this debate that my short contribution to it will come, perhaps, as a not unwelcome interlude and it will concern itself with the less spectacular and perhaps more prosaic items of the Estimates.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a few things that have been brought to my notice in connection with some of the Votes.  One concerns milk and there are at least three items that deal with the supply of free milk.  Vote 41, sub-head J (2) refers to grants for the supply of milk to necessitous children and the amount for the year 1942-43 is £90,000, representing an increase of £9,000.  Vote 74 also provides milk for the dependents of the unemployed and for widows and orphans.  I have good reason to believe that there has been considerable overlapping in supplies and certain houses have got more than they can conveniently use.  In the present state of supplies I think that is a thing that should be looked into.  I do not want to deprive these needy people of anything, but it is possible that many who might not be expecting milk are being given too much and that surplus milk might well be diverted <Col N="739" /> elsewhere.  If my information is correct, that is the position in some cases.</P>
      <P>My own experience is that boots are the greatest need of the children of the poor.  Children are often kept from school because they have not boots. The children of needy parents cannot go to school for want of boots.  When boots have to be repaired the children have to stay at home.  Some may say that boots are not a necessity, but I say they are.  Perhaps when the Minister is framing his Budget it might be considered whether it would not be possible to assist people who cannot provide boots for their children to make some provision in that connection under some of the Votes, possibly through a saving of money in the case of overlapping services.</P>
      <P>Another thing to which I would like to draw attention is the decrease of £28,000 in connection with sub-head D of Vote 74.  This sub-head refers to allowances in kind to certain recipients of disablement benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts.  The grant was £50,000 last year, and this year it is only £22,000.  I am particularly concerned with this because I think that many of the recipients of unemployment benefit are women who are really very pitiable objects.  Very often women of 48 or 50 are not able to get a situation.  From that age onwards until they reach 70 years they have very few resources.  Frequently through mal-nutrition, which is the cause of disease, a poor woman comes on the unemployment fund, and I think that when these women are cut off from this benefit they suffer very considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter upon which I would like to have some information arises out of Vote 41, sub-head Q.  This sub-head relates to grants in respect of the training of native Irish speakers in hospital nursing.  I am very glad to find that the Vote of £120 last year has been increased to £560 this year.  I hope it will mean that more girls from the Gaeltacht are to be given an opportunity of training as nurses and that whatever difficulties have been experienced in placing them in hospitals <Col N="740" /> have been overcome.  The Gaeltacht also comes under Vote 56, sub-head A. That provides £300 in respect of the Galway-Aran steamer services.  It will help to maintain the service between Galway and the Aran Islands.  It is really a necessity for the Aran people. Owing to the coal shortage, the steamer service is very much restricted at the present time.  There is, however, one thing that could have been avoided, and that is, the undue raising of freights.  There have been increases of 50 per cent. and nearly 100 per cent. in the cattle and passenger rates, and that bears very hard on the Aran people at a time when they need all the assistance they can get.</P>

      <P>The curious feature of the early stages of this debate, until Senator Douglas spoke, was that only two constructive suggestions appeared to emerge from all the speeches.  One was Senator Fitzgerald's implicit suggestion that there should be a special Department of cacophony instituted with a special Vote of its own, and the other was Senator Goulding's suggestion that, as a means of intensifying the national spirit, we should have professors of patriotism.  Neither of these two suggestions struck me as being of any great utility in present circumstances. I felt all the more admiration for the contribution made by Senator Douglas. My reason for speaking now is largely that I want to associate myself with what Senator Foran and Senator Douglas suggested.  It is a proposition that has been made to the Government on this Bill in this House ever since the war began, the suggestion that in the difficult times through which we are going, there is only one real hope for the survival of the country, and that is the institution of a national Government; the institution of a united Government in which the whole strength of the people, intellectual and moral, will find expression and some common means of action.  It is easy to make speeches criticising Government expenditure. All one has to do is to take the Book of Estimates for this year and compare the Estimates with those of 1930 or 1927, when it will be seen that there <Col N="741" /> is obviously an enormous growth in the national expenditure.  I think even the Government and their supporters are beginning honestly to admit that the growth in national expenditure has, in many ways, gone too far, and that something sooner or later will have to be done about it.</P>
      <P>It is easy to take one Vote after another, and to show that in every single Department the cost has steadily mounted up, and that a large part of the cost is due to the continual growth in the staffing of Government Departments. It is one of these things like the growth of population in cities and towns, to which Senator Johnston referred, which seems to be almost inevitable.  We seem to be committed to an almost endless process under which the Civil Service will keep on growing and growing automatically, until everybody in Ireland is a civil servant, or until the whole scheme collapses, whichever happens first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probably the system generally will collapse long before we find ourselves in that enviable position of being all salaried civil servants.  There is no doubt that sooner or later these processes will have to stop, both the growth in the administrative machinery of the State, and the tendency for the population to congregate more and more in towns and cities. My reason for interventing is that a time of crisis like this is a time to take stock of these tendencies and to consider how they may be dealt with.  It is quite clear that you cannot do a great deal in one year, or even in ten years, but what you can do if you give a little thought to the matter is to cease to be mechanical slaves of a mechanical system.  What you can do is to institute a new system or reform the existing system in such a way that these tendencies will no longer operate as drastically as they do.  There is no doubt at all that one of the greatest causes of our difficulties now is the enormous growth of the City of Dublin. The fact is that the population of Dublin goes up by something like 60,000 people every ten years, and that is not happening by way of a natural increase, but because Dublin is wide open to the whole country.  I say that <Col N="742" /> although I am an immigrant myself. There is hardly anyone in Dublin who is not an immigrant or whose father or grandfather was not an immigrant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>The peculiar feature of the situation is that if you look at the average employment available in Dublin, assistants in shops, bus drivers, bus conductors, Gárdaí, clerks or teachers it will be found that nine-tenths of those employed are country people who came to the city.  It will be found, if you look at the effects of their coming to the city in these enormous numbers, and in that unchecked way, that every year a considerable proportion of people in Dublin are condemned to the slums for the rest of their lives, because a big city inevitably has a large proportion of people who are living below the margin of subsistence.  That is one of the far-reaching problems that troubles us at a time of crisis like this, when the question of feeding our population is a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech Senator Johnston provoked a certain amount of amusement in this neighbourhood by suggesting that we are, perhaps, facing this danger, that very drastic steps will have to be taken to deal with the question of overcrowding in Dublin, and that if we are going to feed the population some people will have to move out of Dublin.  The increase that has gone on so steadily in the staffs of Government Departments seems to be an inevitable process, and has been accompanied only by a steady increase in taxation, to pay for which more and more people are being taken out of productive work, in order to keep them in unproductive work, and more and more money has to be raised from the people who are at work.  The result is that side by side with the growth of civil servants you have, at the same time, the enormous growth in taxation, such a form of taxation as income-tax, until it has reached a point when it has become certainly intolerable to large numbers of people, and will probably begin to cease to be productive, as any <Col N="743" /> further increase will become utterly impossible.  When I talk about income-tax I do not want to complain about income-tax myself, because I think professional people as a whole get off more lightly from income-tax than most other types of citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>Because they are in secure positions for one thing.  It is a kind of taxation that presses most heavily on small struggling business people.  I am not very much in touch with business, but I have come across people who were making a respectable, though not a very large, income in a small way of business until three or four years ago, whose business has since been ruined by the war and who are still being harried and persecuted by the Revenue Commissioners for the payment of income-tax arising out of an income which they are no longer able to command.  It is a situation that is very serious for some of the best and most enterprising elements in the whole community, the type of small businessman who never made a great deal of money but who did a great deal of work and whose work, in many ways, was very valuable to the community.  I suggest that the time has now come when we ought to reconsider the concomitant growth of that enormous and, to a very great extent, unnecessary State machinery with the enormous growth of a very oppressive form of direct taxation.  Unless we do something to halt that process, there is bound to be a crash and that crash will be accentuated by our present economic difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not really as visionary as it may seem to some to suggest that now is the time to reconsider and to overhaul our whole method of administering the country.  All these things make one pattern.  The fact is that we took over here a system of government and ideas of administration that are entirely unsuited to this country.  One of the tasks to which we should set ourselves is to reform that system of administration. That is one reason why I am altogether in favour of the suggestion I have so <Col N="744" /> often repeated in this House that we should have a National Government because no Party Government, certainly not a Government formed by any one of the present Parties, ever could do the things that will inevitably be necessary sooner or later if we are going to put the State on some sound basis after this crisis has passed.</P>
    <P>As one of the earliest steps it will be necessary to have a process of retrenchment in all directions.  I suggest that even though it is true that you may have to spend a great deal of money in a crisis, even though I agree to a point with Senator Johnston as to the necessity for some form of mild inflation during the crisis, that process should be accompanied by a really serious attempt at national retrenchment and economy.  That attempt should go not only into the Civil Service but into our education system and its methods of working, to see what use we make of its products and kindred questions.  It should be directed, above all, towards seeing that the burden is made as light as possible on the people who are producing in the country, not merely that the burden should be made as light as possible for producers but that producers should get the larger share of the capital endowment of the country.</P>
    <P>One of our troubles is that our agriculture is notoriously under-capitalised, and the tendency all along for the last hundred years has been for capital to flow from agriculture into the cities and towns, for money that should be spent on primary production to be spent more and more on the purchase of motor cars, wireless sets, cosmetics and other trifling things that loom so much and are so important in the life of the townsman and the city man.  We shall have to consider a system of economy which will put the emphasis on the forms of production for which this country is best suited.  Questions like the old tags about protection, free trade, etc., have ceased very largely to have any real meaning in that connection because not only this country but every country, as far as one can see, is going to be thrown back very severely after the war is over on a lower <Col N="745" /> standard of living, with a much greater care for its own productive capacity.  It is not too soon by any means for us to begin to consider these things at the present moment in the middle of the crisis.  In England, for instance, they have had various Ministries whose task has been to consider the situation that will arise for them when the war is over, to try to lay down some line of approach to the enormous task of reconstruction which they will have when the whole crisis is passed.</P>
    <P>We are going through the war as much as any country that is actively engaged in it.  We are not suffering the military consequences of it, but we certainly are suffering the economic consequences just as severely as any other country.  In many ways the impact of it from the economic point of view up to the present was like the first year from the military point of view.  It was what the Americans used to call a &ldquo;phoney&rdquo; war, to a considerable extent until a few months ago.  Now we are beginning to see indications of its real seriousness.  I suggest it is about time that we took the matter more seriously and that we should abandon the notion that you can get the people of the country to join together merely by having an odd speech made to them by the Taoiseach over the wireless or by sending an odd Minister or Deputy to make a speech to them in some country town.  As a matter of fact, the effect of that is more negative than positive.  I was told very recently by a man who is very much in a position to know the circumstances, that when there was a question of an A.R.P. organisation in a particular place, he found there was no use bringing politicians to that meeting to organise a branch because the people in general have no longer any use for politicians.  It is about time that we should begin to realise that.  There is no member of any Party who can lay any particular unction to his own soul in that regard.  The country has become quite tired of politicians of every class and quite apathetic about the differences, if there are any differences, and the jealousies of various Parties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> The only thing that will bring us through the crisis that may well come upon us in the next two, three or five years is some form of a united National Government.  We are told again and again that it is an impossibility.  It may be an impossibility, but our choice may be to do the impossible or go down in disaster.  Our people have faced impossible tasks in the past.  Many people would have said that it was impossible to make headway against the victorious British Government at the end of the last war, but our people faced that task and were successful. They will have to do something that may appear at the present moment to be impossible if they are to survive the next two or three years.  Our political Parties will have to try to put their heads together, whether they like it or not.  Certainly if they have any hope of continuing to guide the destinies of the country, they will have to come together because if they do not they will be swept away in four or five years' time in one common debacle.</P>
    <P>They will learn that the country will not tolerate the continuance of this completely meaningless and pointless political division for many years longer.  It is for that reason that I reiterate what I have said here on several occasions before, that both for their own sakes and the sake of the country, our political leaders of all Parties ought to try to come together and come to some agreement on policy for bringing the country through the crisis, to some agreement on the principles that will guide this country over the next three or four years.  After all it will be agreed that during the last five or six years most of the differences that separated the two Parties have tended to disappear.  They are far less widely apart from each other now than they were seven or eight years ago.</P>
    <P>We shall need, as Senator Johnston pointed out, a policy of something in the nature of inflation in order to carry us over the crisis.  I think that any sensible man, looking around and seeing what is happening with regard to labour, emigration, the supply of commodities and so on, must realise that, and must also realise something I have <Col N="747" /> said here already, that the mistake the Government has made all along has been in being too cautious about borrowing to meet this crisis.  Nothing depressed me more than the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil on that subject.  Last year, the Minister for Finance made a virtue of the fact that, in the middle of the most unparalleled crisis, with business collapsing and the whole country looking as if it were going straight to ruin, he was proposing to borrow only £3,000,000 to meet the crisis.  That was regarded as a virtue, and he was chided by the Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil because he was borrowing anything and because he was not balancing his Budget.  I am only an ordinary individual, and, unlike Senator Johnston, I cannot even do mental arithmetic, but to me and to anyone who reads the papers, or who has his eye in his head to see how things are going, the combined attitude of the two Parties was as near bedlam as anything could be.</P>
    <P>If we are to get through the crisis, we shall have to borrow and we shall have to inflate.  The notion that you are going to get over it on the principles that guided the English Civil Service up to 1938 is a childish notion, but, before entering on any such policy, we must have the first essential.  We must have national unity; we must have agreement between our leaders and an end of all the talk about the split, all the old, miserable debate about the Treaty and the Republic and about what such and such a person said in 1925.  All that must be put aside and even all recriminations about recent financial policy had better be put aside, so far as that can be done. We must start from where we are, taking what has happened up to the present for granted, and we must combine with the policy, which, I think, will inevitably be forced on us, the policy of inflation, an attempt to cut out inessential services, to cut down on our Civil Service, so far as it can be done&mdash;to stop recruiting, for example, to the Civil Service for a while&mdash;to cut down even on our education, or at least to look into our educational <Col N="748" /> system and see how far we have been spending money on unnecessary things in that system.</P>
    <P>Anyone with eyes in his head could point to many instances where money has been clearly wasted on unnecessary, ornamental adjuncts to our education system.  I know of one case myself of a workhouse on one side of a road being left to some friend of the Fianna Fáil Party to do what he liked with it, while part of the local fair-green just opposite was taken away from the people and thousands of pounds spent on erecting a palatial national school on it, the workhouse being left there to be misused.  There are thousands of such cases, about which everybody knows, of money being spent which need not have been spent and where, even yet, many economies could be made and the money so saved spent on the things we shall have to have&mdash;food for the people of Dublin, clothing in so far as it can be got, and the necessary increases in wages to induce our people to stay at home and produce the food and clothes we need.  But in order to get any of these things, you must have a Government which commands the confidence and allegiance of the people, and I suggest, with all charity and all wish to be fair, that we have not got that at present.  We have a Government to which the reaction of a large proportion of the people is one of despair, of apathy, and under which people feel that they are in the grip of some mechanical destiny which leaves them completely helpless to contribute anything at all to the national welfare or to the progress of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not like to sit down without dealing for a moment or two with Senator Goulding's suggested remedy, or partial remedy, for some of the ills that afflict us.  He suggested that we should have patriotism taught in the schools.  I was pleased to hear at long last from a man like Senator Goulding a statement to the effect that it is beginning to dawn on him and on people like him that the policy we have been pursuing with regard to the Irish language for the last 20 years has been a wrong policy, that we have overdone <Col N="749" /> it and that it is not producing the results we expected it to produce.  It is not producing these results because we have insisted, right from the beginning, on not consulting the people who could have told us what to do with regard to the Irish language; because we have insisted on making the cause of the Irish language synonymous with the cause of ignorance and stupidity; and because, instead of not having had enough patriotism in our schools, we have had far too much patriotism, and it is about time we began to think that matter over and to make up our minds that many of us are not so expert in these matters as our strong feelings make us think we are.</P>
    <P>Senator Goulding said that we must teach people why we are forcing them to learn the Irish language.  Unfortunately, I am afraid that Senator Goulding and I and many other people would not agree on the reason why we are compelling people to learn the Irish language, and that, to my mind, is one of the fundamental troubles of the whole business.  Senator Goulding, I am sure, thinks we learn the Irish language and make children learn it, spoiling their schooldays and making them hate the Irish language, because he and many other people like him believe that Wolfe Tone was a Gael&mdash; that is what it comes to&mdash;and because we have insisted on identifying the Irish language with radical republicanism, with which the Irish language has had just as much to do as it has had to do with Chinese metaphysics. Until we get away from that and until we summon up enough intelligence and enough capacity for simple thought to understand that the Irish language and republicanism are to a great degree incompatible, we shall not make any progress with the Irish language, and we shall not only not make any progress, but we shall walk straight into the time when all the young people coming out of our schools will unanimously turn against the Irish language and throw it away.  We may be quite close to that time already, largely because we have confused the question of reviving the Irish language with false and short-sighted notions of what Senator Goulding calls patriotism.  I <Col N="750" /> leave that to Senator Goulding to ponder over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">

      <P>Listening to this debate, I am reminded of a remark made at University College by the President when he was speaking to an auditor's address.  The auditor had covered the whole range of things from the origin of man to the present day, and the President said he was panting from his efforts to keep up with the variety of topics and ideas which were given forth.  I am rather in that position in relation to this debate: I am panting and bewildered by all the different theories advanced.  I do not propose to reply to any of them, except to express myself as completely puzzled by the attitude of the last speaker, who, on the one hand, wants economy, and, on the other, wants a united Government, agreed on a policy of inflation.  If there is one principle that all economists&mdash;even the rather extreme radical economists&mdash;are agreed upon now, it is the dangers of inflation and the desirability of avoiding it by all means possible, and I ask the House not to be led away by facile doctrines of that kind.  Even the economists are not agreed as to the meaning of inflation. To talk light-heartedly about inflation being a remedy for our present evils is to propound a most dangerous doctrine, one that would enormously aggravate the present situation.  Looking back over the last 20 years we know that a policy of the kind produced untold misery after the last war, in certain countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of devoting our attention to these fancy schemes, let us try to discover some practical means of meeting the difficulties with which we are faced. Take first of all the importance of food production.  I regard the food front as far more important than the defence front.  In my view the Government should use all the resources they possess to ensure the production of essential food.  If there is a shortage of agricultural labour they should, in my opinion, use the Army to the fullest extent.  It may be too late to do that for the spring sowing, but it could be done for the gathering of the harvest. <Col N="751" /> I do not fancy the war is going to end this year.  If labour is wanted on the land by farmers, or even under Government schemes, for the production of food, especially on large-scale farms, I think the Army could be usefully employed. I do not believe its diversion at spring time or harvest into agriculture would materially affect its efficiency for the purpose for which it was recruited.  If the Army is short of essential warlike stores, a slight break in its training would not affect its efficiency.</P>
    <P>There are two practical matters I want to raise.  The first is a question of policy with regard to what are commonly known as betting-shops.  It seems as if it were only the other day that we were discussing this matter.  I ask the House seriously to consider whether we should not stand back from the picture and examine the great harm we are doing to the morals of the whole nation by the State traffic in these betting-shops.  It is a canker which is eating into the whole spiritual and moral welfare of our people.  I searched in vain in the Lenten pastorals for any condemnation of this crying evil.  I did see a condemnation of the innocent amusement of dancing, but nothing about these wayside places to which people resort during working hours, waste their employers' time and often are tempted to use their employers' money as a means of trying, by chance, to increase it.  We know, too, of how wives are deprived of the means to maintain their homes in decency and comfort, and that in many cases the wives themselves are tempted to desert their homes and hang about these loathsome places that we find all over the city.</P>
    <P>I was met by a rather humorous aspect of this a short time ago.  A visitor said to me that he was very pleased to see that our fuel scheme was getting on so well&mdash;I hope Senators will not think that I am trying to pass off an old chestnut&mdash;but when I asked him what he meant, he said that he had been down through the country and had seen a large number of shops called &ldquo;turf accountants,&rdquo; and asked if these were not in connection with <Col N="752" /> our fuel schemes.  The Minister and I are, I hope, very good friends.  He has always been very courteous in any dealings I have had with him.  The bone that I have to pick with him relates to the rather disarming and disingenuous manner in which he meets my criticism of his whole policy on this matter.  Last year, when I raised this matter, he met me with the reply that &ldquo;well, we all must have our little flutter,&rdquo; and on that he justifies the moral iniquity of these betting-shops. Surely no one believes that a flutter as expressed by a bet on a racecourse, or even on a sweepstake, is in any way comparable to the places I refer to, places which are frequented day in and day out by people who are tempted to waste time and to commit all the very worst evils that one could possibly imagine.  If I may say so, with all due respect, I feel that it is up to the Hierarchy and the Government to take a strong and determined line to stamp out this moral iniquity from our midst.</P>
    <P>The other matter that I want to refer to is not a question of policy but one of machinery&mdash;that by which permits are obtainable for those who wish to leave the country.  I am not concerned with the policy of the Government on this.  At present it is the accepted policy that people, for certain stated reasons, are permitted to go to England.  I should like to see someone within the Government, who is concerned with the administration of this machinery, try to get a person to England so that he might actually see for himself what happens&mdash;all the delays, the circumlocution, the confusion and the sending from one place to another that goes on.  I can assure the House that it passes all belief.  I speak from experience.  I have tried to get permits for several of my friends.  I do not say that we did not get them in the end, but there is all this jungle that you have to try and make your way through before you reach the end.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to have the matter looked into so that the procedure may be simplified.  My first suggestion to him is that the procedure should be set out on a leaflet.  I do not want to <Col N="753" /> start a debate as to the desirability or otherwise of people going to England. My point is that as long as people are allowed to go the procedure to enable them to do so should be simplified. The whole thing should, I suggest, begin with a form of application.  If the authorities concerned give their &ldquo;O.K.&rdquo; then there should be no delay. At present authority must first come from the labour exchange on the other side.  That is then passed on to the labour exchange authorities here, afterwards to the police and then to the passport office.  My suggestion is that all that should be dealt with on one form which could be sent by post. If an application is favourably received then the form, I suppose, will have to go to the final authority which, I believe, is the British Permit Office. Why not allow that form to be taken as the final authority to proceed on the journey?  I assure the Minister he may be shown regulations which look perfectly simple when seen in an official and calm way; but when you try to carry them out in the case of a permit you are bewildered and disheartened. Six weeks is a long time for a person to be delayed in getting a permit.  A lot of it is due to persons being sent to the wrong place.  I would ask the Minister to request his Department to consider a simplification of the machinery.  It has nothing whatever to do with the policy: it is merely a question of the machinery.</P>

      <P>If I were asked to make a case against parliamentary institutions, I would quote this debate as an ideal example.  I do not think it is fair to expect the Minister for Finance to be able to take in all the statements that are made in respect of External Affairs, Justice, Local Government, Agriculture, Education and other Departments of State.  He cannot be expected to take away the exact statements or the substance of them.  He has an enormous Department to contend with himself and even with the best intention in the world he could not do it.  That is an ideal argument against parliamentary institutions. After all, we may succeed in getting him to take away some of the arguments which we consider good and <Col N="754" /> bring them to the notice of the various Departments concerned.  So Senator Goulding was possibly on good ground when he said it is the duty of everyone contributing to this debate to offer some practical and constructive suggestions. It may be due to my own want of appreciation that I failed to discover any very constructive suggestions in his own contribution.  At all events, they escaped me.</P>
      <P>The complaint of many of the Government supporters was that there was a plethora of contributions rather than a scarcity of them.  I seriously suggest to Senator Goulding that there are many suggestions, not alone when the Vote on Account and the Budget come up for consideration, but at other times.  For instance, there is the suggestion of an economic council to consider long planning, planning for a crisis such as this, planning for the reconstruction of the State and the development of the various resources in it.  More recently, a constructive policy was put forward by the wheat growers, when they asked that an adequate price be paid for wheat, so that there would be no shortage when it is needed next harvest and next winter.  The Minister for Finance probably said: &ldquo;Well, we want to conserve the funds of the country.  We cannot afford to bleed people any more than we are bleeding them at the present time.&rdquo; Surely, if we are to produce for consumption&mdash;as we were told&mdash;the relative value of a couple of hundred thousands of pounds in the coffers of the Treasury and of a couple of hundred thousands of barrels of wheat in the granaries of the country would be easily discovered.  The wheat would provide something to eat, but the money would be of very little value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a certain mentality guiding the decisions and administration of the Government.  I do not want to say it is Civil Service mentality&mdash; perhaps it is&mdash;but it is put down as that.  There are many liberal-minded civil servants who contribute a good deal to Government policy that is worth considering, but let us take some of the administration.  We always have a lot of heroics and trumpet-blowing about the amount of money spent <Col N="755" /> on the relief of unemployment, in employment grants and schemes.  It is worth considering what happens in that case.  I looked at the Appropriation Accounts for 1940-41, as I wanted to see how much was spent, and how much of the money voted for employment schemes went back to the Treasury again.  There is no good in saying in 1938-39, that £1,500,000 was voted for employment schemes when the amount actually expended was about £1,300,000, leaving a return to the Treasury of £197,968.  Neither is it any use in saying that, in 1939-40, there was a similar grant of £1,500,000, when there was returned to the Treasury close on £218,000.  Surely there was no scarcity of schemes on which this money could be spent?  Surely a means could be found by which people drawing unemployment assistance could be put to work on those schemes?</P>
    <P>The Minister was Minister for Local Government for a long time, and he was a very effective worker in that capacity.  Possibly he can remember how the employment schemes worked. About September or October, the schemes were prepared and sent to the Department for examination, and invariably they were sanctioned within a month or six weeks, so that work went on from November to March. What happened this year?  The schemes were prepared in September or October and sent up.  Then an order was sent down telling the council or the county surveyors that they should consider these schemes in the light of the turf traffic or employment on roads used for turf traffic.  I agree that there is a lot of sense in that, and that when one is transporting fuel it is only right that the roads bearing the turf traffic should get consideration.</P>
    <P>But the schemes were not sanctioned and what did we find?  It was only in the latter end of February or the first week in March that they were sanctioned, and the men were hanging around the street corners drawing unemployment assistance when they should have been working as in other years.  They were idle from October to the last week in February.  When the grants were released in the last <Col N="756" /> week in February or the first week in March, the county surveyors were told that, if the employment of these men in employment schemes interfered with the tillage work, the scheme should close down on the 9th March. For goodness' sake does it require anything like supermen to see that men should not be left idle from October to March and then have the work closed down after a week?  That is bad management, whether it is done by the civil servants or directly by word of the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why bog development could not go on during those months.  Drainage in respect of virgin bogs could go on.  We know what happened last year: men went into virgin bog without its having been drained and they were cutting 70 per cent. water.  The drainage should have gone on from October to March on such virgin bog, and then the men would have been cutting 70 or 80 per cent. turf instead.  I think Senator Goulding has no right to say that everybody should make constructive suggestions. When turf production was debated before in this House some of us had the temerity to suggest to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. MacEntee, that the question of transport should be considered.  We were told transport would solve itself.  It did not solve itself and transport proved to be the most serious and the most difficult problem.</P>
    <P>In respect of bog development, I wonder if the Minister is going to cause a great amount of difficulty by fixing a rate of wages below the rate of wages usually in operation in the area.  He is fixing a rate of wages at 30/- a week for bog development. Whether that will appreciate by reason of recent activities by a board, or not, I do not know, but I do know he is going to create trouble for himself if he asks men to work in the production of fuel for the entire community at a wage less than the wage that is paid by the best employers locally.  I suggest that he will create a good deal of trouble for himself if he proceeds in that way.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in respect of local bodies.  Local bodies were told <Col N="757" /> about six months ago, maybe longer, that managers were going to be appointed on the 1st April.  That is a very bad day to appoint anybody, but it was said they were going to be appointed on that day.  Most public bodies are not taking things as seriously as they would if they had not that threat hanging over their heads. A certain amount of dry rot is setting in in public administration because of that statement.  Members of public bodies do not take the same interest in the administration as they would otherwise take.  They say: &ldquo;We are not going to be the real, effective power.  Within the next twelve months a superman is coming in here who will be the man who will do the new things, bring in the new ideas, operate new schemes and activities.  Let him do the work.&rdquo;  I would suggest that the Government should come to some definite decision immediately as to when they are going to appoint the managers, if they are going to appoint managers, and to say definitely when they are going to appoint them so as not to leave public bodies with that sword of Damocles hanging over their head, which is introducing a kind of dry rot in local administration.</P>
    <P>On the vexed question of education, Senator Goulding gave us a lead.  I am glad he did, because many of us feel that the standard of education in the country at the present time for boys from ten to 19 years of age is very low and is not improving.  The fault cannot be laid at the door of the teachers.  I think the fault can be laid at the door of the programme.  The programmes are overloaded.  Whilst the people have not acquired a knowledge of the Irish language that one could consider good in any circumstances, they have lost what was given by the old national schools and the old secondary schools.  They have failed to get a good grinding in English, orthography and mathematics.  That is because the programmes are overloaded. I am glad that Senator Goulding made the remarks he did make.  We have lost these things, but we have not gained Irish as a result.  I noted that he said we should teach patriotism. Candidly, it is very difficult to define what patriotism is.  Senator Douglas <Col N="758" /> said that it connoted selfishness and that we should not be selfish.  I confess that I know some patriots who, if they were anxious to secure everything they possibly could for the State, were also very anxious to secure everything they possibly could for themselves.</P>

      <P>It passed on from the State and they were able to secure the lion's share of what was going for themselves.  I do know a few of them. On the question of education and patriotism, I wish to refer to one incident that I think indicates a very bad idea and is a very bad example of Government policy, if it is Government policy.  I listened the other night to Tráth na Scol&mdash;I am not sure of the name&mdash;it is the children's hour.  I heard a broadcast on the ballad poets of Ireland.  Charles Kickham was the subject of the lecture.  Patrick Sheehan was not a fiction created by Charles Kickham.  He was a reality.  As a matter of historic fact, I think he was buried in Clare out of the workhouse in Ennistymon.  What I did not like in the broadcast, and I am sure the Minister would not like it either, was that certain matter was given out as history to the children which certainly was not history and which no commentator on the life or writings of Kickham has ever stated was history or could be the history of Charles Kickham.  We were told that he wrote in order to secure certain alleviation of certain grievances among the peasantry. I did not object to that very much although that is not the reason he wrote &ldquo;Patrick Sheehan&rdquo;.  He wrote it for a very different purpose. I think Kickham is dead since '82 and why we should censor at the present time what Kickham wrote is more than I can understand.  We all know the verse of Kickham's poem:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;But cruel as my lot was then,</P>
      <P>I ne'er did hardship know,</P>
      <P>Till I joined the British Army,</P>
      <P>Far away from Aherlow.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>How was it recited and sung?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;But cruel as my lot was then,</P>
      <P>I ne'er did hardship know,</P>
      <P>Till I joined a foreign army,</P>
      <P>Far away from Aherlow.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> Are we to censor Kickham, who died in '82, and are we to teach the children of this State such things as historic facts and are the taxpayers being asked to pay for that lie in respect of Kickham?  It is a lie in respect of Kickham.</P>

      <P>It is a lie in respect of Kickham.  I do not know what Senator MacDermot's idea of Kickham is, nor am I very much concerned, but I am concerned about the fact that the taxpayers are asked to pay for the broadcasting of that lie in respect of an Irish poet and an Irish patriot.  I do not think that is the kind of patriotism that Senator Goulding wants taught in the schools or over the radio.  I think it is not a kind of patriotism that should be taught over the radio to the children.  I would not mind adults listening to it, but to have the children of Ireland being taught it as history is, I think, an insult to the nation and a gross attempt to cheat the taxpayers of the country.</P>

      <P>Although Senator Hogan, after complaining of the variety of topics that we have been dealing with this evening, carried us yet further afield, I am not at all sorry that he did, because I think his contribution was extremely interesting, and that what he said about Kickham had quite a relevance to what Senator Goulding said earlier in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in the fortunate position that much that I would have thought of saying in this debate has been better said by other people, so I will detain the Seanad only a very short time.  First of all, I would wish to number myself, by no means for the first time, among those who make appeal to all concerned to consider the plan of a National Government.  I agree with Senator Tierney that a National Government which could give the country strong and far-seeing leadership, and which was believed by the country to be giving it that sort of leadership, might achieve things that come near to being considered an impossibility now, <Col N="760" /> though perhaps not quite such an impossibility as Senator Tierney himself suggested when he proposed combining a programme of inflation and retrenchment, for I have yet to learn that that has ever been achieved anywhere, or, within the nature of things, is capable of achievement.</P>
    <P>Those who have been advocating a National Government have perhaps overlooked the fact, or at any rate not adverted to it, that the principal obstacle is probably one kind of national spirit&mdash;the national spirit of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Unfortunately, for years past &ldquo;national spirit&rdquo; has connoted to me&mdash;the phrase has become rather odious to me and to many others because of that&mdash;bitterness, narrowness, intolerance, and inability to compromise, the habit of referring to your opponents as lacking in patriotism, as the tools of British imperialism, and so forth.  In fact, it has connoted all the ideas that are most inconsistent with the formation of the National Government that I and others would like to see.  I think that there is no denying the truth of Senator Tierney's remark that there is so little to distinguish the Parties from one another that a united Government, formed at any rate by two of them, perhaps three of them, ought to be perfectly possible.  If we ourselves want to give an example of the right sort of national spirit, I cannot imagine a better way of doing it than by forming a National Government.</P>
    <P>Although we cannot overlook the amount of patriotism that has been shown by the young men who have gone into the Defence Forces, and the people who have gone into the A.R.P. and nursing services, and although I think that many of those who crossed the seas to take up service in the British Army, or &ldquo;a foreign army&rdquo;, whichever you prefer to call it, have also been actuated by the highest patriotic motives, it remains the case that, as Senator Goulding has said, there is less of the right sort of national spirit among the young people than we would like to see.  I would diagnose the evil as being this, that for too long&mdash;for 25 years at least&mdash;the humdrum civic virtues have not had <Col N="761" /> the place in the esteem of this country that they deserved.  We have been so accustomed to glorifying the spectacular and the violent and the hotheaded, that people have ceased to value the more humdrum workaday virtues which are comprised in civic duty as those virtues deserve.  I think that needs to be changed, and that the school-teachers and the parents are the ones that can change it, and that would have to recognise the need for changing it.</P>
    <P>The individual members of the Government are, I believe, highly patriotic men, and I have not the smallest doubt that, if they realised what a difference it would make to the whole psychology of the country to get away from Party warfare, to get away from those recriminations about each other's mistakes in the past, and to see in power a Government composed of the ablest and most experienced men of all Parties, they would not hesitate a moment before acting.  For some reason or other a curtain seems so far to have been drawn before their eyes, which prevents them from realising those things.  I do appeal to the Minister to think it over again and again before finally putting it away from him.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter said some important things when he was referring to the question of man power.  The whole problem of supplies and the problem of man power are closely bound up with each other.  I do not think that we can begin to complain and shout about people going over to work in England&mdash;people who send back good money here without which many a home in this country would be hungry that is not hungry at present&mdash;until we are sure that we have found employment for everybody in this country who is fit to be employed.  I confess that I find it rather paradoxical to hear at one moment men saying, as they have done rather often lately, that it is a scandal that people should be going away to England who could be used in the national effort here, and then to hear somebody making a speech next day in which he says that such and such an industry cannot be closed down even though it is consuming goods that cannot really be spared. <Col N="762" /> Let us take, for example, the confectionery industry.  We are told that it cannot be closed down even though the wheat it uses is wanted for bread for the poor, because if it were closed down there would be thousands thrown out of work.  Surely, if we need labour so much in so many directions, it ought to be possible to close down all industries that do not really fit into the national effort that is necessary, and to employ the people in ways that would be more beneficial to the State?</P>
    <P>I am afraid that, in order to overcome the appalling period of stress which lies before us, it will be necessary for the Government to assume and exercise greater powers over the persons of all of us than it has so far done, to order us more about, and tell us what we are to do.  One of my reasons for being in favour of a National Government is that I agree with the general view that it would be almost impossible for a Party Government to do that.  It would not be tolerated. But if we are to overcome that dreadful spectre of poverty that faces us, and to come through all the economic difficulties, I do think that we shall have to become temporarily more totalitarian in our methods, although no one is more devoted than I am to liberty and to parliamentary government. I do think that the Government will have to assume and exercise tremendous powers, but it will not do any good even with tremendous powers unless, in the first place, it has the confidence of the country, and consequently secures the willing co-operation of the people; and, in the second place, unless it does an awful lot of really hard thinking.  The people of this country may be wrong, but I do believe that nine people out of ten think that this Government has not done enough hard thinking; that it is always meeting crises that it might have foreseen more fully had it thought more vigorously, and that it is having to deal with those crises by make-shift expedients because it has not thought things out in time.  That may be unjust to the Government.  Personally, I do not think it is altogether unjust to the Government.  At any rate, if they are hard thinkers, they ought somehow or other to try to convince the country <Col N="763" /> of that fact, because it is very important that the country should be convinced.</P>
    <P>Before I close, there are one or two points about which I want to ask the Minister.  One relates to the Construction Corps.  Senator Sir John Keane suggested that the Army should be used in connection with the coming harvest.  I was rather surprised to hear him, as an old soldier who knows much more about these things than I do, express the view that it could be done without injury to the military efficiency of the Army.  We know that new equipment is now being received and I should have thought there was an immense amount of training for the Army to do during the coming spring, summer and autumn and that it was very doubtful whether its services could be spared for getting in the harvest. Then again, apart from training, there is the question of discipline.  I wonder whether the discipline of the Army would not seriously deteriorate if it were scattered about the country in small parties, as I presume it would have to be in order to assist the farmers during the harvest.  But what about the Construction Corps?  How big is the Construction Corps now? Can the Minister give me any figure?</P>

      <P>Another thing to which I wish to refer is the Defence Conference.  Does the Defence Conference do anything beyond forming a sort of recruiting platform?  Does it accept any responsibilities?  The country would like to be sure that the large sums that we are spending on the Army, which it does not grudge in these times, are being spent with the <Col N="764" /> best possible effect; that they are not being wasted and that our Army is being made in all its branches as efficient as it can be made so far as money is concerned.  May we take it that the Defence Conference comes into that picture; that the leaders of the Opposition, in fact, share in the responsibility of the Government in that respect?  If they do not, one asks oneself just what use is the Defence Conference.  I do not want to run down any institution that is doing useful work, but I would like to be sure it is useful work and that it is not merely something that misleads the public and gives them a false sense of security.</P>
      <P>With regard to the shortage of petrol, which has reached a new stage and apparently is going to be worse and worse, I want to mention one or two things to the Minister.  One is with regard to our fisheries.  I see that sea-fishing boats are in a very bad way and are likely to be in a worse way for lack of fuel oil.  They cannot get sails; they are not able to revert to sailing because they cannot get sails.  Can the Government do anything to help them in that respect?  Could not the sails of pleasure boats be compulsorily acquired and altered in so far as they need alteration to be made available for the purpose?  As regards cars, pleasure motoring is to stop so far as it depends upon the ownership of cars by private owners; but there is another sort of pleasure motoring that, so far as one can see, is still to continue, and it absorbs a fairly considerable amount of petrol, and that is motoring in hired cars.  I have known several cases of people, who are well off enough to be able to do so, in order to avoid a tedious train journey to some place as far away as County Kerry or the remoter parts of County Cork, hiring a car.  This means using up a great deal of petrol, perhaps for only one person. In England they have a law that over a certain distance&mdash;20 miles in that case, and I think here it should be less&mdash;you cannot hire a car, except for some sufficient reason, and you have to fill up a form indicating that reason.  I suggest that plan might be copied here with advantage.</P>

    <P>What about bread for breakfast, or <Col N="765" /> the bread-for-breakfast-only league? Can we have a little guidance from the Minister?  I have vainly scanned the lapel of his coat for a badge.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Supplies has announced that he is a member of the bread-for-breakfast-only league, or the bread-for-only-one-meal league.  One would think it was a subject on which the Government ought to speak with a united voice and not have one Minister leading us in one direction and another Minister giving us a different lead.  I believe there are very few people of the degree of prosperity that it is desired to attract, people who can afford other foods than bread, who would not be prepared to make a modest sacrifice such as is proposed, if they were given the assurance that it was the right thing to do. But I wonder whether there is not a danger that the consequent depletion of our fuel resources might more than make up for the depletion of our bread stocks if people should come to eat cooked food instead of bread?  Take potatoes as an example.  They require a lot of cooking and they use up a lot of gas.  I dare say the Minister for Supplies has thought that out fully. That may be regarded as a trivial thing, but there is a host of trivial things like that on which the ordinary man is only too anxious to do the right thing if he can have authoritative guidance as to what the right thing is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister announced that among the matters which this sum of money will enable him to deal with is compensation of the dependents of the Irish seamen who have been killed as the result of warlike action.  I want to know whether any reply has been received from the German Government about the &ldquo;Glencree&rdquo; and other similar cases since the war began, and whether the Minister cherished any hopes of getting any compensation from the German Government for such cases during this war.  I want to ask him also how our mercantile fleet is getting on.  Is it, in fact, being subjected to attacks?  I understand some of our ships are crossing the Atlantic. How are they faring?  Can the Minister <Col N="766" /> give us reassuring news about them?  Have he and his colleagues made a final decision on the question of arming our mercantile marine&mdash;have they ascertained quite definitely what are the wishes of the people in the mercantile marine, the sailors and the captains of the ships, as to whether they should be armed or not?</P>
    <P>Finally, have the Government taken note of a recent broadcast by Herr Hitler&mdash;a broadcast made a few weeks ago&mdash;in which he announced the initiation of a new, unlimited and more ruthless submarine warfare against the ships of all nations and, if the Government have taken note of that announcement by Herr Hitler, have they made any sort of protest in regard to it?</P>

      <P>War teaches many lessons, not only to belligerents but to neutrals.  It sometimes explodes pet theories, and at other times it confirms long-held views.  In our case, the war appears to have exploded and shown the weakness of the policy of artificial industries, created and maintained behind a high tariff wall.  It has, at the same time, demonstrated that the only real wealth produced in this country, of any real consequence, is produced from the land.  It behoves us, therefore, to plan our future economics with that primarily in view.  This is a time for bold planning, and the Minister, in my opinion, would be well advised in taking the advice given by Senator Johnston and adopting what are, in normal circumstances, considered unorthodox methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, from time to time there have been harsh criticisms of the Minister for Supplies and the Department of Supplies.  When this Bill was before the other House the Minister for Finance defended the Minister for Supplies.  I, personally, do not intend to join the more harsh members of the community who criticise the Minister for Supplies.  I think everybody is agreed that the task that confronts him is a gigantic one, and one on which he or any other man in that position could hardly hope to give general satisfaction in all respects.  I should like, however, to make one criticism, and <Col N="767" /> that is that I do feel that the Government and the Minister for Supplies have not made full use of the prospects of bartering our products for supplies: in other words, that it is up to the Government to see that the products that we send out of this country are paid for in kind rather than in money. That might entail Ministerial conversations with the Ministers of another country.  That is a position that the Ministers of this Government should not be afraid to face up to.  They may say that if they enter into such conversations, questions outside of supplies and trade may be raised.</P>
    <P>They still should not have any fear in facing that situation.  It is one of the few points of national policy on which all Parties in this country are agreed, our neutrality, and the members of this Government should no more hesitate to make their position on neutrality clear in Whitehall than they should hesitate to make it clear in College Green or the Grand Parade in Cork.  I do feel that that avenue of approach for supplies has been sadly neglected.</P>
    <P>Now, there is just one other matter to which I should like to refer.  During the course of this debate, the formation of a National Government has been suggested from various quarters. Undoubtedly, the kind of action that I see it will be necessary for this Government to take before the emergency passes would be far better taken by a National Government.  In fact, I have very grave doubts if this Government or any other Government would be able to take the decisions or carry out the work that will be necessary to pull the country through&mdash;any Government except a National Government. But, while saying that, I should like to point out to those members of this House who have advocated a National Government that, of necessity, the suggestion for a National Government must come from the majority Party. The responsibility for forming or not forming a National Government must be shouldered by the majority Party, and by them alone.  They are the people who must take the responsibility for saying in an emergency: &ldquo;Are we <Col N="768" /> going or are we not going to make use of the men of ability in the other Parties of the Parliament?&rdquo;  Theirs is the responsibility.  They must make the choice, and they must stand or fall by that choice.  As regards the difficulties of forming a National Government, I only want to say this: National Governments have been formed before in other countries, and they have always been impossible on paper and in theory until they have been actually formed, but formed they have been.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is time that somebody should speak in connection with this ramp which seems to be pervading the minds of speakers to-night, in connection with a National Government.  I maintain that we have a National Government.  We have the Government elected by the people, and if anybody or any Party wishes to challenge that, there are several by-elections pending in which the people can get the opportunity of showing whether they want a National Government, as it has been styled by the speakers here to-night.  Surely, the Government which is elected by the people, and which has never shown any indication of losing the confidence of the people of the country, is still a National Government?  What are we going to have as a result of an alteration in the present position, such as has been suggested by speakers here to-night?  It comes from representatives sitting in the Houses of the Oireachtas who seem to think that if a few of them were added to the Government they would make it more national.  I do not hold anything of the kind.  What Parties have we?  We have the Fine Gael Party, previously called the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, which was rejected by the people and replaced by the Government which is at present representing the people.  I do not think it is going to be any addition.  If the demand comes from the people, I have not heard of any such demand.  On the other hand, I have heard plenty of people thanking God that the present Government are there to maintain the country in the position in which it is at present and expressing the hope that it will be maintained in that <Col N="769" /> position.  They pray God for the continuance of the present situation. Then we have the Labour Party, which has never been in office and which has not indicated a tithe of the benefits for the working-class people and the poorer people that the present Government has instituted.  There are fewer people on the subsistence margin to which somebody referred than there were ten years ago when the Fianna Fáil Party came into power.  Even then people who are in opposition at present objected to the unemployment assistance scheme brought in by this Government for maintaining people who were able and willing to work but could not get work.  That Christian scheme which was instituted in this country was criticised by members of the Opposition and even by the Labour Party, because it was suggested that they could do something better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Foran referred to a matter which has been discussed a great deal in the Press lately, namely, the opening in Dublin City of kitchens which were provided through Government foresight in view of a greater emergency than the emergency which exists at present&mdash;the emergency of actual hostilities being forced upon us.  That matter has been discussed widely, and the Government have not agreed that these food centres should be opened to provide meals for which the poor people of Dublin are not looking.  The St. John Ambulance Brigade have a restaurant capable of providing 800 meals at a negligible cost.  Quite recently it was stated in the Press that the attendance at that restaurant has dropped to 400 odd.  I cannot understand why a Senator should look for the opening of more kitchens to provide even free meals or meals at a nominal cost.  These meals were being provided at a nominal cost of 1d. or 2d. and the people did not go to get the meals.  What puzzles me is that Senators should expatiate here about starvation when there is no starvation. In spite of what any Government may do you will have people badly fed, often through their own negligence.  I do not see what action of any Government can bring that down to a negligible number.  I am glad to say that when going through the city you <Col N="770" /> will not see the barefooted children you would see ten years ago.  The conditions of the people have improved despite the emergency and the crisis that is on us.</P>
    <P>The people of the country have shown no indication that they require any change in the Government, that they require representatives in the Government of one Party which has been rejected by the people, another Party which has never come into power, and, I presume, a few Independents who represent nobody and who have been rags on several bushes already; even Independents, whether they be Seanadóirí or Teachtaí, who, when the people of the country would not listen to them, went to a foreign country and greatly jeopardised our position by expatiating on a policy which the people of this country would not listen to.  I want to voice my objection to any suggestion about the formation of a National Government when we have an eminently National Government.  Despite the smiles of some Senators, these are my sentiments and I wish to express them.  We have a Government which is representative of the different sections of the community and especially the farming community.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one statement which Senator Baxter made.  He claims to be the representative of the farmers in this House.  I do not know why he claims to be that, except that he is a farmer himself.  But I am a farmer's son, even though I am not living on the land at present.  Perhaps that is one of the sins Senator Baxter thinks I committed.  At any rate, he claims to speak on behalf of the farmers and to justify everything that farmers do.  I claim to be able to speak on behalf of farmers, but I condemn wholeheartedly what some farmers have done which Senator Baxter tried to explain in a most childish way.  He said that the wheat found in the stomachs of pigs slaughtered in the bacon factories was there because the pigs had eaten grains from the straw of badly-threshed wheat which was in their bedding.  He seems to stand for a farmer who makes that sort of statement.</P>

      <P>You admitted it was there.  You tried to give an explanation that it was there because some pigs had eaten from the straw grains of wheat which had been badly threshed.  The thing is too preposterous. In the first place, if it were threshed like that and grains of wheat were left for pigs to eat out of the bedding, it was a disgrace.  I would not stand for it, although I am interested in the activities and the general welfare of the farming community who have responded to all the appeals made to them and who have supported the National Government which is in office. Despite the arguments used by members of the Opposition in regard to farmers, if we were not in the position to-day of having a Government in office which instituted an agricultural policy which has been developed during the past ten years, we would be in a bad state to endeavour to feed the people.  When the emergency came upon us we would not have been able to extend our acreage of wheat to 500,000 or 600,000 acres.  Neither could we have developed the sugar beet industry.</P>

      <P>Certainly in a debate that took place in this House Senator Johnston suggested to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce the advisability of closing some of the beet factories as national policy.  If that is the kind of help this country would get from a National Government, or of what Senators spoke of as National Government, God preserve us from it.  I wish strongly to voice my objection to such a project, because if a few people are absorbed from other Parties, that is not going to make a Government anything more national than the Government we have now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to confine my remarks as much as possible to the sphere with which I am concerned, agriculture.  In a recent debate that took place in this House I was debarred by time from answering some statements that were made from other parts of it.  One of these statements was that the farmers had let the country down.  That statement calls for some explanation, if not denunciation. I do not think any attempt could be made to support it.  Senator Tierney stated to-night that the period of greatest crisis was approaching, especially in regard to emigration and essential supplies.  In a crisis like this every Senator is bound to contribute in a helpful way, whether we agree or disagree with the Government.  Looking at the position from the angle of one whose lot is cast in close proximity to the life of the majority of the people, I suggest that nothing has yet been done to avert happenings that may be the outcome of this crisis.  The position is easier since the Government wisely increased the price of wheat, but there are still many attractions across the Border.  These attractions are being keenly felt on this side of the Border.  Not a day passes but our <Col N="773" /> workers, in justice to themselves and their families, feel that they are bound to avail of the conditions that exist elsewhere.  Within the past month I know cases where those who earned 30/- weekly converted that amount into £5 5s. and in some cases into £7 7s. I appeal to the Minister to take cognisance of that position while there is time to do so.  I like to look not three or five years ahead but one year ahead. I take this opportunity of thanking his Eminence Cardinal MacRory for his very clear exposition of the position of our farmers in his recent Pastoral, in which he stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At a time like the present, if the State errs at all in its treatment of the farmer I think it should err on the side of generosity.  All other labour is highly paid.  Why should that of the farmer be an exception? The Irish farmer has seen many a lean year, when foreign grain or foreign meat, dumped upon Irish or British markets, reduced prices to such an extent that he and his family were sometimes almost on the verge of starvation; and now, when war conditions, if allowed free play, would bring him considerable compensation, it would be unfair to treat him in a niggardly fashion.  We hear a lot of the desirability of keeping people on the land, but if we want to do that the first thing to be done is to make the farmer prosperous, and himself and his family contented.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position of agriculture here compared with conditions that prevail across the Channel?  If I go to Newry market on Monday next with Grade A cattle I will be paid 11/- per cwt. less than the Imperial preference price, and as the average weight of beef cattle might be between nine and ten cwts., if we export about 500,000 cattle yearly, the loss to this State of the benefit of Imperial preference can be readily estimated.  Pigs are sold from £1 to 30/- less than if sold at the Imperial preference rate.  Farmers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland receive a bounty of £2 on every acre they plough.  On every acre of potatoes they grow they receive a bounty of £10. If a farmer there grows 60 or 80 acres of potatoes, as some of them did last <Col N="774" /> year, they get £10 bounty on every acre.  They have also derating which is of more advantage than the reduction made in the annuities here.  In addition, they can buy sulphate of ammonia at £10 a ton as against £45 to £60 here as our farmers know to their cost.  With these facts before us, I sometimes think that some of the things we do are not wisely done.  No man loves an orange more than I do, but surely to goodness if we could import 500 tons of oranges, there was nothing to prevent us importing 500 tons or 5,000 tons of sulphate of ammonia.  Are we to allow the best of our labourers to go to employment across the water and to be left to carry on with men who are not fit for farm work?  Whatever criticism there may be of education or other things in this House, nobody will deny that we would be acting wisely and well if we could put the farmers here on an exact footing with their competitors elsewhere, so that they would, at least, have the same financial resources and be able to employ our labourers to produce the food we require.  When farmers fail to produce the amount of food required at home it will be time enough to deal with the statement that they had let the nation down, but not until then.  I am supported in my appeal to the Minister by the Pastoral of the Cardinal Primate to see to it that our farmers are put on the same footing as their neighbours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGee struck the most practical note in this debate and I wish to emphasise all he has said.  He referred to the need for a supply of sulphate of ammonia for this year's crops.  The greatest need of agriculture here is a supply of artificial manures, and if some ships could be made available to bring in sulphate of ammonia or nitrogenous manures of any kind it would be of the greatest service to agriculturists.  I ask the Minister to take a note of that request and to ask the Minister for Agriculture to deal with it, because it is a constructive proposal.  If successful it would be a great help in the production of food.  As there has been a great deal of pessimism I would like to be a little optimistic.  It is obvious to <Col N="775" /> anyone travelling through the country that tillage has been greatly increased. I believe that it has been increased some 25 per cent., and if that is so it is a matter for congratulation.  Provided we get a good yield from this year's harvest this country should be safe for another year as far as the food supply is concerned.  Senator McCabe mentioned that there was a subsidy of £10 per acre given to British farmers who grew potatoes.  As the time is now opportune for planting potatoes, our farming community should be exhorted to go in more largely for the growing of potatoes, because that crop provides good feeding for man and beast.  If there are plenty of potatoes here there will be no hunger.  At one time our people had to live almost entirely on potatoes, and if an acute crisis arose potatoes would again save this country from hunger.  It would be a great help if something could be done now to stimulate greater production of that crop.  Several speakers made a plea for a National Government which, I take it, means a fusion of Parties.  In my opinion it is the farmers and not the statesmen who will save this country.</P>

Dá n-eirigheadh na Seanadóirí sin, agus daoine eile le n-a gcois, as a gcuid sabotage, dá labhruighidís, an teanga an chorr-uair féin, dá dtugaidís an deagh-shompla anois agus arís, sílim go mbeadh níos mó misnigh agus muinighine ag na daoine óga as an teangaidh thar mar tá agus gur mó an dul chun cinn a dhéanfadh sí dá réir.</P>
    <P>Mar adhbhar magaidh chuir an Seanadóir Ó Tighearnaigh na focla seo <Col N="777" /> i leith Sheáin Uí Ghóilín gur mhol sé go mbeadh &ldquo;Professors of Patriotism&rdquo; againn sa tír.  Níor mhol Seán Ó Góilín a leithéid ach feicthear dhom fhéin go mba é leas na hÉireann go mór é dá ndéantaí iarracht ar riar de na &ldquo;Professors of anti-Patriotism&rdquo; a laghdú sa tír.  Mar a dubhairt mé, Seachtmhain na Gaedhilge féin ní fhéadfadh cuid acu a sgaoileadh thart gan an sgian a nochtadh agus í a sháitheadh i gcúis na teangadh.  Is suarach iad.</P>
    <P>Chaith an tOllamh Ó Tighearnaigh cuid mhaith ama ag caint ar forbairt an airgid nó inflation mar deirtear. Ar thuig sé an focal?  Níl fhios agam cé méid uaír a dubhairt sé é le linn a óráide ach gach uair dá ndubhairt é is mó a facthas dom nár thuig sé brigh an fhocail.  Is beag nach ndéarna sé dán faoi'n téarma.  Níor thug sé leide dhúinn ar an mbrigh a bhí aige leis agus rud níos greannmhara ná sin níor mhínigh sé dhúinn cén tslighe go mb'ionann inflation agus saidhbhreas na tíre a mhéadú.  Nach cuimhneach linn toradh an inflation ar an Eoróip tamall o shoin?  Nach bhfuil inflation sa tír seo cheana féin de bhárr an mhéid airgid atá ag teacht isteach agus a gcreideann duine ar bith gur soilgheas no buntáiste as éadan é?  Ach bfhéidir gur fearr gan bacadh a thuilleadh leis an bpoinnte&mdash;anocht ar chaoi ar bith.  An dearmad a rinne an Seanadóir MacEóin ina chuid figiúracha, chuir sé an milleán faoi ar shlaghdán a bhí air.  D'fhuagair an Seanadóir Ó Tighearnaigh nach bhfuil aon mheabhair aige le figiúracha nó uimhríocht de shórt ar bith&mdash;ach ní ar shlaghdán a chuireann seisean an milleán.  An í an Gháedhilge is cionntsiocair le n-a laige sa gcása?  Ar chaoi ar bith sílim gur féidir linn a rádh nach staidéar ar an nGaedhilge ná í bheith á labhairt aige is cionntsiocair leis an doiléire nó míochruinneas a nochtuigh sé tráthnóna. Bá spéiseamhail, agus ba greannmhar freisin, bheith ag éisteacht le cuid de na lochtaí a bhíothas a fághail ar an Rialtas.  Ní dhearna an Rialtas an oiread agus ba chóir le go mbéadh ar ár gcumas an ghuais ina bhfuilmuid a shárú.  Céard a rinne an dream seo atá a tromaidheacht ar an Rialtas le cuidiú leis le réidhteach i gcoinne na <Col N="778" /> guaise?  Rinne siad, istigh san Oireachtas annseo agus amuigh ar fud na tíre, a ndícheall le beag is fiú a dhéanamh de gach gné de pholasaí an Rialtais.  Chuir siad i gcoinne polasaí na curaidheachta, cruithneacht, biatas agus eile; chuir siad i gcoinne na muilte agus monarchana agus na gnóthaí a bhí an Rialtas a iarraidh a chur ar bun.  Má támaid gann ar chruithneacht ná aon adhbhar ar bith eile ní ar an Rialtas atá an milleán ach ar na saboteurs a rinne an oiread agus a rinneadar le polasaí an Rialtais i rith na ndeich mbliadhan atá caithte a bhriseadh agus a chur ar neimh-nidh.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir go mbéadh ríméad ar an Aire agus ar an Rialtas go bhfuil na daoine seo a bhíodh ina n-aghaidh roimhe seo chomh tréan anois ar shon an pholasaí gurb é a chuspóir maoin aicionta na tíre a chur á saothrú agus á foirbhiú.  Agus os rud é gur mar sin atá an sgéal, ceapfaí nach bhfuil mórán brígh leis an gcaint a bhíos ar bun i dtaobh Rialtais Náisiúnta.  Is cosamhail go bhfuil an Rialtas Náisiúnta ann le fada an lá i ndáiríribh.  Ach ós a tagairt don cheist seo faoi Rialtas Náisiúnta mé, an bhfuil lucht Fine Gael dáiríribh sa gcaint a bhí ar siubhal aca faoi?  An geuimhnigheann siad ar an méid a dubhairt an Fear Ceannais atá ortha, an Teachta Mac Cosgair, le gairid sa Dáil nuair a rinneadh tagairt don cheist chéadna.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Cad dubhairt sé?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Nach bhféadfadh Rialtas Náisiúnta bheith ann an fhaid a bhéadh an Taoiseach ann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Sin é an rud a bhí sna páipéirí ach ní mar sin a bhí sé sa Tuarasgabháil Oifigiúil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Sin é an rud a léigh mise, ach má abruigheann an Seanadóir Ó hAodha liom nach raibh an ceart sa tuarasgabháil no nach shin é an rud a dubhairt an Teachta Mac Cosgair glacaim leis an gceartú agus fágfad an sgéal mar sin.  Agus tar éis an tsaoghail, bhfuil an oiread seo éifeachta a baint le &ldquo;Rialtas Náisiúnta&rdquo;?  Cuireadh go leor Rialtas Náisiúnta ar bun ó am go ham, ar an Mór-Roinn.  Cén mhaith a rinne siad? Ar shábháil siad a dtíortha?  Nach <Col N="779" /> bhfuil Rialtas Náisiúnta ar bun i Sasana ó thosuigh an cogadh seo agus an bhfuiltear sásta leis nó a gceapann duine ar bith annseo go ndearna siad mórán níos fearr ná an cineál Rialtais a bhí ann roimhe.</P>
      <P>Ba spéiseamhail an tagairt a rinne an Seanadóir Mac Diarmuda don Chór Déantais.  Is truagh linn ar fad nár eirigh i bhfad níos fearr leis an iarracht sin go dtí seo.  Tá súil agam go n-eireóchaidh leis níos fearr san am le teacht.  Is truagh nach isteach ann a théigheann cuid mhaith aca seo atá ag dul go Sasana.  Is mó an mhaith a dhéanfadh sé dhóibh dul isteach sa gCór Déantais dá dtuigidís é, agus ba uasal dílis an gníomh é, ar son a dtíre. Ach ós ag caint ar an gCór Déantais dom ba mhaith liom na fir atá ann a mholadh agus iad a mholadh go hárd. Feicim go minic le gairid iad agus iad i mbun oibre; molaim a spiorad agus a ndúthracht agus a ndílseacht.</P>
      <P>Tá cosamhalcht ann go bhfuil cuid mhaith Seanadóirí i bhfábhar &ldquo;campaí saothair&rdquo; agus fiú amháin i bhfábhar na preasála féin.  Maidir liom féin tá mé sásta bheith foighdeach go bhfeicfe mé cén toradh a bhéas ar an iarracht ionmholta atá ar bun ag an Rúnaí Páirliminte atá i mbun na mónadh. Tá brath aige-san na fir a thabhairt le chéile i gcineál campa.  Gheobhaidh an sgéim triáil féaráilte agus má eirigheann léi b'fhéidir le Dia nach fada go mbéidh ar ár gcumas an sgéim a leathnú i riocht is go mbéidh a lán de na rudaí ionmholta ba mhaith linn a bheith ar bun ar fud na tíre á ndéanamh.  Is experiment é agus go n-eirighe leis.  Is maith liom bheith ag éisteacht le mo charaid, an Seanadóir Magee.  Ní theastuigheann uaidh ach leas a thíre agus leas a mhuintire. Tá mé ar aon intinn leis nuair a deir sé go mba chóir dúinn ár ndícheall a dhéanamh ar son na bhfeiliméaraí agus ar son mhuinntir na tuaithe go léir.  Go deimhin, ní beag atá déanta ar a son go léir go dtí seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ach ní thóigfe an Seanadóir orm má chuirim ceist air.  An gcreideann sé, i ndáiríribh, gur fédir linne £5 no £7 sa tseachtmhain íoc le oibridhthe na tuaithe annseo&mdash;nó cén sórt punta atá i gceist aige?  An gcreideann sé gur féidir linn luachanna ar thortha na <Col N="780" /> talmhan íoc ar an leibhéal céadna agus tá i bhfeidhm i Sasana faoi láthair? Sé an locht atá agam ar an gcaint a rinne sé go bhfuil caighdeáin no &ldquo;standards&rdquo; Shasana á moladh dúinn mar chaighdeáin chearta dhúinne annseo in Eirinn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Micheál O hAodha Micheál O hAodha">
      <NameTxt>Micheál O hAodha</NameTxt>
      <P>Ach is thall atá an margadh.  Nach thall a caithfear an stuif do dhíol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Is fíor go bhfuil margadh againn i Sasana agus gur margadh tábhachtach dúinn é.  Ach ina dhiaidh sin, ní féidir linne bheith ag súil go bhféadfaimís na caighdeáin Sasanacha a bheith againn annseo agus iad a choinneál ar bun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Micheál O hAodha Micheál O hAodha">
      <NameTxt>Micheál O hAodha</NameTxt>
      <P>Ach tá an margadh i Sasana.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá, admhuighim sin.  Ach bfhéidir nach mbéidh sé ann i bhfad dúinn.  Tá súil agam go mbéidh an margadh againn ann ach muna féidir linn feabhas a chur ar an soláthar ionnus go mbéidh ar ár gcumas ár gcuid torthaí a chur ar an margadh sin ar luachanna chomh híseal leis na daoine a bhí ag coimhlint inár gcoinne, Danair, an tSéalainn Nua, srl., b'fhearr dúinn, is eagal liom, druim láimhe a chur leis an margadh sin.  Ní ciallmhar an rud dúinne bheith ag íoc deolchaire nó deóntas ar earraí no torthaí ar bith is mian linn a chur ag mhargadh Shasana, rud atá ar bun againn le tamall maith. B'fhearr dúinne, creidim, ár n-aghaidh iompódh isteach chun ar dtíre fhéin agus iarracht a dhéanamh ár chaighdeáin a bhéas níos feileamhnaighe dhúinn, caighdeáin a bhéas níos nádúrtha, caighdeáin a bheás do réir ár meóin faoi leith féin agus do réir ár n-acfuinne náisiúnta a bhunú.  Má leanamuid nós no polasaí ar bith eile, tá faitchíos orm gur cill a déanfar den tír seo in áit muilinn!</P>
      <P>Tá súil agam nach dtóigfe an Seanadóir McGee orm an cheist a phléidhe mar seo.  Tá faitchíos orm go raibh dul amugha anocht air sna tuairimí a nochtuigh sé.</P>
