      <P>This is a Bill to amend the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1936, by modifying the financial system on which the existing Acts are based so as to permit the release for expenditure on additional benefits of part of the income of the National Health Insurance Society which at present is carried to reserve. For a proper understanding of the Bill, it is necessary to go back to the position of health insurance before the passing of the Act of 1933 which amalgamated all approved societies and branches and replaced them by the National Health Insurance Society. There were then some 85 of these different societies and branches, and their assets consisted partly of cash investments and partly of book credits known as reserve values.  These reserve values represented that part of the liability which each society assumed by admitting to membership persons who were over the age of 16 years when they became insurable for the first time.  Provision was made for their redemption by a sinking fund which was formed by putting aside a proportion of the weekly contributions <Col N="890" /> and used to convert these national investments into actual cash investments.  The retention of part of the contributions for the sinking fund was made possible by the assumption by the Exchequer of a liability to pay two-ninths of the actual expenditure by societies on benefits and administration until the reserve values had all been converted into cash.</P>
      <P>Each approved society was a separate self-governing entity with its own benefit fund and invested assets. While every employed person was compulsorily insured he was free to join any society which would accept him. Owing to competition between societies some societies might expand their membership, others such as those confined to a particular trade or class might maintain a stable membership and others for various causes might suffer a steady diminution in membership. As no society had any guarantee of continuity of membership the method of finance had to have regard to that fact so that the principles of actuarial valuation might apply to them as in the case of voluntary insurance bodies.  An actuarial valuation applies at regular intervals, usually five years, a test of the sufficiency of the existing assets of a society to provide in the future for its liabilities towards all persons in the society on the valuation date.  It is a measure of the funds which a society should have so that, if it never recruited another member, these funds, together with future contributions, would provide all the benefits to which the members would be entitled until, in the course of time, through death, transfer or lapse of membership, the society had ceased to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Health Insurance Act, 1918, effected certain modifications rendered necessary by experience of the working of the scheme which showed that the finances of societies required strengthening.  This was achieved by additional State aid and by reducing the sums retained for the service of the sinking fund to redeem reserve values.  The sums diverted from the sinking fund were used to establish a contingencies fund for each <Col N="891" /> society and a central fund available for all societies.  The object of the contingencies fund of a society was to provide a first line of defence against a deficiency in the benefit fund on valuation. The contingencies fund was left out of account on valuation, but if a deficiency emerged it was used to make good the deficiency.  So far as it was not used it was credited to the benefit fund and became available in that fund at the next valuation.  The object of the central fund was to come to the aid of a society with a deficiency which its own contingencies fund could not cover.  Assistance to a society from the central fund was given only when it was clear that the deficiency was due to circumstances over which the society had no control.  Its income was derived in part from a proportion of reserve value deductions, part from State grant, and part from the moneys available from unclaimed stamps.  The State grant ceased in 1921 and since then the central fund is supported solely by moneys out of unclaimed stamps.</P>
    <P>Another fund, known as the reserve suspense fund, was set up to deal with the necessary adjustments as regards new entrants to insurance; the transfer of members from one society to another; or lapse from insurance. Since unification transfers are now confined practically to international transfers to and from Great Britain. These complicated technical arrangements were an essential part of the old individual society system.  When the financial position of some of these societies gave cause for anxiety some ten years ago, and it was evident that a continuation of the system would result in the further growth of anomalies and inequalities between different groups of persons, indefensible in a national insurance system, the Act of 1933 was passed unifying approved societies in the National Health Insurance Society.  It was recognised that the reserve value system was no longer appropriate to a national society and that the principles of actuarial valuation were capable of considerable modification.  Departmental consideration was given to the matter and discussions <Col N="892" /> with the actuarial adviser were directed towards the question of what changes in the financial system were possible and desirable.  One of the first obstacles to progress was the absence of reliable standards applicable to this country for the measurement of factors affecting the actuarial basis of the scheme.  All previous valuations had been made on standards originally based on British experience which had ceased to apply.  The first task was to collect information on which a reliable standard of measurement could be based.  The provision of the information required was undertaken by the new society, and data covering a period of years was supplied to the actuary who furnished a report on the sickness experience of the society.</P>
    <P>In the meantime consideration of the financial position generally had continued as a result of the valuation made on unification at the end of 1933, which had disclosed a deficiency of £46,700.  The contingencies fund of £183,000 had been drawn on to meet this deficiency, the balance, small in relation to the future liabilities, being carried forward.  In making this valuation, previous methods and standards of sickness and mortality, etc., as in previous valuations had been used, but the report as to the sickness experience showed that these standards did not provide a proper measure of the society's liabilities and that a valuation on the basis of the society's own experience would show a large deficiency which would call for a reduction in benefits or an increase in contributions. It was considered, however, that the principles underlying valuations of individual societies could not properly apply to one national society to which all persons entering insurance must necessarily belong. Although the excess of income over expenditure amounted to sums varying from £150,000 to £200,000 a year, which were being added to reserves, nevertheless, on the old valuation system, these reserves were insufficient.  It was, however, felt that in a comprehensive national scheme as distinct from a commercial scheme or a scheme worked through a multiplicity of societies new <Col N="893" /> considerations might be taken into account subject to the best expert opinion available.</P>
    <P>The Department's actuarial adviser was, accordingly, consulted and the result is contained in his very informative report dated 28th March, 1941, which has been presented to the Oireachtas.  That report confirmed the departmental opinion that fundamental alterations in the financial structure of the scheme were possible and that, instead of continuing to accumulate reserves, an appreciable proportion of the society's income might safely be regarded as available to provide additional benefits for its members.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the Seanad provides for the repeal of all those sections of the National Health Insurance Acts which deal with the crediting and debiting of reserve values and transfer values and with the provision of a sinking fund for the redemption of reserve values by means of a deduction from contributions.  It also repeals the provisions relating to the contingencies fund, which, as already explained, is formed by placing to temporary reserve a proportion of the contribution income.  The result of these repeals will be that the whole contribution income of the society, which hitherto has been apportioned between the benefit fund, including the administration account, of the society, the contingencies fund and the sinking fund for redemption of reserve values, will be credited to the benefit fund and administration account of the society. The Bill also provides for the repeal of those sections of the existing Acts governing valuation and the manner of dealing with a surplus or deficiency arising on valuation.  Instead of these provisions, the Bill proposes that, as at the dates on which a valuation under the existing Acts would normally be made, there shall be made a comprehensive actuarial review by an actuary appointed by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In his review, the actuary is to have regard to the amount by which the income of the society, other than that <Col N="894" /> available for administration expenses, exceeded the expenditure on benefits, medical certification and the provision of transfer values during the preceding five years, and he is required by the Bill to report as to the amount of such excess which, in his opinion, may be made available for additional benefits in the next succeeding additional benefit period.  The type of report contemplated would correspond to the report to which I have already referred and which governs the amounts which will be made available for additional benefits in the five years beginning 1st April, 1942.  The Minister, after considering any such report, is to determine the amount which may be made available for additional benefits, and the society may submit for his sanction a scheme for the provision of such additional benefits.  The Bill proposes to make no change in the list of additional benefits contained in the existing Acts.</P>
    <P>Under Section 3 of the Act of 1911 two-ninths of the cost of the provision of additional benefits including the cost of their administration is borne by the Exchequer.  It is contemplated that the amount to be made available for additional benefits in each of the next five years will be £175,000 of which about £39,000 will be borne by the Exchequer.  The Central Fund is to be reconstituted as the National Health Insurance Reserve Fund, and will in future be the only resources of the scheme held in reserve to meet adverse experience.  It is of the highest importance that the existing capital assets of the society which represent the investments of its benefit fund, should be maintained intact and should not be encroached upon.  They are under no circumstances available for distribution.  They perform the function of producing by way of interest, an income which is a supplement to contributions.  If this interest income were to fail then it would be necessary to replace it by an increase of contributions.  If adverse circumstances were experienced in which the income of the society fell to a level lower than that necessary to provide ordinary benefits, or if the claim rate <Col N="895" /> so increased that the income was no longer sufficient to meet it, then the proper procedure would be not to encroach on capital assets but to increase contributions or reduce benefits in order to restore equilibrium.</P>
    <P>For this reason the reserve fund is of importance.  Its purpose is to perform the functions of a contingencies reserve fund and it is proposed that it should be allowed to accumulate by its own interest and by the addition from year to year of certain moneys made available from the proceeds of unclaimed stamps until, in the opinion of the actuary, it has reached a figure which will constitute a reasonable reserve.  He will consider its position at each quinquennial review and will advise as to the amount, if any, which may be transferred from it to the benefit fund of the society.  Any amount so transferred will be taken into account in deciding the amount made available for additional benefits. The Bill also deals with the disposal of moneys representing unclaimed stamps, and proposes that an amount not exceeding £15,000 of these moneys be paid each year to the Exchequer as an Appropriation-in-Aid of the cost of central administration, the balance being credited to the new reserve fund. Under the existing Acts, the State bears two-ninths of the expenditure on benefits and administration by the National Health Insurance Society.  It contributes a substantial amount by way of State grant on contributions, provides the cost of the district medical referee scheme and in addition the whole cost of central administration, including the cost of printing contribution cards and of the printing and sale of insurance stamps.  Including expenditure in respect of National Health Insurance by allied Departments the whole State expenditure at present on National Health Insurance is £321,000 a year.  The present Bill will add to that expenditure by the State, two-ninths of the cost of the additional benefits to be provided amounting to £39,000 annually.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are rather technical in nature.  They <Col N="896" /> deal with the winding up of the contingencies fund, the sinking fund and the reserve suspense fund; with the cancellation of reserve value; with the provision of transfer values in cases of transfers of insurance to or from Great Britain or to or from the military forces fund; and with the allocation of interest income amongst the various funds and accounts on which interest is earned.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I think it well to say that this Bill is, to some extent, experimental in character.  The changes made in the finances of the scheme are fundamental, but it must not be taken that they permit of any loosening of supervision and control over the existing financial resources. Because the income of the scheme has regularly exceeded the expenditure, it must not be assumed that a satisfactory position exists, allowing of large extensions of the benefits, limited only by the amount of that excess.  On the contrary there are indications that the position is far from satisfactory in certain respects and the actuary in his report of 1939 dealing with the sickness experience and also his report of last year dealing with the general financial position has drawn particular attention to these.</P>
    <P>It is clear from his reports that the rates of incapacity for which payment to members is being made by the society are exceedingly heavy, particularly in regard to disablement benefit, which are two or three times the corresponding British rates, and far exceed the amount of incapacity for which provision was made in the financial basis of the scheme in this country.  He states that unless drastic administrative measures are taken successfully to eradicate the &ldquo;claim habit&rdquo; the incapacity experienced will have to determine the actuarial basis of the scheme.  This is a question which is actively engaging the attention of the society and the Department.</P>
    <P>The actuary also draws attention to the comparatively low proportion of persons of insurable age who are insurably employed in this country, while pointing out that in recent years a considerable <Col N="897" /> increase in members has occurred, particularly at the later ages, and concludes that the insured population, both as regards numbers and age distribution, is not in a stable position.  He adds that since changes in numbers and age constitution may have a marked effect, not only on the capital liabilities of the scheme, but also on the average cost of benefits, it must be remembered always that this instability in the insured population is a factor of fundamental importance in considering the effect of far-reaching amendments of the financial arrangements and enlargements of the scope of benefits.  The need for extreme caution is evident.  It must not, therefore, be assumed that, because recent experience allows of a temporary enlargement of benefits, there is a certainty of continuing these additional benefits indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Apart from the very important considerations advanced by the actuary, it may well be that an increase in the incidence of unemployment, due to present economic conditions, might have the effect of so seriously reducing the contribution income of the society, that expenditure on additional benefits might have to be curtailed.</P>

      <P>As one very closely associated with national health insurance, both under the old system and the comparatively new, I sincerely welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is somewhat late in coming but, nevertheless, it is extremely welcome and marks a considerable advance in social insurance in this country.  To call our system national health insurance was a misnomer, as there was no relation whatever between the societies and national health.  They paid out certain cash benefits, but beyond that they made no effort whatever to deal with the health of their members.  This Bill marks a departure in that respect.  It makes it possible for the unified society to deal with the health of its members. There is available from the accumulated funds and from the Central Fund now a matter of £175,000 per annum. Part of these funds will be devoted to hospital and convalescent treatment, dental and optical treatment.  This will <Col N="898" /> go some way towards helping the sick insured people.  To that extent the Bill is timely and very well worth while.</P>
      <P>This Bill is merely a step forward in social insurance in this country.  It does not go nearly far enough, but it makes it possible in the immediate future to develop social health schemes somewhat comparable with some of the schemes in operation on the Continent. We can say that, as a first step in that direction, it is well worth while. The unifying of all the various societies which existed up to some few years ago has proved a very wise step.  The present National Health Insurance Society, with which I am very closely associated, is one of the most efficient organisations with which I have ever been associated.  In the management, the staff, and right through the whole organisation of the society, one sees efficiency and competence.  The very fact that all these societies have been merged has made it possible to accumulate a reserved fund of £4,500,000. Now, under the actuarial system, it would take us another seven or eight years, possibly, to arrive at a period in which we would be actuarially sound and could possibly give some extra benefits.  This departure to the assessment basis makes it possible for the present generation of subscribers or contributors to derive some of the benefits from this accumulated £4,500,000 of reserve fund.  It is worthy of note that this £4,500,000 is invested entirely in this country.  There is no rake-off going outside the country at all.</P>
      <P>The societies have been clamouring for a considerable time to get the Government to come to their way of thinking, in order that the present generation of contributors would derive the benefits that they are entitled to.  That is being done under this Bill.  From what I know of the society, the Parliamentary Secretary can rest assured that this money will be wisely and well spent in the interests of the members at large.  £175,000 is a very considerable sum to have at the society's disposal over each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With that it will be possible to deal with the health of the members in <Col N="899" /> general.  It deals with dental, hospital and convalescent treatment, which was unknown under the old régime. It may be in the future that this society may be able to finance their own convalescent homes, hospitals and dental clinics.  At least that is the ambition of a number of people on the present management committee.  While I say that, I am not at all satisfied that these benefits go far enough.  I think that they might be more extensive. It has to be realised that the cash benefits are not to be improved. From what I know of the insured population they would be willing to pay a larger contribution in order to get larger benefit.  Another feature that is very badly wanted in the way of insurance is the merging of workmen's compensation under a proper scheme of national health insurance. The national health suffers very considerably from the absence of compulsory insurance under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  It does occur that workers meet with accidents in their employment and the employers not being insured they are unable to pay compensation.  The workers then fall back on national health insurance, and the payments have to be met out of funds of national health insurance.</P>
    <P>It often occurs that men and women meet with accidents and they have been known to take in settlement lump sums far less than they were entitled to. The society takes up these cases and in a number of cases it has succeeded in substantially increasing the amount already arranged between the insured worker and the employer.  That will show the need for closer association or affiliation between workmen's compensation and national health insurance. Another matter that the Government might devote some attention to is the relationship between unemployment benefit and national health insurance. It has been realised that the amount provided for a man or woman a long time unemployed and drawing unemployment benefit is insufficient to maintain them in normal health.  Any doctor examining a person who has been a long time unemployed, trying to live and maintain a family on the amount allowed under the unemployment <Col N="900" /> scheme, will know that such a person is ill-nourished and not in a sound, healthy condition.  It might be advisable at some stage to merge these two schemes and put them under one head.  Some of us believe that this national health scheme is capable of great development, and capable of conferring much greater benefits than people are able to obtain to-day.  The Parliamentary Secretary in his statement made a reference to the unclaimed sums account and under the Bill he makes arrangements that the Central Fund will get £15,000 per annum from this fund.</P>
    <P>I do not know how he can justify that claim.  That money does not belong to him.  It belongs to people who bought the stamps and failed to put them to the purpose for which they were provided &mdash; that is, to return them to the National Health Insurance Society.  To that extent, the National Health Insurance Society has lost the money, not the Central Fund, and I think it is very unjust to apply £15,000 of that fund to the cost of central administration.  I hope the Minister will explain that unfair seizure of £15,000 which properly belongs to the National Health Insurance Society.</P>
    <P>The amount allocated for administration funds for the society is 4/5 per member.  Out of that already the society has paid the entire compensation of all people dispossessed of their jobs, which ran into a very large sum of money.  In addition to that, they are charged with paying the cost of the buildings in O'Connell Street.  I think they paid somewhere in the neighbourhood of £88,000 of that from the Central Fund.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the enormous drain on the insurance funds, due to disablement benefit.  There is no doubt that there is a very serious drain on the funds of national health insurance, due to disablement of one kind or another.  The society has been extremely active and has done everything in its power to reduce the amount spent on that phase of its activities, but, as things are, it cannot turn down people who are unable to work.  Therefore, these benefits must be paid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="901" /> Generally speaking, the Bill is very welcome, not for what it contains but for what it makes possible in the future.  I hope that the Government will make an effort&mdash;and make it soon &mdash; to co-ordinate and consolidate the Acts governing national health insurance, which are very confusing to the average member of the society.  They are bewildered by all the Acts to which they have to refer and upon which they have to get information.  It is time that these Acts were simplified and consolidated, so that the insurance population would have a proper understanding of the law under which insurance is operated.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible and timely for an extension of national health insurance to be made.  The income limit should be raised.  I do not think that many people would object to coming into the national health insurance scheme now, when extra benefits are available. Heretofore, they did not think it worth their while to come in because of the paltry allowances available.  Now that the amount has been substantially increased, large numbers of people would be willing and anxious to come under the national health insurance scheme.  I hope it will be made possible for them to do so.  I believe it is necessary to extend and develop national health schemes, generally, in this country.  Up to now, the term &ldquo;national health insurance scheme&rdquo; has been a misnomer here.  From now on, I believe that big efforts will be made to improve the health of the members of the society.  With £175,000 available, the members will be able to get special treatment in hospital and convalescent-home treatment &mdash; two very essential features of a national health scheme in any country.  These will be initiated under this scheme of extra benefits.  As regards maternity benefit, I do not know how that is to be dealt with.  We cannot very well give kind; but I suggest that it would be possible to give an extra cash benefit.  At a time like that, extra cash is very necessary and I believe that we ought to encourage the raising of the birth rate. By increasing the maternity benefit, we shall be moving in that direction.  A good deal of money will be spent, I <Col N="902" /> understand, on dentistry; whether there will be enough material or men to work the scheme, I do not know. Optical and specialist treatment will be introduced and, to make these things possible, this Bill is well worth while. I heartily welcome the Bill as a step towards developing a proper system of national health and social insurance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We ought to congratulate the Committee of Management of the National Health Insurance Society on the great efforts they have made in recent years to bring national health to the stage to which they have brought it.  We should also congratulate the Minister and the Government on having acceded to their request to change the law, so as to enable them to enlarge the benefits payable.  There are a few points which I should like to raise, although Senator Foran has covered the ground very well.  I believe that the income-limit, which is at present £150, should be raised to £400 or £500 and, if necessary, that the contribution should be in proportion to the salary received by the person.  If it were not made compulsory, it should, at least, be left <Col N="903" /> optional to any worker in receipt of a salary up to £400 or £500 to become a voluntary subscriber to the National Health Insurance Fund.  As Senator Foran has pointed out, with the increased benefits and with widows' and orphans' pensions, there is a great attraction to many of our workers to come in, and it would be a source of income to the society, because the people in receipt of fairly good salaries would not be liable to be a drain on the society.</P>
      <P>Another point to which I wish to refer is that of money benefits.  At present, a member of the National Health Insurance Society who becomes ill is entitled to benefit of 15/- a week. While, under unemployment insurance, he is entitled to a family allowance, as it were, when he becomes ill there is no allowance made for the family.  I believe in a time of sickness more money is required to keep a person than would be necessary if he was in good health.  But it is also necessary that the family should have some income. There should be a family allowance attached to the benefits, just the same as there is under unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>There is another point.  Where a man is unemployed for a long period, and then probably gets a few weeks' employment, and finds himself suddenly taken ill, he is entitled to no benefit because he is probably in arrears.  That is brought about by unemployment.  I suggest that, where a man is unemployed for a period and gets into arrears for national health insurance, due to unemployment, that that should not be counted, and that an arrangement should be made between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the National Health Insurance Society that that man would not be described as being in arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we have, under this Bill, taken a step in the right direction, and, as Senator Foran has pointed out, it is not so much what the present Act brings about as the opportunity it gives to the National Health Insurance <Col N="904" /> Society to become a real national health organisation.  I suggest that the time is here when we should review the whole health organisation.  I believe that our dispensary districts and doctors have, as it were, outlived their usefulness.  The dispensary districts were set up almost 100 years ago, when transport was not what it would be now if we had normal times.  We have a school medical inspection system carried out, speaking for County Galway, by a county medical officer and an assistant county medical officer. One or other of these medical men visits a school, I understand, about once every three or four years to carry out medical inspection, while at the same time there is in many of these districts a dispensary doctor drawing £360 or probably £400 a year, while the number of red ticket cases he is called upon to attend are in many cases very few.</P>
    <P>I think there is a good deal of waste in the system.  Of course, this is hardly the proper time to raise this matter, but if times were normal, with transport as before the war, with telephone facilities and the progress generally that we have made, there is no necessity for half of the present number of dispensary doctors.  I do not mean to cast aside these medical men and to put them on the unemployment list.  In my opinion, some of them are unemployed as it is, but of course they are drawing salaries.  My idea would be to amalgamate the districts and to put one of these men in each of the amalgamated districts in charge of health, school inspection and such work.  In that way we would make far greater progress.  We know that the county medical officer or his assistant can visit the schools and carry out inspection there only once every three or four years.</P>
    <P>The county medical officer in Galway has applied for an assistant.  I do not believe in assistants, because I think that when one is appointed he believes that the assistant is to do all the work.  We should get rid of the idea of having assistants.  We should have a man in the dispensary districts who <Col N="905" /> would know the family history of the young people there.  We would make far more progress if we developed in that way.  It is something that might be done in the future.  I cannot argue that point now, because transport being what it is, doctors cannot get around for want of petrol.</P>
    <P>Senator Foran has covered the main proposals in the Bill.  We are very proud to know that we have so many members of the Seanad interested, and that they can see the value of the work of the committee of management of the national health insurance.  As a worker I think the workers will appreciate very much what they have done and the great progress they have made.  I know that the committee have been urging this step for a long time and that it is not their fault that these benefits have not been granted before this.</P>
    <P>I urge upon the committee and the Parliamentary Secretary that it is absolutely necessary for dependents to get allowances in case of illness. I do not know why that should not be when it is the case with unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I think the limit of income should be raised to £300 or £400.  In that way you will bring in a greater number of workers, workers who would be a less drain on the society's funds, because the man with a fairly good income is not going to be so liable to sickness, except by reason of his own carelessness, as the man with a smaller income and who is harder worked.</P>
    <P>We have heard the Parliamentary Secretary and we also know from the reports of the National Health Society that a big drain on their funds is brought about by so many people malingering, as they term it.  Here again the real cause of the drain may be laid at the doors of medical men. I do not like to be too hard on them, but we see when we look up the accounts that they have drawn from national health insurance £60,000.  I know that one man did not get it all and that it probably went to many, but that is what they have got for issuing certificates.  In the actuary's report one sees that people malinger longer <Col N="906" /> here than across the water.  I wonder would that have any relation to the number of certificates issued by doctors?  I believe that that system should be abolished.  After all, if a dispensary doctor is in receipt of £300 or £400 a year in a dispensary district, I fail to see why it should be necessary for him to receive any fee for issuing certificates in connection with injured workers.</P>

      <P>I have very little to say in reference to this measure.  It has of course all the faults of legislation of this kind, legislation by reference.  It is very difficult to go through all the various Acts, which this Act amends, to find out the true meaning of some of the matters embodied in this piece of legislation. There was one matter to which I was anxious to hear the Parliamentary Secretary make some reference but he did not.  I remember some years ago great difficulty was experienced in respect to people who went across to England and who later when they came back ill to this country were seeking benefit here.  Most people do not understand the regulations in respect to national health insurance as thoroughly as they should.  A person who is insured here who goes across to England in many cases does not notify his or her society that they are going to England.  Their cards are collected in England and given to some society there.  Their membership of the society here lapses after a year or so and when they claim benefit they cannot get it either from the society in England or the society here.  At least two or three years ago that was the position.  I have come across several cases of very great hardship in which people could not get benefits to which they were entitled either from the society here or some society in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like if some consideration were given to that aspect of the problem because, if all we hear is true, from 50,000 to 80,000 people have gone across to England in the last 12 months, and it may well be that in a short time we shall have an unusual demand made on the societies here and in England. Possibly the society here or the Government <Col N="907" /> has anticipated that development and made some arrangements to deal with it, but if that has not been done this would be a very suitable time to embody some provision of that kind in this measure.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary would be over anxious to come to this House again with a supplementary measure in the next 12 months simply to deal with a matter of that kind.  When a person gets ill in England he is very anxious to come home for treatment as he would be likely to get better consideration from his family and neighbours than on the other side.  I think this is an important point.  I do not know whether it has been anticipated or not but if I am not anticipated I suggest that this would be a very good time to make some attempt to deal with the matter.  Whether the Department will deal directly with the Department in England or whether the society will be able to attend to it, it is a matter that is clamouring for consideration if some steps have not been already taken to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with my colleague, Senator Foran, in congratulating the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary on their courage and initiative in introducing this Bill.  In particular I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the masterly statement with which he introduced the Bill on Second Reading in the other House. Though I myself have been associated &mdash; at one remove &mdash; with national health insurance, since it was first made part and parcel of our social system some 30 years ago, and more directly since the Government did me the honour of associating me with Senators Dr. Rowlette and Foran as trustees of the Unified Society about six years ago, I must confess that I never got such an unclouded vision of the very complicated and elaborate financial system on which national health insurance was based until I studied&mdash;I use the word advisedly &mdash; in the Dáil Debates the Parliamentary Secretary's introductory statement.  I studied it very carefully and for the first time I felt that if I <Col N="908" /> would not get full marks in an examination on the subject, I could claim that I might come nearer to an honours marking than ever before.  One must have some grasp of the financial structure of the previous Acts and the circumstances which made them fundamental to our system of national health insurance, to understand the full significance of the Bill we are now considering.  This is a very modest and unpretentious Bill &mdash; the Parliamentary Secretary rightly described it as a short Bill of 16 sections &mdash; but it is a bold measure inasmuch as it does something that has not been done in this country since the national health insurance was initiated.  It represents a beneficent revolution to that extent. The full implications of that &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; have been explained by the Parliamentary Secretary.  May I sum it up for ordinary people like myself by saying that it releases the living present from the stranglehold of a problematic future?</P>
      <P>We have often heard of the clutch of a dead hand.  In a system of national health insurance, which had more thought for the theoretical &ldquo;last man&rdquo; than the actual men and women of the present, there is something more throttling than the clutch of a dead hand, the clutch of a hand yet unformed in the womb of time.  The object of the Bill is to give the men and women whose contributions have built up the substantial funds of our National Health Insurance Society, the full benefit of those contributions or, at least, as full benefit as possible while fully safeguarding the financial stability and solidity of the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The departure from the hitherto accepted system would not have been possible had it not been that in this State there is only one approved society through which, to use Deputy Norton's striking phrase, &ldquo;the insurable section of the Irish race has to filter itself,&rdquo; and which acquires from that fact an assurance of permanence, coterminous with the Irish race itself, at least as long as it makes health insurance a part of its social system. This means that there is no theoretical &ldquo;last man&rdquo; to queer the pitch for all <Col N="909" /> his predecessors.  The Bill is, therefore, to a certain extent a complement to the Unification Act of 1933 and it has particular importance as a justification of that Act.  It is a justification of the courage and the vision which the Government showed on that occasion when, in spite of strenuous opposition, it merged all the societies in the State into one.  Under the old system it was only selected societies, favourably circumstanced and capably managed, who could give their members additional benefits.  Of the other 85, some were in such a parlous condition that their ability to continue the payment of even the statutory benefits was problematic.  That was a cause of great injustice to the ordinary insured person.  They had all to pay the same contributions but it depended on the society to which they belonged whether they would get their full benefits, additional benefits or even have an assurance of the statutory benefit, without levy.  Now, owing to the way things have worked out, every insured person who is a member of the National Health Society can be sure of all benefits, statutory and additional, to which his contribution record makes him entitled.  We have compulsory national health insurance by one society that is obviously in a highly favoured position. But that would not count if it were not carefully managed, and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary can corroborate the tribute paid to the management by Senator Foran.</P>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary, when he made the necessary preliminary inquiries, must have assured himself that the society was well and carefully managed.  The staff officers are senior members of a very fine body of men and women.  They were recruited, I think I may say without exception, from the cream of the older societies, and a secretary of brilliant ability, and an assistant secretary of rare competence and experience; have given of their best.  Everybody connected with the society will agree with me in saying that the society owes its best achievements to its chairman, Most Rev. Dr. Dignan.  His Lordship, persuaded <Col N="910" /> that national health insurance properly adjusted to the characteristics and needs of the country, can be made a great instrument for securing the health and well-being of the nation, has thought it not inconsistent with the duties and character of a patriotic Irish Bishop to devote to the society an amount of time, energy, labour and thought, involving great personal sacrifices, which the nation can never repay.</P>
    <P>The House will be glad to know that, associated with the Bishop of Clonfert, as chairman, is the vice-chairman, Dr. Rowlette.  It is not necessary in this House to stress the great ability and great sense of public service and integrity that Dr. Rowlette has brought to the society.  These men have been a wonderful combination, and we have now come to the stage when we can congratulate ourselves.  It is true that we have a long way to go before we can make the vision of these men a beneficent reality &mdash; this is only a step to it.  But the National Health Insurance Society that we are now considering has been released from its fetters, and is free to make its way to the splendid goal which these men have set before them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to take up the time of the House for many minutes in joining with other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  In fact, Senator Foran in his speech covered the ground clearly and comprehensively. What I have to say is rather to emphasise some of his points, or to underline some of his suggestions, than to add anything fresh to the discussion. Many people may ask &mdash; and the Parliamentary Secretary has met them in advance &mdash; whether this scheme is financially secure.  They will suggest, and some have suggested, no doubt, that to leave the actuarial system on which national health insurance both in this country and in Great Britain has been carried out for some 30 years, indicates some lack of success in carrying on the scheme, and suggests that, possibly, there may be a financial difficulty somewhere that has to be met by making the financial restrictions somewhat less <Col N="911" /> rigid than they were.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary has made it clear that there is no financial risk in accepting the scheme put forward in this Bill.  Each scheme of benefits will be prepared for a period of five years, and for five years only, depending strictly on the actuarial report as to the actual sum of money which can be available for that five years, on the basis of the five years' previous work.  That renders it impossible for the scheme to bankrupt itself, or to risk the society in any way.  It substitutes a scheme based on the living financial position of the society, for a scheme built on actuarial ideals which, as Senator Mrs. Concannon has just said, and as experience has proved, tied the living members of the society by unnecessary fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one point in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement over which I was a little puzzled.  I understood him to say that the State will continue to contribute two-ninths of the money expended by the society on administration and benefits.  I cannot very well reconcile his statement with the provision in Section 7, clause 3, which appropriates to the State a sum not exceeding £15,000 per year from the unclaimed stamps fund. Hitherto the unclaimed stamps fund has been like Mahomet's coffin, suspended between Heaven and earth, and not really accessible to anybody.  Now it is taken, as regards £15,000, if such is available, as a contribution towards the State's expenses &mdash; not a contribution from the insurance fund, but a contribution which will lessen the amount contributable by the State each year to the society.  It seems to me to interfere with what has always been one of the fundamental financial principles of the Act, since, over 30 years ago, it was laid down that two-ninths of the money spent on benefits and administration should come from the State.  In future, the unclaimed stamp fund, which has accumulated almost by accident for the purpose of insurance, will not go direct into the funds, and will not go to this Society for its work, but is to diminish the <Col N="912" /> amount contributed by the State. These funds do not come from the State.  They are not public funds in the sense of being funds credited to the State, and it seems to me that the State has a certain responsibility in departing from what has hitherto been the fundamental condition of contributing two-ninths to the fund for benefit and administration.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will reconsider this section, and see whether he can return to what has been hitherto the financial basis of benefit expenditure and administration expenditure.</P>
    <P>He said, too, that the entire expense of certification was borne by the State. Not being familiar with the actual details of that, it surprises me, as it was understood that for some years past a certain contribution was made by the Society towards the expenses of certification.  I am not challenging the Minister on that, because he knows, and I am only speaking from memory, which may have misled me.</P>
    <P>Senator Foran has suggested and outlined very generally what it is hoped to be able to provide if this Bill meets with your approval.  He expressed an opinion in favour of an increase in the cash benefit which is given in the case of maternity.  I would like to associate myself with that.  I was rather disappointed in the debate in the Dáil recently, when I think the Parliamentary Secretary said that he was not sympathetic regarding the increase of cash benefits at all&mdash;I may be wrong, but I understand that was the general impression left by his utterances on that topic&mdash;and that the Government did not think it well to increase the cash benefits.  I do not understand the reason for that.  It seems to me that cash benefits which may have been considered fair and justifiable 30 years ago have lost a great deal of their values to-day.</P>
    <P>The cash benefit which, let us say, in the first years of the Insurance Act of 1912 or 1913, might have provided a fair and reasonable amount of comfort or amenities for the woman who drew the benefit or whose husband was entitled to the benefit, cannot bring anything like as good a return to-day. Therefore, there is no logical reason <Col N="913" /> why there should be &mdash; if there is to be &mdash; a ban put on the increase of cash benefits.  It might be asked why we should not increase the benefit in some other way by providing necessities or benefits in kind for the woman at this time, which is always one of difficulty and, amongst most insured people, one of financial stress.  If one gives that a little consideration, one finds that the administrative difficulty would be so enormous as to make it impracticable. I think it would lead to grave abuse and grave discontent, owing to the inequalities which would arise from the practical difficulties.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us that, as it is the Minister's duty to approve or disapprove of such schemes, the Minister is not determined to disapprove of such a scheme if it be put forward.</P>
    <P>At the outset of his speech Senator Foran said that this Bill is a step forward. It is a step forward and a very important one.  It releases the system of national health insurance from the bands which tied it too tightly and hampered its development, and gives it an opportunity to develop as never before.  But we should remember that it is only one step forward. Senator Foran has pointed out that there are many ways in which national health insurance may be developed.  I agree with him entirely that, up to the present, although it is called national health insurance, it has not been in a position to do anything towards the care or improvement of the health of the people.  It is true that, for some years, in the early years of national health insurance, it extended to treatment of tuberculous patients, and in that respect only it was concerned with the improvement of the health of the people.  That function was &mdash; quite rightly, I agree &mdash; shifted from the national health insurance scheme to the local authorities and became part of the general public scheme for the treatment of tuberculosis.  I am not sure that certain funds from the national health insurance moneys do not find their way to the local authorities who carry out these schemes of treatment of tuberculosis. If that is so, it would <Col N="914" /> seem that the members of the society are contributing twice over to the expense of the tuberculosis schemes throughout the country.  They are contributing in their ordinary capacity as ratepayers, bearing their share of the burden on the rates, and they are contributing also as members of the society.  That is a point which should be cleared up.</P>
    <P>I am entirely in agreement with Senator Foran and others who have suggested that the care of health should be a proper part of any scheme of national health insurance.  It may be remembered that, when the National Health Insurance Bill was first brought in in Great Britain in 1911, it was proposed to include this country in the same scheme, word for word as it would apply to Great Britain.  It was quite clear to those who gave it thought, that a scheme based on a purely British &mdash; and local, in that sense &mdash; scheme was not necessarily the best scheme for us, and great opposition was put forward in this country to the application of the scheme to Ireland.</P>
    <P>As a consequence, the scheme for medical treatment disappeared when the scheme was applied to Ireland. That was in fact the acceptance by the British Government of the day of the expression of public opinion in Ireland from very varied classes of people.  It was the official attitude adopted by the then Irish National Party, it was adopted by chambers of commerce and other such bodies who may be taken as representing employers, and it also received the support of the Catholic Bishops in meeting assembled.  Whether these bodies were wise in opposing that part of the Bill or not is not worth inquiring into now, but it was the wish of the country that that part should be dropped and it was dropped.</P>
    <P>Shortly afterwards, an investigation was made to try to find some other scheme which might be applied to this country instead of that applied to Great Britain.  The investigation did not proceed any further than the report of the Committee, but twice later <Col N="915" /> the country more seriously investigated this problem.  The Irish Public Health Council, which was appointed in 1919 and reported in the following year &mdash; of course, under the old régime&mdash;recommended the establishment of a national medical service which should embrace in its functions the medical treatment of insured persons and also embody or take over the existing public medical services of the country, poor law medical services and so on.  That received pretty generous support but, when the report of that Council appeared in the summer of 1920, it was quite impossible to get clear consideration of a constructive improvement.</P>
    <P>A few years later, in 1924, the then Minister for Finance appointed a committee, under the chairmanship of Professor Magennis, to investigate the whole system of the medical services of Eire and, after consideration lasting some two years, it recommended a scheme very similar to that which the Irish Public Health Council had recommended six years before.  It was postponed on account of the expense that would be involved, and it has never risen for consideration since then.  It also provided a comprehensive scheme of medical treatment and a public health service. In 1929, I think, when the Government of the day brought in the National Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, one of no very great scope, one of the speakers on the Front Opposition Bench opposed the Bill.  In fact, I think he moved its rejection. At any rate, he very strongly opposed the Bill, or any Bill claiming to reform national health insurance unless it included medical benefit.</P>
    <P>That gentleman when he moved across the House and was in the more responsible position of Minister for Local Government and Public Health brought in a further National Health Insurance Bill in 1933 which is now law and as far as it goes I think a very good Act.  I agree with what has been said by Senator Foran and Senator Mrs. Concannon as to the great improvement in the system since that Bill has been working, from 1934 or <Col N="916" /> thereabouts.  We cannot rest content with any scheme of national health insurance which does not deal much more radically and thoroughly with the question of the care of health and of the general health of the country than has been done in the past or even could be done on the strength of the Bill now before the House.  It must go much further and take the whole problem into its purview.</P>
    <P>Much could have been learned three years ago from schemes at work in other countries, although to what extent they are at work now God only knows.  Much could have been learned from schemes in operation on the Continent, in countries such as Czecho-Slovakia and other continental countries.  More could have been learned that would be suitable for adoption here from some of the foreign schemes than could have been learned from the system which was worked in England for the last 30 years.  One would have hoped, but for the events of the last few years, that before now the Government might have appointed a small commission, some foreign experts and some people with expert knowledge of this country, who could have prepared a comprehensive scheme for consideration by the Government. That, of course, is out of the question for the present, and that is the reason that the present Act, which is a good Act within its limits, falls short of what anybody who is interested in the topic would have considered proper and necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Foran made some very sound, and I believe healthy recommendations, that national health insurance should be closely associated with other forms of social insurance. He did not try to suggest the machinery nor do I.  He suggested that there should be close association with other forms of insurance and that we might have a whole system of social insurance that would deal with questions of health and with closely allied questions, such as workmen's compensation, out of work grants, and so on.  In that I have no doubt we would be following the system in so far as it has been operated in other <Col N="917" /> countries where more attention has been paid to this matter than we have paid to it or indeed than we have had an opportunity of paying to it. I welcome the Bill, and like my colleagues connected with the Society I am grateful to the Government for having brought it forward.  It is a useful Bill.  It promises much better service than we have had in the past, but it is by no means the thoroughgoing measure we would like to see.</P>
    <P>There have been some comments made about abuses in connection with the present scheme.  I can assure the House that the Society, as regards both its officials and the committee of management, is well aware of some of these abuses and does its best to check them.  The difficulties, however, are very great.  People are sometimes out of work for a long period and they fall into bad health and they properly and legally claim national health insurance benefit.  Some may claim benefit who are not so entitled. These people are receiving the constant attention of the officials of the society as well as of the Committee of Management.  I want to say this with a sense of responsibility, that the State, the public and the Society have not received from certain district justices the support they are entitled to receive in the carrying out of the law in regard to national health insurance.</P>
    <P>There have been cases of non-compliance with the Act where people who were legally bound to insure have not done so, and cases where employers have not stamped cards.  When these cases come before the courts they have been treated as if they were trivial.  Perhaps I should not say that so broadly, because there are justices who carry out the law, but there are many other justices who do not treat the law in these cases with respect, and bring it into contempt by the trivial penalties they impose, where penalties are imposed at all. One case of a deliberate fraud was brought into a District Court in which a woman had not attended for examination for a certificate but had been impersonated by someone else.  As well as I remember a healthy daughter was <Col N="918" /> impersonated by her aged mother, who was not insurable.  Either no penalty was imposed or it was a contemptuous one showing that the offence was not regarded seriously.  The district justice made the remark that this woman was only acting in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am not quoting actual words used, but the justice said that the Constitution laid it down that the interests of the family came first.  It was enough to excuse or justify such an offence as was committed by this woman who was so devoted to her daughter.  That sort of thing happening in the courts brings the law into contempt and increases very much the lack of respect for law among people who may think they will benefit to some extent by what they consider to be petty frauds and what the district justice may think to be petty fraud.  I do not think the Government have any control over the sayings and judgments of these district justices but if they have any control in this respect it should be exercised very rigidly.  The society and the State should be put into a position that they could look to the district justices for the proper and rigid carrying out of the law in cases of this kind.  I am glad that this Bill has been brought forward and I am glad, as far as one can judge, that the House does not show any hostile or critical attitude towards it. I would like it to go further and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will go further in one respect than I understood him to go from the attitude taken up in the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as there has been any criticism of the Bill, I think it has been effectively answered by some of the speakers.  In fact, there has not been very much criticism. There has been little or no criticism of the Bill in so far as its terms are concerned. The debate has ranged over a very wide field, embracing the entire social services.  That, of course, is a very interesting subject, but I do not know that a Bill such as this is the proper occasion on which to embark on a full discussion of our entire social services.  To begin with, some of the social services that were mentioned <Col N="919" /> here by Senators in the course of this debate are administered by other Departments.  Unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, employers' liability in so far as the State has any functions in relation to it, belong, in the main, to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I quite appreciate that that is a condition of things that many Senators desire to terminate.  The idea permeating the debate to-day apparently aims at the establishment of a social service department, whereunder all the social services would be co-ordinated and administered, with one Ministerial head.  I do not think that, on this Bill, we can usefully pursue the discussion of that very big subject.  We are all agreed upon one thing &mdash; that this Bill is a considerable advance on the present position, that it opens up new possibilities of a far-reaching character in so far as the provision of treatment for insured persons who are in ill-health is concerned, and that it is a necessary preliminary step, at any rate, to any of the further desirable developments Senators have in mind, just as unification was a necessary preliminary step to the step we are taking to-day.</P>
      <P>Senators might reasonably say that there has been a very long distance between these two steps.  There has, and all I can say in that regard is that I hope the distance between the step we are taking to-day and the next important step will not be as great as that was.  The experiment of unification has been very encouraging.  Without unification, I could not come before the House with these legislative proposals.  More than that, were it not for the ability and enthusiasm which the committee of management, from the Most Reverend Doctor Dignan, chairman, down to the members of the Committee of Management, and the staff of the unified society, brought to bear upon their work, making the unified society the undoubted success it has been, I could not appear before you with a Bill such as this.  The least I can do is to pay that tribute to the most reverend chairman, the members of the committee and their staff for the excellent work they have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> Senator Foran was the first to complain about the terms of Section 7 of the Bill.  Under Section 7, up to £15,000 is to be paid to the Exchequer from the unclaimed stamps account.  In the event of the amount accruing to the unclaimed stamps account being less than £15,000, the State will get the amount accruing.  If that amount be £5,000, the State will get the £5,000; if it be £10,000, the State will get the £10,000.  But if the amount in the unclaimed stamps account exceeds £15,000, the excess will go to the reserve fund set up under Section 6.  The average amount accruing to the unclaimed stamps account in recent years has been about £17,000, so that it can be assumed, if that rate can be relied upon, that, approximately, £2,000 would ordinarily be available for this reserve fund, after making an Appropriation-in-Aid of £15,000. Senators ask why this payment should be made at all to the State, why the State should not bear the full cost of the additional benefits.  They think that the State should make its two-ninths contribution to the ordinary benefits and its two-ninths contribution to the additional benefits.  That is a good enough debating point.  It is very easy to say that the State should give this amount, but Senators should realise that there is a limit to the State's resources, and that we have been increasing our expenditure on social services to a very great extent during the past ten years.  Even on this particular social service &mdash; national health insurance&mdash;the estimated nett expenditure for 1942-43, if this Bill becomes law, is £35,000 in excess of the expenditure in 1931-32.  Senators may say that the State can find money for other things, and may ask why it cannot find money for health insurance purposes.  It is, however, very hard to get agreement when it comes to a question of selecting services upon which expenditure can be curtailed.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that the Exchequer contribution to national health insurance for 1942-3 is estimated at £360,000.  That is a very substantial amount and it is not unreasonable to make an Appropriation-in-Aid of the Exchequer of £15,000 when we consider <Col N="921" /> that, in respect of two items outside health insurance services proper&mdash;Posts and Telegraphs and Stationery and Printing &mdash; the cost to the Exchequer is £15,900 per annum.  Apart from that, it should be borne in mind that the Exchequer could, with reason, argue that it ought to be relieved to a much greater extent, in present circumstances, than is represented by this small sum of £15,000 per annum.  Let us not forget that, when the State originally undertook to pay two-ninths of the cost of the benefits and their administration, we were operating under a system of finance that is being abandoned under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the system of finance that we are now abandoning a certain proportion of the contribution income had to be set aside for the purpose of servicing the reserve values redemption and interest fund.  These reserve values represented the liability the society undertook in respect of its members. The State would be entitled to contend, now that we are abandoning the redemption of reserve values, abandoning the reserve value system entirely, that it would be entitled to be relieved of the contribution that it made towards the finances of the national health insurance in order to make up for the deduction from the contribution income which was found necessary to service the reserve values. I have no enthusiasm for defending the Exchequer in this particular regard, I confess, but when the matter is raised it is my business to draw the attention of the House to the case that the Exchequer could make, not for relief to the extent of £15,000, but relief to a very much greater extent.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins raised some interesting points that are a fair distance outside the scope of the Bill but, in so far as I can, I will refer to some of them.  He raised the question of increasing the income limit and the provision of family allowances.  Now, personally I have no fundamental objection at all to raising the income limit but it seems to me, and I will ask Senators who are interested in this question to devote their thoughts to it, <Col N="922" /> that if you are going to increase the income limit to £400 or £500, instead of having the limit of £250, you must at the same time increase the amount of benefit available.  Senators will appreciate that, if we are to bring into insurance benefit people with an earning capacity of say £10 a week, there is not much use in providing 15/- a week benefit for them at the time they are ill.  If we are going to branch out in that direction then we must, as a logical sequel to it, adopt the principle of relating the amount of benefit to the income, and that opens up another very big field.</P>
    <P>On the question of family allowances much the same line of argument might be pursued.  It would be very desirable. I have no hesitation at all in agreeing that, when the breadwinner is ill, 15/- a week cannot possibly maintain himself and his dependents or even maintain himself if he had no dependents, but I do not think that national health insurance was ever intended to maintain a breadwinner and his dependents during his illness. If that principle is to be adopted, clearly in an insurance scheme benefit must be related to the premium and premium to the benefit.  Within the financial foundation of national health insurance under the present scheme we cannot provide £1 a week or 25/- a week for a bread-winner or 2/6 or 3/- a week for each dependent.  It just cannot be done within the present framework.  If the people interested, the contributing parties, the National Health Insurance Society, the State, the insured persons, and the employers, come along and say they will go 50-50 or 33? in this matter, if agreement is reached on these principles you will find me in a very receptive mood, but I am afraid it is a fairly thorny problem with so many interests involved.</P>
    <P>The same argument applies to the abolition of the arrears penalty.  Any interference with the financial framework as it stands at present to the detriment of the funds of the society must carry with it the corollary that someone has to pay.  The money to recoup the society must be found somewhere if you are going to deprive the society of part of its <Col N="923" /> income by one method or another.  I was surprised to hear Senator Hawkins, who lives in the country, say that the dispensary system had more or less outlived its usefulness.  Speaking with considerable knowledge of the dispensary system both as an administrator and as a man who actually operated it for a number of years, I am not prepared to agree with Senator Hawkins at all in that matter. I do not know what volume of agreement I might get on that in this House. My deliberate view is that our dispensary medical service is streets ahead of the medical service of the panel system in England.  That is probably another of these matters we could argue a good deal about, but I speak from experience inside the system and looking on from outside also.</P>
    <P>He also made a point which one would have some difficulty in relating to this Bill, namely, that doctors under the Medical Charities Act do not appear to have much to do.  He bases that conclusion on the sparsity of red tickets.  I only want to answer the point because it has been made, not because it is related to the Bill, and I want to say that in many districts the number of tickets is no reflection on the amount of work a doctor does. Doctors as a general body are a kindly class of people taking them all round.</P>

      <P>Very often people who are entitled to treatment under the Medical Charities Act come to a doctor and ask him to go out in a hurry.  Not nine cases out of ten are urgent, but the unfortunate people think they are <Col N="924" /> urgent and that is the main thing. Nine out of ten of the doctors who go out will not bother whether they get a red ticket at all.  The ticket should be presented in all cases even before the doctor attends, but I am glad that in urgent cases the other system obtains.  Senator Hawkins made another suggestion and I was rather surprised that Senator Rowlette did not refer to it.  Perhaps he missed it, but he does not miss much.  His statement conveyed to me the suggestion that medical certifiers were induced to certify by the fact that they were going to get paid so much per certificate. That is not a fair suggestion either, and is not consistent with the facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that Senator Hawkins made it and I mentioned that I was surprised that Senator Rowlette did not advert to it and defend the doctors, when he was speaking.  It is not part of my business, nor do I look upon it as a special duty by any means, to defend the doctors but I like fair play.  It has not been my experience, at any rate, that doctors are induced to certify by the knowledge that they will be paid per certificate and that the more certificates they are able to send in, the bigger the cheque they will receive at the end of the quarter. I do not think that is the determining factor at all.  I should be very sorry to think it was.  Again, I speak with the practical knowledge of a man who was a medical certifier for 18 years in different areas, urban and rural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind Senator Hawkins or any other Senator in this House who may be thinking on similar lines, that the doctor is very often confronted with a very difficult social problem.  I would ask him to bear in mind that when the bread-winner is unemployed and when he lacks for his dependents perhaps the necessaries of life, what might be a very minor ailment in normal circumstances assumes abnormal proportions. <Col N="925" /> The doctor has to deal with a very big psychological problem when these people come along for certificates.  He knows if an unfortunate man comes to him for a certificate, that he would not be trying to draw 15/- a week sickness benefit if he could earn £2 a week at work.  The man tells you that he has lumbago.  It is usually lumbago, muscular rheumatism or influenza. These are the popular diseases.  You do not know whether he has or not. How on earth would you know?  There are things that doctors do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There are&mdash;not many.  At any rate, the doctor knows that the man is in a miserable condition, physically and mentally.  He knows that somebody must maintain him and that he must become a charge either on this particular social service or on some other, and the doctor says: &ldquo;If you tell me that you have such a pain in your back, that you are not able to stoop to lace your boots, I am not going to certify that you have not.&rdquo; Senators may be very critical of that attitude but, at the same time, realising all the factors entering into that social problem that confronts that doctor when he is asked to certify, I cannot find it in my heart to say that he is doing very much wrong when he gives the insured person the benefit of the doubt, so long as there is a genuine doubt in his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Rowlette, I think, misunderstood me.  He understood me to say that the State paid the whole of the medical certification cost.  If I conveyed that, I did not intend to convey it.  The State pays the whole of the cost of the district medical referee scheme.  As to the point that Senator Rowlette has stressed more than once in regard to my attitude towards cash benefit as additional benefit, I do not know whether Senator Rowlette read the debate in the Dáil on this Bill, but I do not recollect stating that I was definitely and unalterably opposed to cash benefit as additional benefit.  But I do want to say &mdash; and I believe I said <Col N="926" /> it in the Dáil &mdash; that if I had a limited amount of money at my disposal &mdash; and the amount of money at our disposal at the moment is limited&mdash;I would prefer to devote that money to making the sick bread-winner fit to work. I would prefer to apply it to providing specialist treatment, if he requires specialist treatment, than to giving him additional cash benefit and leaving him untreated.  I do not think that Senator Rowlette will find any fault with that approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>The last point of real importance dealt with by Senator Rowlette was the question of medical benefits.  He very adroitly for a man who is not a politician&mdash;of course Senator Rowlette is not that&mdash;reminded us of a statement made by a member of the Government when we were in Opposition. I suppose most people have had the experience of making a statement at some time or other that had to be modified in the course of time and in the light of experience but, on the question of medical benefits as a principle, I think we are at one all the time.  Again, it is a question of how medical benefit can be provided with real advantage to the general community, but particularly to the insured sections of it.  As I stated in the Dáil on this question, the provision of medical benefits for the insured person alone has no attraction whatever for me, none at all.  I cannot see that it is any improvement on the present position to provide that either the dispensary doctor or some other doctor will be called in to attend the insured person when he is ill, if the dispensary doctor has to be called in and the Medical Charities Act availed of, when the wife or the children are ill.  That is getting you nowhere.  In my judgment, there is no use in providing medical benefit for the insured person unless that medical benefit can be extended to his family as well.</P>
    <P>Again this question is not just as simple as it looks.  Neither can I see any great advantage to the insured person or to anybody else, to superimpose a new service on the service <Col N="927" /> that is there already.  It is true there is a sentimental prejudice against the Medical Charities Act, but I think it is equally true that good service is provided &mdash; a good public health service &mdash; under and through the Medical Charities Act.  Therefore, we do not seem to be getting anywhere, in fact, we would appear to be heading towards a waste of money if we superimpose on top of the Medical Charities Act and the dispensary service already provided, a service that is new in name only.  And why is it new in name only? For the reason that in rural Ireland at any rate &mdash; and rural Ireland constitutes a very big geographical area of the whole of Ireland &mdash; you will have only one doctor available.  He is the dispensary doctor; and if the insured person or insured person's dependents can have his services at the present time under the dispensary system, surely it is not going to improve matters for anybody to have him called in as an insurance doctor instead of a dispensary doctor so long as the service remains the same.  I cannot see much in it.</P>
    <P>Senator Rowlette's approach to it is, if it could be done, probably the most logical solution and the best, but then again it becomes a matter of money &mdash; to co-ordinate all our medical services, to merge medical benefits and the additional benefits of national health insurance in our medical services.  If the public health service was not a complete State medical service it would be a modified State medical service.  In that direction there is scope for thought.  It is quite possible that a scheme could be evolved for a modified State medical service that might not, when all items of expenditure are taken into account, increase the burden by a staggering amount.  But that is a big question, and the furthest I can go now in a discussion of that question is to say that it is a matter that is well worthy of serious and careful consideration. Along those lines there might be scope for further development.</P>

      <P>In continuing the debate on this motion I feel like a man who had been very angry.  I feel like that in regard to Senator Cummins. He made me frightfully angry with his remarks in regard to this motion, but my anger having subsided in the meantime, what I have to say would have been more effective if I had spoken when he made his speech.  We are going to have a considerable debate on finance, I imagine, in the near future, and I hope that the Senators will have some regard for reason and reality.  I have a copy of the Debates here.  Senator Cummins talked about an enormous sum of money, £180,000,000 looking for investment abroad; that now was the time to invest it in our own country, and secure credits on the strength of the nation.  He continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Even one twentieth part or less of those millions, lent to the nation at 1 per cent., which would be a working cost on such an amount and would set up agriculture&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Why, it does not make good English. What does he mean by saying it would cost only 1 per cent.?  Does he mean it would cost the banks only 1 per cent. to lend money?  He says, &ldquo;the working cost&rdquo;.  The working cost of what?</P>

They have to maintain services and pay salaries&mdash;and increasing salaries, as a result of a detailed inquiry recently.  Senator Cummins goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a tragedy that £180,000,000 of our money should be under lock and key waiting for 10 per cent., 15 per cent., or 20 per cent., gross interest, while lending it would cost <Col N="931" /> only 1 per cent. and would help the nation.  Where did he get those fantastic figures?  Does he suggest that banks are lending at 10 or 20 per cent.?  I rather understand the Senator suggested that the banks are holding money, waiting for 10, 15, or 20 per cent., where the working cost of that money is 1 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">

      <P>That may be so, but the implication is that the banks are to lend this money, bulging out of their pockets, at 1 per cent., instead of holding it for 10, 15 or 20 per cent. The thing is so fantastic that I do not propose to pursue it any further.  I hope that if, in the near future, there is a very prolonged debate on finance, we will get down to reality and not have these wild and fantastic statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the motion itself, I think we all have every sympathy with the desire to pay a living wage to our agricultural workers, and I feel, with Senator Johnston and others, that there is great scope for improved technique in our agricultural matters.  There is very great difference between theoretically improved technique and the practical work on the farm.  This must be approached very carefully and with regard to practical experience.  Any of us who have farms and who have been attracted by modern methods have suffered.  Following the lines of improved technique, and many of the things experts advocated, has had disastrous results.  I have heard a shrewd farmer say: &ldquo;If you want a farm to give a profit, you will keep near the ground, without departing from the method the man who is making his living on the farm adopts and which he has not seen fit to change.&rdquo;  I have yet to see people, other than certain lucky individuals, who have ever been able to improve on the recognised methods of the men who have been born and bred on the <Col N="932" /> land and who have had to make their own living by it.</P>
    <P>You can make progress by education and example.  When it comes to the question of example, I feel that the Government is to blame in two respects. It has steadily set its face against experimental farms on a profit and loss basis.  I know that we have experimental farms which do research in seeds and methods of plant cultivation, and manurial experiments, but the Government has always refused to face up to the demand for a farm which is under Government control and run to pay, where the accounts are published, and where you can say to the farmer: &ldquo;Come along; here are the books; here is the 5, 10 or 20 per cent on capital. We have men doing it, who have been trained in agricultural colleges, and here is what they can do.&rdquo;  The Government always has hesitated to do that, and until they have shown what can be done on a profit and loss basis, people will hesitate to be pioneers.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I am forced to admit that if, by some occult process, you could remove the population of this country, age for age and sex for sex, and transplant them to Denmark, and replace them by the Danes, the Danes would get more profit and far greater production out of our resources than we do.  It is one thing to deal with this on a purely imaginative basis, and another to deal with it on a purely practical basis such as people have here.  I hesitate to accept the view that merely to adopt the theoretical methods given by experts will put the farmer in a position to pay wages which are really due to people who have to work on the land.  I hope that, in the course of time and by education, the younger generation coming along in the agricultural community will be able to obtain higher wages, which must come out of the profits made by the owner of the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister for Agriculture speaking on this debate, it seemed to me that he tried to impress on us that we would be violating the territory of the Agricultural Wages Board and the Agricultural <Col N="933" /> Wages Committees if we were to pass this motion.  I do not take that view at all.  I think it gives us an opportunity, and that the Seanad is not only entitled to give an opinion but that it is its duty to give an opinion, on a matter of such great national and social importance as is embodied in this motion.  Moreover, when we passed a motion a few weeks ago raising the price of wheat from 45/- to 50/- a barrel, and made it obligatory, I think it is logical that we should adopt a motion such as this.  Part of the increase rightly should go to the people who will earn it&mdash;the agricultural labourers.  Moreover, it would be impossible to make wheat-growing obligatory unless we pay them an adequate wage.  Therefore, when we passed the first motion, we cannot escape the consequences, and we ought to pass this motion, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the position of the wives of agricultural workers.  They are doing a great national service.  The business of rearing children for the State is the greatest industry the State has and these particular children are of great importance to the nation.  They are the future agricultural workers.  Unless we have a good supply of agricultural workers we cannot carry on this fundamental national industry.  We cannot do it even now, if we continue to pay wages which will not show a reasonable comparison with those paid in countries competing with us at the present moment for our supplies of land workers.  Outsiders are competing with us for the labour and they are paying more than can be earned here. Therefore, we must raise our price.  It is a matter of expediency that we should pay a reasonable wage but also justice demands it.  The agricultural worker is a skilled man.  It has taken a great many generations to produce an efficient agricultural worker, although we may talk about it being done by quick methods.  I was born in a small village in which were many agricultural labourers and I know the pitiable circumstances under which they lived.  I learned to have a great regard for the worker and for his knowledge of agriculture, and especially <Col N="934" /> to have a great regard for his wife who has to keep a family clothed and fed by superhuman efforts.  I am glad that this motion calls not only for increased wages but improved conditions for agricultural workers.  It is absolutely necessary if we are going to make this State what we hope it to be, that we should have the fundamental industry in a sound position.  That cannot be done unless the agricultural workers are given a wage that will enable them to provide for themselves, their wives and families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>The part of the country from which I come has a very large proportion of agricultural workers and their condition is extremely miserable, such as was described by Senator Mrs. Concannon. The work of agricultural labourers in the counties to which I refer has become very irregular owing to the decline of the dairy industry.  Officially their wages are supposed to be 30/- a week but the actual wage I am sure would be less than £1 per week. Agricultural labourers have large families and their children are underfed and under-nourished.  They grow up without proper feeding until they are able to work.  It is very difficult to know how they manage to exist. It is especially difficult to know how an agricultural labourer with a large family manages to maintain them.  I am convinced that unless something is done to improve their condition and increase their income as a class they cannot survive.  We see them emigrating to England every day.  One of the greatest problems at the present time is to see how the people can be maintained on the land and especially how the agricultural labourer whose work is most necessary can be kept on the land.  One method would be to advance the official rate of wages.  I doubt if that would be effective.  We must remember that the agricultural labourer is employed not by a large firm or by the State but by a farmer in a small way of business who is scarcely better off, and who finds it difficult to pay labourers out of the produce of his farm.  If you raise the fixed minimum wages to a point beyond which the employer <Col N="935" /> can pay you may actually reduce the income of the agricultural labourer and the amount of work he gets.</P>
      <P>I was in favour of the Agricultural Wages Act and had I been in the House at the time I am sure I would have supported it enthusiastically but, looking back over the years, I am very doubtful if it has not done more harm than good to agricultural workers.  The fixing of the minimum rate of wages has not proved the success it might have been.  In a period when there is a slump in agricultural prices it has a tendency to prevent farmers giving employment that they might otherwise give.  In a period of good prices, a boom period, it has the effect of keeping wages down because the minimum tends to become the maximum wage. It keeps down the wage which would have been current owing to the law of supply and demand.  The position is that the agricultural labourer is undoubtedly not getting a living wage for himself and his family but, by raising the officially fixed rate of wages, it is more than possible that you may bring about an actual reduction in his income as the man who employs him may not be able to pay the increased wage.  In any case it should be clear that at the present price of agricultural produce the farmer is not able to pay a living wage to agricultural labourers.  That is the crux of the whole situation.  I have given the matter careful study and have come to the conclusion that there is no other way out but for the Government to give a direct subsidy in some form to agricultural labourers.  I know that that is an easy way of getting out of the difficulty. One alternative would be to raise the fixed wages, but as I have shown that may mean a reduction in the income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another alternative would be to increase the price of agricultural produce. It would be better to give the money directly as a subsidy to the agricultural labourers.  We must remember there are two sides to this question.  If the agricultural labourer <Col N="936" /> is not given employment, not alone will he disappear, but, with his disappearance, work on the land must cease. Production must go down.  Not alone will there be a loss for the agricultural labourer, but there will be a loss in production.  It is in the interests not only of the labourers and the farmers, but also of the community, that the agricultural labourer should be employed and be encouraged to remain on the land.  I see no alternative to a direct subsidy, either in the form of a family allowance or some addition to the actual wages while a man is working. It has been suggested that unemployment assistance should be added to the wages of the agricultural labourer who is at work.  Perhaps that might do.  Whatever it would cost, it would be well worth it to the community.</P>

      <P>I should not like to see this matter going to a vote without making a few remarks upon it, purely as a townsman, but, nevertheless, as a person with some knowledge of the country who has had certain opportunities of observing agricultural labourers.  Usually, when a motion to which there is an amendment is moved, one finds oneself in the position of being for the motion and against the amendment, or for the amendment and against the motion.  But in the case of this motion in the name of Senator Foran, and the two amendments tabled to it, I find myself in what, from the Parliamentary point of view, is a rather strange position.  I should like to vote for the motion and for each of the amendments.  Having voted for all three, I am afraid I should not have accomplished very much to solve what is a very real problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was reared in an atmosphere which was, naturally, sympathetic to the claims of all workers and, particularly, to the claims of agricultural labourers.  The information I got, before I had any opportunity of checking it, was that the farmer was a bad man to pay tradesmen and labourers. That was the country-town skilled worker's viewpoint.  Like a great many other prejudices and views in which I was reared, I have had an opportunity <Col N="937" /> of studying that opinion theoretically and practically.  I found that while these prejudices had, perhaps, a certain basis, they were not absolutely sound.  The agricultural labourer, undoubtedly, gets a very raw deal when you consider that he is not a labourer at all in the sense of being unskilled.  He is a skilled person.  Not only is he skilled in one respect but, very often, he is skilled in many respects and, from that angle, he is extraordinary badly paid.  Apart altogether from the question of pay, the agricultural labourer is in a singularly bad position so far as the prospect of improving himself is concerned. His position regarding the education of his children is very much worse than the position of his counterpart even in the country town.  I imagine that very few agricultural labourers' sons ever see the inside of a secondary school. If they never see the inside of a secondary school, they get practically no opportunity of raising themselves above the standard of their parents &mdash; an opportunity which occurs in abundance in a city like Dublin or in any reasonably-sized country town, in a country town, for instance, where there is a Christian Brothers' school, where education can be got free, from the secondary point of view, by anybody who can, by any manner of means, keep his son away from work.</P>
    <P>The farm labourer is necessarily, I think, a very intelligent and a very virile member of the community and it is a great loss to the nation that his children are, in overwhelming majority, prevented from enjoying the benefits of secondary education or getting into any other class than their father's, if they do not emigrate.  I should like, therefore, to take any steps which this House could take towards improving the position of the agricultural labourer.  As Senator O'Dwyer, himself a farmer, has very properly remarked, apart altogether from the interests of the individual concerned, the preservation of a class of persons working on the land is of vital importance to the development of the country.  If we fail to do that we shall, I think, fail to survive as a nation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> On the other hand, taking the amendment in the name of Senator Counihan, I do not want to place an unbearable burden on the farmers.  It is no harm to say that the whole tendency, particularly during the last ten years, has been to increase the farmers' costs.  We have had industrial expansion which has been very largely at the expense of the farmers. That has tended to increase the farmer's costs without, at the same time, increasing the price he got for his produce.  Of the two amendments, I prefer Senator Baxter's.  I am confirmed in my view of Senator Baxter's amendment by reading the advertisement of the Agricultural Wages Board. Senator Baxter advocates a technical agricultural costings organisation to determine what agricultural costs are and whether agricultural prices can bear increased costs.  I have some intimate personal knowledge of people engaged in dairy farming and I have often heard them argue &mdash; they are relations of my own &mdash; that milk cannot be produced at the price which is currently paid for it at the creameries. A member of the staff of University College, Cork, has recently conducted a scientific investigation into that matter and he has proved, from the scientific and statistical point of view, that milk in certain areas&mdash;areas with which I happen to be familiar myself &mdash; costs a penny more to produce than can be obtained for it by way of price.  In that situation, it is really difficult to say to a man that he must increase his labourers' wages.  If it could be done rapidly &mdash; and if certain people were employed, it could be done rapidly &mdash; it would be beneficial to ascertain scientifically what costings on a farm are like.  That might be beneficial even in a much wider sphere than farming.</P>
    <P>I do not profess to be an expert on farm conditions, but I do know something about the appetites of boys and men.  I am a man, and I have two boys at home.  I do not understand by what process the Agricultural Wages Board came to what seems to me to be a ludicrous conclusion.  They allow certain deductions for meals for farm labourers.  For agricultural workers of 20 years and upwards, all <Col N="939" /> over the country with the exception of two areas which are set out, they allow 3d. per day for afternoon tea.  For agricultural workers under 20 and not under 19 years of age, they allow 2½d. It baffles me that any intelligent people could have sat down and calculated that a man over 20 could be given afternoon tea &mdash; I presume that means, in the country, tea, sugar, milk, bread and butter &mdash; that is, at all events, what it means in Tipperary, Waterford and Limerick &mdash; at a cost of 3d., and that younger men than those of 20 years of age could be given that meal for 2½d. That is baffling, and it certainly shows that Senator Baxter's amendment needs to be considered by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">

      <P>Somebody pays for it. That this should be published at public expense is fantastic.  I have no costings organisation of my own, but I am perfectly certain that my evening meal of tea costs less than the evening meal of a boy of 18½ years at home.  If it does not, I have been deceived for some time past.  If he were an agricultural labourer, heaven knows how much he would eat.  For a man of 20 years of age, 7½d. is allowed for supper, but if the individual is only 19, the amount is only 7d., whereas it is clear to anybody who ever sat in a farmer's house &mdash; I have had a fair number of meals in farmers' houses and in farm labourers' houses &mdash; that a man of 35, 40 or 45 years of age will eat less instead of more than a boy of 19 years of age. Surely, even from the military point of view, is it not one of the things in connection with conscription that is against armies of young people: that while boys of 18 to 21 are good fighters, nobody could feed them?  They simply cannot be fed.</P>

      <P>Yes, indeed, always empty.  I must plead ignorance of this board, but it seems to me that these costings cannot have been arrived at on any scientific basis.  It seems that they are against the law of <Col N="940" /> commonsense and experience, that they are a very sound argument for Senator Baxter's amendment.  I feel that the discussion here is useful, but I doubt if we are going to get very much further by passing the motion or even by passing the amendment.  Certainly, as far as one's information is concerned there can be no doubt that one of the most urgent of our problems is the provision of an adequate wage.  I am more concerned with wages than I am about the conditions of farm labourers.  I do not think that town conditions, trade union conditions for example, are quite applicable, but I say that they do not get at the present time a fair return for the amount of skill they have and the amount of work that they do by contrast with the wages paid often only a few hundred yards away from them over the town border.  For that reason I propose to take what is rather a strange decision, to vote for the amendment and to vote for the motion whether amended or not.</P>

      <P>It should be clear to Senator Foran that he is pushing an open door in this matter.  If the matter was brought up at the last sitting, and if a division was taken a different position would arise.  Since this motion was tabled what Senator Foran wants to be done has been done and I cannot see any necessity for pushing an open door.  Maybe Senator Foran wants something far in excess of what is being done.  Maybe he wants to urge that the thing should have gone much further.  If that is so we will probably have Senator Counihan, on behalf of the farming community, getting up to say that the farmers could not go any further and then Senator Baxter would have to produce his costing organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> I have been hearing about costings in connection with farming and I have heard figures quoted here and other places for a number of years.  I think anybody who will get down to the actual facts of the matter, who will take the trouble of going down to examine the cases of good farmers &mdash; I am not talking about isolated cases &mdash; but if they asked these farmers how much would it cost you to produce an acre of mangolds or turnips or how much to feed so many men, they would be told that they could not go into that.  A farmer and a very prominent member of this House told me that he had gone into this costings business, but after three months had to give it up.  He added: &ldquo;If I do not give it up I will be in the asylum, and I would rather be in the poorhouse any day than in the asylum.&rdquo;  So he did give up the costings idea.  It is just as foolish for Senator Foran to be pushing the open door as it was for Senator Cummins to say the other day that the agricultural workers here are the worst paid in the world.  A statement like that is ridiculous and it takes any good there is out of an otherwise reasonable speech.</P>
    <P>I heard a story the other day which throws a bit of light on this particular subject, and if I wanted to take a certain line of argument I could open up a considerable debate.  An inspector of the Agricultural Wages Board is supposed to have gone into a farmer's house and got into conversation with the first man he met.  &ldquo;Are you the boss of this place?&rdquo; he asked, and the farmer replied: &ldquo;Yes, I am the boss.&rdquo; The inspector then asked: &ldquo;Who have you working here with you?&rdquo; and took out a book.  The farmer replied: &ldquo;I have that man you met at the gate.&rdquo; The inspector asked: &ldquo;What does he do?&rdquo;  The farmer replied: &ldquo;He milks four or five cows at night, does ploughing when it has to be done, and when the weather lets him do it.&rdquo;  The inspector took down all particulars and noted down the wages paid.  He then asked: &ldquo;Have you anybody else employed?&rdquo; and the farmer said: &ldquo;Yes, I have another fellow too,&rdquo; and told the inspector a big long rigmarole of a story about what this other fellow <Col N="942" /> did.  &ldquo;Have you anybody else in the place?&rdquo;  asked the inspector.  &ldquo;No, nobody else in the place,&rdquo; said the farmer. &ldquo;Are you sure you have nobody else?&rdquo;  the inspector asked.  &ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;there is a fool of a fellow, but he does not get any wages.&rdquo;&ldquo;No wages at all?&rdquo; said the inspector, thinking he had discovered something great.  &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;he gets a cut of tobacco at the end of the week when it was fairly plentiful and he gets his three meals.&rdquo; The inspector said: &ldquo;I will want to see that man right away,&rdquo; and the farmer, pointing to himself, said: &ldquo;Here he is.&rdquo;  Senator Counihan could put up an argument like that, that the boss, the farmer himself, was the worst paid man on the farm.</P>
    <P>The general opinion is that something more should be done for agricultural workers.  On this side of the House we believed that it should be done and it has been done.  In my opinion there is no use in pushing an open door unless we can find something by which these workers' conditions can be improved.  If anyone can put up a scheme for that we will be all one on it.  We are all interested in stopping the flight from the land, in stopping emigration, and in stopping the backbone of the country, so to speak, from going away.  But I do not see any object in dividing on a matter of this kind.  Senator Counihan suggests that it is desirable that a small expert committee be appointed to consider and report as to what steps, if any, can be taken to increase wages payable to agricultural workers, and to improve their conditions of employment without placing an unbearable burden on the farmers.  I say that that committee has been set up, that it has decided that so-and-so should be done, and that it has been done.  In connection with the costings organisation it can be taken that the Agricultural Wages Board is a costings organisation and that it has been devised by practical men, accountants and so forth.</P>

      <P>Listening attentively, as I always do from this back <Col N="943" /> bench, to the demands and claims that are made on behalf of various sections of the community, I realise that there is one piece of legislation that must be introduced, and that is a Bill to give everybody everything.  Nothing short of that will be satisfactory.  Now, here at any rate, in these motions seeking to ameliorate the lot of the agricultural worker, we have claims that, to my mind, cannot be treated facetiously or derided, because they belong to the proper organisation of the national industry.  This purports to be, and in a large measure is, a vocational Second House, and one function of vocational organisation is to have, on something like mediæval lines, industry representing both employers and employed &mdash; everyone whose life interest, as well as the interest of the nation at large, is bound up with the industry.  We have here in this House admirable representatives of agriculture. Surely, instead of proposing external committees, committees of this type or that type, the purpose of the Seanad's creation should be fulfilled by what I would call in academic language the faculty of agriculture in this House getting busy on the problem and proposing a solution.  That is one objection that I have to what is, in many respects, a motion which I think is impossible for anyone not to approve:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Eireann is of opinion that it is essential to increase substantially wages payable to agricultural workers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It seems to me that it is too obvious to need argument in favour of it.  I deliberately read the essence of the motion.  By itself, as it stands on the Order Paper, it reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Eireann is of opinion, complementary to the announcement of increased minimum prices for certain agricultural products,&rdquo; etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to me to imply that it is out of the increased remuneration of the farmer-employer that the increase in wages is to come for the agricultural <Col N="944" /> worker employed, and something of that is in a later proposition.  I do not see that these two things are quite so intimately connected as they would be made to appear in the wording of the motion because, irrespective of what prices are to be given for agricultural produce, the social problem, the moral problem, remains.  It is there all the time, that whoever is asked to devote his life's energy to a certain industry has to find, out of that work, the wherewithal to keep him on a decent human standard of living.  I think that is an incontestable proposition, is a simpler proposition.  I do not advocate the increase on any such grounds as that we have increased the price to be given for wheat.  I support the proposition, apart from any such increase.</P>
    <P>In the amendments we are asked to delete certain words.  I find no difficulty in refusing to delete the words, and instead, adding the words of the amendment.  For instance, I find that these two things could be read together with perfect compatibility:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Eireann is of opinion that it is essential to increase substantially the wages payable to agricultural workers, and to effect a reasonable amelioration of their conditions of employment;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>the next is the amendment &mdash; ignore the directions to delete words, and read on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And it is desirable that a small expert committee be appointed to consider and report as to what steps, if any, can be taken to increase the wages payable to agricultural workers, and improve the conditions of employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have already indicated what, to my mind, that small expert committee to be appointed should consist of.  The personnel, obviously, should be the Senators of this House who are here in the name of, and on behalf of, the industry of agriculture.  They are the people who are fittest; they are our experts.  That is why they are here. Even the further amendment of Senator Baxter I can find room for &mdash; I mean in the technical sense of not finding it to be something to be a substitute, <Col N="945" /> but something to add to the original.</P>
    <P>Now, when we go into detail, I regard the first part as merely expressing a desire to improve the lot of the worker, but indicating in no degree the steps that have to be taken.  The amendment of Senator Counihan does suggest a first step, namely, to have the matter gone into by an expert inquiry. I have taken the liberty of suggesting that he and others of the faculty of agriculture in the House should be that body.  My difficulty in the matter of ameliorating conditions of employment is: by whom is the amelioration to be provided?  Either it is by the employer or by the community at large &mdash; the State.  Which is intended?  I read the innuendo of the words as implying that the increase was to come from the supposed increase the farmer was receiving, but I am not personally convinced that the farmer is getting an increase.  The fixed price has been increased, but that was on representation, and, as I take it, on the case made, that it was necessary to have an adequate and just price in face of the conditions imposed upon the producer of wheat in the emergency period, which is now.  Therefore I cannot see that there is an element in the remuneration of the wheat grower out of which to draw the remuneration of the worker.  Yet I contend with those who proposed the motion and the amendment, in the following motion: &ldquo;That the imperative duty of persons in regard to the national industry is that men shall not be hired to work in it and receive inadequate, unjust remuneration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is a fundamental national duty that the national industry should be made to conform with the declarations of the Constitution.  We invoke the Holy Ghost, we declare that by the inspiration and aid of Jesus Christ, we have succeeded in setting up this State, declared it to be free, sovereign and an independent State, and if we mean those things, surely we mean to live up to them.  That is the test of sincerity.  It cannot be defended that labourers should be asked to live as human beings and rear and train <Col N="946" /> human beings &mdash; their families &mdash; and make them good citizens, if the return for their work is simply what is set out in that agricultural wages finding. I regard that, with all respect to the well-intentioned men who produced it, as a ridiculous travesty for solving the problem.  As to the idea that the position of the agricultural worker could be improved by getting 33/- a week &mdash; with a deduction of 3d. if he gets his tea &mdash; it is hard to believe that serious men sitting down to the solution of a serious problem could be so inconsiderate as to give that to the public as a verdict.  I hope I am not being offensive or unappreciative of the way this committee did its work.  They were probably doing their best.  I have more faith in my colleagues here representing agriculture.  I think they could do very much better, and I look with confidence to this motion being passed with the addendum of Senator Counihan, interpreting it only in the way I interpreted it, namely, that the select body should be a body from the agricultural section of this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter's amendment, viewed favourably &mdash; I mean the best interpretation being put on it &mdash; goes to the root of the matter, but I make that reservation in my description of it, because from one angle it is susceptible of a very sinister interpretation.  I had better get that out of my way first.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to delete all the words after the word &lsquo;workers&rsquo;, and read, &lsquo;provided it has been determined by a technical agricultural costings organisation that such agricultural prices can bear increased costs&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That might appear to some as meaning that if they were not able to bear increased costs, then there is nothing doing.  If we read it like that, I think I am correct in calling it sinister.</P>
    <P>The proviso means that we must remain inert, and do nothing in respect of this great pressing problem, if the body of experts report that the inquiry shows that agricultural prices cannot bear increased costs.  Surely, if agricultural prices cannot bear increased costs <Col N="947" /> then agricultural prices must be adjusted. Who is willing to eat bread or vegetables with the full knowledge that they are his because men have slaved and toiled in the fields for inadequate wages?  What is that but setting up again, under a thin disguise, serfdom? Are we to pay high salaries to civil servants and officials and defend that on the ground that they are worth them?  I hold that they are worth them and that it is our duty to pay them.  On the same reasoning, it is our duty to pay an adequate price for the stuff that is provided for us to eat.  It is, therefore, not a question of economics; it is a question really of morality, of service, and of common decency.  It is a question of common decency that men be paid what justice and equity demand.  We cannot plead an emergency.  If we are unable to pay for what we get, we must learn to do without it and suffer the disadvantages accordingly.  We have no right to exact a sacrifice from the needs of others.  I take it that Senator Baxter had no intention of putting in the implication I have read out of it.  It can be read out of it, but I believe that it was not in his mind.</P>
    <P>The root of the whole problem &mdash; viewed, first of all, as an economic problem &mdash; is to discover what is wrong with agriculture, what is wrong with the working of the land, that makes it impossible, apparently, from what Senator Quirke said, to get the farmers to keep books and conduct their industry with commonsense and with the same amount of attention and care as the city shopkeeper or the city manufacturer gives to his employment. There must be something radically wrong and, naturally, as a teacher, my mind turns to the explanation that most people find for what has gone wrong in the State &mdash; that there is something faulty in the education both of the farmer and of the labourer.  That requires more consideration.  In other words, a reorganisation of society on a proper basis of social justice is really necessary.  While such an inquiry as that would be going on, things would be going from worse to still worse. Therefore, the immediate &ldquo;inch before <Col N="948" /> the saw&rdquo; is, &ldquo;What is to be done now?&rdquo;  Just as we said, in the earlier part of to-day's sitting, that we took a step anyhow to making a better system of national health insurance, admitting that it was not what it ought to be or all that we would like it to be, similarly we can take the first step here and now, and that is to have the agricultural representatives of this House devise a scheme and make recommendations to the Government of the State.  There are others more competent to speak about that than I.</P>

      <P>I will briefly run over what I consider the most outstanding speeches in the discussion.  They came from the very opposites&mdash;Professor Johnston and Senator O'Dwyer.  They seem to have very much the same mentality on this matter.  Both of them argued that minimum wage was maximum wage and that minimum wage would destroy the farmer and the labourer.  Surely, if we recognise agricultural labourers as humans, we must recognise that they have rights, and then is it too much to ask that they have a statutory wage and that they can sue the employer and make him pay?  Surely that is a fundamental right which should be conceded to the agricultural labourer, to establish his right by law to a certain minimum wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to its becoming a maximum wage, the same thing has been said time and again regarding the trade union wage, that it was a maximum wage.  It is no such thing.  If a farmer has a good season and feels that his financial position would allow it, there is no obligation on him to confine himself to the bare minimum wage laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board.  The motion asks for a substantial increase in the wages of agricultural labourers &mdash; a substantial increase &mdash; and, apparently, every Senator who has taken part in the discussion agrees that there is room for a substantial increase.  The farmers have, undoubtedly, got a substantial increase for their produce &mdash; in beet, oats, wheat and so on.  The farmer has been fairly well catered for in the way of fixed prices, so it is not unreasonable to ask that the man who <Col N="949" /> helps him to produce should have a reasonable standard wage.</P>

Nobody would defend such a wage, notwithstanding the fact that reference has been made here to the provision of tea in the afternoon at a certain rate.  I can understand that, though, perhaps, people in higher stations cannot understand it.  If the farmer gives his workers something over and above a minimum rate, and the workers agree on that, it is not unreasonable to expect the farmer to be paid.  It is not a usual custom to provide afternoon tea for agricultural labourers&mdash; everybody knows that&mdash;but even in that extreme case the Agricultural Wages Board has made provision for it. It has been argued by Senator Johnston that the farmer cannot afford to pay.  He was very careful to take the 1938-39 figure in order to prove his case.</P>

I do not know any Department of State that would more welcome book-keeping among the farmers than the Revenue Department.  I am sure that they would be glad to know that the farmers were getting bookkeepers. The revenue would be substantially increased.  Certainly the income-tax people would have a much easier job.  Perhaps it is due to intelligent anticipation that the universities have so many farmers' sons.  They may be in training for these new accountancy positions in agriculture.  You do not get many labourers' sons going into the universities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion which stands in my name and in the names of Senator Baxter and Senator MacCabe as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in order to avert the decline of the dairying industry, Seanad Eireann requests the Government to provide an increased price for butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was with considerable reluctance that I put down this motion but I felt it my duty to do so.  It is open to the suspicion that because we represent the particular industry, we may be endeavouring unfairly to use the privileges of this House to push the interests of that industry at the expense of certain sections of the community. While fearing that the motion might be open to that interpretation, I felt also that representing, as we do, one of the fundamental industries, at a time when we see so much enthusiasm about the industrial revival, it was our duty to call the attention of the community <Col N="954" /> as a whole to the decline of that industry.  It has been steadily declining for years and, so far as we can see, it is approaching complete decay. In drawing attention to the matter, we are serving not only the dairying industry but the whole community which is so vitally concerned, even though it may not understand how deeply it is concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out the great importance of the industry to the country and, particularly, to the dairying counties, where it has been carried on for, perhaps, 100 years.  To Tipperary, Limerick, parts of Cork and other counties, this industry is as important as the orange industry is to Jaffa and the wine industry to Malacca.  It is the industry around which the whole economy of these counties has been built and on which their population has subsisted for many generations.  The dairying industry employs more people per acre than any other industry&mdash;even tillage.  In Limerick, it has employed a large population and the land on which dairying is carried on can retain its fertility without the importation of artificial manure.  For the past 100 years, those lands have retained their fertility and will retain it so long as dairying is carried on.</P>
    <P>Besides its importance to these counties, the industry is of still greater importance to the country at large, because, without the assistance of the dairying industry, the cattle trade, which forms so large a part of our national economy, could not be long carried on.  The cattle for export are furnished by the dairying counties, and a decline in the dairying industry would, naturally, be followed by a decrease in the export of cattle. The dairying industry was very important at one time.  We supplied 50 per cent. of the imports into the British market.  That ratio has steadily declined until, nine or ten years ago, we supplied less than 4 per cent.  For the past two years we supplied only a fraction of 1 per cent.  The decline has been steady and continuous for many years, and especially for the past few years.  Last year, very little butter <Col N="955" /> was exported&mdash;only 4,000 or 5,000 cwts. The probability is that this year there will be no exports, that we shall have barely sufficient for the requirements of the country.</P>
    <P>We shall be asked what the reasons are for this continuous decline, and it is well that those reasons should be explained as clearly as possible.  The main reason was the bad price always paid for butter.  Five or six years ago the Government found it necessary to increase, by State bounty or subsidy, the price received on the British market for exports of butter.  That export bounty has had to be kept up practically ever since.  The low price was, in general, the reason for the continuous decline.  In addition, it is a very laborious industry, requiring late hours and hard work.  Agricultural workers were, in general, inclined to give up the milking of cows and go in for other forms of agriculture which called for shorter hours of work.  The general inclination on the part of agricultural workers was to avoid the milking of cows, if at all possible.  The difficulty of obtaining labour was, therefore, also responsible for the decline of dairying.  Another reason was the heavy export of the best heifers. For over 20 years they were exported to England, with the result that only a poor type of cow remained, which gave an uneconomic return.  That affected the dairying industry.  Another reason was the competition of the dry cattle.  It is at present far more profitable for the farmer on the dairy lands to engage in dry store feeding, with the result that, for many years past, dairy cattle in Limerick and elsewhere were replaced by the dry cattle industry which gives scarcely any employment.</P>
    <P>The result is that those who relied on the dairy farms for employment are now practically idle or depending on public works.  If that decline is allowed to continue it will mean not only that unemployment will be directly increased but that, sooner or later, we shall be faced with an actual shortage of butter.  If that does not happen this year, it may happen <Col N="956" /> next year.  It will also follow, in the course of a few years, that there will be a shortage of cattle.  That must, inevitably, follow on the decline of the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>It has been asked why we should continue to subsidise the production of dairy products when the surplus has to be exported and sold at an uneconomic price on a foreign market. That has already cost a large figure but I think this is not the time, after continuing it for so many years, to let the export bounty drop.  I firmly believe that, when the war is over, no matter how it ends, the prospects for the dairying industry and for the export business will be far better than they have ever been, that there will be an increased demand all over the world for butter, meat and meat products. For that reason, during the year or two that must elapse, the Government should not hesitate to encourage and maintain the present herds and, if possible, to increase these herds.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons for the decline in the industry is the poor price that has been paid for butter.  I would find it very difficult, I am sure, to explain to those who live in towns and have no connection with the industry, its important nature or the uneconomic price which has been paid.  The Minister for Agriculture, who has always been very sympathetic, will, I am sure, point out to the House the basic nature of the industry and its importance to the community.  He will also be able to state that the prices hitherto paid for butter are not economic.  We suggest that, in order to maintain the industry as it is and to prevent it from declining during the present situation, there should be an increase in the prices payable to farmers.  How increased prices can be made available would be a matter for the Government to consider.  There are two means of doing it.  The first is by a direct contribution from the public funds and the other is by increasing prices to the home consumer, because this year it will be, probably, the home consumer will use all our butter.</P>
    <P>In regard to a contribution from <Col N="957" /> public funds I do not consider the contribution hitherto paid over-large. Unless I am mistaken, it has not been much more than £300,000 or £370,000 net over the past couple of years.  That amount, when we consider everything, is very small in comparison with the subsidies given to other industries and other interests.  Now we come to the question of raising the price of butter. Personally, I would be very much against increasing the cost of living. I always thought that if we could keep down this cost everything would be all right, but we must realise that when we have not been able to enforce the policy of keeping down prices in other directions&mdash;when prices of other commodities have risen&mdash;we cannot, in all fairness, keep the price of one commodity down.</P>
    <P>Take the price for wheat, for instance.  The price was fixed and, apparently, it was a fair price, but oats and barley went up and everyone recognised that in view of that prices of wheat could not be kept down.  The same applies to butter to-day.  In all fairness everyone must admit that, at its price to-day, butter is the cheapest commodity on the market.  Those who understand the working of the industry know that the price is not an economic price and that it has not been economic for a long time.</P>
    <P>The price to-day is that which has been in operation for three or four years.  There has been no increase. Those who live in towns seem, especially, to resent the price of butter, but they forget that though they pay 2/- or 2/3 per gallon for milk, it takes two and one-third gallons of milk to make a pound of butter.  Actually butter is the cheapest food on the market to-day.  I believe it would not be unfair if the price was advanced to a figure that would give a fair return. We all agree that the producer of food is the first person to be considered and that he is entitled to a fair return.  I suggest to the Minister that he should see the justice of the case and meet it either by a contribution from the public funds or by increasing prices, if that is necessary.  Some increase should be given to the dairy farmer and <Col N="958" /> the sooner that increase is given the better.  Just as the delay in fixing the price of wheat meant a loss in the quantity sown, so the longer the present price for butter prevails the greater the decline in the dairying industry will be and the greater will the amount of the butter exports be.  I ask the Minister and the House to consider the case carefully.  What we ask is only fair and something to which the dairy farmers are entitled.  Otherwise we would not have put down this motion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. MacCabe Mr. MacCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am associated with this motion in connection with increased prices for butter and I agree with the remarks of Senator O'Dwyer. The first thing I want to impress on the House is that it is a well-known fact that the dairying industry has declined for the last two or three years.  One of the factors that caused that decline and which is still operating is the price of milch cows.  In the Twenty-Six Counties prices have increased by at least £10 per head during the past five or six months.  Good cows are being sold off the farms and are being purchased in the Six Counties.  A small number of them go across the Channel.</P>
      <P>The farmers here were obliged to sell good herds because they wanted money and the prices offered were an inducement to do so.  Now they will have to wait for two or three years before young heifers will leave them in a position to supply milk to creameries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor is that in middle sized farms on account of the extra tillage farmers will be obliged to reduce the numbers of their live stock. The first to go are the good cows.  Dry stock is a paying proposition at the moment.  It requires less labour and gives more profit than dairying stock. Labour is scarce and more expensive with the result that the farmer is induced to feed dry stock and utilise the labour available for tillage.  The price of foodstuffs for dairy cows has increased by 200 per cent., and many small farmers&mdash;or any farmers for that matter&mdash;cannot get suitable food to <Col N="959" /> feed dairy cattle for the winter, no matter what price they pay.</P>
    <P>In a good many counties there is a good deal of what is called mixed farming. That depends a good deal on the raising of pigs.  Pigs were fed on separated milk as it came from the creameries, together with other food. The raising of pork is unfortunately, I think, a thing of the past here.</P>
    <P>The pork industry is going from under our feet.  There is no feeding for pigs and there is very little use for the separated milk or the surplus milk that in normal times would be utilised on the farms for rearing pigs.  I am sure there are very few in this House who understand the conditions on which the ordinary milk supplier sends milk to the creameries.  I think I would be safe in saying that the average price per gallon paid for milk in the Twenty-Six Counties for the year ending 31st December, 1941, would not be more than 6¼d. per gallon but if we take the farmer living in a backward place in the country who has to take his milk a mile or a mile and a quarter to the main road to the carter who is going to take the milk to the creamery, it will be seen that that man spends an hour or an hour and a half going in the morning and coming back in the evening to fetch the separated milk.  That hour and a half is time that could well be used in working on his farm.  At the end of the month there is deducted from that man's milk cheque 1d. per gallon in respect of the cartage of the milk to the creamery for the month. So that even after losing his own time to the extent of three hours per day and paying 1d. per gallon for the cartage of the milk he receives only about 5d. per gallon for his milk on the price that is being paid for butter.  He is not going to continue to do that and I say he would be a foolish man if he did.  Apart from the loss of his time there is the wear and tear of harness and of his cart.  It may happen that he cannot afford to pay a boy to do this work.  The distance travelled each week in going with the milk and coming back a second time in the day to <Col N="960" /> bring home the separated milk, would represent a ten or 12-mile journey.</P>
    <P>The man who carts the milk to the creamery is perhaps more fortunate. He has to deliver the milk to the creamery but even so the loss of time is considerable.  He has to harness his horse in the morning and he has to be out very early.  There is also considerable wear and tear in equipment.  He has to make sure that the milk and the utensils are clean.  He has to remain a certain time at the creamery and return about 12 o'clock in the day. I fear that dairy farmers are not going to continue to supply milk on these conditions.  I say that as one who has worked in a creamery for over 30 years.  I supply milk to a creamery but if I had not been a worker in the creamery, I would certainly believe that dairy farmers are fools to expend so much in time and labour and get so little in return.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that at 1/6 per lb. the price paid for butter is reasonable and that there should be no complaints as far as that is concerned but, taking the creamery itself, let us consider the overhead charges and the increased cost of the various articles used in the manufacture of butter.  I take the year 1939 and compare the cost of a few items that have to be used in the creameries in that year with their present cost.  In the year 1939 coal was delivered to the creameries at 42/- per ton.  In 1941, it was 90/- delivered.  That is more than double what it cost in 1939.  Salt cost 70/- per cwt. in 1939 while in 1941 the cost was 170/- delivered.  Boxwood in 1939 was 1/3 per box and in 1941 it was 2/10 per box.  Butter paper, a commodity that is used every day in large quantities, in 1939 was 6½d. per lb. and in 1941 was 1/3 per lb.  These, as I say, are only a few of the items used in the creamery. I shall not give the cost of spare parts for the machinery in the creamery but whatever spare parts are allowed into the country would now be at least 100 per cent. over what they cost in 1938.</P>
    <P>Taking the other side of the picture, in 1938, the creameries received 147/- per cwt. for butter; in 1940, 156/-, and <Col N="961" /> in 1941, 163/-.  That means that they received only 26/- per cwt. more than the price in pre-war days.  I think that that is a comparison that would not satisfy anybody because it will be seen that the overhead charges of the creamery are up by over 100 per cent., while the increased price of butter would not be more than 15 per cent. The Minister will agree, I am sure, that the production of butter last year, in 1941, was not nearly so high as the production in 1940.  The quantity of creamery butter manufactured in 1941 was 620,000 cwts.  The present consumption of creamery butter per month is 50,000 cwts.  The estimated production of creamery butter for the ensuing year is 550,000 cwts.  The retail price of butter in 1939 was 1/6, while the retail price to-day is 1/7 per lb.  The minimum price of milk on the average for manufacturing purposes should not be less than 8d. per gallon, exclusive of the skimmed milk.  That is not an unreasonable claim after allowing a penny per gallon for separated milk. It is only right and just that the farmer should get at least 8d. per gallon for his milk.  When it is considered that farmers living convenient to the City of Dublin are getting 1/8 and 1/10 per gallon and that down the country farmers are not getting even 6½d. or 6¼d., it will be seen that there is something wrong somewhere.</P>
    <P>Our claim, I hold, is not an unreasonable claim.  We only ask that the Minister should seriously consider the advisability of increasing the price of butter so that the farmer may get 8d. per gallon for his milk&mdash;or 9d., in other words, allowing 1d. per gallon for separated milk.  That may necessitate a retail price for butter of 2/- per lb., which, in view of all the circumstances, would not be excessive.  The manufacturing cost of creameries, with the exception of salaries and wages, has increased, at the lowest calculation, 100 per cent.  I have not known of a single case where a creamery manager or a worker has made application for an increase of salary since the outbreak of this war.  And why? They felt that their employers were not able to pay it, that they were struggling, or were not getting a proper <Col N="962" /> return for their produce.  Consequently they were patriotic enough not to make a foolish attempt to ask for an increase of salary.  I hope that will continue.  The farmer would be quite willing and just as anxious as anybody else to see the employees well paid, because they expect if they are reasonably paid, that they will give a good return for their pay; but on the return they are getting, they are not, unfortunately, in a position to pay anybody. I have here an article from an English paper which shows that there they have considered the whole question of food production and the prices that should be paid to farmers.  With the permission of the House I shall read an extract from it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It cannot be said that the new production prices have been received with any great enthusiasm.  Many had the idea that the increases required to meet the higher wages bill and other mounting costs would be much larger than the new prices indicate.  Indeed, the trouble about reaching a just settlement was the lack of proof about farmers' costs now or at any past time.  Agricultural economists at Oxford, Cambridge, and other centres, could quote financial results from about 2,000 farms, where careful accounts are kept, but such figures are rather a hand-picked sample than representative of all farms and all farmers. It appears that wheat, fat sheep and wool, sugar beet and flax have been treated comparatively generously, and no doubt this will be true of milk when the new prices are fixed. The delay in settling milk prices is due to the proposed introduction of a national basic price for the next contract year...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The <i>Farmers' Gazette</i>, an English paper.  They have great hopes that from the 1st April this year the price of milk, as well as the prices of other commodities, will be increased or will be fixed so that it will be a paying proposition for the British farmer.  I am sure the House <Col N="963" /> will agree that the Department here has as clever experts or supermen as any other country in the world.  I am sure they have carried out experiments on farms and have gone into the production of milk and butter.  I ask any of the inspectors of the Department to say if any farmer could produce milk at less than 9d. or 10d. per gallon.  I think I would be fairly correct in saying that they could not contradict that statement.  If they are prepared to do it, they are welcome to it at any time, but I fear there is no hope of convincing the people that it can be done.  Why should people be asked to produce butter and send it out to the consumers at a loss?  What man would walk into a boot factory and ask the manager to sell him a pair of boots at 15/6, that cost 18/6 to manufacture. The manager would say: &ldquo;The sooner this man is locked up the better; he is insane.&rdquo;  You cannot expect a farmer to produce and to sell at a loss.  It cannot continue indefinitely.</P>
      <P>If consumers had the true facts of the case they would realise that our claim is a just one.  Taking it on the average it will take 2.35 gallons or 2.50 gallons in some cases, to produce one lb. of butter, which is sold at 2/- per lb.  It would be much less for the gallon of milk sold without any manufacturing or overhead charges.  I do not want to let this occasion pass without referring to the action of the Minister during the depression in the butter business, and the position he was confronted with regarding exports of butter to foreign markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly say that he stepped into the breach on that occasion.  He did his work remarkably well, and I have no hesitation in saying that he was responsible for saving the dairying industry at the time.  Not only do I say it, but all the dairy farmers appreciate his work on that occasion.  But times have greatly changed since then, and nobody is in a better position to know that than the Minister.  He knows from his inspectors the position so far as farmers are concerned.  These men have an interest in dairying, and they know that good cows are being sold. <Col N="964" /> That information is available to the Minister in his Department.  I hope he will consider seriously the position of the dairying industry.  I do not want to be too pessimistic, so far as the future is concerned, but I never had greater doubts in my mind as to the future of the dairying industry than I have at present.  I think that if something is not done, and that quickly, the year 1942 will see a number of small farmers turning over to dry stock and refusing to supply milk to creameries at the price that is being paid.  I endorse what Senator O'Dwyer said.  He has a through knowledge of the business, having been for a considerable number of years chairman of prosperous and successful creameries.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I was not able to follow the speech made by the last Senator.  Although I understand a little Irish, I could not follow the Senator very well.  I support the motion because I am convinced that the dairy farmer is the most important factor in our agricultural economy.  I am convinced that every possible encouragement should be given to foster that industry.  The Minister made a statement&mdash;I think it was before the Dairy Science Society&mdash;in which he said that the production of butter for export is uneconomic, as it cannot be done without paying out very heavy subsidies, which cannot be continued in the future.  He went on to advise the farmers to get out, to some extent, of the dairy shorthorn bulls and go in for more of the beef cattle such as Herefords and Angus bulls.  I cannot agree with the Minister and, in my opinion, he was very badly advised to make that statement at this particular time, if he considered world conditions to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the breed we should keep to at the present time is the dairy shorthorn breed.  If we are fortunate enough to remain neutral, when the war is over we will be the only country in the world in a position to restock not only England but, perhaps, portions of Europe with cattle.  The dairy shorthorn is the most suitable breed for that purpose. At the present time a dairy shorthorn heifer of a year and a half is worth from £2 to £3 more than heifers of any other breed of that age.  It shows that, even at the present time, British and Irish farmers believe that their stocks of dairy cattle and the keeping of them in calf is most important.  I <Col N="967" /> think that the Minister should encourage the production of the dairy shorthorn.</P>

      <P>Dairy farming is the foundation of the live-stock industry. If we have not dairy farming we will not have live stock.  We cannot produce young stock as they do in the ranches of Canada and the Argentine. The cheapest and the most economic way is to subsidise the dairy farmer to produce young stock reared on the bucket with milk from the creameries or from the dairy farms.  The dairy farmer has a very difficult and precarious job.  It is an all-time job. Cows must be milked on Sundays or holy days and in all kinds of weather. Cows are also subject to very virulent diseases.  They suffer from contagious abortion.  Mastitis and other diseases may destroy a whole herd.  A farmer may lose all his calves in a season from white scour.  If we give consideration to these facts I am sure no one would grudge the dairying farmer better remuneration for his valuable work. The Irish farmer has been described, even described here to-day by some people, as lazy and inefficient while the Danish and Scotch farmers are held up as models to follow.  Anyone who understands the position and takes our soil and climate into account must admit that there are no farmers in the world who could manage our land to better advantage than Irish farmers. I hope the Minister will favourably consider the suggestion that the price of butter should be increased.  I think no one grudges the farmer a better price for his produce.</P>

    <P>I cannot let this motion pass without intervening.  I happen to be one of those members of the Seanad nominated by the Municipal Authorities Association of Ireland.  People in the cities and towns are already well taxed <Col N="968" /> as regards the price they are paying for butter.  The citizens are paying 1/7 per lb. for butter.  We heard a good deal about the wages of those living in cities and towns.  Well they have to pay the increased prices.  I am sorry to have to differ from the views of Senator O'Dwyer or Senator MacCabe, two Senators for whom I have the greatest admiration, but on this occasion I cannot help standing on a different platform.  I know something about the dairying business and it is certainly news to me to learn that the dairy business around County Limerick is such a great factor in providing employment.  I lived for about two months in Charleville and I never saw a man driving a donkey or a jennet to the creamery.  It was girls who drove milk to the creamery from the farms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Senator Quirke that my eyes were wide open. That was the type of employment that was given in the dairying industry. They employed no men.  The girls milked the cows and they took the milk to the creamery.  I do not know whether there is any change since then. I gather from the remarks of Senator MacCabe that the creameries now send around and collect the milk.  Is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we are advancing. Why is it that all the good classes of stock are leaving the country?  Why do they not rear the calves and keep them?  That was the system always carried out by mixed farmers.  They bred their stock and kept them for the dairy.  When they do that they keep the best stock for their own use. Senator Counihan made some reference to advice given by the Minister for Agriculture to cattle owners as regards the breed they should perpetuate. I noticed that at the last bull show in Ballsbridge greater numbers <Col N="969" /> of shorthorns rather than Aberdeen-Angus were purchased.  I remember the time when butter was produced for something between 6d. and 8d. per lb.  The citizens of Dublin are now paying 1/7 per lb.  That is practically twice the price paid formerly for butter. The urban citizens are subsidising the production of butter in the country by paying a bigger price than could be secured on the open market. If there was an open market in England, Australia and New Zealand could cut these producers out of business. It was for the purpose of getting Irish butter into the English market that the Government here subsidised Irish butter.  But they compelled the consumers of butter to pay the highest price possible.</P>
      <P>I should not be doing my duty here if I did not oppose this motion.  I am sorry the Labour Senators are absent. This is one of the things to which they should pay some attention.  I notice that Senator Cummins is here, but he is the only one of the official Labour Party who is present.  I do not know how the poor people in the cities and towns are able to live, having regard to the prices they have to pay for everything.  They are well fleeced.  I oppose this motion, not that I have any anxiety other than the anxiety to see the farmers doing well, but all sections of the community must be considered and I stand up for the section least able to bear the burden.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to the speeches made in this debate. Some statements were made in support of the motion that do not tally with my experience.  Senator Counihan and, I think, Senator O'Dwyer stated &mdash;I have seen reports of the same statement by persons outside this House&mdash;that the dairying industry is <Col N="970" /> the foundation of our live-stock industry, that we would have no young stock if we had not the dairying industry. I come from a county which is not a dairying county, but I dare say that it and the neighbouring counties, which are not dairying counties either, produced more young stock in the past than any of the dairying counties. The greatest fairs for store cattle in Ireland were in the West, where dairying is not carried on.  When I was young, small farmers in my county produced and reared young cattle which they sold off at one and a half or two years of age to the graziers in the midlands and eastern counties.  We know that Ballinasloe, Balla and other places in the West of Ireland were the main centres from which young dry stock came rather than the dairying counties.</P>
      <P>A statement made by Senator MacCabe will sound strange to most people.  When they consider what is paid for liquid milk here in the city and in the towns, they will be surprised to hear that Senator MacCabe, representing the dairying industry, would be quite satisfied to get 9d. per gallon for his milk.  I cannot understand why the producers of milk would not, instead of turning it into butter, consider the possibility of selling the milk in liquid form or why some organisation is not set up whereby the people, particularly the young people, would get adequate supplies of milk. This is a milk-producing country but the consumption of milk is less here than in most countries.  As a result of that, quite a number of our people suffer from malnutrition.  I do not think that an industry that can live only with the aid of subsidies is an economic industry or is worth carrying on.  I do not mind an expedient to get over a temporary difficulty but the sooner we consider the reorganisation of an industry that has to live permanently on subsidies and to be artificially fed, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Cú Uladh and with Senator Healy as to the undesirability of increasing the price of butter at present.  We know that it is the only form of fat available to poor <Col N="971" /> people, not only in the cities but in the country.  There is no margarine available at present, such as was available in the last war, so that butter is practically the only fat available.  The price of dripping is fixed but most people know that it cannot be had&mdash;at all events, at the price fixed.  Dripping is being called by fancy names and is being sold at fancy prices instead of at the fixed price.  If the only way of keeping the dairying industry alive were to increase the price of butter, I would oppose such an increase.</P>
    <P>I do not know that the alternative suggested by Senator O'Dwyer&mdash;to increase the subsidy&mdash;is much better than the other proposal.  Producing milk at 5d. or 6d. per gallon is not a worth-while business for the farmer. What I should like most to see would be some reorganisation of the industry whereby milk, in its natural liquid form, would be available&mdash;at, of course, a reasonable price to the farmer.  I believe it could be supplied at a lower price than the people of Dublin and some other cities have to pay for it. That would be my outlook on the whole question&mdash;that we should go in much more for the supply of milk to the children, and people generally, and encourage its consumption.  That, I believe, would meet the difficulties which the farmers are up against, because I do not think that we shall ever again see the day when producing milk for the English market will be an economic proposition.  Even if that were an open market and things were normal, you could not compete with places like New Zealand and Denmark. Even before the war, that was happening. We shall have to turn our energies in another direction rather than produce for the English market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to steer a, more or less, middle course on this motion.  I do, certainly, think that this year and next winter the country generally, and especially Dublin, will be faced with a serious milk problem. It was so last winter.  I do not at this late hour propose to cover the field which was traversed by the various speakers but, before the Minister <Col N="972" /> speaks, I wish to put a few queries to him in order to get enlightenment.</P>
      <P>One thing I would like to ask the Minister is, has he any method of comparing the cost of cold storing butter that is produced in the summer against the relative cost of winter produced butter?  To my mind, the big difficulty with the dairying industry and the milk-producing industry is that production has to take place practically during the summer months.  I do not agree with that system.  Coming from a farming district in which there was always and I hope always will be a mixed farming industry I can definitely say that there are no places in Ireland that I have seen, and I have seen a good few of them, that I can compare with greater similarity than Wexford and South Cork.  They are certainly farmed on the very same lines, and the aim of farmers there is to produce on the land the crops and the fodder that will maintain live stock during the winter, so that they will have cows calving and maintaining milk production during the winter.  In this debate I should like to get the comparative figures for the amount of milk produced and delivered at the creameries during the winter and summer months.  My personal belief is that in Limerick and Tipperary, and in these places that are known as the dairying districts, the milk is practically all produced in the summer.  I can speak from actual knowledge and say that the cows that come up from these districts during the winter apparently are not half fed.  It is a disgrace to see the quality of the cattle that come up to Dublin from these districts&mdash;old cows from places which are supposed to be the mainstay of the dairying industry.  It seems to me to be absolutely wrong that these cattle should come up in such a poor condition from what are supposed to be the principal dairying districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately disease is rampant among such stock, and without a perfect knowledge of the situation I feel that there must be something very wrong with the maintenance of these cattle during the winter time.  They are apparently half-starved and badly housed.  I am saying things now that some people may object to, but they <Col N="973" /> are absolute facts.  It is a very unfortunate thing from the point of view of the person examining these cattle <i>post-mortem</i> and <i>ante-mortem</i> to see the poor condition in which they are in generally.</P>
    <P>There is one redeeming feature, if you could call it such, that these cattle are selling at fancy prices now.  Those which sold at £1 a few years ago now fetch £10.  They are used in the canning industry.  It seems to me that the whole system of milk production in the vicinity of cities, and also throughout the country, must get careful consideration. Prices were given by Senator MacCabe indicating what is being paid in country districts compared with those in Dublin district milk producing counties.  I understand producers have to give a guarantee to produce so much milk to supply the Dublin market, but the price is much greater than what is given for milk in the creamery districts. Even with the guarantee, I understand that the contract was not fulfilled, and during the winter months there was a shortage of milk for delivery in the city.  Quite recently the Department of Local Government had to call on the country creameries to supply milk to the City of Dublin. Senator O'Connell mentioned that we should devise some system of producing milk to be consumed in a liquid state.  With the present transport difficulties, however, that is absolutely impossible. It often occurred to me, even before the present time, that there should be properly refrigerated carriages on the railways.  That has not materialised.  With or without refrigerated carriages, it is an impossibility, in view of the present transport difficulties, to bring milk from districts in Limerick, Cork and Kerry, to Dublin, in a satisfactory state.  It has not arrived in a satisfactory state, and that is mainly due to delays in transit.</P>
    <P>I am afraid we cannot get over these delays at present.  To facilitate Dublin, Meath and Wicklow, the counties interested in the Dublin milk district, I feel also that there must develop a <Col N="974" /> system of winter dairying.  There is no place in the country where that is being done as consistently as in the city itself.  Even with the increased price in the Dublin district contracts were not fulfilled and it is hard to believe when that happens that the price is satisfactory for farmers turning milk into butter in country districts.  The unfortunate thing is that all the milk in these so-called dairying districts is produced in a lazy manner in the summer, and there is no proper provision made for the maintenance and housing of the cattle and the production of milk during the winter.  The question I have been hearing since I was a child is: Does winter dairying pay?  I would like to put that question to any Senator or even to the Minister. I would like to raise also the question as to the comparative cost of the storage of butter produced in the summer, as it is stored at present, against the possibly increased cost of producing that butter in the winter time and selling it without storage.</P>
    <P>Senator Cú Uladh mentioned that no farmer should have to buy anything in order to maintain his cattle.  That was the system when I was growing up. Indian meal was bought for pigs but for nothing else.  Apart from that everything necessary for the feeding of stock was produced on the farm.</P>

      <P>Seventy acres of land in West Cork or Wexford is not such a big farm, but it is bigger than the average farm.  I have not seen much of Cavan, but I do not think <Col N="975" /> Cavan could be similar to the counties I referred to.  I am speaking of the position where production takes place entirely in summer, where there are no cows calving in winter, no milk being produced, and where cows are neglected.  Certainly they must be neglected when they are left outside when there is no pasturage, and where the farmers do not grow anything from the soil to maintain the cattle during the winter.  The housing system must be bad, too.  I can see that the system is bad, that it is not economic, and in the interests of the country and of the health and appearance of our stock it should be altered.  I include Tipperary as well as Limerick.  The incidence of disease in the cattle there is very much higher than in most of the counties I know, but cattle from the West are amazingly free from tuberculosis.  I cannot say why that should be as the housing conditions could not be much better.  The smaller number of cattle that come from the West seem to be much better cared for.  They are amazingly free from tuberculosis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The pigs are free because they are very often fed on milk from these cattle.  There was a time even in Limerick when the separated milk was allowed to go to waste.  I do not know whether that occurs now.  I presume that a large quantity of the separated milk is used in the condensed milk factory.  If the factory was not there to utilise the separated milk, I do not know what would happen to the surplus milk and the separated milk that is produced during the summer if calves or pigs are not kept.  Of course there is none during the winter.  I appreciate the fact that something must be done to encourage milk production for the coming winter.  My suggestion is that milk produced in the winter, to be sold in liquid form or in the form of butter, should be subsidised <Col N="976" /> to some extent but not to such an extent as would increase very much the price to the consumer.  We must remember that during the last war the price of butter went to 3/6, 4/- and even 4/6 per lb.  We do not want that to occur again.  It might be all right for farmers, but it would be bad for the nation and the community as a whole. On the other hand, we do not want to go back to the time when butter was sold at 6d. per lb.  In conclusion, I suggest either an increased price for butter produced in winter time or a subsidy to maintain winter production, because it will help the maintenance of cattle for production during the summer.  At present, I do not think the system is sound at all.</P>

      <P>I may say that a consideration that influenced me in calling on Senator Baxter was that his name is attached to the motion.  He had an opportunity of speaking earlier when he formally seconded the motion, but he did not avail of that opportunity. However, with the assent of the House, I was agreeable to hear the Senator until 9.30 p.m.  It seems to me now that in view of the provisions of the Standing Order, and the feeling of the Seanad generally, it might be as well if the Senator would move the adjournment of the debate at this point.</P>
