      <P>We shall wait for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health before proceeding with item No. 1 on the Order Paper.  With regard to item No. 2, motion in the name of Senator Quirke, there is no certainty that the Minister for Education will be available this evening as the Education Estimates are at the moment under consideration in the Dáil.  Should the Minister be free to attend the Seanad later in the evening, we shall then take motion No. 2. As regards item No. 3, resumed motion in the name of Senator Douglas, there is a communication from Senator Douglas intimating that he will be unavoidably absent from the Seanad this evening and asking to have further consideration of the motion postponed until the next sitting day.  I take it that the Seanad agrees to that course?</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1247" /> In sub-section (1), line 41, after the word &ldquo;committee&rdquo; and within the brackets to insert the words &ldquo;or the board of management of a hospital&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment, I hope, will clear up a situation which is puzzling many of us at the moment.  The section as it stands empowers the Minister whenever he so thinks fit, to &ldquo;declare any particular board or committee (other than a pier or harbour authority or a vocational education committee), not less than half the members of which are required to be appointed by two or more rating authorities severally, to be a joint body within the meaning and for the purposes of the Principal Act&rdquo;. The consequence of such a declaration would be that the Minister would be empowered, as he thought fit, to appoint a manager for such a joint body. It strikes one at once that there are certain exceptions made by the Minister to this power.  It will not apply to a pier or harbour authority or to a vocational education committee.  I understand that the Minister on the Second Reading of the Bill a week ago explained that the reason for these exceptions did not lie in the nature of the work which these bodies performed but that they came under the authority of another Department as well as of his Department and he did not think, therefore, that the Minister of one Department should have such authority over a body that was really responsible to two Departments.  One assumes from what he said that he did not consider or did not intend to consider &mdash; I do not know whether he had already made up his mind on the matter &mdash; any other reason for making exceptions to this power.</P>
    <P>I think the House will see that my amendment raises a point which, whichever way it is decided, whether <i>pro or con</i>, needs to be considered on its own merits.  The amendment seeks to insert the words &ldquo;or the board of management of a hospital&rdquo; within the brackets, so as to make the board of a hospital also exempt from this power which it is proposed to give to the Minister.  I think it is clear that a <Col N="1248" /> hospital is a completely different sort of undertaking from the ordinary undertakings that have been committed to the control of managers in the past or for which provision is being made at present.  The manager of a local authority must be an excellent man of business.  That is the first essential for his work.  Apart from being an expert in business methods, he need not be an expert in anything else.  He is an expert in business methods and business management, or he ought to be, but he is not an expert in any other particular line of activity. In the case of the management of a hospital, one has to consider that the duties are not merely a matter of business which any man of business ability can perform, but a matter which requires expert knowledge.  A person who manages a hospital should have, undoubtedly, an expert and technical knowledge of medical matters.  He should be familiar with the work that goes on in a hospital as no layman can be.  He should know what have been the practices and the usages of hospitals in the past and what practices and usages have been abandoned as being cumbersome or burdensome or because they were wasteful of time and money.  I take it that the man who is likely to be appointed manager under this Bill will be, first of all, a capable business man, a man of ability in administrative and executive work, but the matters which I have mentioned as appertaining to medical work, are matters with which he as a business man can have no familiarity.  Therefore, I suggest he is not a person who should be given the management of a hospital and put in a position in which he is deemed to be technically superior to the rest of the staff of the hospital.</P>
    <P>It has been said to me that at present hospitals are managed by boards. They are under the control of boards, of course, but the board of a hospital has one or more expert advisers.  The largest hospitals which we have in this country unfortunately &mdash; I say unfortunately, because if there were not need for them, they would not be so big &mdash; are the mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is a committee in control, but <Col N="1249" /> there is a resident medical superintendent. The resident medical superintendent, though not technically the supreme authority in the house, is, undoubtedly, the practical authority over all matters that are purely professional. I do not know how far a board could instruct him on his own affairs, but I do know that it would not be tolerated either by the public, the Department of Local Government, or the Minister.  Where a medical superintendent is brought into contact with the lay members of a board, he is almost certain to establish good working methods with them and the board are anxious to establish good working methods with him.  They regard him as their expert adviser on professional matters and they get on very well. You have very rarely any instance of friction between resident medical superintendents and lay boards.  You find that they work generally in happy comradeship and co-operation.</P>
    <P>But, it is an entirely different proposition to consider if instead of putting in a group of men on a board of that kind who will establish a <i>modus vivendi</i> with the superintendent, you put in one man as a supreme authority.  There may be certain persons who are difficult to get on with, but if you take any board, you find it is composed of average sensible men. Very often they are men of great administrative ability.  There may be some cranky people among them, difficult to get on with, or faddists, but the weight of the board or committee will move on a fairly steady line and they will, practically always, I think, realise that in their medical adviser they have a source of advice from which they should not differ.  If you have a single manager as dictator &mdash;I do not use the word offensively&mdash; as the supreme authority in the place and in a position to give orders to the resident medical superintendent or to a professional staff, you have a different position.  Instead of having an expert giving advice to a sensible body of men, you have an expert giving advice to one man, who, on those matters, knows no more than anybody else.</P>
    <P>He is not likely to form a sensible <Col N="1250" /> opinion, or his attitude is not likely to conduce to the same happy co-operation as exists between boards and their medical advisers.  I am not at all suggesting that such happy co-ordination might not in some cases be established, but the mere fact that there are two people concerned and that one is an authority over the other, is likely to lead to a rather arbitrary attitude on the part of the one in authority.  There is a certain hierarchy of authority established which is not necessarily the best, and I do not think that the Seanad should encourage the Government to establish a position such as that, in which considerable danger of friction might occur, and considerable embarrassment in the working of the institution. I am not clear yet as to what institutions this clause would really apply if it should become law.  I am not sure, for instance, whether the Minister has the power at present over our mental hospitals of appointing a manager. Would the Minister say what the position is?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>That opens up a very wide field and, although I am not entitled to discuss it on this amendment, most of what I have been saying applies to that position which will arise when the Principal Act comes into force.  I can only hope that the arguments have been fully before the Minister and that they may make him extremely slow to act under these powers and to appoint managers for such institutions as these&mdash;technical institutions, where technical knowledge is required for the due carrying out of their work.  I am not suggesting at all that a great deal of improvements might not be made in the management of our hospitals, whether local authority hospitals or others, but I do not conceive the best way to <Col N="1251" /> do it is to take authority from the people who perform the best work of the hospital and have the necessary professional knowledge.</P>
      <P>I suppose I have to make the Minister a present of the mental hospitals, as he has already got them in his grip, but there are certain other hospitals which may be affected, though it is not quite clear yet which they may be. As a layman, I find it extremely hard to track the different provisions from one Act to another.  I am not sure how far the grip of this Section 3 will carry, but I gather it will apply to some hospitals in special circumstances, namely the teaching hospitals. Before I mention teaching hospitals, I want to point out that some of the mental hospitals are, also, teaching hospitals, and the only place where students can get instruction in that very important branch of medical work. But, there are, I believe, some others of our teaching hospitals which are not immediately affected by this provision but which are liable to be affected if the Bill passes, and if the Minister thinks fit to take the step which this section will enable him to take.  In particular, I have in mind the position of the Fever Hospital in Dublin commonly known as Cork Street Fever Hospital.  Cork Street Fever Hospital is in rather a peculiar position.  It is an old voluntary hospital, over 100 years in existence, established by voluntary funds and administered by voluntary boards of governors for something over a century.  It has conferred great benefits on the people of Dublin through all that time, making provision, before public provision was made, for people suffering from infectious diseases, and maintaining a high standard of charity, skill and devotion in the interests of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time came when it was thought fit to alter its constitution in such a way as to appear to strengthen it, by bringing in representatives of local authorities, and a board was established by the Dublin Fever Hospital Act of 1936, which contained representatives of certain local authorities in addition to a persistent representation of the old <Col N="1252" /> board of governors, representing the board which had managed the hospital for, I think, about 116 years previous to that.  Various local authorities were empowered to appoint representatives to this joint board&mdash;the Corporation of Dublin and the County Dublin local authority&mdash;and there were a number of representatives of the old governors, who still persisted as governors' representatives, and whose presence there on that board is a guarantee that the old traditions of that hospital, which were such a credit to generations of governors, and such a benefit to the City of Dublin, should be carried on in the future of the hospital.</P>
    <P>As far as I can understand, it may be possible for this section to apply to such a hospital as the Cork Street Hospital.  At the moment, while the present board of health is in existence, I do not think the section would apply, because not half of the present Cork Street Board are, I think, appointed by the local authorities, but the board of health will presumably go as a result of recent legislation, and that will alter the constitution of the Cork Street Board, I am informed, in such a way as to make it come within the Minister's grasp and the grasp of this section.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a disaster if such a power were given to the Minister.  I am not suggesting at all that the Minister would be in a hurry to use it, but, when we give a power into the hands of a Minister, it is presumed that some Minister will use it at some time.  Although our present Minister might hesitate to interfere so gravely with the traditions and history of a famous institution, it must be supposed that at some other time some other Minister, without the same interests and sympathies, might think it proper to appoint a manager in charge of the institution.  Cork Street, in addition to its special history, as a hospital built up by the charitable citizens of Dublin, and to that extent the gift to the public by certain charitable people during the last 140 years, has also a duty to perform in addition to caring for the sick poor.  It has the duty of teaching an <Col N="1253" /> important branch of infectious diseases to the medical students of Dublin.  Particularly during recent years it has built up a reputation for teaching and for research which goes far beyond what had been the reputation of Dublin before.  Unfortunately, Dublin for many generations had plenty of material for such teaching. It has been systematised and made scientific within recent years in a way which was never done before. I cannot believe that such a change as the putting of an institution like that, which is not merely a hospital but a seat of learning and research, under the care of a lay manager, can take place without doing considerable harm to the institution.  I am not afraid that the Minister is likely to take this step even if he gets the power, but I would appeal to him not to take the power.  I would appeal to him to accept the amendment which I have proposed, or some other amendment which would have the same effect.</P>
    <P>Apparently he cannot make that effective as regards the other groups of hospitals of which I spoke, but he can in regard to those of which Cork Street is an example.  I am not sure that there are not other teaching hospitals in other centres which may be affected as Cork Street is.  It is very difficult to anticipate how far this section may reach, but I would appeal to the Minister to consider this matter carefully and sympathetically, and not to do anything which would cause anxiety to those whose heart has been in the work of that institution for many years, and some of whose families have been interested in it for over a century.  I should say that Senator Douglas, who was associated with me in this amendment, has had to leave Ireland for the moment and, therefore, cannot be here to support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I gathered from Senator Rowlette that he was not here <Col N="1254" /> when I pointed out that the reason why we had excluded ports and harbours authorities and vocational education committees from the terms of the section was that they do not in any circumstances come under the control of the Minister for Local Government, and that, therefore, I would not introduce a Bill dealing with them. Apart altogether from that, there is in the course of drafting at the moment a comprehensive Bill which will deal with the position of ports and harbours authorities in the country.  As far as the position of vocational education committees is concerned, that was dealt with by the Act of 1930.  I should say that I have considered the proposed amendment very carefully.  I am sorry, but I think that it would stultify us if we were to exclude hospitals from the scope of the section. In considering the section, we have got to take a long view.  It was not drafted with particular reference to hospitals.  There are drainage boards and other joint bodies of like constitution where this position might arise. We have taken the long view, and we have assumed &mdash; as the Oireachtas has definitely adopted the managerial principle in relation to local administration&mdash;that, where it is clear that the local authority has the major interest and major responsibility for conducting, and particularly for financing, the hospital, there is no sound logical reason for excluding such an institution from the application of the managerial principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us think of what is proposed here, that where not less than half of the board of management of an institution &mdash; not merely a hospital, but any institution or undertaking which is in existence at the present time or which might be brought into existence in the future&mdash; is representative of or is nominated by two or more rating authorities, then the Minister may, if he thinks that the circumstances render it desirable, apply the managerial system to that particular organisation, whatever it may be.  I think that it is illogical and an undue reflection upon the members of the local rating authorities that the Oireachtas &mdash; having decided that where they only jointly participate <Col N="1255" /> in the management of an undertaking it is not necessary to apply the managerial system to that undertaking &mdash;should decide that, where the members of the local authority are wholly responsible for financing the undertaking in question and for prescribing general policy in regard to it, then they are not fit to administer its concerns and a manager has to be put in.  It would seem to me that, where there is a joint undertaking, where the committee of management represents not one single local authority, but is composed of two or more local authorities with perhaps competing interests, that if there is a need to apply the managerial system at all it exists in, I would almost say, a larger way in regard to the administration of joint undertakings, because I doubt whether those joint undertakings get the same sort of careful consideration which we know is given to an undertaking under the sole management of a local authority.  I doubt that, but whether they do or not I think is really beside the point.</P>
    <P>So far as hospitals are concerned, the principle has already been decided, because most of the hospitals&mdash;certainly, those widespread throughout the country &mdash; are already under the control of the local authorities, and to them the Oireachtas has already decided to apply the managerial system. Senator Rowlette referred to mental hospitals.  I cannot recall a single case of a district mental hospital to which, as soon as the Principal Act comes into operation, the managerial system will not apply.  It will, certainly, apply to county hospitals and to county hospitals which are, at the same time, teaching hospitals, to sanatoria, to district hospitals and, where the local authority has sole responsibility for the management, to fever hospitals.  The principle of applying the managerial system to hospital administration has already been accepted by the Oireachtas.  In the light of that, I think it may be said that this issue has already been decided.</P>
    <P>That fact does indicate that the Oireachtas does not believe &mdash; and that would be the only justification for this <Col N="1256" /> amendment &mdash; that the application of the managerial principle to hospital administration will lead to vexatious interference with the medical staff in the proper discharge of their duties. What it does mean, perhaps, is that the Oireachtas recognises that this work of administration &mdash; seeing that the boiler-man does his job, that the stores are properly kept and that the buildings are maintained in proper repair&mdash;is not really work for a professional man or for a medical man, as such, but is work for a trained administrator. Having taken that view, I do not think that we can assume that the vexatious interference which Senator Rowlette fears is likely to arise in the case of any of these joint boards.  In that connection, we have to bear in mind that more and more responsibility and a larger and larger share of the financial burden of running these institutions is being thrown back on the local authorities and the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>In almost every case now the ratepayers provide by far the greater part of the finance in respect of these institutions. That is so, I think, in the case of Cork Street Fever Hospital.  More of these joint bodies may come into existence, because the natural desire, so far as the development of medical and hospital services is concerned, is to associate the local authorities with these hospitals, and to get them to pay a reasonable proportion of the cost of the services they render to the citizens. The general tendency will, therefore, be to impose a greater share of the burden upon the local authorities and the ratepayers.  When we have said that it is proper, in the interests of the protection of the ratepayers, to apply the managerial system to hospitals which are under the sole control of local authorities, there is, I think, no good ground, in principle at any rate, for excepting the joint undertaking where the majority of the committee of management or of the trustees of what ever board may be administering the hospital are representative of the local authorities, and where, because they have this representation, the local authorities have to carry the major portion of the expense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> Senator Rowlette has said that it has been comparatively easy to work with the committees when they have been numerous, when they have represented even conflicting interests, and when they consisted of laymen.  He said that the professional men connected with the administrative side found it comparatively easy to work with these bodies.  If arrangements between lay committees, on the one hand, and professional men, on the other hand, have worked satisfactorily, it is likely that the new system will work even more satisfactorily, because the medical men will now have to deal with a trained administrator, with a person who will not be subject to the same sort of conflicting motives which often animate even the best of assemblies or the best of boards.  They will be dealing with a person who will himself be responsible to the general public, and, of course, to a committee also for the administration of the institution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Senator Rowlette seemed to be under the impression that the joint board would disappear. The board will remain in exactly the same position as the local authority at present and the manager or his deputy&mdash;presumably, he will appoint a deputy in a case of this sort &mdash;will be responsible to the joint board. Everything it has been sought to secure by constituting the boards of these hospitals as they are at present will be achieved &mdash; even with the manager.  The Senator has suggested that the representatives of the original committees of these hospitals might consent to sit on the boards and see that the old traditions of the institutions were preserved. There will be no change in that regard.  They will still be able to do so and to make representations to the manager.  If a conflict arises between the manager and the medical staff, they will be there and, if necessity arises, <Col N="1258" /> they will, no doubt, arbitrate between them.  It is not intended that they should disappear.  The only thing we are asking is that, if it becomes manifest that it is in the public interest to apply this managerial system to existing institutions or to institutions which may come into existence in the future, we shall be able to do it.  It seemed to me, when I commenced to consider this whole question, that, owing to the manifold activities in which local authorities are tending to engage and the needs which may have to be met in the future by institutions devised <i>ad hoc,</i> the proper thing to do, when bringing this managerial principle into operation, would be to take such powers as would enable us to give effect to it wherever the need for it seemed to have arisen.  It is with this end in view that the section was drafted in the form in which it now is.</P>

In the case of Laoighis-Offaly it does not matter, for the county manager will become the manager.</P>

      <P>With most of the Minister's speech I have no concern at all, because he was dealing with a matter that I had not raised.  He was dealing with a general advocacy of the county management system.  I know that is a settled question.  I did not raise it, but I have asked for an exception in a particular case.  The Minister refuses, as far as I can make out, to concede what I had asked in the amendment, that these hospitals should be excluded from the Bill.  I take it that that is so and that the Minister is declining to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister then to consider the matter a bit further, to see if he could not make some slight modification of the terms of the section which might at least meet some of the objections which a good many people feel.  These objections are not peculiar to myself. They are felt not only by members of my profession, but by many people interested in the working of hospitals. The other point is as regards the teaching hospitals.  The Minister went so far as to say that he would make no special concession as regards the teaching hospitals.  I would like to press him to consider whether the local authority, acting through the manager, is likely to be as helpful to the freedom and the scientific outlook of a teaching establishment as the local authority by itself would be.  Another point I ask the Minister to consider is the alteration of some words.  He might consider amending the clause which specifies &ldquo;not less than half of the members&rdquo;. If he were to say &ldquo;more than half&rdquo; it might take away some of the objections.  I think it would probably meet the objections or fear that might possibly be aroused in Cork Street. The Minister is not giving away very much in that.  He has made the case that where a local authority contributes the major part of the funds or constitutes the majority of the governing body the managerial system should hold.  In what way the managerial system is regarded as a sop to the local authority I have not been able to <Col N="1260" /> understand.  I had not regarded the managerial system as a recognition of local authority.  I have always regarded it as rather a denial.  Apparently I am wrong.  That, however, is not very relevant to what we are discussing.  I ask the Minister to consider very carefully the question of accepting these words &ldquo;more than half&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;not less than half&rdquo;.  It only makes a difference of one in the constitution of the board.  I noticed in his plea at the end, when he came to tell us of the power of the local authority, that all he said was that they would be able to make recommendations, but they had no power to insist on their being carried out.  The manager has power to act on the recommendations, but they are not mandatory upon him, so that we are left with the very thin consolation that the local authority has power to consider a matter and make recommendations.  We are told that the Board of Cork Street may make recommendations to the manager and thereby carry on the traditions of the hospital.  That gives us no great security, and I hope the Minister will consider making these concessions.</P>

      <P>I just want to say that I will look into the points which the Senator has mentioned.  I think if he looks at Section 29 of the Principal Act he will find</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any council of a county or any elective body at a meeting specially summoned for the purpose under this section, may by resolution proposed and passed in accordance with this section require any particular act, matter, or thing specifically mentioned in such resolution and which such council or the county manager for such county or such elective body or the manager for such elective body (as the case may be) can lawfully do, to be done in exercise or performance of the executive functions of such council or body.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I sympathise with Senator Rowlette, but I am afraid his grievance is against the Principal Act rather than this particular Bill.  I understand from what has been said, and from my understanding of the Principal Act, that when the managerial system is applied the manager will take over certain powers of the local authorities in regard to the boards of the hospitals, but in this particular Bill we cannot add to or subtract from the powers of the boards of the hospitals.  The position, when this Bill becomes an Act, will be that Cork Street Hospital Board will retain its members from Dublin Corporation and the county council.  The county council would have a manager instead of the secretary.</P>

      <P>I do not know what we could do about that except to alter the Principal Act, and we cannot do that in this particular discussion.  The joint board in the teaching hospitals still will exist and still will be dealing with members of local bodies.  With regard to the exercise of certain functions, it will have to deal with managers, but unless the Principal Act makes the manager a dictator with regard to the hospitals, then as far as this section is concerned, he gets no more powers than he had before.  If we were voting on this particular amendment, I am not quite clear as to what we would be accomplishing. Regarding the further suggestion made by Senator Rowlette, I take it that that depends on whether or not the local body is the principal contributor to the hospitals rather than on the number of members appointed.</P>

      <P>With regard to the teaching hospitals, I will look into that; but I want to say that there is a number of teaching hospitals managed by local bodies, which are public hospitals run by local bodies, such as in Galway and Cork.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put this amendment down as a result of what we heard from the Minister on the Second Stage, and to contest the point that a person who has been made by the Minister a commissioner acting for a local body should be in a priority or privileged position when a manager is being selected.  The Principal Act lays down the priority principle.  The secretary of a county council and other such officials are given priority, that is to say, if a county manager is to be selected, the Local Appointments Commissioners have the obligation to consider, in the first instance, the county secretary, I think, and only when they consider that he is not a proper person can they go on to consider any other candidate.  The Minister has gone a step further in this particular Bill, and has placed a commissioner appointed by himself in the position of, I think, third preference, so that other qualified people are only considered after the Local Appointments Commissioners <Col N="1263" /> have come to the conclusion that the commissioner is not a qualified person.</P>
    <P>In this particular amendment I do not wish to raise a discussion on, or to contest, the priority principle in the Principal Act, or the whole commissioner scheme.  I recognise that commissioners are necessary sometimes, and I have nothing against any particular commissioner.  I know some who are particularly well qualified, and I have some knowledge of the two persons mentioned by Senator Quirke as having given great satisfaction in their areas.  I have nothing against any individual, but merely look at it from the point of view of filling the post.  The Minister selects the commissioners generally from the ranks of the Civil Service, I think; he rarely selects a commissioner from, let us say, the staff of the Dublin Corporation.  Let us take the Dublin Corporation as an example merely to illustrate my case.  A great many years ago the Dublin Corporation displayed great enlightenment by selecting its clerks on an open competitive basis.  That was, I remember, a very considerable step forward.  The main clerical offices are filled by persons who got into the corporation service by that particular method.</P>
    <P>Some of them have, in the interval, got university degrees, some have been called to the Bar, and many have very wide experience of local government in so far as it applies to the City of Dublin.  I take it that that experience would be useful in other parts of the country.  If a managerial post became vacant, some of those people obviously would be qualified, if they cared to apply for it.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why a person who applies from the City of Dublin, the City of Cork or a county like Galway, should find himself in a position that a commissioner with, perhaps, only a few months' experience&mdash;by the mere fact that he was selected by the Minister to be a commissioner &mdash; is not only a candidate but a candidate in a privileged position, who must be considered in a certain priority before any other employee of a local body or any other person who has got experience which the Local Appointments <Col N="1264" /> Commissioners may deem suitable. For the purpose of this particular amendment, I am not questioning that the Local Appointments Commissioners will do their best to recommend the most suitable person.  Since the passing of the Local Bodies (Employees) Act the particular Act setting up the Local Appointments Commissioners, a considerable number of people have been appointed by them to various posts throughout the country.  None of those is likely to be appointed a commissioner by this Minister or any other Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and I would like to hear why those who were appointed through the Local Appointments Commissioners, in the first instance because of their experience and qualifications &mdash; either university or professional qualifications &mdash; should now have to wait until a commissioner has been considered.</P>
    <P>This seems to me an inequitable proceeding, which would need more justification than the Minister has given. From the point of view of the commissioners, I do not see what injustice would accrue to them by their being taken out of the position given to them here.  I accept that the Minister for Local Government, whoever he is, will do his best, when appointing a commissioner, to get a competent person and that the person will have, say, a good Civil Service record.</P>
    <P>That being so, there will be added to that Civil Service record an experience as commissioner.  Then the post of county manager will become vacant, and that particular commissioner can present to the Local Appointments Commissioners and to the selection board his experience in the Civil Service, his special selection by the Minister, his special experience, and his experience as commissioner.  The Local Appointments Commissioners are to consider all that and give it due weight.  I do not see why he should be put in a better position than that. The Minister's choice is limited in practice.  I do not understand why the people he has chosen should get a special position when a Manager is to be appointed.  On that ground, it seems to me that this particular sub-section should be deleted, and that, <Col N="1265" /> with the exception of the priorities arranged in the Principal Act, there should be a fair field and no favour for all the people who think they have, or have in fact, qualifications for the position of manager.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to make this point quite clear.  The selection board only applies to persons who are acting as commissioners for county councils or for boards of health at the date of the passing of the Act. I think that will dispose of the objection which Senator Hayes has directed against the section, that it would be possible for a person who had only held office for a month to get priority simply because of the fact that he has been appointed by the Minister a commissioner for one or other of those bodies.</P>
      <P>I think if this Bill goes through, as expeditiously as I hope, it will be quite clear that there will be no question of the Minister appointing commissioners either to administer counties or boards of health before the limit, which is imposed by the definition section of the Act, begins to operate.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Of these seven commissioners, one is, in fact, secretary of a county council and has already secured his priority under the Principal Act.  Another is the commissioner who is acting for the Dublin County Council and the Dublin Board <Col N="1266" /> of Public Health, Balrothery and Rathdown Boards of Assistance.  There are only five persons who would benefit by the provisions of this section and all of these have been acting for considerable periods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He would be an existing commissioner, but I do not think he would be eligible under the section in respect of every appointment he has held since 1924.  The next thing we have to consider is that, first of all, existing secretaries of county councils and existing secretaries of boards of health get priority of consideration in respect to their own counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they are not found to be suitable for appointment as county managers in their own counties, they then, under the Principal Act, get priority in respect of other counties, and the practical problem which we have in front of us is, that we feel that the number of persons who have had the necessary experience to become county managers is at the moment somewhat limited. On the other hand, we have a number of people who have had considerable experience in respect of such county management, and are we going to allow the present position to exist, which would mean that they would not arise at all for consideration until those officers who have been deemed to be unsuitable for appointment as county managers in their own counties have been considered?  It seems to me that the simplest way out of the dilemma would be to say that in counties where the councils are not suspended we shall not touch existing priorities of the secretary of a county council or the secretary of a board of health in respect of his own county but that we shall assert that before any person who has not been found to be suitable for appointment as manager in his own county comes to be considered in relation to another county a commissioner, if he wishes to go <Col N="1267" /> for the post &mdash; and it is again doubtful whether he will think the post sufficiently attractive &mdash; should get prior consideration.</P>
    <P>The next point arises in connection with a county which has been administered by a commissioner, and where the county secretary has been found to be suitable for the post of manager. The commissioner will ultimately be free to accept another post, in another county, and in a county where the existing county secretary or the secretary of the board of health has been found by the Local Appointments Commissioners not to be suitable for appointment, we propose that this commissioner, with the experience which he has, should be considered in priority to any other applicant for the post from another county, bearing in mind what I have already said, that in most of these appointments the persons who would arise for consideration in counties other than their own would be people whom the Local Appointments Commissioners would deem to be unsuitable for appointment in their own county.</P>
    <P>Therefore, to shorten the procedure and to ensure that these men will receive early consideration, in regard to suitability, the amendment of the Principal Act is proposed.  As I say, it affects only five of the existing seven commissioners.  Of these five, some are elderly men, some may not elect to be considered and others of them may not find the post financially attractive.  While I think, therefore, that there would not be such an undue interference with the competitive rights of other members of the local services and that no great harm would be done, a great deal of time may be saved and some of the existing commissioners may be encouraged to apply for county management appointments which otherwise they might not be inclined to seek.</P>

      <P>I drew the attention of the Minister on a previous occasion to the desirability of putting secretaries of county committees of agriculture on a par with secretaries of county councils and secretaries of <Col N="1268" /> boards of health in regard to these appointments.  Some of these men hold university degrees, and many of them have a good knowledge of accountancy. They are experts in agriculture and are constantly in touch with the agricultural community.  They have sprung from the land and were originally selected by competitive examination. All of them are capable men and I think they would make excellent managers.  I should like the Minister to give them a preference in these appointments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the position where we are going to have secretaries of county councils who are not regarded as suitable for posts in their own counties, available for posts in neighbouring counties.  I do not think we were thinking so much of the secretary of a county council who would not be so useful in his own county but who would still be eligible in another county. We were thinking of the individual who would be one of two where the two counties were coming under the management of one individual, and only one of them could get the appointment. If that individual is to be put into a position where he cannot get the post in the area in which he has been operating, is he not going to be put in the same position of preference in a neighbouring county, or is it the position that a man who has been acting as commissioner is going to get a preferential position as against the other official who could not possibly have got it?  It is one thing to reject the individual who is regarded as not having sufficient competence in the area in which he has functioned himself, but <Col N="1269" /> it is a different situation where you have two men of equal, or almost equal, competence.  One of them gets the post in preference to the other, but the other man goes out to compete against a man who has been commissioner in another area.  I think that the preference a man has enjoyed in the county where he has been operating should be retained by him when he goes to a neighbouring county to compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two separate cases to be considered.  First of all, there is the case where the Act comes into full operation at once, where the county council exists, and where the county is not a grouped county.  In that case the permanent county manager will be appointed, and the position of the county secretary will be that he will get absolute preference, to be followed by the preference of the commissioner after that. Where the counties are grouped, we have endeavoured by paragraph 4 of Section 1 to preserve for each of the county secretaries the priority of consideration he would get when the first appointment is being made.  I think the case Senator Baxter has referred to is that where a county is a grouped county, where the permanent manager is appointed for a group of counties, and where he happens to be one of the county secretaries.  He is concerned with the case of the other county secretary, who has to go elsewhere to look for another appointment.  There we have to balance up the fact that we have commissioners who have had long experience, men who have long carried the responsibility of a county manager and have had experience of the post. With the exception of one county secretary administering a county board of health, no county secretary has yet had managerial experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man may be a good secretary operating under the control of a commissioner, or the control of the local authority, but he may turn out to be a disappointing county manager.  On the other hand, the Local Appointments Commissioners will have this to guide them &mdash; in regard to the existing commissioners they know they have <Col N="1270" /> had this experience and they can look at their record as commissioners.  With that record in front of them, they can decide whether they are going to be suitable.  In the light of that, it would be regrettable if the Local Appointments Commissioners were precluded from considering the suitability of existing commissioners at an early stage.</P>

They would have to determine the issue of suitability on that record. In the case of that record, they have something more to go on than mere secretarial experience.  They have actual managerial experience and I think in the light of that it would be regrettable if they were to be precluded from considering, at an early stage, the only persons in the country who have actual managerial experience.</P>

      <P>I desire to ask the Minister to explain the procedure as to the receiving of applications.  Do we assume that we shall have the county secretary, the secretary of the board of health and the existing commissioners in that order?  Would the county secretary be considered first, the secretary of the board of health secondly, and the commissioner thirdly?  Will all these be applicants at the same time?  It is a point of procedure. What is running through my mind is that if three individuals are to go before a selection board on the same day, or on subsequent days, the fact that three of them are applicants would weigh the scale in favour of the commissioner if he was number three. They are considering the county secretary to-day, the secretary of the board <Col N="1271" /> of health next, and the commissioner on the day after that, and the tendency, I feel, with the selection board would not be to wait until they had interviewed the three.  The position I would like to have cleared up is: Is the county secretary considered and finished with, and do they come then to the secretary of the board of health and, if he is not suitable either, do they then come to the commissioner, who cannot be an applicant until the other two are dealt with?  My question is: Is each candidate separate or are they candidates jointly?  If there are three candidates together, the tendency will be for the selection board to say: &ldquo;We are coming to the commissioner.  He is the man the Minister sent down, and we will have to consider him before we consider any of them&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>Only if they had been rejected.  The point raised by Senator O'Donovan is one I cannot answer, because the Minister for Local Government has not the responsibility for recommending any person. Under sub-section (2) of Section 4 the responsibility is put on the Local Appointments Commissioners of recommending a person to be county manager.  How they will proceed I do not know, but they will undoubtedly have to proceed in the light of the order of priorities laid down.  They will make regulations whether applications will be received from all parties on the one day, or whether <Col N="1272" /> they will proceed to consider the county secretaries before they determine to look elsewhere for a suitable county manager.</P>

      <P>There is not so much in this as I thought in the beginning. It applies only to five people.  As a matter of fact I had in my mind that people who had spent a period of five years or more as commissioners might be left the privilege given to them in Section 4 of this amending Bill.  At the same time, the more the Minister explained it the more I was inclined to think that there was not much in it one way or the other.  The Local Appointments Commissioners must be <Col N="1273" /> deemed to be able to do their own job. If the commissioner has had this experience which makes him peculiarly suitable to be a manager, the Local Appointments Commissioners will, presumably, advert to that, and, if they have on their list a person who has that kind of experience, and who is otherwise suitable, they would presumably prefer him to a person who has not had that kind of experience. I do not know what kind of disadvantage the commissioner would suffer from in the competition if he did not get the particular privilege in this section.  However, as the number is only five, and as no others can be appointed, presumably, before this Bill becomes an Act, and as we have already established the priority system in the Principal Act, I suppose the matter is not worth dividing the House on.  But I am not so sure that there is so extremely small a number of people competent to be county managers as the Minister thinks.  I am inclined to think that character should be as important as qualifications, and we ought to have enough people of character to do the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have some further clarification of the question I raised originally.  I am not acquainted with the facts with regard to those particular areas where you have a commissioner operating in two counties, but I take it from what the Minister has said that if one of those secretaries fails, as he must, to obtain the post of manager in his own county, he will only be considered for the post in another county after the secretary of the county council, the secretary of the board of health and the possible commissioner have failed to get the appointment?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department, of course, knows what the position is in those areas, but it does seem to me that a considerable injustice might be done to a very competent individual. It is quite conceivable that you could <Col N="1274" /> have, in two adjoining counties, two of the best secretaries of county councils in the country, and one of them, in those circumstances, might absolutely fail to get the post of county manager anywhere.  I think a matter like that ought to be considered.  I think he should, at least, be on level terms with the commissioner, who may have walked into that post only two or three months before.  I think in the case of a man who may have given, perhaps, 30 years as secretary to a county council, and who would find himself excluded because of what we are doing now, it would be very hard on him, and I think it would not be wise from the point of view of local administration. Again, I say that I do not know the facts in the particular counties.  The Minister may say that in any case those individuals would not come up to the requisite level, and that there is no use in making provision for them.  If such be the case, I let the point go, but otherwise I think it ought to be possible to leave the matter open in such a way as to give that kind of man a chance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That Emergency Powers (No. 173) Order, 1942, made by the Government on the 1st day of May, 1942, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>During my almost 20 years unbroken membership of this House, I do not think that I have had to bring before it a more important matter than is contained in the motion on the Order Paper.  It may be remembered that, when this unfortunate war broke out, Parliament gave the Government very wide and, I might say, very necessary powers.  It gave them practically unlimited powers to deal with production, liberty of the person, censorship and other matters.  There was practically no limitation on the powers given to the Government, except the limitation regarding a declaration of war and the conscripting of citizens into the armed forces.  One essential safeguard was retained by Parliament. That was that the Government had to proceed by order in the exercise of the powers they got and that any Order the Government made could be raised in this House by way of motion for annulment.  It is that one remaining power which democracy possesses to-day that I am now exercising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senators turn to the basic statute under which the whole series of orders we have had during the past three years have been issued, they will find that, under Section 2, the Government <Col N="1276" /> may, whenever and so often as they think fit, make by order&mdash;I am leaving out the words that are not essential &mdash; such provisions as are, in the opinion of the Government, necessary or expedient for securing the public safety or the preservation of the State or for the maintenance of public order, or for the provision and control of supplies and services essential to the life of the community.  It goes on to set out, in a number of sub-paragraphs down to the letter (p), the various matters over which the Government is to have authority.  I want Senators to note that these orders were confined to matters which the Government considered were necessary to secure the public safety or the preservation of the State or the maintenance of public order or the provision and control of supplies and services essential to the life of the community.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it may well be asked &ldquo;How can everything a Government propose to do under an order be embodied in the order?&rdquo;  Just as in the case of an Act of Parliament it is not possible to embody every act to be done under the Act in the Act, so it is with orders.  The Government takes power, in the case of an Act, to proceed by regulation to amplify the powers it has taken, but these regulations have to be within the powers given by the primary Act.  I am only a layman but, if I am right in my contention, these subsidiary powers of operation, as one might say, were taken in sub-section (3) of Section 2.  It is a rather involved section.  Reading between the lines it shows that the Parliamentary draftsman was probably worried as to how the intention should be expressed.  If I may paraphrase the section, it is as follows:&mdash;Whenever the Government makes an emergency order, the Government may, in lieu of making provision for or doing any particular thing in or by such emergency order, authorise or empower a Minister or any other person acting on his behalf to do the said thing and for that purpose, subject to such conditions and consents as may be specified, to make, grant, or issue such instruments and give such directions as shall appear to him necessary for the said purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> Put into ordinary language, that means that the Order cannot set out all the things the Minister is to do but, if he wants to do a particular thing, he may do it by &ldquo;instrument&rdquo;&mdash;that is the actual word used.  If Senators turn to the definition clause, they will find that &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; means an order, regulation, rule, bylaw, warrant, licence, certificate &mdash; mark these last words &mdash; or other like document.  If I read that rightly, every instrument must mean a document in some form or other.  The Minister operates the Order by documentary instruments.  I think that that is a fair statement of the case.</P>
    <P>The next step, following on that Act, is the main Order &mdash; Emergency Order No. 224 of 1939.  If Senators refer to the dates, they will find that this Order was ready at the time the Act was passed.  The Act was passed on September 23rd, 1939, and the very next day this Order appeared.  Incidentally, it is rather interesting to note that, unlike a large number of subsequent Orders, this Order is only in one language.  I do not make this point for the purpose of casting ridicule on our bilingual methods.  There is a purpose, as Senators will shortly see, in these remarks.  Ever since the war began, the Government has been acting under this Order of September 23rd, 1939, and this Order derives its authority from the Emergency Powers Act passed the day before.  Now we come to Section 31 of this Order. Here I would like to read some significant words: &ldquo;The Minister, so far as appears to him to be necessary in the interests of public safety or for the preservation of the State or for maintaining supplies or services essential to the life of the community, may, by Order, provide&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;  Then it goes on to mention a very wide category of activities which the Government can pursue.</P>
    <P>We all know and we have all experience of that action under most of these headings.  They have power to regulate production, movement of commodities, transport, distribution and sale of goods, and so on.  Then in a later sub-section it reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any incidental and supplementary <Col N="1278" /> matters for which such Minister thinks it expedient for the purposes of the Order to provide, including, in particular, the entry and inspection of premises to which the Order relates by persons authorised in that behalf by such Minister, with a view to securing compliance with the Order;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and an Order under this Article may prohibit the doing of anything regulated by the Order except under the authority of a licence granted, by such authority or person as may be specified in the Order, and may be made so as to apply either to undertakings generally or to any particular undertaking or class of undertakings, and either to the whole or any part of any undertakings, and so as to have effect either throughout the State or any particular area therein.</P>
    <P>No reasonably-minded person during the last three years has had any complaint about this.  We all realise that there is a crisis and an emergency, and what very wide powers the Government is entitled to have.  I suppose it is your experience, as it is mine, to receive from time to time a number of these Orders by post.  It is only a natural temptation not to read them too carefully in many cases.  Some are dealing with technical matters such as quotas, fuel production and every conceivable activity.  I do my best to run over them to see if there is anything I consider specially important.  I happened to read very carefully Order No. 173.  It amends Article 31 of the main Order which I have just read, and I ask the House to note very carefully the vital difference between the powers taken in these two Orders.  Order No. 173 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Article 31 of the Emergency Powers Order, 1939, is hereby amended in the following respects, and shall be construed and have effect accordingly, that is to say: by the substitution of the following paragraphs for paragraph (1) that is to say:&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And here is the vital paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Minister may, by Order, or direction (which direction may be <Col N="1279" /> given either in writing or orally) provide....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to provide practically the same wide range of activities as are provided in the previous Order.  I ask you to note this, and I ask the Minister to enlighten us as to why it has been necessary to remove in this latest Order any reference to the interest of public safety, preservation of the State and the maintaining of the supplies and services essential to the life of the community.  All these limitations for what they are worth are taken out, and the Minister need no longer justify any action he takes within these limits.  He is now absolutely and completely without restriction of that kind.  But that is not the really dangerous aspect of this Order. You will note that not only can he proceed by Order, but he can proceed by oral direction, if I read the Order aright.  The Minister in his wisdom and discretion can proceed by Order, but if he thinks fit to do otherwise he has complete and omnipotent power simply by verbal direction.  Nobody will know and Parliament will not be aware of it.  His action cannot be challenged and the last vestige of control that Parliament possessed will be swept away.  The Minister will be complete and absolute dictator and, moreover, the dictatorship will be made all the more dangerous by the powers of censorship which the Government now enjoy, so that if any action is taken by oral direction of the Minister and the Government do not think fit that any reference should be made to it, either in the Parliament or the public Press, then it will not be known.  I consider that is a very serious state of affairs.</P>
    <P>It makes it hardly worth while to bear the expense of having Parliament at all.  Parliament might as well stay at home and the strain that the holding of Parliament imposes on the transport service could be saved.  I ask the House to regard this as a very serious infringement of Parliament's control, in fact, as removing the last remaining vestige of Parliamentary control that exists.  For example, the <Col N="1280" /> other day the Government took very wide powers in reference to our transport system.  Practically a dictator was appointed.  That was done by Order.  We knew it was being done and the whole wisdom of that policy could have been raised in the House.</P>
    <P>What can happen now unless I am mistaken is that the Minister or anybody authorised on his behalf can walk in to the board of a company and say: &ldquo;I do not propose you should function any longer.  I am sending down Mr. So-and-so to take over the whole company.&rdquo; I know the Minister will say that nothing of the kind is contemplated, but I submit that such action is possible under this Order.  For that reason, I feel that this matter should be within the knowledge of the House, and that the House should consider seriously, unless the Government can give some undertaking to restore in some form control by Parliament, passing this motion to annul this Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane's dramatic declaration at the beginning of his speech that this was the most important motion that he had brought before the House during his 20 years as a member may have deceived Senators as to the nature of the Order referred to in his motion.  The Order is of very minor importance.  It effects only verbal changes in Article 31 of Emergency Powers Order No. 224 of 1939. The Senator's declaration was inspired by a misunderstanding of the Order. Orders made by the Government are capable of being annulled by resolution of either House.  These Orders frequently confer upon Ministers powers to regulate particular activities by direction.  The instruments which the Minister may use in the exercise of these powers to effect the control of activities which they desire to achieve are not submitted to the Oireachtas nor are they capable of being annulled by resolution.  The powers conferred upon the Department of Supplies to control supplies or regulate the distribution or production of particular commodities were given by the Emergency Powers Order of 1939.  That Order could have been annulled by the Oireachtas by resolution.  That could not be done <Col N="1281" /> now, but it could have been done within the period specified in the Act. Article 31 of the Order is the operative Article, so far as the Department of Supplies is concerned, and the effect of Order No. 173, made by the Government, is merely to amend it in certain particulars.</P>
      <P>I will mention the particulars in which that Article has been amended, just to support my contention that the changes are of no very great importance and do not greatly increase the powers of any Minister under the Order, much less confer upon him the very wide powers which Senator Sir John Keane seems to think Ministers now have&mdash;including power to walk into a meeting of the board of directors of the Great Southern Railways and order them to pack up their bags and go.  I am not saying that the Government could not make an Order under the Emergency Powers Act which would enable them to do that or to confer on a Minister the power to do it by a new Order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Order would have to be laid on the Tables of both Houses of the Oireachtas, and could be annulled by a resolution of either House.  This Article 31 was drafted, as Senator Sir John Keane has rightly remarked, before the beginning of the emergency.  It was drafted in preparation for the emergency, and was made effective by the Government the day after the Emergency Powers Act was passed.  It has worked reasonably well, but Senators will appreciate that it was drafted at a time when knowledge of the circumstances that would be created by the emergency did not exist.  We tried to visualise what those circumstances would be, and to frame an Order which would give the Government powers to cope with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, although the Order has worked reasonably well, experience of its working over three years has indicated that, in certain respects, it was incomplete and that some of the actions taken or contemplated by the Government under it might be questionable in the courts, because of the particular phraseology used.  The question <Col N="1282" /> of amending the Article only became one of importance when it was decided to introduce a system of rationing by means of a ration book. With that decision and the distribution of ration books to facilitate any future rationing schemes that might be decided upon, it became obvious that certain verbal amendments of the Order were necessary, if the effectiveness of the regulations made concerning the use of those books was not to be impaired, or the legality of the whole procedure made questionable in the courts.  The main purpose of the amendment was to make effective the system of rationing by means of ration books.</P>
    <P>The changes which were made in Article 31 were, in the main, verbal. The Order provided for, or gave the Minister power to make, regulations providing for the production, treatment, keeping, storage, movement, transport, distribution, sale, purchase, use or consumption of articles of any description.  It was necessary to add the words, &ldquo;restricting or prohibiting&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;regulating&rdquo;. In other words, an Order made by the Minister could provide not merely for regulating the production, treatment, storage, etc., of these goods, but also could provide for restricting or prohibiting the production, distribution, keeping, etc., of these goods.</P>
    <P>The terms &ldquo;sale&rdquo; and &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; were expanded to mean &ldquo;disposal, including sale, or acquisition, including purchase&rdquo;.  The paragraph of the Order which gave power to provide for controlling the prices at which articles of any description may be sold has been expanded to give power to control the prices at which articles of any description may be purchased.  The power to provide for regulating the carrying on of any undertaking engaged in an essential work has been changed to &ldquo;the power to provide for the regulating of the carrying on of any undertaking&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;engaged in any essential work&rdquo; have been deleted because, quite obviously, the exact significance to be attached to those words could be the subject of dispute, and the question might arise at any time <Col N="1283" /> as to whether a particular undertaking was engaged in essential work.  For instance, is the distribution of tea essential?  One could think of many commodities sometimes classed as luxuries, but which ordinary people regard as essential.  It was deemed undesirable that there should be legal arguments and dispute as to the exact meaning of these terms.</P>
    <P>A new paragraph has been inserted giving power to provide for requiring persons carrying on any undertaking to keep such books, accounts and records as may be prescribed by or under the Order.  There is power taken for the inspection of, and the taking of extracts from, books, accounts, records and documents, for requiring persons to verify extracts taken from books, accounts, records and documents.  There is power taken even to take possession of temporarily, and remove for inspection the records and documents kept in such undertakings. There is a new paragraph providing for the taking of samples of articles found on the premises of persons carrying on any undertaking. There is a new paragraph providing for the display of lists of prices of articles.  That power exists at present under the Control of Prices Act, but it is considered more desirable to have the power under the Emergency Powers Act, as the procedure is simpler and the penalties are more severe than in the Control of Prices Act.  There is another provision of the same kind relating to the giving of receipts.  Again, there is power under the Control of Prices Act to require that receipts be given by traders to customers.  It is considered preferable to have that power under the Emergency Powers Act rather than under the Control of Prices Act.  These changes are, in the main, verbal changes.  We could have done without them but, as the Article had to be amended in any event, with the distribution of ration books, it was considered, in the light of the experience of the last three years, that these changes in the verbiage of the Article were required.</P>
    <P>There is also power to give directions, which can be given in any event <Col N="1284" /> under the Article of the original Order, orally as well as in writing.  I will explain the circumstances in which such power would be used.  If an inspector from the Department of Supplies in West Donegal reports a shortage of flour in a particular parish there, the obvious course for the Controller of Flour to take is to get on the telephone and to order that a ton of flour be sent for the relief of that parish. That means giving the direction orally. If we were to adhere to the terms of the Article of the 1939 Order, that direction could be given only by signed and sealed documents.  Alternatively, the trader would not be bound by the direction.  The same circumstance might arise in relation to any other commodity or any industry.</P>
    <P>By various Orders made under the Emergency Powers Order, 1939, persons engaged in different industries and trades are operating now under licence &mdash;a licence which requires them to comply with any direction that may be given to them by the Minister for Supplies.  Woollen manufacturers are required by such directions to produce cloth for military purposes in preference to cloth for civilian purposes, to a prescribed percentage of the total available quantity of yarns.  Persons engaged in various clothing industries have been directed to concentrate on the provision of utility cloths as distinct from fancy or luxury products.  In various industries that system of directing the manner in which available supplies of raw materials are to be utilised is in operation and, while it is true that, under the Article of the 1939 Order as originally framed, these directions could be given only in writing, in practice, the appropriate official of the Department of Supplies told the industrialist or trader concerned to proceed in the prescribed manner and said that the Order would come along in due course.  In practice the industrialist or the trader acted upon the directions given to him orally.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that it should be made clear that in these cases where industries are carried on subject to orders which give the Minister for Supplies power to direct the manner in which available materials are to be utilised, the Minister should have power to <Col N="1285" /> give oral directions and get these directions acted upon promptly without any option to the trader or manufacturer concerned to disobey the direction. Again that particular alteration in the terminology of the Order was made merely because the Order had to be amended in any event.  The existing system had not worked badly; the individual was told what he had to do, and if he would not do it we made an Order which compelled him to do it. In practice he did what he was told except in a very small number of cases.</P>
    <P>The other changes, as I have said, are merely verbal changes.  They are designed to deal with the possibility of the powers of the Minister to ration commodities or to control production and distribution of commodities being questioned in the courts.  In respect of some of the rationing schemes in force, or some of the Orders which have been made relating to production of commodities, it is possible that the Orders could have been questioned in the courts before the amending Order was made, because of the inadequacy of the terminology used in the 1939 Order. The only other powers taken are those which confer upon the Minister concerned authority to get certain records and if necessary to get certain extracts from these records.  These are powers which are obviously necessary in certain circumstances, where a large number of commodities are in short supply and where their use and distribution have been controlled by the Government in the public interest.  The other changes make no additions to the Minister's powers at all.  They merely transfer from one Act to another a power which he already possesses.  I refer to the paragraph relating to the display of price lists, the giving of receipts, etc.  The Minister for Supplies has these powers under the Control of Prices Act, but he prefers to have them under the Emergency Powers Act because the procedure is simpler under the Emergency Powers Act and also because the penalties for non-compliance are greater under that Act than those which were considered adequate in the more normal period when the Control of Prices Act was passed.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Keane has put down <Col N="1286" /> this motion to annul the Order under a misapprehension.  We are not in any way detracting from the powers of the Oireachtas to annul any Order made by the Government.  An Order made by the Government can give to an individual Minister power to issue Orders to direct particular activities for a definite aim, and these Orders, which can be given orally as well as in writing under Article 31 of the 1939 Order as amended, would not in any event come before the Oireachtas or be capable of being annulled by a resolution.  The main changes made in the Order are, first of all, those required in the wording of the Article to make it sufficiently broad to cover a comprehensive rationing scheme such as that to be introduced under the rationing book system. The second change is that which enables more detailed information to be secured as to stocks held by manufacturers and traders.</P>
    <P>It appears, at least I was advised by the legal adviser to the Government, that under the Order as it stood such a simple matter as obtaining returns of the stocks of flour held by a flour merchant or the stocks of fuel held by a fuel merchant could not be required, unless the particular trade or commodity concerned had already been the subject of an Order made by the Government or the Minister concerned, relating to an entirely different matter.  That, in fact, was only defective drafting, quite understandable having regard to the circumstances under which the Order was made.  In addition to the power already possessed requiring the keeping of records, power is now being taken to secure extracts from such records as well as power to remove and detain temporarily such documents.</P>
    <P>The final amendment relates to the giving of directions orally as well as in writing.  I have explained the circumstances under which that power is acquired and is at present being used, I think it would be preposterous to require that an Order given by the Flour Controller to a flour merchant in Sligo to supply a ton of flour to a trader in Donegal should have to be tabled in the Oireachtas and should be capable of being annulled by a resolution of <Col N="1287" /> the Oireachtas.  There is no revolutionary change such as Senator Keane suggested had been made by the Order.  In fact, the additional power acquired by the Minister is very slight indeed.</P>

      <P>Although, in general, I am quite prepared to agree with the Minister's interpretation of the amendment, I should like to have two points cleared up.  I am not quite clear as to why the amendment has omitted the preamble of the 1939 Order. The second point is that this question of oral instructions is something new in Parliamentary drafting and in the machinery of administrative procedure in Government offices.</P>
      <P>I visualise what might happen in an extreme case.  Under this Order, the Minister is allowed to employ agents to carry out his wishes.  On one particular day he may give 20 different orders to 20 different agents.  There is no provision in the amendment for the keeping of any record whereas we, ordinary people, who have to pay income-tax to the Government and taxes or rates to the local authorities, have to keep records of everything.  I do feel that the Minister should examine that question.  The various people to whom the Minister has to give instructions&mdash; they may be big instructions or small instructions &mdash; will vary in intelligence, for one thing, and consequently in their interpretation of what the Minister wishes to convey.  In fact reading all these Orders people even of the experience and standing of Senator Sir John Keane are not quite sure of what the Minister intended.  I think that question of oral direction without records is something that requires consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might intervene, the power to delegate to agents the right to give oral instructions is obviously necessary if inspectors of the Department are to carry out their functions properly.  Perhaps I may give one of the most recent instances.  I received a complaint that a baker's shop at Marino never had enough bread on a Saturday to supply its registered customers, and I sent out an agent to see for himself.  He found <Col N="1288" /> so many registered customers queueing up for bread that he decided that the existence of the queue was good ground for believing that there was something in the complaint.  After a number of hours, the bread supply of the shop was exhausted, with 40 customers left unserved, and the manager of the shop was about to close for the day leaving these 40 customers without bread. At that point, an officer of the Department went in and directed the manager to telephone the bakers for a supply of bread to provide the ration for these additional 40 customers.  That order was obeyed by the manager and the bread was provided.</P>
      <P>Clearly, that is a matter for action precisely along these lines &mdash; the agent on the spot, on the scene of the trouble, can give an order which has to be complied with.  Clearly, it could not be suggested he should have gone back to the office of the Minister to get him to draw up and sign an Order to the manager of the shop to keep the shop open for the supply of extra bread. While there is always a possibility of these powers being abused by people who are tactless, or inclined to lose their heads when given undue authority, it is the job of the Minister and the officers under him to ensure that those who are appointed are chosen because of their tact and discipline and because they will carry out their duties in a responsible manner.  Obviously, if we are to get effective control over distribution to deal with problems of that kind as they arise, the authorised agents of the Department must have power to give oral orders and to get these orders obeyed properly in order to prevent difficulties occurring.</P>

      <P>I am not at all satisfied that the Minister is right in suggesting that I have discovered a mare's nest.  I am still profoundly dissatisfied with the position and the explanation given by the Minister.  The Minister and the House will note that I was not in the least concerned with the extent of the powers that were being taken in the Order under the present sub-section.  This power to inspect books, take samples and so on is not a serious matter at all.  The <Col N="1289" /> serious matter is this: the section is put in in substitution, synonymously it may seem.  In broad terms it means that if the Minister does not see fit to make an Order he can do by direction all that had previously to be done by Order.  Let us get this clear, because it is very important.  These sub-paragraphs set out in general terms the ambit within which the Minister can function.  Take now for instance paragraph (d):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;for regulating the carrying on of any undertaking and in particular, for controlling the charges which may be made by the undertakers in respect of the doing of any work by them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;the carrying on of any undertaking...&rdquo; may mean anything or nothing, but it is quite possible to-morrow that the Government may wish to replace the management of an undertaking.  The Government may say that the undertaking cannot be properly managed by the existing undertaker, and that they will have to change the management.  Hitherto, there would have to be an amending Order setting out their power to change the management and that Order would have to be made by the Government.</P>

The power of the Oireachtas to annul Orders is confined to Orders made by the Government.  Orders made by the Minister could not be annulled by the Oireachtas and that position is not being changed.</P>

I think if it is true that the Minister could make an order orally, it must also be true that you could put down a motion in this House stating that the order should be revoked, and the distinction between revoking and annulling an order, while important legally, is not very important parliamentarily. If Senator Douglas could get a majority to support his motion for the revocation of the order, it would be just as effective as annulling the order.  He beats the Minister, and that is that.</P>

      <P>The Senator does not cover the ground fully on that at all.  The Minister can act in three ways, by Government statutory order, by Ministerial order, and by oral direction, and he can choose which he likes. I say that, whatever the legal point may be, I should be very unhappy, if I were the Minister, having to stand a test case in the courts in regard to this Order, but that is another matter.  He has complete powers under this Order, in my submission, by verbal direction, and I say that is at least against the spirit of the original Act.  The original Act set out a number of activities which had to operate through statutory Order implemented by direction.  Now, that is all gone, and the Government can, if they see fit, act by direction only. I considered the matter so serious that I felt it my duty to bring it to the notice of the House.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that you cannot specify everything you want in those days, but there should always be power in the last resort for a person to ask, if he thinks fit, for an Order in writing.  If I may sum up, as I picture the whole structure under which we work, there was, first of all, the Act; then there was the Order which set out the main functions that the Minister could operate; and then there was the definite Order saying what powers were to be taken.  It was because I felt the extreme seriousness of the powers which the Government now proposes to take that I considered it my duty to bring the matter before the House.</P>

    <P>Motion: &ldquo;That in the opinion of the Seanad further steps require to be taken to encourage an increased production of wheat; in particular, the House recommends that the minimum price of 50/- per barrel for <Col N="1293" /> millable wheat, which has been guaranteed for the coming season, be assured to wheat growers over a period of years.&rdquo;&mdash;(Senators The McGillycuddy of the Reeks, J.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which we were assembled, I had reached the point where I had given such approval as I could to the action of Senator Crosbie and of the Ministers when they were considering this matter on their agricultural rounds throughout the country during the spring.  I have not given the full examination to the idea that perhaps I ought, but, so far as I see, I think that the implementation of the motion would be an excellent idea.  It would permit the segregating of the various farms, the resources of the various owners and the resources of the land as well, because it is not to be expected that a common percentage could be justified all through.  In the case of the smaller farms which have been intensively tilled for a number of years, the resources for the growing of wheat are not present.  Many of the smaller men with whom I do business would prefer to see a higher price for oats, barley and other crops than wheat.  Hence I think that county committees of agriculture should be approached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the contracts on beet-growing lines which were mentioned, I think that by that means the exact position could be gauged.  The exact acreage could be determined, and the probable return could be assessed. Subject to weather conditions being favourable to the maturing of the crop, one could almost anticipate the exact returns.  With the knowledge of the local committee &mdash; knowing as it does the farmer, and the loyalty of himself and his workers &mdash; it should be within the province of the Government, acting through its committees, to extract <Col N="1294" /> the last grain from the soil and put farmers in a first-class position to provide the nation with its needs.  I do not like the violent changes of technique which are so often prescribed for us.</P>
    <P>As I told the House on the last day, I remember when we were in barley and we were hounded out of it.  I see no reason why a thorough search into the resources of the nation should not result in the country providing its own wheat.  With regard to the tillage farmers, they have watched down through the years much of their labour go to provide but a very miserable existence for themselves, while everybody to whom they disposed of their grain was leading what one might call a life of considerable luxury.</P>
    <P>The idea behind the motion is, by no means, to coerce or compel; it is rather to induce.  Personally, I am against much of the compulsion of these times.  I am sorry that some of it is essential in the present emergency but, having regard to the losses which tillage has brought in the past, many of our most shrewd farmers shy at tillage programmes.  The motion aims at getting farmers, by a guarantee, to adopt what is in the motion &mdash; a normal tillage rotation.  It implements immediately security, stability and guarantee.  On that point of guarantee and stability, the whole course of our Irish land laws, as many of us have known it, was altered considerably by the Oireachtas some time ago.  I should be exhibiting a lack of candour if I did not express here and now how pleased I was at observing that, at the last Parnell celebration, the Taoiseach himself, in so many words, appraised the memory of Parnell as the man who brought security to the Irish farmers.  This matter may not be exactly relevant now, but the question of having the laws re-established on those old lines would be well worth serious consideration. I think that an excellent chance could be found, if the spirit were strong enough, in the ramifications of the Defence Council, where all Parties are represented.  They should be in a position to implement a unanimous agreement on that question of security for the Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> The guaranteed prices for the complete rotation are I think reasonable. The cost of production of commodities is allowed and I hope it will be allowed hereafter in the agricultural industry. There is no fortune in wheat growing for anybody.  None is needed, but what one wants to avoid is dead loss in cash and the dead loss caused by the deprivation of the soil of its essential fertility. Hence a reasonable and fair price is necessary.  On that score, I am in a position to state that from my own farm, and my own home, as far back as 1790, wheat was sold at 37/6d. per barrel.  In those times, the costs were nothing like what they are now.  Last January, I advocated 50/- as a reasonable price.  If the costs increase, the price will have to increase as well but, in this matter of guarantees, we should not permit any breaking of faith with our farmers.  It is breaking of faith in that way that makes the agricultural community suspicious.  Last year, 41/- was placarded everywhere as the price of millable wheat.  When growers came to be paid, they found that they were paid 4/-, 5/- and 6/- per barrel less than the fixed price.  The guarantee is now 50/- and I do hope that no effort will be permitted, allowed or condoned that will have millable wheat going into the millers at less than 50/-.</P>
    <P>The time to get down to the proper method of maximum production for next season is now and the local committees of agriculture should be approached in all the Twenty-Six Counties.  Necessarily, the success of one crop hangs upon the success of the other.  The details of the rotation can be easily learned and the county committees have so far not been sufficiently utilised in this matter, while in other countries they have led in a marvellous manner to successful production.  I often wonder why more use was not made of them.  I sometimes question whether the Government is in earnest. I do not mean in talking and advertising. There has been plenty of that.  I mean in regard to the direct touch with the farmers which can only come from the local county committee.</P>
    <P>We have a great chance of assistance <Col N="1296" /> from local parish councils.  If the parish councils elsewhere work as well and in as close touch with the farmer as some of the parish councils I know they would be a great assistance.  But what sometimes causes me considerable uneasiness is when I read, as I read recently, that the Minister for Supplies gave a list of petrol distributions and, while every creed and every class got their allotment, not one word was mentioned about the petrol to be allotted to the agricultural instructor, the chief officer, who is the fountain and foundation of all success of food production.  Revenue officers, income-tax collectors, clergymen and doctors were in the list.  Everything those people do is deemed urgent.  One would think that some of them might walk an odd time, take a bicycle, or sometimes a donkey might convey them, but all the time these classes have to get all the petrol.</P>
    <P>This technique, to use a word of my friend, Senator Sir John Keane, ought, I submit, be altered immediately. Farmers are to produce all they can, and the most urgent need is for wheat and, in my opinion, the first person that should be encouraged and driven into inspection of every field of wheat in the country should be the chief agricultural officer.  The reason for that is that on practically every farm some wheat will die; in one the wheat will be shrivelling up because manures are not to be had, and in another case it will be suggested that it should be ploughed up.  Farmers would ask neighbours were they to be at the loss of the whole of it and what course they should follow.  If they write to the agricultural inspector it might be days before he would come.  I have seen extraordinarily good results achieved by agricultural instructors during the last few months.  I impress upon the Minister the desirability and urgency of supplying the agricultural instructor, not only for the future but for the present year, for reasons with which I will deal.  I think I am correctly advised that in Canada there is a crop insurance scheme which might well be considered by the State here.  It is late for this year, but we should provide our agricultural officer with <Col N="1297" /> every possible means that the nation can place at his disposal to go into every field in which there is tillage.</P>
    <P>The more places he goes into the better it will be for the country and for the future education of our agricultural population.  That applies equally to the growing of barley.  I do not know why the petrol that is being distributed is not being retained for these officials.</P>
    <P>I am uneasy about the attitude of the Department of Supplies in this matter.  Occasionally you will notice in the daily papers that another cargo of foreign grain is chronicled as having arrived and we hear of cheers as it steams up the Liffey.  Would it not be very interesting for our non-producing community to see each week an article from one or other of our 26 or 27 agricultural instructors in each of Dublin's dailies giving evidence of what was happening in regard to the crops in the various parishes?  In that way you would interest the people and evoke considerable sympathy for the difficulties that confront the agricultural community and the efforts they are making to cope with them.  It has been rightly said that if you give the money to farmers they will deliver the goods.  I believe that is perfectly true. I know of no reason why it should not be.  Sometimes we hear that farmers have the home market.  I wonder just how true that is?  Our wheat is 50/-. I wonder what is the price of foreign wheat?  There is now absolutely no excuse for not offering every possible encouragement to producers.  You will do far better by doing so than by compelling the labourer to work for a small wage or the farmer to do work which he does not believe in and which history shows cannot support him or his family.  Price should not be the object.  If you offered a white loaf in any shop you would have queues bigger than those now seeking tobacco, sweets, or going to the pictures.</P>
    <P>In my experience, such as it is, winter wheat alone must be our reliance.  I never had much faith in spring-sown varieties and one of our most vital jobs, if not so much for this year as for next year, is the selection <Col N="1298" /> of proper seed.  It is there the services of instructors should come in.  It is of the growing crop that the most minute inspection should be made.  No threshed samples should be deemed evidence sufficient to warrant depending upon it.  Inspection should be constant and the resources of farmers should be very minutely examined before they are permitted to sell seed wheat.  Wherever the farmer wants seed he should be encouraged to go to the agricultural instructor, because seed from one soil might only suit one part, and only the trained eye of the agricultural inspector can correctly guide producers.  No person should be permitted to sell seed wheat that has not been matured in the straw.  Many of the troubles of the present year are due to the fact that wheat was not sufficiently matured in the straw.  I have mentioned that all other crops on the farm count &mdash; everything that goes into the farmer's budget counts.</P>
    <P>A successful beet crop and a successful potato crop clean the land and contribute to its form for maximum wheat production.  The wealth and the wellbeing of an agricultural community rest in the fertility of its soil.  A fertile, vigorous Irish soil will stand any test. I wonder if we are catering for that. Possibly we cannot do all we would like.  Possibly we were not sufficiently well advised in time, but we should do our best with our limited resources. I do not think it could be stated that you can put too much manure at present on our Irish fields to produce the maximum crops of wheat.  I am in a position just at the moment for anyone to come and see fields that have received, perhaps, 1 ton of lime dust per acre, plus 2 cwt. of ammonia and 3 cwt. of superphosphates.  If you stand on the hill and look into the valley, you will very rapidly realise where the promise of an efficiently-run wheat field may be found.</P>
    <P>In the old days, stall feeding was very profitable and it produced an excellent manure.  Considerable supplies of manure may be produced by raising store cattle, but its quality is limited.  I am sure everyone knows of the scarcity of manures, ammonia <Col N="1299" /> and superphosphates generally at present. There is also only a limited supply of lime, and there is delay in providing lime burners with colem and gelignite.  Sometimes, there is difficulty in getting cement dust.  I ordered my supply for next year within the past ten days, from the cement factory in Drogheda, as I hoped to be able to draw in material in the long, bright days of summer.  I got a reply from the protected cement factory that, as they had ceased production, there was no dust available for the farmers.  That was on the 23rd May. On the 26th May, I saw an advertisement in the Dublin papers that cement produced after that day would be sold at an enhanced price, owing to the increased cost of production.  The two matters did not blend, in my view, and I felt rather sore, but we all will have pin-pricks which sometimes are very irritating.</P>
    <P>It is essential to encourage beet and potatoes, and, in the absence of manures, the prices must go up, if we are to pay wages and keep going at all.  This year the beet is a little on the down-grade, and there is danger in regard to the sugar supply. Potatoes at the moment are a hopeless proposition.  About ten miles from my home there are extensive areas under potatoes, not more than my own, but there is a fixed price and they are graded from a certain date.  Let us see how the farmer was encouraged there.  He gets £3 10s. per ton for the estimated quantity of what he grows, cash paid on a certain date in October. When he is delivering he gets a further £3, increased by a grading system as the months go on.  Then, before he starts the job at all, he gets a bonus of £10 per statute acre.  I asked one of my labourers if he was coming back to me this year, and he said he was not as this other farmer was getting the bonus long before me, so I have to do without him.  The price paid here bears no relation whatever to the price paid across the Border.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why barley is not encouraged more.  It should be £2 a barrel at least, as it is a useful stand-by as food.  In the last war we got 50/- <Col N="1300" /> for both barley and wheat.  Barley is an excellent product and will stand the test for food if there is a real scarcity here.  I think it did stand that test before.  There is a complaint &mdash; I do not know if it is true &mdash; that oats is too cheap and that oatmeal is too dear, with the result that there is a black market in oats.  Wheat is the thing which the country obviously needs and our producers should be encouraged in regard to it.  The most fatal of all human emotions if fear and the fear of getting into difficulties, which many farmers have, has warped their minds completely.</P>
    <P>I think this motion is a reasonable one.  Some people who do not wish to see wheat grown state that it cannot be grown, or that 50/- is enough, and others say that those who grow wheat want too high a price, and that one way out of the difficulty would be to have no guaranteed prices at all.  Those arguments are unreal and unreasonable. Our farmers are able to provide the food for the people if they like, and I suggest that, if this motion is implemented, it will give a reasonable prospect that our people never will go hungry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down my name as one of the seconders of this motion because, when the Minister visited Cork in the early part of this year, I made suggestions at the meeting which he held there in pursuance of his wheat campaign, which were somewhat similar to the terms of this motion and which the Minister was gracious enough to say were practical and of some value. I maintain that the onlooker sees a great deal more of the game than the players, and I feel that the views of one who, although not actively engaged in agriculture, for a number of years has been in contact with farmers and agricultural problems and has been enabled to look on these problems from the outside, may be of some value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, it never has been demonstrated more clearly at any period of our existence than at present that the main source of our national wealth lies in our agricultural industry.  By its success or failure we stand or fall. When our farmers are prosperous we <Col N="1301" /> are prosperous; when they become impoverished we, as a nation, also become impoverished.  What is now termed the emergency, but what, in my opinion, should be more correctly termed the economic war which this country is waging &mdash; and waging for its very existence in the present world conditions &mdash; has been a complete vindication of the policy of the late Government.</P>
    <P>It is demonstrated to us in no uncertain manner that a false industrialisation founded solely on high tariffs and without a solid foundation of native raw materials, is, in effect, a house built upon sand, and that, as the winds of international war sweep over it, it trembles, shakes, ultimately collapses, and leaves us as nature designed us to be &mdash; a country that is primarily agricultural and with a number of subsidiary industries that are native to the soil and independent of foreign raw materials.</P>
    <P>The successful propagation of our agriculture presents many and varied problems.  This motion deals primarily with our wheat policy which is, at the moment, a problem of the greatest urgency.  The wheat policy, however, has many repercussions, and many other branches of living and agriculture are dependent on it.  It should and must, in my opinion, be faced not as a policy of improvisation from month to month or year to year, but should be constructed into what might be described as a long-term policy.  It is not merely a question of providing wheat from the autumn of 1942 to the autumn of 1943.  The Government and the Minister must look further ahead than that.  They must take into consideration the following year and the year after that.  They must also consider and remember that, with the cessation of hostilities, the wheat problem will not disappear in a night or in a year. They must bear in mind that we are situated on the outskirts of the European continent, a continent that is virtually at starvation level, that will have to be fed the moment hostilities cease, that ships will be urgently required for that process and that it will almost certainly be many years before there will be a return to anything <Col N="1302" /> like normal conditions of world trade.</P>
    <P>In view of that situation, it would appear not to be a wise policy continually to permit an argument to occur every autumn between the wheat producers and the Government regarding the price and acreage of wheat to be sown for the following season.  I would suggest that a scheme involving some form of contract should be worked out between the Government and the wheat producers.  I make this suggestion in the hope that it may be helpful and that having studied the suggestion, the Minister may be able to evolve a better scheme than mine and put it into operation.  For instance, the farmer could enter into a contract to grow so many acres of wheat each year, the minimum price to be 50/- a barrel.  There are many difficulties involved in this suggestion.</P>
    <P>One of the principal difficulties is that, owing to the nature of wheat as a crop and the lack of artificial manures, the yield per acre will continue to fall year after year, and the price of 50/- for the wheat of the season 1942 may not, as a result of the fall in yield, be anything like adequate for the season 1943-44.  That is why in this motion the word &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; has been used in connection with 50/- per barrel.  It should not, however, be beyond the ingenuity of the Government and the farmers to set up a small committee or board which will annually review and recommend a price for the coming season.  The essential thing would be, at all costs, to put our wheat policy on a business-like basis between the Government and the farmer so as to ensure a continuity of wheat production. In this way it should be possible eventually to bring our wheat production to such a pitch that, instead of being barely able to supply our people with bread &mdash; a thing which we have not yet succeeded in doing &mdash; we should have a residue and be able to provide offals for our farmers.  I consider that Senator Byrne's amendment to this motion is therefore a very proper and useful contribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be unwise to neglect the county committees of agriculture. <Col N="1303" /> These committees are worthy of more consideration than an annual visit during the &ldquo;Grow More Wheat&rdquo; campaign.  They contain some of the best and most progressive farmers in the country &mdash; men who have devoted half a lifetime to the study of farming and farming problems, and who have a wide knowledge of the conditions that prevail in their localities.  They would, therefore, form an ideal recruiting ground for the personnel of a committee or advisory board to assist the Government, should the Minister decide to adopt that suggestion.  They might even be given similar status and powers as the Sugar Company, and used as the intermediate contracting party between the Government and the wheat producer.  They could be given responsibility for wheat production in their own county, and thus decentralise wheat growing in all respects, except, of course, price, which would be fixed nationally.</P>
    <P>As an example of how this scheme might work, let us take Cork County Committee of Agriculture which, under such circumstances as these, might decide to operate as follows:&mdash; Firstly, they would estimate that the requirements of County Cork for the year 1943-44 for human consumption would be X barrels of wheat.  Secondly, they might estimate that Y barrels would be required to provide a reasonable ration of offals and animal feeding stuffs for stock raisers for the same cereal year. Thirdly, they could estimate that Z acres would be necessary to grow X and Y barrels of wheat and contract with the growers accordingly, the growers to get preferential terms for the purchase of offals or surplus on similar lines to the sugar-beet scheme under which the producer gets return of the sugar-beet pulp.  Other county committees, on the other hand, might decide to operate on different lines according to the particular agricultural economy of their counties.  All these county schemes would, of course, have to be under the direct control of the Ministry.  Ministerial sanction would have to be exercised and the Minister should have full power to disband instantly any committee that he had <Col N="1304" /> reason to believe were not delivering the goods.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the difficulties that lie in the path to successful and adequate wheat production.  Now I must particularise in these difficulties, and draw the attention of the Minister to a very serious state of affairs that has arisen in some localities.  I do not think it is general &mdash; I sincerely trust not &mdash; but I do not think I or anybody else would be doing our duty if we did not draw his attention to the fact that it has occurred in some areas and in a great number of cases.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of trouble and difficulty regarding the germination of seed wheat.  In some areas, both the winter and spring sowings have failed to germinate at all and have had to be ploughed up.  In other areas, and in other cases, germination has been poor and reseeding has had to be resorted to; and in other cases where seed has been tested for germination, it has been found that in the course of one month the germinating results have dropped from 90 per cent. to 50 per cent.  It is not for me to say why this has occurred. I merely warn the Minister of it, but it is essential for the Minister to discover to what this is due.  Some people say it is caused by fermentation, but why does it happen?  Is it due to too early harvesting, or to insufficient seasoning in stooks, or to the fact that the wheat has not been properly conditioned in storing before being stored, or maybe some of the varieties recently grown from imported stocks have not yet become properly acclimatised to our conditions?  That is a matter for the Minister's technical experts and I would suggest that the thing to do is to recognise that the trouble is there, and then to take steps to overcome it.  If necessary, the entire time of the Scientific Research Bureau should be concentrated on this problem.</P>
    <P>It can be truly said that in this emergency there are many things we could do were it not for the emergency. That may sound nearly as involved as Senator Fitzgerald, but, nevertheless, it is true.  We could, for instance, grow more rye were it not <Col N="1305" /> for the difficulty of procuring seed. That difficulty should not be insurmountable, and I think the Minister should not fail to endeavour to procure a supply of rye to be used as a substitute for wheat wherever suitable.  I cannot feel impressed by the manner in which the Department has dismissed the possibilities of rye growing. As a crop, it is less severe on the land, and I place little credence in the theory that it is more subject to pests than other cereals.  Surely our ships plying between Portugal and here would be better employed in carrying cargoes of rye, or in fact any other necessary agricultural seeds than such luxuries as grape fruit, oranges, lemons, etc.</P>
    <P>I must also confess to a feeling of grave dissatisfaction on reading that the Taoiseach's Scientific Research Bureau reported that they do not consider it practical politics to establish a factory for the production of artificial manures.  Reading between the lines, it would look to me as if these gentlemen were inclined to fight shy of all obstacles and to fall back on the line of least resistance, with a vague recommendation for the further exploitation of native phosphates.  I should have thought that in this national crisis, it would have paid us extremely well to establish such a plant in spite of all costs and difficulties, even though it meant abandoning the project at the end of the war and scrapping the plant.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear to me that no business man would dream of basing his business economy on the present hand-to-mouth methods adopted by the Government on the question of wheat. Prudent men would plan now, not only for the day, but for the future.  The Government should make up its mind, here and now, to plan boldly, and if necessary, ruthlessly, not only for the duration of the war, but for after the war.  They should not confine their agricultural planning merely to wheat and wheat production.  Now is the time for them to admit frankly and fearlessly that our whole future must be based primarily on agriculture, that their industrial policy, while it was all right in many respects in the pre-war world, did not stand up to the acid <Col N="1306" /> tests of war conditions.  They must remember that foreign raw materials will not be available for many years after the war and that we must still mainly exist on what we can produce from the land, but the whole of our agricultural policy must now be readjusted and that now is the time to do it &mdash; and not in the future, when it is too late.</P>
    <P>We will have many problems to face when hostilities cease and there is no use in not facing facts.  There are 150,000 of our citizens taking part in this war, and there has also been an exodus of labour running into many thousands.</P>
    <P>These people will return one day and work must be found for them.  I suggest that they will demand, among other things, higher wages and a higher standard of living.  Our industrial resources are not going to be adequate to absorb our population. They never have been adequate to absorb our population so far.  Properly planned and properly worked, our agriculture should provide a great deal more employment than it does. Instead of a flight from the land, it should be possible to bring men back to the land, but not while our agriculture is run on its present basis.  The difference between the standard of life and standard of wages of the agricultural worker and the town worker is far too great.  It must be remembered that the agricultural worker produces, and that a great many of our town workers do not produce, yet they receive wages out of all proportion to the value of their work.  As an example, a street sweeper for the Dublin Corporation receives 64/- a week.  Now, I am not saying that the work which that man does is not essential, but it is not productive.  It produces no wealth.  I am not saying that he does not earn his 64/-, but it must always be kept in mind that his work is unproductive, whereas an agricultural labourer, who is frequently as skilled a man as his master, receives 33/- a week.  Until that situation is readjusted, it is fantastic to expect people to return to the land.  One step towards readjusting that situation would be the adoption, if not of this motion <i>in toto</i>, in principle, and giving <Col N="1307" /> to the farmer a feeling of security and a feeling that he is going to get a fair return for his work and for the wealth that he produces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of this motion and I am also in favour of the amendment.  The great virtue I see in the motion is this: it lifts the business of wheat growing completely out of its present rut.  We have a great acreage of wheat this season and with a good harvest the food supply of the people should be secure for another year.</P>
      <P>If those hopes are realised, if the harvest is as favourable as we hope it will be, the shipping which is now being used to bring in wheat for our people can be used to bring in artificial manures, agricultural machinery, and other things which are essential to agriculture.</P>
      <P>When the present Government came into office, the price of wheat was considerably less than 20/- a barrel. The amount of wheat then grown was something less than 20,000 acres. To-day the price of wheat is 50/- a barrel and the amount of wheat grown is 500,000 acres.  In the face of those facts it is amazing to hear a Senator on the opposite benches telling us that the Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach have not done their job. The plain fact is that the Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach, in the face of violent opposition, have made the food supply of the people fairly secure.  When the present Government came into office, the price of barley was somewhere in the region of 12/- or 14/- a barrel.  To-day the price is 30/- a barrel.  I am not satisfied that the price of barley is sufficient.  The price of wheat, of course, is the important thing, but the price of barley and the price of oats ought to be a little higher than they are at the present time.  The present price of oats is creating a black market.  If that price were raised to something like 12/- or 14/- a cwt., and if the price of barley were raised to 17/- or 18/- a cwt., I think it would not in any way lessen the production of wheat in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great prejudice <Col N="1308" /> against wheat growing here.  In my opinion, that was due to the excessive use of lime before the introduction of artificial manures.  At one time, large areas of wheat were grown in this country, and people used lime injudiciously and excessively.  The excessive use of lime did much to impoverish the land.  The people believed that it was the wheat did the harm, whereas in my opinion it was the lime that caused it. The plant breeding expert at Glasnevin has given his opinion that wheat growing takes less out of the soil than any of the other cereals.  He is a man of international repute.  He is a man who has done much for the grain growers of this country.  He is a man from whom I have learned a great deal of useful information about cereal-growing, and I should be very slow to disagree with any theory propounded by him.</P>
    <P>Whilst I do not fully agree with his statement that wheat takes less out of the ground than the other cereals, I do agree with him that wheat is a more desirable crop than any of the other cereals to grow on much of the virgin soil of this country.  Wheat can be planted all through the winter, in almost any kind of weather.  It divides labour, and prevents a glut of work in the spring time.  When the harvest comes, the saving of wheat is much easier than the saving of any of the other cereals.  If wheat is left four days in the stook, it will save just as well as any of the other cereals which had been left eight or ten days.</P>
    <P>I listened to Senator McGee telling us the story of his association with the farmers' party in this country years ago, and their efforts to criticise the firm of Messrs. Guinness for not giving an adequate price for barley.  There is a Grain Growers' Association in this country, and in 1934 that association sent a deputation to Messrs. Guinness. The price of barley was then about 12/- or 14/- a barrel; I think the actual figure was 13/-.  I happened to be one of that deputation, and we pointed out to Messrs. Guinness that they paid very fine wages to their workers; that they paid very fine dividends to their shareholders, but that the barley growers, who were the backbone of the <Col N="1309" /> concern, were very badly paid for their grain.  Messrs. Guinness rose beautifully to the occasion.  The deputation approached them in the middle of the harvest, when they had declared their price and had actually paid for half the crop.  The result of the deputation was that Messrs. Guinness increased the price by 2/- a barrel, and made it retrospective. Larger quantities of grain will have to be grown in this country, and I am not sure that one of the results of the acceptance of this motion here this evening would not be that the acreage of wheat might be increased by 50 per cent. or 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>Some speaker on the other side pointed out that it would be a good thing if the grain grower got back the by-product, such as bran and pollard, to feed his animals.  That is already happening in the case of beet.  The beet grower gets back the pulp to feed his animals, and that is one of the greatest incentives there is to beet growing.  Similarly, if the wheat grower could be assured of getting back a proportion of the offals of the wheat crop, it would be a great incentive to wheat production.  Were it not for the wheat-growing policy and the general tillage policy of the present Government, the people would be in a sad plight for food to-day.  It is a good thing to have the Opposition coming in even at the eleventh hour. When I say that, I do not refer to Senator McGee or to the other members who have moved the motion. Senator McGee came in to the wheat growing business very early on.  He has given good service in that particular sphere, and I am quite sure that the other members have had equally good intentions.  I am in favour of the motion; I am also in favour of the amendment, and I am sure that, as I said earlier on, it will have a very good effect on increasing the acreage for the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some aspects of this matter which I should like to bring before the House.  May I begin by saying that I sympathise profoundly with the problem which the movers of this motion have set themselves to solve, but I am not at all sure <Col N="1310" /> that this motion is the right contribution towards a solution of that problem? Of course, so long as the emergency lasts, we must make it our business to grow as much wheat as will provide enough flour to feed our people.</P>
      <P>The motion gives you that, and suggests that for a number of years &mdash; presumably after peace is restored &mdash; we should continue to grow as much wheat as we need ourselves, and that there should continue to be a minimum price of 50/- per barrel for that wheat &mdash; a minimum price, not an actual price. I am not at all convinced that that policy is related to a true view of the situation that will exist after the war, but, in any case, I feel that there is need for some definite policy of agricultural reconstruction with reference to the period that will be upon us as soon as the emergency is over.  I am quite certain, however, that that policy will have to relate itself to far more than the single product of wheat, and will have to contain many things besides a fixed price for a single product if, indeed, it should contain a fixed price for any single product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A real agricultural policy of post-war reconstruction will have to take into account what should be our general agricultural policy &mdash; whether we should aim at maintaining and developing our export trade to Britain, which is now withering away; what should be the relations between agricultural production for the home market and agricultural production for export; what should be the relation between what I might call grass farming and tillage farming, and whether we should not, at long last, accept the findings of modern science, that there is no fundamental opposition between the right use of grass and the right use of tillage operations&mdash;that, on the contrary, the best grass farmers are often, also, the best tillage farmers.  What is needed in the case of the majority of the grass acres in the country is a policy that will aim at a tillage rotation with a view to maintaining and restoring from time to time a thick sole of really nourishing grass.  Large areas of grass are not feeding stock to the extent they should feed it, because they have for years <Col N="1311" /> been neglected, because the land has not been put through a proper rotation involving the use of the plough from time to time.</P>
    <P>A proper agricultural policy will, I think, recognise that grass is our principal crop but that, to get the right kind of grass, we must have a right tillage policy in relation to grass and in relation to large areas of the country which have not known the plough as much as they should have in the past two decades. The policy of post-war reconstruction, besides dealing with wheat, must have some reference, for example, to agricultural credit and it will have to assign a proper place to dairy farming and establish right relations between milk-production and calf-production and fat-cattle production.  All that will take some thinking out and will take some collaboration with our British neighbours because, whatever they do in their agricultural policy and in their import policy, is bound to affect our agricultural activities for better or for worse.  If it is the case that they are no longer likely to want butter supplies from us, that will involve us in a very serious way in relation to our dairying, tillage, and other activities.  However, I shall not develop that matter now because it is not directly related to the problem before the House.</P>
    <P>One of the assumptions running through this debate is that, just as we are being starved for wheat imports now owing to emergency conditions, we shall continue to be starved for wheat imports when the war is over and that, for years, Europe will absorb whatever wheat is available in the new world and no cargoes of wheat at all will come to us.  Surely, that assumption is utterly without foundation.  I am not aware of any reason why we should make that assumption but I do know &mdash;this information is derived from the Monthly Letter of the Royal Bank of Canada, 8th January, 1942 &mdash; that, at present, a terrific amount of wheat is stored up in the granaries of the world overseas and that it is only the difficulty of transport conditions that prevents that wheat from being brought to Europe.  I think that we still remain <Col N="1312" /> part of Europe, within the meaning of the Act, and I am not aware of any reason why Ireland should be excepted, after the war, from the possibility of importing wheat at world prices. Listen to this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A series of abnormally large crops in the past four years, together with a moderate reduction in overseas shipments to European markets already declining when war broke out, has concentrated one-half of this year's wheat supplies in the hands of four nations which are together incapable of consuming more than one-fifth.  Excess stocks of wheat in Canada, the United States, Australia and Argentina during the present season reached the staggering total of 1,750,000,000 bushels. This compares with 1,520,000,000 in 1940, 1,280,000,000 in 1939, and an average for five pre-war years of 830,000,000 bushels.  Such quantities, obviously, are completely out of line with both the present and prospective requirements of importing countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the wheat carryover available in the big wheat-growing countries overseas is increasing every year and is now twice as much as was the pre-war normal.  There is now available for export to Europe 40,000,000 tons of wheat and I think we would get our share of those 40,000,000 tons.  Wheat is selling in the United States at present at a price which is little over a dollar a bushel, which corresponds closely, I think, to a price of something more than 10/- a cwt. over here.  There is no reason to assume that, if the war were over, the price of wheat imported from America, where they are dying to get rid of it, or from Argentina would greatly exceed the figure of 10/- per cwt.  That being so, is it fair to our wheat-consuming public who, in number, far exceed the limited number of people who can be wheat producers, and who include nine-tenths of the small farmers of the country as well as all our urban and non-agricultural population, that they should be faced with the possibility of having to pay at the rate of £1 per cwt., or more, for <Col N="1313" /> wheat when they would, probably, be able to buy imported wheat at 10/-? It would be a very poor service to render to the majority of our people if we were to impose that necessity upon them.  What is more, it would be very bad policy from the point of view of the kind of agricultural economy we ought to encourage &mdash; that which is primarily suitable to the conditions of this country.</P>
    <P>We have to grow wheat under war conditions but the minute the war is over, if we can import it more cheaply than we can grow it, we should cast about to find other and more profitable uses for our land, both from the point of view of the owners of that land and from the point of view of the nation as a whole.  The real problem and what has been bedevilling all our agricultural effort for the past ten years or more is the unsatisfactory relationship that exists between the price of live stock and live-stock products and the price of cereal products.</P>
    <P>On that point may I suggest that with a fixed price of £1 per cwt. for wheat it would be high time the price for oats and barley was adjusted to correspond to that for wheat.  I think that wheat at £1 per cwt. should be related to oats at, at least, 15/- per cwt., and if the price of oats had been altered to keep step with the price of wheat the question of farmers holding oats instead of selling them to millers for sale as oatmeal would have been solved and a great many people would now be enjoying oatmeal porridge who have not had it for months.  What has been bedevilling agriculture for years is the unsatisfactory relationship between live-stock products and cereal products.  That relationship is partly the result of British policy and partly the result of a policy which the Irish Government pursued for a number of years but has now abandoned.  It still exists because Britain has not yet abandoned that policy.  In my view, the British policy of paying an inadequate price for our fat cattle, a price that penalises the production of fat cattle and destroys the relationship between the cattle industry and cereal production, has done more injury to the economy of this country than anything that Britain has done here since <Col N="1314" /> the destruction of the woollen trade at the end of the 17th century.  I am amazed at the pro-British attitude of the Government in failing to publish these facts to the world and make it quite clear that in this respect Britain is inflicting a serious injury on this country.  We have a national grievance there which it would be to our interest to ventilate and on a true view of British interest it would benefit by a higher price for our fat cattle.</P>
    <P>The fact that for years the price of fat cattle has been out of relationship with the price of grain meant that our people had no economic interest in feeding cattle in winter, and consequently there was a shortage of farmyard manure, and in time of peace they had to rely too much on artificial fertilisers.  When the war situation arose they found their land was without the accumulated fertility which would have enabled them to grow wheat during a period of emergency. The problem is to get a price for beef which bears a proper relationship to the price of grain.  I had the curiosity to compare over a period of years the price per cwt. of oats with the price per cwt. of fat cattle going back to 1924.  I found that between 1924 and 1930 the price per cwt. for fat cattle live weight ran about five or six times the average annual price per cwt. of oats.  It is within the recollection of most of us that during that period there was a certain amount of cattle feeding in winter, but from 1932 down to the present time the price per cwt. of fat cattle was less than five times the price per cwt. of oats, and with that price relationship it is not economic to feed concentrated foodstuffs to large animals in winter.  Consequently stall feeding disappeared and farmyard manure as a consequence is scarce.  I noticed that the fixed price of oats in Britain is 14/- or 15/- a cwt.  The price of home-bred and finished cattle in Britain and Northern Ireland is at present about 77/6 per cwt., which is more than five times the price fixed for oats.  What we want to get is a price for fat cattle which will be at least five times the price of oats.  When we get that price it may be possible to get more large animals <Col N="1315" /> fed during the winter and more farmyard manure, and consequently more wheat and other cereals without undermining the fertility of the land.  There is another aspect of this matter.  I have sometimes had occasion to criticise and express disapproval of an agricultural policy which I regarded as a racket in favour of small farmers. In that I was trying to express what I believed to be the point of view of general interest.  There seems to be some danger that this wheat growing may develop into a racket in favour of the large farmer.</P>

      <P>I did not intend in the least to impugn the motives of the movers of the resolution, who, I may say, are my good friends, but however high and lofty the motives of the advocates of a policy may be, it nevertheless remains possible that the policy, for reasons they do not foresee, may develop into a racket on behalf of a sectional interest.  I hope that it will not, and I know that the movers of the motion least of all desire that it should.  In this matter I think there is a definite conflict of interests between small farmers and large farmers. It is possible that wheat growing by large farmers could be encouraged to an extent and in a way that would positively injure the interests of small farmers as well as of the community. Wheat is more a large farmer's crop than a small farmer's crop.  I doubt whether there are 50,000 farmers with wheat in a worth-while quantity, or who could have it in a worth-while quantity without injury to the whole of their agricultural economy.  I imagine most of these farmers are farmers of 50 acres or more.  They can and should in a time of national emergency devote a greater proportion of land to the growing of wheat, but it is <Col N="1316" /> not possible for small farmers to do that without disorganising their whole agricultural effort.  In the ordinary way the small farmer derives a larger proportion of his income from what are called farmyard products rather than from those which are sold direct from the fields.  There is a distinction between products such as wheat, which are sold, and farmyard products such as poultry, eggs and pigs, which are worked up in the farm. The small farmer derives a very high proportion of income from the use of cereal raw materials, and it would be doing him very grave harm to raise their cost.  It would be making it difficult, if not impossible, to specialise in the production of poultry and pig products, which must be an important element in our total economy.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the present emergency is bearing more seriously on and doing more injury to the smaller farmers than the larger farmers.  It is compelling every farmer to cut down practically everything to the scale of what he can produce on his own farm.  That will inconvenience the large farmer, but it is disastrous for the small farmer.  It accounts for the fact that pig and poultry production have diminished and possibly it has some relation to the fact that dairy production is not as vigorous as it should be.  This aspect of the matter should not be overlooked. In whatever policy the Minister finally decides to adopt, the interests of all farmers, small and large, should be realised and brought into harmony with the common interests of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point.  We have now 100 per cent. extraction of so-called flour from wheat, and we have complaints that wheat offals are no longer available for farmers in the quantities they would like.  I am told, on the highest authority, and I believe the information has been conveyed by the proper channels to the Government, that the extraction of more than 85 per cent. of the wheat is a waste of effort, as the other 15 per cent. now extracted simply passes through the human stomach, which is incapable of deriving any nourishment from it; whereas animals &mdash; pigs, poultry, and so <Col N="1317" /> on &mdash; derive considerable advantage, when they can get more bran, pollard, and so on.  Therefore, from the point of view of food for human beings, it would be doing a greater service if we went back to 85 per cent. extraction and made these offals available for animal feeding.  It would be adding indirectly to the food of humans after wards, instead of wasting that 15 per cent. at present uselessly passing through human bodies.  That is an aspect of the matter which I hope the Minister has been considering, and I hope it will lead, in the near future, to a whiter loaf than we have had, since there is no sense in eating something which does not do any good.</P>

      <P>I will try to keep as closely as I can to the motion.  I would like to join issue with Senator O'Callaghan, but I would like to have this question discussed in a clear atmosphere.  It is an important motion and should be examined coldly, calmly and realistically.  As to whether the Minister or the Taoiseach is or is not responsible for having an abundance of food or the shortage of food, I am not going to join issue with Senator O'Callaghan.  The question for all of us, for the Minister and his Department and for every responsible citizen, is to do our best to provide food for all our people.  Senator O'Callaghan will admit that, since the beginning of the emergency, people who did not agree with the Minister politically have done their best&mdash;both farmers and public men &mdash; to ensure that there would not be a shortage of food.  If we are short to-day &mdash; and we are short &mdash; it is not because the people who differed politically from the Minister did not do their best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have held the view for a long time that the agricultural policy pursued here never has been what it ought to be, as it has never been truly representative of the country or in the best interests of the country, agriculturally or nationally, because the head of the Department of Agriculture is a political figure.  I am quite convinced that, if the present Minister for Agriculture and the Minister who preceded him, were responsible to the whole Dáil, instead <Col N="1318" /> of to a political Party, our agricultural economics would be on a sounder basis than they are.  They would be representative of the common sense and the widest experience of all our agriculturists, regardless of their political beliefs.  In our time and generation, we have discovered that the land does not respond to political economics.</P>
    <P>I intended to make a comment on Senator O'Callaghan's reference to the view of an expert on the effects of wheat growing on the soil, but I notice that he said, as I did on a previous occasion, that he did not quite agree with the expert in regard to what wheat would take out of the soil.  The problem confronting us now, and which will confront us for the next few years, is that of getting enough food out of the land.  I am not impressed by the argument put forward by Senator Johnston on a certain aspect of this question, much as I respect his views generally and much as I find that we can agree on many points.  He says it is inadvisable for us to decide on a long term wheat policy, in view of the colossal stocks of wheat stored up in the wheat growing lands throughout the world.  He gave us a quotation from a Canadian commercial bank indicating that the stocks of wheat are somewhere around 1,750,000,000 bushels and that the average was somewhere around 830,000,000 bushels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the carry-over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the average carryover in a normal period is somewhere around 800,000,000 bushels, and to-day it stands at 1,700,000,000 bushels.  That in itself meets the case made by Senator Johnston, who knows as much about conditions in the European Continent and in the Continent of Asia as any of us.  It seems to me that the shortage of food throughout the world to-day is such that a three years' supply of wheat, even with ships available to convey it, will not meet the conditions of starvation that have to be faced in Europe and elsewhere when the war is over.  As far as we are concerned, the emergency in the European Continent will continue for a long time <Col N="1319" /> after the war, perhaps for three or four years.  Apart altogether from what the dying Greek and Asiatic peoples may need to keep them alive, and apart altogether from giving them sufficient nutrition, the ships available to convey food in any part of the world will be very few, and they will be required to convey the minimum requirements to any country.  Therefore if for no other consideration, apart from our own selfish interests, from the Christian standpoint, in order that people in a much worse plight than ours &mdash; and in a plight which I hope it will never be our misfortune to get into &mdash; may be fed, we should do everything we can to feed ourselves, and not call on the resources of any other country.  It will be a physical impossibility to feed those peoples properly, and we ought to carry on by making as much provision as we can to feed our own.</P>
      <P>What will our problem be in the next few years?  We can agree that the farmer likes to know where he stands at least 12 months ahead.  His tillage campaign has to be planned ahead, and he has to know, when going into a green field, what he intends to do about rotation of crops and so on.  If you want to grow wheat and you have mixed soil on your farm you are not going into the poorest field or the middling field; you must go into the field with the best soil if you want to secure the best return.  It is important therefore that the farmer should know a long time in advance what the plans of the Government are in the matter of payment for the respective crops which he intends to produce.  It is not sufficient to tell him a week before he sows or a week after he has sown what the price for a particular crop is going to be, as he may then discover that the price for the crop which he had sown was lower than he expected and that the price of another crop had been raised.  Accordingly, it is essential that the farmer should be given notice a long time in advance as to the return he is likely to get from a particular type of farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wheat, of course, is most essential for our people but I believe myself that <Col N="1320" /> in this country it is the most fickle of all crops and the experience of a great many farmers &mdash; I think we might as well be frank about it &mdash; is not calculated to make them more enthusiastic about the growing of wheat.  There is a great deal which our farmers, and indeed which a great many of our technical people, did not know about the growing of wheat.  If there is one thing that has been definitely established about wheat-growing it is that the advice given by the experts was not justified by the results.  For that reason, it will be very difficult to create enthusiasm amongst many of our farmers for the growing of wheat over the long period for which I think wheat must be grown. We have had in every county, in some counties to a greater extent than in others, very considerable failures in the winter wheat sown in the month of February.  Considerable areas have had to be ploughed up and sown again with Spring varieties or with oats. Some of these areas will give a very poor yield and no matter what price a man gets, his return from his crop of wheat is going to be very poor.  Such experience as that is likely to render more difficult the production of the necessary amount of wheat.  Our experts did not know apparently all that was to be known about the difficulties of wheat-growing in this country.  In such a situation as that, we cannot afford to take risks because after all is said and done, we must have wheat. Wheat is the basis of our bread supply and we must get a considerable area under wheat every year, a much greater area than we had last year.</P>
    <P>I fear that our wheat yields are going to fall very considerably from now until the end of the present emergency. Some of the best farmers in the Twenty-Six Counties last year were only able to get a yield of five barrels to the acre.  That is a very poor return. When the Government first started their wheat policy we were able to get 12 barrels, 16 barrels and sometimes 20 barrels to the acre, and some of us then pointed to the fact that in the Balkan States where the wheat crop must be cultivated and where, in fact, it is the medium of exchange, they were only able to get five bushels to <Col N="1321" /> the acre.  I believe that in a great part of this country the yield will ultimately be reduced to that level.  We shall come down to that average next year or probably the year after.  We shall have exploited most of our fertile soil in the growing of wheat and used up much of the fertility of such manured land as we have.  In face of a situation such as that, the farmer, who has got to make ends meet and who has got to cultivate the crops from which he will reap a sufficient reward to enable him to pay his way, must know what his return is going to be if he sows wheat. As the wheat yields fall, we must have a plan that will encourage our farmers to continue producing wheat.</P>
    <P>It is not in this country alone that wheat is a very variable crop.  Senator Johnston has referred to wheat growing in Canada and he could have told you that the Canadian Government have at least three schemes of assistance for the farmer.  They have the prairie farm assistance scheme and a crop insurance scheme whereby the farmers, when the price of crops falls below a certain level, are compensated by the State.  If we had such a scheme as that here our farmers could afford to takes risks which to-day they are not prepared to take. In the absence of such a scheme, the alternative is to keep the price of wheat relatively high and to give such security in the production of the crop over a period as will induce men to persevere in their production of it. We have to face a situation, whether we like it or not, in which we are going to have difficulties in getting our farmers to grow wheat, but we must have wheat.  In conditions such as we are experiencing to-day it is, I know, popular to urge that prices are too high for the consumer, but there are quite a number of commodities now getting so scarce that even the poorest consumers would be prepared to pay a higher price than they were prepared to pay in the past in order to secure such commodities.  That is the case with bread as with a number of other things.</P>
    <P>I recognise that you can raise the prices of commodities or food to such a level that they are beyond the reach <Col N="1322" /> of the poorest amongst us.  When we are faced with a situation like that &mdash; it might very well be like that before the end of the emergency &mdash; then the State, representing the community as a whole, has an obligation to come to the rescue of the poor, to ensure that they will get such assistance as will enable them to get the necessities of life, and that they will not go hungry. The first essential, however, is to make sure that the commodities are there.  The only agency through which you can make certain that wheat is grown is that provided by our farmers. You may find all the fault you like with them, but if they do not do the job for you, I do not think anybody else in the country is prepared to undertake it.  In circumstances like these, dependent as the whole community is on them, you have got to give them such conditions of security and such remuneration for their services as will ensure that a position is created in which the farmer has been given every encouragement to deliver the goods.</P>
    <P>There is one point to which I should like the Minister to give some consideration. I feel certain misgivings about the position in which we appear to find ourselves at the moment.  While we have an immensely increased area under tillage, certain other essential foods are becoming short, and the shortage is gradually becoming accentuated. I am beginning to wonder whether or not this whole question of our agricultural production and the type of production in which we should engage has been given that wide and deep consideration that the welfare of the nation demands.  In spite of all our efforts to provide wheat and cereals and in spite of the hopes I have had, and the feeling and belief that we ought to be able to produce much more of food for human beings and animals on our own land, I see a situation where, apparently, we are not succeeding. That is an aspect of the question to which I should like the Minister to give attention.  I do not want to stand between the House and the Minister in giving him an opportunity of dealing with some of the questions that have been raised.  I say, finally, that I think <Col N="1323" /> it would be most unwise to press the amendment of Senator Byrne.  It is not going to get us more wheat.  There are great tracts of land on which, if you compel people to grow wheat rather than the grain crop of their choice, we are going to get no crop at all.</P>
