    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I had been making a case for having this report give an indication of the political development of the Communities and also Government policy in relation to these developments, so that the Oireachtas could play a useful role in debating this report and have some accountability from the Government. Therefore, I had expressed criticisms of the content of this the first report because it is a bare factual report, summarising matters which can be found elsewhere; indeed, often disguising the real policy considerations behind the report.  Going progressively through the chapters of the <Col N="220" /> report, I had come to the chapter on Company Law and I had referred to the fifth draft directive on company law from the European Communities. This directive could result in a fundamental change in Irish company law by a new structure of companies, particularly by this concept of worker-participation.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed to see how little debate either in the trade unions, in this House or in general in Irish life there has been on this question of industrial democracy.  If this directive is to be implemented in the near future, we ought to have much more consideration of its implications here and adopt a much more positive approach to it.  Therefore, I regret that the very minimal coverage in this report does not give an indication of Government thinking and does not really give an opportunity for a fuller debate on this very important subject.</P>
      <P>The next item I should like to look at is chapter 11.13 on the Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgment in Civil and Commercial Matters.  This convention has come into force since February, 1973, for the original six member states and will come into force soon for the three new members.  It is an extremely important legal convention.  It will make a vast change in the role of the courts in recognising and enforcing foreign judgments.  It will have vast legal implications.  It will always have important political implications too, which are not indicated here at all. One area in which it will have significant political implications is that of the recognition of maintenance payments. Every public representative is aware of the hardship caused by the failure to have maintenance orders made in Ireland enforceable in England and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts have been made over the years to get agreement on a bilateral basis in relation to this.  It does seem that this convention will require the enforcement of maintenance payments. This is extremely important.  It is a matter of high policy content but there is no indication here of what is involved.  I regret this very much because it means that the debate cannot <Col N="221" /> be a very constructive one.  The wording about the present position is rather typical of the approach of this report.  I quote from the second paragraph under this heading, which states:</P>
    <P>...A working group representative of all member states of the enlarged Community, is now engaged in the examination of the problems of adaptation of the Convention to meet the requirements of the new member states.</P>
    <P>Who is on this working group?  Have consultations been held?  What are the factors involved?  Surely we could have a little more information as to the background of what is, in fact, a very important convention.  To what extent has there been consultation either with the judiciary or with the legal profession? To what extent is there involvement of the people to whom this makes a vast difference?  To what extent will there be more publicity about the discussions which are going on?</P>
    <P>The next chapter deals with the policy in regard to the environment. Here, again, if we are to believe that this report covers the developments in the Communities up until the 15th May I find it very disappointing that it does not cover the draft Council's resolution on the environment which is dated the 10th April and which is an extremely important draft resolution recommending extensive Community action relating to the environment, recommending that the Community would have a sort of monitoring role in relation to even State activity in relation to the environment.  None of this is clear although this was all published on the 10th April.  It does not appear in this report which was supposed to cover developments until the 15th May.  What would be useful here would be an indication of the Irish approach to this question of the environment. Are we going to take it more seriously on a national basis?  There have been rumours about a Department of the Environment.  If one looks at the scope of the Community activity and the extent to which there will be an exchange of information and joint enterprises, there is a very strong case for a Department of the Environment to allow us to play a full part in the <Col N="222" /> Community activity and to expand our national activity in protecting the environment.</P>
    <P>The next subject I should like to look at is the question of regional policy.  This is the area which has given rise to most of the discussion.  We seem to view the Community through the eyes of a regional policy.  That is not a bad way to look at it but once again the actual chapter on regional policy, although it does refer to Commissioner Thompson's report on regional policy which was published early in May, is disappointing, because it does not really give an indication of the consideration involved or of the necessity that the regional policy be more than just a word.  There is no attempt to go deeper into the whole concept of regions.  It is important that we appreciate that within the complexity of the European countries there are at least four different types of regions.  There is the region which has a national minority in it and which has a strong cultural and historical difference such as in Brittany, Wales or Flanders.  That is the first type of region.  There is the second type of region in which an existing administrative unit has been formed, very often not of a very long historical background such as some of the Laender in Germany and the Italian regions.  The third type of region is the trans-frontier region where for various reasons to do with the development of a particular area which crosses countries' boundaries there is a joint administrative machinery.  Examples of this are the Regio Basiliensis and Schleswig-Holstein.  There are strong arguments for trying to create this sort of unit between the north-west and northern part of this country.  Fourthly there is the economic region in the sense of a Community regional financial policy.</P>
    <P>We ought to look closely at the Thompson report for this reason, because it only deals with the economic region.  Perhaps this is one of the reasons why Europe has not achieved, as yet, the human face that is talked about so much.  There is a great deal more to regionalism than the economic aspects of it, important as they may be. There is the importance of treasuring <Col N="223" /> and fostering cultural diversity, recognising the traditions that are there.  We ought not to allow all debate on regional policy to be narrowed purely to the economic aspects.  It might very well be that Europe could achieve much more relevance and popularity with the people living in the unit of the Community if we were to emphasise the importance of this cultural diversity and if we were to try to work out a convention which protected cultural minorities, the rights to a language, the right to self-determination within areas, which reconciled differences and which encouraged the peoples of Brittany, Flanders, Wales, Scotland and particularly the Gaelic areas of Ireland to realise that Europe protected rather than destroyed them.  We do not want a homogenised single culture Europe. This is part of regional policy in its full sense but it is not part of the present regional policy as conceived by the Community.</P>
    <P>The other point I wish to make about the Thompson proposals is that they rely very much on national regional policies.  In chapter 15.5 paragraph (a) it is stated:</P>
    <P>Community regional policy cannot be a substitute for the national regional policies which member states have been conducting for many years.  It must complement them with the aim of reducing the main disparities across the Community....</P>
    <P>Here the responsibility lies with ourselves. We do not have, I would maintain, a sufficiently co-ordinated, clear and devolved regional policy.  We have various types of regions for various reasons.  We have one type of region according to the IDA, another type of region according to Bord Fáilte, another type of region for purposes of health.  We do not have any representative structures at the regional level.  This is very important. If the Community regional policy is to be a reality, then the Commission is going to look for structures beneath the national level which are representative and with which it can deal.  This must come. The Commission must be able to talk <Col N="224" /> to representatives of regions.  We do not have representative bodies at regional level.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan was much too optimistic about the approach of the Commission that has designated Ireland as one region, but is prepared to say that within that one region there are areas of greater need than others, for example, the west and the south-west.  What the west and the south-west should have is representative regional bodies to articulate this point, to speak for that region to the Commission and to examine and plan for the needs of that region.  This is the trend in other countries.  In Britain, for example, the Kilbrandon report will recommend regional assembles for Scotland and Wales. There will be a devolution of power. We ought to examine how to set up in our own internal regions representative structures which can benefit from a Community regional policy. This ought to be done as a matter of urgency.  As a complement to this in our legislative policy we ought to examine whether in all cases centralisation is a good thing.  We do not ask the question any more when it is decided that the Government will be involved in a new activity.</P>
    <P>There is always the demand that the Government do something, that they set up a particular machinery, or that they take over a particular activity.  This is the increasing tendency. We never say it would be better to let it be carried out at a regional level rather than at a centralised, Dublin level.  If we have representative structures at the regional level we could ask this healthy question: &ldquo;Do we really want this also centralised in a Dublin bureaucracy or do we want it devolved to allow more participation by the citizens around the country?&rdquo; There are vital questions for our own internal regional policy on which the Community policy will only be a supplement and not a substitute, certainly in the near future.</P>
    <P>Regarding the social policy of the Community we need to do much more thinking about our own social policy and labour relations.  Efforts have been <Col N="225" /> made to introduce the concept of equal pay in the public service.  I hope we have an opportunity to debate the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women and I hope we will be able to push this a great deal further because equal pay in the public service is only a very small first step.</P>
    <P>Also, in chapter 16.14 of the report reference is made to the proposed regulation dealing with conflicts in labour law:</P>
    <P>A draft regulation under consideration since 1972 would provide that labour relationships generally would be governed by the labour law in force in the State in which the worker is employed even though his employer's headquarters may be located elsewhere in the Community.</P>
    <P>If I were a worker in one of the six original member states I would not be happy if I should come here and be governed by the labour law in this country.  As far as I know, we are the only country without an unfair dismissal compensation.  I think our labour law could be regarded as very primitive. It is part of the social policy of the Community that each of the countries improve their own internal labour relations and protection for workers.  I think that we may find that we are a stumbling block in the evolution of a Community social policy unless we put our own house in order very substantially.</P>
    <P>On a specific matter which is under the Community social policy&mdash;I am not quite sure why&mdash;I should like to ask a question in relation to the European University Institute in Florence for which the Convention has been entered into and ratified by Italy and with which plans are going ahead.  It is stated there that Ireland is represented on a preparatory committee.  Who is representing Ireland?  Is it university representation? Have there been consultations with our university?  What is our approach to this university in Florence?</P>
    <P>I hope it is intended to set up a European school in Ireland.  I think that this would be a very useful contribution to creating a European awareness in this country.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say about the <Col N="226" /> report itself.  I now want to turn to the other important matter contained in the Minister's opening speech, which is the question of the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  Like the other Senators who have spoken, I welcome the commitment to set up this Joint Committee and I welcome in particular the fact that the Government are prepared to amend section 4 of the European Communities Act.  I think that this is a very welcome and a very flexible step on their part.  I am not, however, quite satisfied with what the Minister has said in that opening speech about the Committee.  He does not make it clear whether this Committee will be a Select Committee.  I think the arguments are very strong that this Committee must have the powers of a Select Committee if it is to be a reality.  It must have powers of a Select Committee because it must be able to call for persons and records. It could be worked out that, instead of having consultation between the Parliament and the bureaucracy in the Civil Service, there would be co-operation.  It would not be necessary to give powers of <i>subpoena</i> to the Committee.  One could try to work for a very real co-operation. If the Committee cannot call for expertise from outside, if they cannot ask the head of the IDA, for example, to come in and say what the implications might be, to ask the official in the particular Department implementing a particular proposal to come and explain to the Committee, then that Committee is reduced to a very minimal level and it is not sufficient to give that Committee a good Secretariat. Without the power to reach out for information that Committee cannot report as it is intended that the Committee would report, on specific proposals in a meaningful way because it would be too confined in what it could do.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some points, first of all, about the way in which the Oireachtas, in general, ought to approach membership of the Community. I do not think that it is sufficient to create a Committee and then forget about Europe.  The whole dimension of Europe must be something of which all Members of the <Col N="227" /> House are aware and on which all of them have a possibilty of getting sufficient knowledge and information. I would draw the attention of this House to the procedure in the Westminster Parliament.  I do not give this as an example we must slavishly follow but to show that we can learn from the way in which other parliaments operate.  Members of both Houses are sent weekly lists of the proposed legislation from the European Communities and there is a part in it which can be filled in if a member wants the particular proposals for regulations and directives sent to him.  This is very important because, increasingly, the draft regulations and directives of the Community will be of interest to particular sectors and therefore to particular public representatives who have either a local factory which could be affected or a local industry.  It is not enough to have a Committee.  All Members of the House should have the facilities of knowing what legislation is coming from the Community and have it sent to them if necessary.</P>
    <P>I think that we ought to consider the possibility of rearranging the procedures of the House.  For example, it should be possible to have a special day for questions on Europe so that the Ministers may reply to questions on the European activities which affect their Departments, so that there can be a comprehensive assessment of Government activity on a day-to-day basis through this Question Time. Again, the twice yearly debate in each House on the report of the developments in the Community is another additional way in which the Parliament can adapt to membership of Europe.</P>
    <P>Returning to the question of a Joint Committee, I feel if this Committee is to be really effective it must be a Select Committee, having powers to call for persons and records.  I also believe it should have a paid chairman in the same way as the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach.  This would mean that the chairman of the Committee would regard his work as full time and the necessity for this arises from the fact that the Dáil rises for a very long period during <Col N="228" /> the summer while the Community does not.  The holidays of the European Commission are much shorter than the holidays of the Dáil at various times of the year.  If the chairman is actually paid for this position and therefore has the status of and equivalence to the Ceann Comhairle or the Cathaoirleach, he can be expected to be working and the members of the Committee can be expected to be called during off-periods when the Dáil or Seanad are not in session. I also think that the staff of the Joint Committee should be responsible to the chairman of that Committee and be separate from the general staff in the Oireachtas so that it would not mean that the Joint Committee would be using a part-time official who had about ten other functions to perform and who could be called away to do these other things.  We need to define the staff of this Committee who will be responsible to the chairman of the Committee.</P>
    <P>I do not think that a membership of ten delegates to the European Parliament and ten others is sufficient. Senator Yeats made the point that the delegates to the European Parliament might be absent for a good deal of the time and even when they are present they may not have the time to devote to committees.  They may want to be in the more public arena of the floor of the House.  Therefore, it is a burden on them to some extent. They ought to be allowed to participate in the work of the Committee but they are not going to be very real members of it.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Committee should be at least one-third as big again. It should be at least a Committee of 30 members, including the delegates of the European Parliament.  If one looks at the possibility that the membership from the Seanad will be three and the membership from the Dáil will be seven I believe, speaking as an Independent, it will be sad to see how that will be parcelled out and how very few Members of the Seanad, who wish to participate, will be able to do so.</P>
    <P>It would be better to involve a larger number on the actual Committee <Col N="229" /> and also&mdash;this is very important&mdash;to give access to all Members of both Houses to the sittings of the Committee and the right to participate if they so wish.  This is an important way of creating an awareness of the European dimension rather than having an elite who huddle in a corner and have secret discussions on proposals.  If there was a right of access to all Members to the deliberations of the Committee it would be a very useful exercise.</P>
    <P>A larger Committee of at least 30 members would create the possibility of having some sub-committees.  It will be necessary to have some sort of sifting process, probably by the chairman and the officials of the Committee, for the more important recommendations. It is stated in the Minister's opening address that the Committee will report to the Houses of the Oireachtas and I think this is to be welcomed but it is very important that the Committee be allowed to publish their reports so that there will not be a delay while they are being laid before the Oireachtas. Secondly, I think the Committee should have the power to decide in which language the report will be published or whether it should be published in both languages.  Anybody dealing with reports of Committees of the Oireachtas knows of the very long delays that can sometimes occur.  It is necessary that this Committee be able to report very quickly after they have completed their deliberations either on specific proposals, such as the proposal for regional or social policy, or on a series of individual draft proposals of the Community.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one final point on the question of a Joint Committee. I see a need for a body&mdash;I am not sure if it would be appropriate that this would be a subcommittee of this Committee or another <i>ad hoc</i> body&mdash; to look at the legal consequences of Ireland's entry into the European Community.  There is a necessity for a scrutiny of specifically legal draft instruments.  We need to examine the changes in domestic law which would be either desirable or necessary as a result of Community draft instruments. <Col N="230" /> We need to know the effect of directly applicable regulations on domestic law and we need to examine the most appropriate means of passing European legislation into our domestic law.  Here again I would disagree with Senator Yeats who seemed to think that it was not a function of such a Committee to decide on choice of means and that the Government should not ask the Committee to do so but should come forward with draft proposals.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the fact that the Government would consider asking the Committee about the question of choice of means of implementing Community secondary legislation into domestic law because, very often, there could be quite an important policy consideration involved.  Take, for example, the fifth directive on company law which talks about worker participation; surely nobody here would like to see that implemented by a regulation under the European Communities Act rather than by a full Irish statute that went through the Oireachtas and was debated very fully in both Houses.  That would be the appropriate method to implement a welcome change in Irish company law of that sort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, what is proposed is that the Committee would have the power to recommend, not that the Government would ask it nor that the Committee would decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I understand by it although I may have phrased it wrongly.  I would welcome that power to recommend because the choice of means of implementing Community legislation is extremely important.  If the Committee are to be really effective they will have to be in some sense an innovation in the life of the Oireachtas.  They have to be a Select Committee who function as such.  They have to have an independent relationship in having a paid chairman, in having a staff responsible to that chairman, in having the power to issue their own reports and these reports could be taken at the same time as the Government reports <Col N="231" /> are taken twice yearly for debate.  We could have a very interesting cross-reference from one to the other and it would be a useful way of finding out what the selected representatives in the Parliament think of specific areas.</P>
      <P>Even in the near future it ought to be possible for this Joint Committee to have the sort of contact with the European Communities, with the European Parliament and with the European Commission that the committees of other member state parliaments have.  The procedural Committees of the Houses of Commons and Lords, which are examining this question, have been to Brussels and have interviewed people there.  That is an expensive exercise but there are occasions when it would be very useful for the Joint Committee of Parliament to go to Brussels to find out about the debates in the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>In other words, we are not talking about just another Committee.  We are talking about a very real development in the parliamentary life of this country if the Oireachtas is to play a relevant role in the development of the European Communities.</P>

      <P>First of all, I would like to praise the very critical and detailed analysis that has been made of the report both by Senator Yeats and Senator Robinson.  I am not academically inclined and I have to live in the university of life; consequently, I should like to talk about the social aspects not so much as regards how we approach them but from the basis that we are in Europe.  Europe is now a fact and certain developments have taken place that make it necessary for us to ensure that our people, who are appointed and nominated to go to Europe, act in a way that will bring about the best possible results for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Paris Summit the heads of state agreed that, although the structures of the institutions have proved themselves, the decision-making procedures and functions should be improved. This is important to me as a trade unionist but I do not say so in a selfish way.  The trade union is a mass <Col N="232" /> organisation, representing about 750,000 people from both parts of our island, and if one takes the dependants and relatives of members it constitutes a very sizeable proportion of the population. Their activities can have a great influence on the industrial, political and economic advancement of the country and, indeed, they have had a great influence over the years.</P>
    <P>The statement that there should be an improvement is a very welcome one because it is neutral in the sense that it is an admission that the foundation exists and needs to be built on.  I would be concerned about the shape that this improvement in the structures would take, whether they would widen at the base or whether they would become pyramid-shaped.  If they became pyramid-shaped I do not know if we could bear the weight.  Probably that is saying the same thing as Senator Mary Robinson in a different way.  I would be rather concerned about the shape of any improvements in the functions and procedure-making positions in the EEC.  It is a problem for us.</P>
    <P>The purpose my putting my viewpoint is as follows.  Firstly, I should like it to be clearly known that, while the trade union people may have had a viewpoint either for or against entry, or some may have had reservations, they are taking it as a factual situation. Our representatives in the EEC will bring home forcibly and influence as much as possible the other parties concerned to the effect that an evolution into an economic community is not the end nor is it the peak of the ambitions of the trade union movement.  In addition, it is not the end of the social desires of trade unionists who have been pursuing social initiatives for many, many years.  In this respect I have every confidence in the people who have been nominated to the committees of the Commission in Europe. They can play a vital and energetic role and can bring a very wide and broad experience into those institutions.</P>
    <P>The collective attitude is that: if the blow went against somebody, that is fair enough; we are not interested in the blow, we are interested in the way the thing bounces.  The main consideration <Col N="233" /> is this: we are in there now and the institutions of the Community must be worked and worked to the greatest advantage possible for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Participation in the committees, as they are presently instituted, must also be considered.  I believe that, as far back as 1965, many social initiatives were taken by trade union bodies in Europe and social programmes set down and these have not yet been given effect to.  This is a cause for very great concern.  Procedures and functions are very important to a person like me, who has to deal with industry.  Dealing with industry is similar to dealing with institutions of this sort.  This is why the question of dealing with the institutions is of tremendous importance.</P>
    <P>There is no point in emphasising further that the workers have helped to advance their present decision by conflict.  It was like a civil war and many sanctions had to be applied.  There was also the attitude that it was quite possible to have this conflict and, at the same time, work in co-operation with the other parties, whether it be the Government or the employer.  It was generally the employer, and we always tried to keep the Government out of it.</P>
    <P>We tried to play our part to help the advancement of the working classes and the underprivileged people. That attitude will be taken into Europe.  We will further not only the interests of the workers, but the welfare and advancement of the Irish people in general.  To approach it in any other way would be a dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>The trade union representatives on the various committees, irrespective of the nature of the peculiar institution they have to serve on, will be conscious all the time of the aspirations of the Irish people.  They will endeavour as far as possible to see that nobody in the Community&mdash;they will need the help of the other social partners and the Government&mdash;gets a social advantage over any other section.</P>
    <P>At present, unfortunately, that is <Col N="234" /> the way it is going.  The rich have got richer and the poor have stood still.  That is the history of Ireland. At present in Europe there is no great indication that the social advantages there have kept pace with the economic developments.  This is a matter of great concern to us.  I should like the House to know that we are not expecting miracles.  We entered the Community as recently as 1st January, 1973.  Progress is very slow because, no matter what initiative, idea or proposal comes up, it is not 100 per cent, and is never accepted as being 100 per cent correct.  That, in itself, poses many problems.  There are also the many variables referred to by Senator Robinson.  All still have their own advocates at work.  Consequently, it will not be easy to get agreement very rapidly.  Working within the presently constituted institutions, advancement on the social front should be a priority, whether it is through equal pay, regional policy or benefits for the underprivileged. We probably will get the support of the employer.  Despite the conflicts of the past, there is an enlightened attitude among most employers now that the worker must be more than ever involved in the running of industry.</P>
    <P>Workers participation has been mentioned.  This is related, whether we like it or not, to industrial democracy. What has happened in Ireland regarding industrial democracy?  Senator Robinson was disturbed that it had not been debated in either the Seanad or the Dáil.  She probably does not realise that in 1957 the Irish Congress of Trade Unions adopted a motion on industrial democracy and a great deal of work has since been done on it.  The many pronouncements we had in the meantime, and the use of much intellectual jargon, did not help it to progress; it only confused the situation.  We had people designing and drawing up policies and proposals, and it all has led to a bit of confusion.  Had they stayed out of it and left it to the Trade Union Congress, a great deal more progress would have been made on this front. To those of us who represent workers and their interests all it means is another step in the process of regulating <Col N="235" /> the relationship between the employer and employee.  It is as simple as that, although there are many considerations in it.  However, the intellectuals decided to write articles, produce papers and bamboozle the workers with the result that we had people crying out for industrial democracy who did not even know what it meant.</P>
    <P>If Senator Robinson wants to debate the question of worker participation, I would most certainly welcome that opportunity.  There are many sides to it.  Even though this motion has been down since 1957 and work has been done on it, we in Ireland have not even an effective grievance procedure.</P>
    <P>If supervisory boards and other machinery are introduced into the Irish trade union movement and into the relationship with employers, <i>et cetera</i>, in order to help us develop in the Community and enjoy the standard of life, which membership of the Community entails, we must understand&mdash;and so far it is not quite understood&mdash;what the supervisory boards are.</P>
    <P>If I were told some workers should serve on the board of an enterprise, I would adopt a cynical approach.  It would seem ridiculous to have the right to sit on a board to make policy and then have the right, at ground level, to veto that policy.  In the present design and structure of industry the employer makes the policy and the trade union deal with it.  So far the workers in general have expressed no great desire that they want to share in that sort of decision-making process.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to say whether supervisory boards would be readily accepted by the trade union movement or whether the workers in general would gain anything from them.  Certainly a board of directors' first obligation, whether we like it or not is to the owners of an enterprise.  It is not necessary the management we are talking about but the owners of capital.  Their first obligation is not the supplying of goods and services but to see that the enterprise is profitable. Consequently, I do not know if we would be much interested in that <Col N="236" /> aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>If workers were put on a board there is no reason why the company could not put somebody on to out-vote them. It does not appear to me to be a very practical proposition.  Even though it has not been proposed here it has been suggested in other areas and I think the air ought to be cleared on that point.</P>
    <P>The question of full and active participation in the operations at the lower level is something to be desired. As I have said, we have not even got effective grievance machinery.  Sometimes consultation, or what passes for consultation, is merely information at a point when an irrevocable decision has been taken.</P>
    <P>As to the question of participation, regard would have to be had to the dimension it would assume.  If the councils are merely going to be used for company policies, a mutual admiration society, if you like, or for a developer or some individual to advance his own social position, then they have not very much meaning.  In effect, this whole question of industrial democracy as a natural development from democracy in general is justified but its shape and nature need very serious consideration.</P>
    <P>It should not be clothed in legal jargon.  It must be expressed in terms of the man on the ground floor.  The real way to tackle a problem is to ensure that when it is done it is done in such a way that the thickest man in the squad is catered for.  Possibly this will not look too well in print in the Official Report.  However, it is a fact of life.  This has to be done.  When it is brought about everyone must understand exactly where he is going. Consequently, while we welcome the idea of industrial democracy, there should not be any great interference from outside the trade union movement. Congress has got the people and the ability and I have no doubt it will be introduced at an opportune time.</P>
    <P>We work through structures and institutions.  I should like to go on record here as saying that I was not opposed to entry into the EEC: in fact, I was an advocate of it.  As well as that I had regard to the many <Col N="237" /> problems and difficulties in which we would be involved.  I am concerned about the nature of the developments. If the developments were going to allow people to overwhelm us because of their vast experience having been in Europe for a long time before us, we should guard against it.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the point Senator Robinson was making about policy-making in Ireland.  She referred to a policy committee.  If the Senator means that somebody would write policy and then bring it into the institutions in Europe, I do not agree. It was rather difficult to hear everything the Senator said as she spoke at great length.  But if I understood her last remark correctly she was talking about the position where if we had this committee we could determine, to a great extent, policy and bring it into the institutions of Europe.</P>
    <P>In regard to policy-making unfortunately the Community are not very ready to receive it from any organisation outside.  It has to be argued from within on its merits.  One cannot have the Houses of the Oireachtas being the only people involved in making policy; other sections of Irish society should be involved also.  Policy-making is really a matter of improvisation.  Improvisations are necessary because we have clever men who will not subjugate their own needs to the needs of the masses.  When directives are decided upon we have to consider and see how they can be used to our advantage.  We are not bound hand and foot by any directives made, except in the sense that they are decisions to which we are bound.  We are not bound by them to the extent of not being able to use our own initiative to implement them.  I was concerned about this point as I do not know what the Senator meant in that respect.</P>
    <P>I am concerned as to how the institutions function not particularly on behalf of the trade unions or the employers but rather on behalf of the under-privileged.  The employers and trade unions have resources at their disposal for taking care of themselves. The under-privileged have not got these resources.  One of the disasters of society is that the working classes were <Col N="238" /> engaged in a kind of civil war which was very costly to both sides in a situation where there is a natural conflict of interests because of the nature of the society in which we live.</P>
    <P>There is always an argument not whether you should get a share of the cake but as to the size of the share. The under-privileged suffer most in this sort of conflict.  By these I mean persons on fixed incomes and whose who are looking for equal pay for equal work. I should like to ask my representatives what are the possibilities of pushing as hard as possible on the social objectives and in this process would it be possible to ask the Government on the one hand for some further assistance in Europe and the institutions and the employers on the other hand to practise the art of letting go.  This applies particularly in cases where it would not be so disastrous for them to let go because the scope is there for this.</P>
    <P>The trade unions have got into this civil war and the under-privileged suffered.  Another class arose out of that, the middle class, and the gap is beginning to widen between us and the people whom we are striving to help by the nature of society.  We are now in a position that unless we take an attitude in Europe of having the social objectives as a priority, and unless we take social initiatives, the gap that has widened between the owners of capital and the under-privileged to whom I have already referred will widen still further.  The trade unions will take care of themselves in the trenches.  They will have the co-operation of other European bodies and I have no doubt they will play a good role for the country, but there may be some limitations on how far they can go in the social objectives.  They would need assistance from the employers and the Government.</P>
    <P>When we speak of rights we should understand there are obligations as well.  If we wish to gain greater benefits a certain amount of rights have to be surrendered.  I am not an advocate of the private enterprise society but I am a realist.  I must work within the society in which I live and do it without wearing the crown of thorns at a crucifying angle but rather at a jaunty angle. <Col N="239" /> When things go wrong you must bounce back and deal with matters as they come along.  We must pay great attention to the question of what our ambitions are in the community inside the structures.</P>
    <P>I am forgetting for the time being about the report and what should or should not have been found there and what was wrong with it.  I am concerned with the question of advancing our people to a point where the old order must go and I realise that in the process we cannot get benefits without surrendering some rights.  I am somewhat puzzled by the contributions from Senator Yeats and Senator Robinson. They were carrying it close to the bone as to whether some of these rights should be surrendered.  If I thought the social objectives were to get priority and that we would receive help from the Government and the employers in the sense of leaning back a bit on the shoulder, then I would willingly accept as I am sure most of my trade union colleagues would accept, in the interests of the under-privileged, that the abrogation of some independence is a necessity.  We cannot have the rights without the obligations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of the communiqué issued at the end of the Summit Conference in Paris last October was its emphasis on the necessity for co-ordinating the various measures which were necessary to reach European union by the end of the decade.  Although the nature of the union is still far from clear and will be the subject of a great deal of debate and disagreement, I have no doubt that some progress will be made and that the structure we will have in the Community by 1980 will be a great deal more integrated than at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aims and objectives of the economic and monetary union and the methods by which these can be achieved have been outlined to a considerable extent and although many problems remain, if the problems can be solved and agreement reached to the satisfaction of the nine States in the Community then one important aspect of European unity will have <Col N="240" /> been achieved.  On the other hand, the form and extent of political union is much less clear at this stage and there will undoubtedly be very strong pressures by at least some of the states against any substantial transfer of power from the states to the Community in the political sphere.  This pressure has waxed and waned over the years since the beginning of the Community and it often depends on the personality and philosophy of some of the leading statesmen in the Community.  It is difficult to say at this stage just how much progress will be made towards political union. Some progress will be made, but on the other hand it is most unlikely that we will find ourselves with anything in the nature of a federal structure by 1980.  Progress will be made by way of consultation, starting by way of further consultation and co-ordination. Subsequently a limited transfer of powers will result in certain areas, probably those of foreign policy, defence and possibly such ones as aid to under-developed countries outside the Community.</P>
    <P>What strikes on reading the report before us is the connection between the common agricultural policy, the social policy and the regional policy. Certainly all three have many things in common and are of significance. For the same reasons, as far as this country is concerned, there is a considerable amount of overlapping of benefits.  One could easily envisage a problem area in an agricultural region of this country being the beneficiary of funds from the three policy departments, agricultural, social and regional.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the referendum dealing with membership of the Community, when a great deal of discussion took place as to the benefits or otherwise of membership, most of the discussion was in relation to the common agricultural policy.  It was argued by those not in favour of entry that the CAP was the aspect which had any real hope of benefit for this country, that the regional policy had no teeth in it and that the social policy was not really relevant to our problems.  The social policy has been given increased status.  Substantial <Col N="241" /> funds have been provided and more have been promised for the future.</P>
    <P>The Paris Summit communiqué in relation to social policy included a statement in which the heads of State emphasised that they attached as much importance to vigorous action in the social field as to the achievement of economic and monetary union.  A reformed fund, financed by the Community budget and in operation from 1st May, 1972, provides assistance to two categories of cases.  These are set out in page 77 of the report, chapter 16, paragraph 3.  The second paragraph, which is of more importance to this country, deals with the reformed fund:</P>
    <P>Where the employment position in certain regions, in certain branches of the economy or in certain groups of undertakings is affected by difficulties which are not the result of any specific Council measure but which derive indirectly from the operation of the Common Market or which impede the harmonious development of the Community: in these cases, assistance may be given towards eliminating long-term structural unemployment and underemployment, towards training manpower as well as towards operations intended to fit disabled persons for employment and to give employment to older workers, women and young persons; and, in general, these projects must form part of an overall plan for the region, the industries or the particular groups of people concerned.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that this country will benefit very much under the type of situation mentioned in the second of these two categories.  The first category is not so relevant to this country but it includes help from the social fund to those who are moving from agriculture towards industry and who consequently require retraining.  To this extent also we would benefit under the first category outlined as being the beneficiary of social policy.</P>
    <P>As regards the regional policy, the heads of state at the October Summit, agreed that a high priority should be given to the aim of correcting the <Col N="242" /> structural and regional imbalances which might affect the realisation of the economic and monetary union.  The importance of this priority is that they emphasised that whatever one might think about agriculture or depressed areas&mdash;even those who had no altruistic or idealistic interest in such matters &mdash;if the economic and monetary union was to succeed it was necessary that a regional policy should be successful and achieve an economic quality, in so far as this was possible, in the under-developed regions.</P>
    <P>To those who argue that the European Community are only concerned with making the rich richer and the poor poorer, the big business and the wealthy areas, this is an answer by the Summit Conference.  People must realise that if the Community is to progress and achieve economic and monetary union, it will be necessary to have a successful regional and social policy.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the regional policy would be to correct imbalances resulting from, <i>inter alia</i>, preponderance of agriculture, industrial change and structural underemployment.  In the guidelines given in the report of the Commission on 3rd May, 1973, the importance of national policies was stressed.  It was stressed that they were the important ones.  National policies would give the initiative.  The Commission can only complement these policies.  This point has been made already by some of the speakers but it is necessary to reiterate it because many people in this country, in all walks of life, from the Government right down to the man-in-the-street, still feel that the Common Market will take the initiative and give us help, money and ideas as to how the regions can be developed.  The states must take the initiative, the Commission can only complement them.  This must be stressed again and again.</P>
    <P>The document refers among other things to the fact that the Community must reduce concentration of capital, benefits and aids of one kind and another to what the report describes as the congested areas.</P>
    <P>It has another association in the minds of people in this country, because <Col N="243" /> what the Community mean by the congested areas are the areas which are congested in the sense that they have a very high incidence of industry and high employment.  It is one of the aims of the regional policy referred to at the Summit Meeting in October last that there must be far less aid given to these areas and far more given to the areas which are in need.  This will be an important test of the solidarity of the Community as to whether it is to move in the direction mentioned by some of its critics of making the rich areas richer and the poor ones poorer or whether it is to make a really practical move to bring up the backward areas to the economic wealth of the better-off ones.</P>
    <P>The report analysed the under-developed regions at page 75, chapter 15, paragraph 15.5 (j), where it described a common feature of all these areas as a relatively low income per head of the population and a high dependence on agricultural employment. It stated:</P>
    <P>As regards the areas suffering from industrial change these have usually been those where there has been a high dependence for employment on ageing industries.  Their problems of economic transformation are often underlined by a constantly slow rate of growth and by high levels of unemployment stretching over many years.  Thus, for identifying these industrial problem areas GDP per head is a valid criterion as is a persistent high rate of unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary in considering the three departments from which we can hope to obtain financial benefit from the Community to go into detail in regard to the common agricultural policy.  The common agricultural policy has in the past year, particularly in the past few months, suffered some criticism and lack of support.  There have been attacks on it by various countries. In particular, the UK is obviously not an enthusiastic supporter of this policy.  Nevertheless there is sufficient support of a fundamental kind for <Col N="244" /> it in the Community to ensure that it will remain a fundamental part of the Community and that any attempt seriously to undermine it will mean the collapse of the Community as such.</P>
    <P>Consequently, we can look forward to the prospect that it will remain. Possibly it will be modified in certain respects.  We can, however, be confident that it will remain as a fundamental part of the Community and that it will maintain its objective to ensure that the agricultural community will obtain a fair rate of remuneration for their products and that their position in the Community will be kept on a par with those in the industrial and commercial areas.  At present, even though disappointment has been expressed at some of the prices fixed in the last few months, the prices which are available to the farmer add up to a position of great potential for every farmer, but particularly for the farmer who combines initiative with industry. This goes for farmers in all parts of the country not only for big farmers and those with good land.  If they have the initiative the prices and benefits available under the common agricultural policy have great potential for them.  I stress the word &ldquo;potential&rdquo; because it is merely a potential.  They have to produce the right goods.  They have to use their farms to the maximum potential irrespective of whether they are big or small or good or bad. If they do so there is a great deal for them in the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the economic and monetary union, the Council of the Community adopted a resolution in 1971 recording the political will of the states to establish an economic and monetary union by 1980.  A further resolution in similar terms was passed in March, 1972.  The measures provided for were varied, some of them were purely financial and others very technical, but the report has summarised the measures which were to be taken with a view to achieving an economic and monetary union.  The measures are summarised under seven headings in the report.</P>
    <P>It is of significance that two of the <Col N="245" /> seven headings deal with regional policy.  They deal with (a) the preparation by the Commission of a draft directive aimed at promoting stability, growth and full employment and (b) initiation of action on regional policy. We have, again, the position where the achievement of an economic monetary union which is something the Community has worked hard for and which the Community wishes more than anything else to achieve can only be achieved where we have a satisfactory regional policy.  The Summit Meeting last year confirmed the determination of the Community to achieve an economic and monetary union and reaffirmed the principle of parallel progress in different fields.  None of the measures which have been summarised in this report under seven headings was to be achieved in advance of the others. None of them was to get maximum concentration.  In so far as possible there was to be parallel progress towards all the objectives mentioned.</P>
    <P>Having read this report and having regard to the developments which have taken place during the past year it seems to me that these developments have, if anything, added to the potential for Ireland in the Community. There have, perhaps, been some disappointments.  Certain aspects have not been as good as we had hoped for a year or two ago.  Nevertheless, the benefits for this country have, on balance, been added to during the time covered by this report.  The Government, however, have a primary responsibility to ensure that such benefits as are available are in fact obtained for this country.  I say the Government have a primary responsibility but I do not suggest that it is the responsibility of the Government only.  Every organisation&mdash;agricultural, industrial and vocational organisations, the trade unions and every section of the community&mdash;must play their part in ensuring that such benefits as are available are obtained for this country.  Indeed, everybody can play some part towards ensuring that the benefits are obtained.</P>
    <P>Even with the best will in the world certain organisations and certain sections of the community will find it <Col N="246" /> very difficult to avail of the benefits unless suitable structures exist or evolve to enable them to be effective and to enable them to obtain the information as to the very benefits which are available and, also, to enable them to be kept informed of the developments in regard to benefits.  In addition to this, it is obviously necessary that they should not merely play a passive role and sit around inquiring what the benefits are and then applying for them.  They must be in a position to put forward proposals which would be for the benefit of Ireland, and which would ensure that policies in the future would be designed in such a way as to be appropriate to the needs of this country.</P>
    <P>Again, it is not merely necessary to put forward proposals.  There would have to be suitable structures to ensure that these proposals are pressed, that they are bargained for and that there is lobbying done to ensure that the Irish proposals and points of view are heard and heeded in the various institutions in the Community.  These are things which would have to be done over and above the responsibility of the Government to play their part. The Government should do their utmost to encourage and assist suitable structures and suitable co-ordinating committees to ensure that what I have mentioned is done to enable various organisations to get the information at once and to make their case for the further policies that are necessary.</P>
    <P>The Government should encourage and assist structures where they already exist or where they are in the process of evolving and should, in certain cases, take the initiative in setting up structures or helping them to evolve where no suitable structure exists or where no suitable structure seems to be likely to evolve without help from outside.  The Irish Council of the European Movement have already indicated that they would be willing to play a part in this respect if it were considered that they could be of any assistance in doing so.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of structures and committees, I would like to welcome the Minister's statement that <Col N="247" /> it is intended, in the near future, to set up an Oireachtas Committee to deal with regulations and generally to deal with the information and directives, and so on, which come from the Community and to have them processed by the Oireachtas and enable the Oireachtas to take such action as they consider necessary.  This Committee has been discussed for some time and I am glad that action will now be taken to set it up.  It should be the subject for a certain amount of discussion before it is set up.  I would not like to see too much discussion and too much delay in setting it up.  I hope it will be a flexible arrangement which can be changed if it is not entirely successful in its first form.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Robinson in regard to the size of the Committee, which is rather small.  The Committee consists of those members of Parliament who are members of the European Parliament and ten other Members of the Oireachtas.  It must be realised that the members of the European Parliament will be very elusive people in the years ahead.  It will be very hard to assemble them here for a meeting of this Committee It is not merely a matter of whether the European Parliament are sitting or not.  The European Parliament sits fairly frequently. Even when they are not in session there are frequent meetings of the various committees and it would be no exaggeration to say that there will never be a time here, apart from August, and, perhaps, around Christmas, when all of the Irish members of the European Parliament will be available for a meeting.  Some of them will always be at some committee meeting or other.  This means that this Oireachtas Committee will have to do one of two things&mdash;they will have to wait until most of the European Parliamentarians are available to have a meeting, in which case, the Oireachtas Committee would meet very rarely indeed or, alternatively, they will get tired of waiting for the European parliamentarians and meet without them or with very few of them present. This will mean that they will be a very <Col N="248" /> small Committee making allowances for the fact that the members of the Committee, even those who are not European parliamentarians, will have their own problems in attending it.  In that situation there will be a very small Committee.  A Committee which will not be big enough to do the job successfully.</P>
    <P>The necessity of having the European parliamentarians at these meetings should be qualified.  Obviously, they will be very useful members of the Committee, and they will be of great help when they do attend meetings of the Committee.  Their advice will be very helpful and they will be able to give background information to the Oireachtas committee which would be of great benefit.  I do not think it necessary that they should attend all meetings or that all of them should attend all meetings; obviously this would not be possible even if it were essential.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the work of this Committee will be `homework'.  It will be a detailed examination of regulations and directives.  It will involve discussions as to how they are going to affect this country and discussions as to how directives should be implemented. There will be a good deal of detailed work, for which it will not be necessary to have European parliamentarians present, and for which a great deal of time will be necessary. Time is one thing which the European parliamentarians will not have in great quantity.  I would urge that the size of this Committee should be reconsidered on the basis that the number of non-parliamentarians should be increased.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson suggested that the size of the Committee should be increased from 20 to 30 members.  Perhaps that is a little bit unwieldly but, in any event, it should be increased to such a size as to ensure that a reasonable number, having regard to all the vicissitudes of political life, would be able to attend regularly to undertake the vast amount of detailed work which will be necessary if the Committee is to be successful.</P>
    <P>The problem of the European Parliament and its place in the European Community has been dealt with in this <Col N="249" /> report.  The twin problems of the European Parliament remain.  On the one hand, it has not sufficient power and, on the other hand, it is not democratically elected.  The Parliament has, of course, been promised some increase in power.  Certain developments have taken place during the last year or so which would give the Parliament some increase in power which would, in relation to certain measures of a general nature&mdash;where the Commission or the Council had departed from a parliamentary opinion&mdash;enable those measures to go back for something akin to a Second Reading.  Certain other proposals are being made, and some of them have been authorised, in relation to the power of the European Parliament over budgetary matters.  Some small improvements with regard to increases in the power of the Parliament have been made but they are still quite inadequate to give the European Parliament the status and the power which most parliaments already have.</P>
    <P>The reservations which some people have about membership of the Community and the transfer of power from the various States to the Community would be considerably modified if the European Parliament had substantial power, on the one hand, and if it was elected by the people, on the other hand.  This is a type of chicken-and-egg dilemma: which comes first, the chicken or the egg?  Which comes first, power or the democratic elections?  Is it worthwhile giving power to a parliament which is not representative of the people of the Community?  On the other hand, is it worth while having elections if the parliament has not got sufficient power?</P>
    <P>The dilemma will only be solved if power comes first.  Until such time as the Parliament has power there is not much use talking about democratic elections.  If it had sufficient power there would be more demand for direct elections to the Parliament and more incentive to have direct elections.  Consequently, if this dilemma is to be solved it must be solved by ensuring in the first place that the Parliament has a substantial amount of power and the question of direct elections will then follow in due course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> There is a very good prospect that if one country takes the initiative and puts forward concrete proposals and takes certain measures to have direct elections in its own country, the other countries would rapidly follow suit.  I see no reason why Ireland should not take the initiative in this respect.  It is not only necessary for the political health of the Community to have direct elections to the European Parliament but, more than anywhere else, it is necessary for this country to have direct elections because our present system, the system of sending members of the Dáil and Seanad to the Community, will become more and more burdensome as the time goes on.</P>
    <P>Parliamentarians who have to look after their Dáil affairs and, at the same time, constantly go back and forward to the European Parliament, will find it impossible to do so satisfactorily in the future.  It is estimated that approximately 100 days of the year will have to be spent by a member of the European Parliament in the Parliament if he is to attend to his duties there assiduously.  This means that almost two weeks out of every month will have to be spent abroad. I doubt whether the present system will prove to be practicable as time goes on.</P>
    <P>Our present parliamentarians who have been appointed will, in a comparatively short time, report that it is almost impossible to carry out this duty effectively.  There is a very serious risk that those who attempt to carry out their European Parliament duties properly will find that they are neglecting their constituents at home and this will result in an impediment to re-election when a general election comes along.  From this country's point of view there is a lot to be said for taking the initiative, laying the plans, discussing them at this stage and putting forward concrete measures as soon as possible for direct elections to the European Parliament</P>
    <P>There have been a number of different opinions expressed as to the form and nature of the report which is before us.  It has been argued for and against whether there should be <Col N="251" /> more Government policy, Government views, and Government thinking in the report.  I am firmly of the opinion that the report, although excellent in its way, does not contain enough policy or views of the Government as to what they intend to do without committing themselves completely.</P>
    <P>The Government should have given in this report far more pointers to policies, views and general Government thinking.  It is important that, when a policy is given, it should be described as such; it should be attributed to the Government.  It should be made clear that, when a view is given in the report, it is not merely the view of the person drawing up the report nor the view of the European Community, but that it is the Government view on a particular matter. I say this because I am in favour of more policy, more of the Government point of view, being included in the report.  It would be pointless for the report to elaborate on development during the previous six months, or to end by pointing out that there was a serious problem for this country, as a result of developments during the six months.  It would be pointless to leave the Members of the Oireachtas who read this report with a kind of cliff-hanger at the end&mdash;posing this problem and not saying what the Government were likely to do about it.  I accept that the Government cannot be too committed in advance about a matter like this.  They may not have made up their minds exactly what they propose to do.  In such a situation, the report should set out the various ways in which the Government feel this problem might be met without necessarily committing them to take any particular action.</P>
    <P>If we do not have a good deal of Government policy in these reports, then they will merely be a factual report.  It will merely be something upon which to hang a debate twice a year.  On the other hand, it might be argued that these reports should be purely factual and that, when these are being debated, the Minister could give his views on Government policy. I have no doubt that on this report <Col N="252" /> the Minister will give his views and Government policy and will mention Government proposals.  As the report will always have been written a month or two before it actually appears, in many cases it will be quite legitimate for the Minister to give views on matters contained in the report when it is being debated, because views might not have been formulated at the time the report was written.  In so far as possible the Government view should be given in the report, so that Members of the Oireachtas can consider these views, and have the opportunity of discussing them and be enabled to make an informed contribution in regard to them.  I agree that in some cases the Minister will not be in a position to give Government policy until the report is actually debated.  However, as far as possible, Government policy should be set out and referred to in the report.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins suggested that the terms of reference prevented anything but facts being included in the report.  I query if this is so. Even if it is, the terms of reference should be changed.  After all, this is the first report produced under the terms of the Act and we should not for one moment take the view that the report will always be exactly the same.  I would certainly be hopeful that the form of the report would evolve as time went on and would change in the direction of including more policy.</P>
    <P>In the report at present there is a great deal of what might be described as historical facts.  But, once these historical background facts have been dealt with, if future reports did not deal with policy they would be very short indeed and would have very little value.  It is, therefore, necessary that the form of the reports should evolve and should contain a good deal of comment and policy from the Government point of view.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to ask the Minister to comment on what is described in the report as the common commercial policy.  It is referred to in chapter 4.3 as though it was on a par with the common agricultural policy <Col N="253" /> or social policy, but there are no references made to it elsewhere in the report.  I should like to ask the Minister if the common commercial policy merely deals with the restriction on trade agreements with Eastern European countries or does it contain other provisions of importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by making a rather general point directly relating to this report.  As has been pointed out by other speakers, the report comes before us as a result of section 5 of the European Communities Act, 1972, which states that the Government shall make a report twice yearly to each House of the Oireachtas on developments in the European Community.  I concur with the opinion that this report should be a discussion of policy and of principle in general concerning the Community rather than a mere statement of fact.  There was a small minority of people in this country who voted against Irish entry into the Community.  I was a member of that small minority.  There was a still smaller minority who went around the country pointing out the great dangers attendant upon Irish membership of the Communities.  On that occasion I had the pleasure of engaging in disputation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I welcome his presence in this House and I know that he will respond to the points that have been raised in very critical fashion by Senator Robinson. However, I ask him to bear with me if I try to change contacts.</P>
      <P>This country has made a decision. I am a democrat and accept that decision. However, I must reformulate my arguments and my position in relation to the Community.  For example, one now has to see how can the dangers that were spoken of be mitigated.  One has to try to see how the Community will affect the various areas of Irish life.  One has to make the best of the situation to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I agree with the point that we should not have a mere statement of facts, I believe we should have a discussion of policy.  I say that for a number of reasons.  Opinions as to what the European Communities are differ among ordinary people, differ <Col N="254" /> among scholars.  There are those who view it as a major development towards a happy development in the history of Europe.  There are others who see it as the emergence of a new super power in Europe with certain possible dangers. These fears can only be allayed when we have a broad discussion on policy.  For example, on one occasion one of the Swedish economists commenting on Sweden's position in relation to the Common Market pointed out that one of the reasons why Sweden was worried about its relationship was that membership of such a Community, rather than facilitating a greater redistribution of income among the community, would endanger it.  Certainly, this House of the Oireachtas would benefit from the Minister's opinion as to what has been happening within the member countries of the Community.  Has inequality been eroded?  Has it been lessened or has it been significantly increased?  The Minister's opinion will be valuable.</P>
    <P>There are other points concerned which are general.  There have been conflicting opinions voiced within the Community itself.  On some occasions we have had a commitment to growth economics; on other occasions we have had statements from distinguished members of different institutions of the Communities saying that the attainment of economic growth itself was insufficient, that it was the quality of life, the welfare in general which was important.  I would welcome the informed opinion of the Minister as to which of these essentially competing economic philosophies are prevailing at the present time and what direction economic philosophy is taking in the Community.</P>
    <P>Being within the Community, whether we like it or not we have to answer these questions.  There is much in what Senator Robinson said which we can put rather simply.  Is the general tendency in the Community towards an expansion of those aspects of it which might be democratic at the cost of bureaucracy, or has there been an increase in bureaucratisation at the cost of expansion in the direction of democracy itself?</P>
    <P>I share, I am sure, with a number of <Col N="255" /> members of the Irish community a certain degree of confusion concerning the Community.  Reading, I can find, with some difficulty I must say, detailed orders concerning the dimensions of tomatoes, carrots, vegetables, cauliflowers. I know now from which side a tomato is to be measured, that is must not have spots, green leaves, things like that.  It is less easy to find out what at this point of time the Community envisages itself to be.</P>
    <P>I would welcome far more in this report a discussion of the Community's relationship to the Third World.  This is something which we may have in future reports.  This brings me to a general point again which directly emanates from the debate we have had so far.  There has been enthusiasm expressed from all sides for the idea of an Oireachtas Committee.  Senator Robinson has made the case for it being a Select Committee.  I would go further than this and I think that it would help both Houses of the Oireachtas immensely if, rather than having a Committee&mdash;even a Select Committee&mdash;on matters relating to the European Communities, we had a legislative research bureau of which this might be a part, that this would be just the first step towards establishing a legislative research bureau to which Members of the Opposition and Independents would have access.  This would be staffed by temporary and permanent staff of research capabilities which would provide Members with information so that they could discuss matters adequately and fully and more adequately participate in the deliberations of this House.  That would be a generous gesture towards all Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and would be a welcome development.</P>
    <P>I preface my comments on regional policy by again agreeing with what Senator Robinson has said concerning the definition of regional policy.  Far too often it has been conceived merely in an economic sense, and regions are not merely economic regions.  One can make a plea for regional policy so as to preserve cultural diversity.  That is a very reasonable argument.</P>
    <P>There is one point about this whole <Col N="256" /> discussion on regionalism that bothers me.  The Minister knows that the history of writing on regional economics has yet to give us a widely agreed upon definition of a region.  Far worse than that it is when we look at the history of modern economic writing; where the word &ldquo;region&rdquo; has been used we can see that it differs depending on the context in which it is used.  Regional planning, for example, has quite a different meaning in the French economic sense than it has in the states of Eastern Europe; and even in the states of Eastern Europe there is a wide variation in the usage of the term.</P>
    <P>That is a rather minor point, but what is important is that there is a great deal of talk of regional policy.  I am getting a little weary about the manner in which the terms are abused and in which the plea is being made. Everybody, I understand, is now in favour of regional policy.  Everybody bemoans the lack of regional policy. One thing that comes across to me from this report and from a number of documents emanating from the Communities is that we are presumed to have a regional policy ourselves. Maybe I am a rather naive person, but I noticed on the four or five pages here on regional policy the usage of the term &ldquo;harmonisation&rdquo;.  The message coming across loud and clear is that, where member countries have regional policies, one of the concerns of the Community is that these be harmonised.</P>
    <P>We should be a little honest about this.  We have no regional policy.  We have had no regional policy under the previous Government and this report deals with 16 months, three months of the present Government and 13 months of the previous Government; but we have not had a regional policy.  We have had a system of aids administered through clearly established institutions such as the Industrial Development Authority and others.</P>
    <P>There is a further danger in the impression we might give people in that, having imagined we have had a regional policy, we might then go on to another level of imagination and imagine that the Community has a regional policy and the shape of this second figment of the imagination <Col N="257" /> could be largely derived from the first one.  That is in so far as the Community might appear to be offering a system of aids towards peripheral regions.  Once again an aids policy at the level of the Communities could be masquerading as a regional policy. Here I come to the nub of the matter. Unfortunately in recent months I have had to reacquaint myself with the documents appearing on regional policy during the course of the campaign against entry.  They were more familiar to my mind.  All I can say is that documents continue to appear.  The recent history of documentation includes a Council resolution I read from the report of the 21st March, 1972, which suggests the use of the European Agriculture Guarantee and Guidance Fund for regional purposes and the creation of a Regional Development Fund.  This is followed by a suggestion from the Commission on 16th June of mechanisms, followed by considerations before the Summit Conference in October, 1972, at the level of the Council.  We have the Report itself, the Commission on the problems, and a speech by the Commissioner to the European Parliament on the 8th May.  Then we had the preliminary consideration of further problems on the 14th May.  There was a statement made that the Commission's proposals are expected by the end of June, and we can hope for a Regional Development Fund by the end of 1973.  These documents, taken together with all the other documents on the necessity of helping certain regions, do not constitute a meaningful move towards regional policy.</P>
    <P>The assumptions upon which our own regional policy will be established might emerge in the reply to this discussion. Are we helping regions because they need aid, because we feel we should give more from the economy? Is it an attempt to be charitable, where we have accepted the concept of sectoral growth and its cost?  If we mean real regional development I would favour Senator Robinson's suggestions about decision-making bodies within the regions.  Preliminary to regional planning, it is necessary to have a philosophical commitment to give people as much power over their <Col N="258" /> own lives and as much decision making as possible.  There is a related political concept that the structures which would exist would enable such power to be expressed across as many areas of life as possible.</P>
    <P>After these philosophical and political commitments one comes to the pragmatic manner of regional planning in the economic sense.  To be adequate this must include powers of research, planning and execution.  Literature on regional planning at its best has merely made a plea that strong development bodies have these three economic planning functions&mdash;research, establishment of plans and execution&mdash;brought together. This is insufficient and we must go back to the higher level of power, and this is why I agree with Senator Robinson.</P>
    <P>When people no longer know what is happening in their lives a number of practices start which erode democracy. The development of bureaucracy in this State has given rise to the phenomenon of political middlemen or brokers or gombeenmen, call them what you like.  When bureaucracy develops at the expense of democracy, patronage thrives.  In this case people go into a state of despair concerning their ability to control their lives.</P>
    <P>To give an example of this, I read last week on the Order Paper for the Dáil that a Deputy from Galway West constituency, Deputy Molloy, had a request for information as to when the community of Inisturk and Inisturbet would receive electricity and later, on the same Order Paper, a request as to when they would be evacuated from the two islands.  This example is further complicated by the local reporter who announced that the islanders had heard what was happening to them on the 1.30 news on Radio Éireann.  Obviously, the movement from an island to a mainland is a traumatic event in the lives of people.  This is admittedly an extreme example, but in our community at present a great number of people have no knowledge about the decision-making process and how it affects their lives.</P>
    <P>I am worried that if the bureaucracy of the Common Market continues to <Col N="259" /> develop at the expense of a democratic development, we will have a new system of patronage at a higher level.  The Minister's report to this House will become a new form of national sophisticated broker.  He should be willing to discuss in the first half of his speech the philosophical and policy developments within the Community; where he thinks the Community is going and where it is failing.  He has the commitment to be generous and honest in these comments and not to confine himself to pragmatic detail.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention a few points on regional policy.  Guidelines in chapter 15, paragraph 5, of the report are proposed as a basis for proposals to be made subsequently by the Commission in order to fulfil the invitation of the Summit Conference. Under (a) it states &ldquo;Community regional policy cannot be a substitute for the national regional policy which member States have been conducting for many years&rdquo;.  The Minister would perhaps clear up my confusion about this and indicate from which departure point our regional policy will be established.</P>
    <P>On the identification of areas with problems, it states: &ldquo;The Commission considers that the fundamental cause of regional imbalances stems from the absence of modern economic activity or the over-dependence of a region on backward agricultural or declining industrial activities&rdquo;.  I would suggest that the criteria for identifying backward regions here are at least subject to some question.  The backwardness or the development of the region cannot be identified by mere economic criteria alone.  In some of the professional discussions on the criteria of our regional backwardness there is a considerable difference of opinion.  In some of the member countries of the community there are 40 indicators of regional underdevelopment; in others there are none.  I would welcome more information on the manner in which our regional backwardness is to be established.  Will the criteria of establishing the entire country as a backward region due to its hopeless economic management in recent times <Col N="260" /> be the same as those for discerning particular regions?</P>
    <P>I appeal to Senator Lenihan and those on the other side of the House who expressed enthusiasm for the Select Committee, those on this side of the House who favour an Oireachtas Committee and Senator Robinson who wishes to have a Select Committee, to consider seriously the possibility of introducing as soon as possible a full and adequate research bureau of which this would be but one part and which would involve both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Committee which will consider EEC documents would need to establish some procedures for disseminating information concerning the activities within the Community.</P>
    <P>The second important point about which I was worried is that we would realise that true regionalism means essentially either autonomy, the ability to make decisions, or it means nothing. If we mean economic paternalism, the establishment of central aid funds, and the giving of funds to the particular regions in the centre, let us call them that; but let us not create confusion.</P>
    <P>I should like to footnote what I have stated on the eighth policy with one other consideration.  In the history of the Community, as one looks back on the decisions which have been taken, particularly in relation to agricultural products, the point of view has been expressed by a number of people that what France got away with in agriculture, certainly the member countries and the new member countries are not going to get away with it under the heading of regional policy.  We could find ourselves in the very dangerous position of having a commitment at the level of the Communities to an aids policy towards the peripheral regions without an adequate budget to implement it.  Therefore, I would be grateful for an opinion from the Minister, as to what extent he feels realistically the wealthier members of Community will allow such a budget to be developed which would implement aids policies. These two points concerning the Legislative Advice Bureau and the <Col N="261" /> regional policy are the important ones I wished to make.</P>
    <P>I began my speech by saying that I was a member of the minority within the minority who warned this country about the dangers of entry into the European Economic Community. This was the policy of the Labour Party of which I am a member.  Most of my criticisms at that time could be put in very simple language, that is, that where economic events take place without regard to human considerations, then the result is the subjugation of human and labour conditions to the demands of capital.  I was not happy then at the development which was taking place within the Community.  The Labour Party felt that the Community was not moving sufficiently towards democracy to control the unmitigated effects of economic decisions on the lives of people.  People are powerless when economic decisions take precedence over human considerations. It is not to our credit that in the history of Government in this country we have not spelled out the social priorities of economic planning.  Under pressure, in the second economic plan, a few measly paragraphs were thrown in on social development to dress it up.  There has been no clear establishment of the criteria on which economic planning should be based. The lack of a regional policy in this country is a particular example of this.  The Community is in a dangerous position.  I do not see the development of democratic checks on an emerging and growing bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>Reports are to be welcomed, but I join with those in saying that future reports, when we have our procedures for disseminating information, need concern themselves less with facts and more with philosophy and policy. When we were debating whether or not we should enter the Community, the Minister was one of those who travelled the country probably more energetically than anyone else.  He attempted to reply to practically anyone who asked him questions.  I look forward to information on these, I admit, simple points.</P>
    <P>I hope in the future report to take <Col N="262" /> up in more detail a point at which I have only glanced today, that is the relationship of the Communities to the Third World.  Our relationship to the Third World is historically a disgraceful one.  We have not assumed our responsibilities in terms of foreign policy or in foreign aid to the Third World.  It would be even worse if we had joined communities who, in a similar manner, rejected their responsibilities. These are probably matters we can take up when we have the report before us dealing more with policy and philosophy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak at length on this motion.  It is difficult to discuss something as broad as the developments in the European Communities, whether factual or policy-making decisions.  We could talk for weeks on this subject and have accomplished very little at the end.  The subject is so broad that for effective discussion leading to the crystallation of certain policy recommendations or agreed lines of action we have got to narrow down the issues and debate them singly.</P>
      <P>A general purpose debate on this matter is of little value.  We have had a lot of discussion on the report itself. The report, as presented, is largely a factual one.  We have been aware of most of the items contained in the report from reading the papers.  Yet it is necessary that, at stated times, these decisions, even though they are history at that stage, should be brought together and made available so we can have a true record of what has happened in that period.  It provides a factual basis from which to start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard, the production is quite well done.  I cannot see how policy can be mingled with the presentation of facts in this way.  Policy in the context of the EEC is very different from policy in the national context. Policy in the EEC for our Government, just one member of the Community and a very small one, is almost like an Independent in the Seanad having a <Col N="264" /> policy.  In other words, a policy can be made to sound very attractive but that does not bring one any nearer to being able to implement that policy.  To implement it many others must agree with it and go along with it.</P>
    <P>The pitfall that must be avoided here is the Government presenting policy in such a way that it might become a type of party political issue.  In other words, the Government present their policy and say what they intend to do or are seeking in regard to either the social policy or the regional policy.  What they are looking for is based on an assessment of the situation with respect to the other countries, what they are likely to agree on and how we can best attain some of our desirable policy aims in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for an Opposition party to say that they do not agree with it, that we are not looking for enough.  It is like an Independent on Seanad policy who can be much more progressive and more revolutionary than any Government party putting up the policy.  We must begin thinking in a very different way.  Our primary concern, with this debate is how to link the Oireachtas, with the development of playing our part in the European Community, the main objective being to try to do the best we can for this country.  We should be eager and anxious in both Houses of the Oireachtas, especially in Seanad Éireann, to be involved.</P>
    <P>Members of past Senates have felt that the Seanad was not given the opportunity of playing a role.  The Seanad has not, in the past, made a significant enough contribution to the Oireachtas.  It has not been given enough duties.  We have not been putting in enough hours.  I do not mean that hours should be put in just simply making speeches in the Seanad.  Hours, especially in the European context, will be put to far better use by being members of study groups or small committees investigating certain specific aspects of the EEC policy that is bound to affect us at that time.  This is what I mean.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to put in those hours.  That goes more for the Independent <Col N="265" /> Members here than Members of parties in so far as they have very specific commitments to parties. They have a great deal of work to do on behalf of the party, party organisation and general party matters, whereas, we, on the Independent benches have no such work to do. Consequently, it is only right and proper, if we are to be capable of making some contribution in the EEC committees or advisory groups, that we should be given the opportunity to try to give full value to the Community.</P>
    <P>The involvement should be much more clearly thought out.  The Minister has given a very good lead here where he has outlined the Joint Committee that the Government propose to set up.  I feel the Government have gone as far as they could go in satisfying the legitimate demands in both Houses for a proper involvement of the Oireachtas in European Community matters.</P>
    <P>I think we can go much further than this.  In the first stage&mdash;it is almost like the Committee on Statutory Instruments&mdash;we should be largely concerned with the machinery of the EEC.  The directives that are about to come up should be subjected to a quick study, but there is not a continuing study involved here because there is not the time and the number of personnel is not adequate for a continuing study.  A quick study of some directive that is expected to be issued in a couple of months should be made.  The second phase, when that directive comes in, is in regard to the regulations that are likely to be necessary here to implement it.  The third phase is one of just looking at the regulations that are made.</P>
    <P>This is all very necessary but it is not the basis of providing real advisory committee assistance to the Ministers in their work in Europe nor, indeed, is it the machinery for providing the facilities for continuing study because, for one thing, there are too many topics involved in the EEC.  The topics in the EEC are much more than an individual Government have to contend with.  Therefore, <Col N="266" /> having a part-time committee to make an adequate study of these is an impossibility.</P>
    <P>The task will have to be broken down.  The various chapter headings should be taken in this.  Many of them correspond to major sections of policy or major sections of the EEC work, like the social policy and everything it entails.  We have industrial democracy, mergers and so on; we have the regional policy allied to an agricultural policy, which would absorb a committee on its own.  The Committee, as set up, cannot be much more than a type of general purposes committee whose main job is to act as a watchdog on the regulations.</P>
    <P>The Government will want to move much more rapidly in setting up advisory committees to the various departments on the major EEC issues. I am not aware that we have an advisory committee on the common agricultural policy.  I know the Government have not been in office very long but yet I would have thought that it would be something that should be already well under way.  The Department concerned should already have had their plans formulated for those committees when the Government took office and it should be a matter of speeding-up and adjusting those plans.  Our Ministers, in the EEC context, need all the back-up that the country can give them.  That back-up cannot be confined merely to the Civil Service, who have a particular type of approach, which is conditioned by the bureaucratic approach.  I do not say that in any derogatory sense but it has a bureaucratic slant, whereas the main defect in the EEC at present is this ultra-bureaucratic structure that we are all trying to liberalise. Therefore, if our Ministers are to be briefed on this it is essential that the knowledge and expertise, outside of the regular Civil Service Departments, be harnessed into effective advisory committees to provide this balance. They would, of course, all work in harmony in advising the Minister on the issues involved and especially on how the various developments are likely to affect this country, what should be foreseen and guarded <Col N="267" /> against and generally advise on the repercussions here.</P>
    <P>I appeal for at least major advisory committees on social policy, regional policy, on a common agricultural policy, on an environment policy and on an economic and monetary policy. These should now become regular features of our Government advisory structure.  They should be provided with adequate secretariats and other facilities to enable them to function effectively.  In other words, money will have to be spent to make those committees into effective advisory committees.</P>
    <P>A question which concerns us here is how to link these committees to the Oireachtas.  They will be real policy advisory committees and we want their policy to come back and be received here in the Houses of the Oireachtas, especially in the Seanad. That means we should have, either as a subcommittee of the proposed present Committee or as a special committee, a special general EEC policy committee as distinct from what is required in the present Committee, where we are only dealing with policy that is likely to lead to immediate directives.  Ideally, I would envisage a committee of, say, eight or ten people who would receive regular reports and have regular contacts with the various advisory committees as set up by the Minister and that those reports might be debated in the Houses by way of motions.  In that way we might succeed in involving Oireachtas Members in this real European study which is so necessary.  We have to break completely away from the past.  We are living in different circumstances altogether now which call for different measures.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the Committee as proposed.  I hope the Minister will be able to modify it very considerably.  First of all, the proportions of ten to ten&mdash;that is, the Members in Europe and the Members from the Oireachtas in general&mdash;are not good.  I think it will be found that our European Members will not find it <Col N="268" /> easy to attend regularly the sessions of this Committee.  I believe ten Members is too small from both Houses of the Oireachtas for the amount of work involved.</P>
    <P>Then the question of apportioning the ten Members&mdash;seven from the Dáil and three from the Seanad&mdash;is not utilising the special position of the Seanad properly.  In the Seanad we should have more time for this type of work.  We have less demanding commitments by way of regular meetings. It should not be overlooked that of the ten permanent Members in Europe at present only one comes from the Seanad whereas before the recent general election we had three Seanad Members.  That is a ratio of nine to one in favour of the Dáil.  By adding three more Seanad Members will only mean that we will have four Members of the Seanad contributing to this committee of 20.</P>
    <P>The Minister could use more of the help that would be willingly forthcoming from the Seanad and I would suggest that that figure should be adjusted so as to achieve some better proportion between the Seanad contribution and the Dáil contribution.  I would suggest in this case that equal numbers be taken from the Dáil and Seanad which would result in an overall picture of nine Members from the Seanad and 15 or 16 Members from the Dáil.  I make this suggestion because I believe the Committee should contain only people who are in a position to put in an amount of time and are willing to make a real contribution on that basis.  The allocation of three Members to the Seanad, when that is apportioned one to each party, leaves no opportunity for contributions from the Independent benches.  We want to make some contribution because we have time we would be prepared to devote to it.  I would advise the Minister to include as great a number of Seanad Members as he possibly can.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of anxiety at present about who is representing us on the various committees in Europe Most of our representation is drawn almost exclusively from the Civil Service. I know many professional groups <Col N="269" /> are very worried about this state of affairs.  This situation began with the last Government and I hope the present Government will be more conscious of this anxiety.  About two months ago we had a very informative meeting of the Institution of Engineers in Belfield where, in a three-day symposium, they considered the various aspects of the EEC.  A speech submitted from the English Institution outlined their worries and difficulties with regard to the fact that the Civil Service in Britain were trying to arrogate to themselves the right to speak for every group in England in relation to Community affairs.  Consequently, anxiety was expressed by that group that they were not being properly represented in Europe.  This goes back to a fundamental difference in European organisation compared to that of Britain and Ireland.  In European organisation, if they have an educational policy, they want some people from the administration and some from the professions; they want some from the universities or from the teacher organisations.  University professors will arrive on the committee.  Of course they are civil servants, that is the difference.  In Europe, especially in France, that is the regular position.</P>
    <P>What we want to ensure is that there is a balanced viewpoint: one from the Civil Service and the other from the professionals, such as is given here from those who are organised, independent of Government or of Civil Service organisations.  On that occasion we impressed on our visitors from England that we had a new Government and that we felt our new Minister for Foreign Affairs would be more than alive to the necessity to see that this balance was maintained, and I hope that that is being done.  I know that the professional organisations are very concerned at present.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the democratic control of parliament and the building up of the European Parliament, which is a key to the survival of the EEC. The tradition of liberty in Europe is too great to have it try to survive under a Eureaucracy.  It will have to be a humanised and liberalised bureaucracy, in which the European <Col N="270" /> Parliament must appear to function in a parliamentary capacity and must be the body in charge.</P>
    <P>I promised to be brief and I shall resist the temptation to take the various chapter headings with views on social and regional policies.  The only view I am giving on those is the view that it is absolutely necessary for each group to make serious study and to make their views known.  The Ministers attending meetings in Europe to discuss it would want to be briefed from all sides.  I appeal to them to ensure that their advisers are drawn from all available groups within the country.  By that method of approach we can ensure that we will make a positive contribution to European development which will safeguard our position and be in the best interests of our community.  We have a mansize job to get our own country moved from its position at the bottom of the European league.  That is a mansized job for any Government to do and it should be our number one priority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly be very brief.  We should realise that we are discussing what is the first report of its kind and that it is being produced in what might be called an evolving state of the European Economic Community. It is bound to have stresses and strains in the changeover from a Community of six member countries to one of nine member countries.  As previous speakers have pointed out, it is a factual document and is intended to tell us what has happened in the institutions of the Community in the past 14 or 15 months.  I do not think we should be too critical or expect too much from such a document.  Primarily, it is intended to advise us of what is happening and also to project the policies of the various institutions of the Community, and what they hope to achieve, particularly in the light of <Col N="271" /> the Paris Summit Conference last October.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Quinlan that it would be quite wrong to expect the Government of the day to write their policies into such a report.  I find it very difficult to understand how a Government could put such policies into a document such as this, having regard to the fact that so many of the policies of this country and the other member countries will, in any event, be decided at Brussels.  It would be rather inappropriate, to say the least and probably grossly inaccurate and misleading, for any Government to decide in a document such as this what the policy of this country will be.</P>
      <P>We must get used to the idea that we are a member of a nine-member Community.  While we hope to expect to achieve from that any concessions to assist our social and economic policies&mdash;the development of our cultural arm and our industrial arm, the expansion of our social fund and so, a general improvement in our standard of living and the general progress of the country&mdash;we should not go overboard by considering only what we are going to get out of the Community.  Every Senator who has contributed to the debate so far has overemphasised what we hope to get out of it.  Nobody has made any suggestion as to what we might put into the workings of the Community as a member State.  It is important that we should look at it also from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course it is right that we should get all we can in connection with the regional development of this country. It is right that our farmers can look forward to good steady prices in the foreseeable future.  It is right that we should have industrial development and get all the possible help we can from the institutions of the Community to help our industrial development. But we should never forget that we, as a small country with a distinctive nationhood of our own, should be prepared to contribute to the institutions of the Community also.  If we are not prepared to do that there is <Col N="272" /> a danger that we will become just a take-all nation and give nothing.  We would then be absorbed by our larger neighbours and be looked upon as an English-speaking appendage on the west coast of Europe, with nothing to contribute to this Community of nations.</P>
    <P>The men who established the Community in the first instance&mdash;statesmen such as Schuman and de Gasperi &mdash;had far higher ideals.  Their ideal was that the communities of Europe would come together and would jointly contribute to the welfare of the individual member countries.  We should never forget that we are a country with a long and honourable association with the continent of Europe for many centuries.  It should be our desire, perhaps in our own limited way, to make a contribution not only to the industrial and social life of the Community, but also to the cultural and artistic life of the Community. We have much to offer, as a country.  Our history is one that we can be proud of and we should never forget that we are an equal in this Community of nine member countries. As such we must be expected to make a worthwhile contribution to its various institutions.</P>
    <P>After the overwhelming success of the referendum in connection with our entry into the EEC, there has been some falling-away and a sense of anticlimax. We went in the hope of getting regional funds and of getting better prices for farm products, and because we felt there was no life for this island outside the community of nations in any event.  That sort of phase has passed to some extent, the promise has been dimmed and some disillusionment has followed the overwhelming decision of the Irish people to join the Community.  Rightly or wrongly I feel this springs from several causes.  First of all, there are the pragmatic or mundane facts of life&mdash;the huge increase in the price of food and raw materials cannot all be attributed to our membership of EEC; very little of it can; certainly some can. These are some of the reactions that stick in the mind of the man on the street, or the woman in the home who is even more important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> While we can discuss at rather more lofty level the development of the EEC and all it has achieved&mdash;and it has achieved a good deal in a very short time&mdash;and all it hopes to achieve, we must not forget that Mr. and Mrs. Seán Citizen are concerned with much more basic things than the Commission or the Council of Ministers or even, indeed, the European Parliament. They are concerned with the hard facts of life and they tend to relate our membership of the EEC with what they, as individuals or families, get out of it in the way of better living and more happiness for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>I feel there has been disappointment at the failure to make more positive progress towards an effective regional policy.  Steps have been taken and intentions have been promulgated, and in due time these will be put into practice; but as of now perhaps we expected too much too soon.  That is a natural reaction in most people. However, if we did, we are now settling down to the cold realities of the situation and are beginning to realise that all the dreams will not be realised overnight.  That, too, is a perfectly natural reaction.  However, it needs more explaining to the man in the street.</P>
    <P>There is also concern among what I would describe as &ldquo;the smaller fry&rdquo; in both business and agriculture &mdash;the small businessman and the small farmer.  He has a growing concern at the economic pressures that he is being subjected to from larger economic units, units that will become large in any event in the context of the EEC.  While I appreciate that in the EEC countries&mdash;Germany, Italy, France and others&mdash;the small businessman has kept his position, there is a lot more that could be done to help him here to realise that he has a secure future in the context of the EEC and that there are many aids there to help him to survive and prosper in his business or farm, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>There is the feeling that we are caught up in a huge bureaucratic structure.  I do not think anybody would deny that the European <Col N="274" /> Economic Community of necessity has to be a very large bureaucratic machine.  There is also the question of the limitation of national powers to do anything about the non-involvement of national parliaments working in the Community institutions, and the almost complete ignorance&mdash;this is a vital factor&mdash;of the general public about European affairs.</P>
    <P>Several Senators have spoken about the setting up of this Joint Committee. I was very glad to hear the Minister in his introductory speech talking about that as something that will happen in the very near future. I should like to agree with those Senators who suggested an enlargement of the number from 20 to, say, 30.  Our delegate/members of the European Parliament should sit on the Committee as of right; but I take the point&mdash;made, I think, by Senator Ryan&mdash;that these representatives, if they are to do their job properly, if they are to attend the meetings of the European Parliament, will be away for at least 100 days out of 300 working days in the year, possibly fewer, and they may not always be available.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we should have ample and adequate representation from both Houses of the Oireachtas on this Joint Committee.  The number mentioned, 30, is not unreasonable in that regard.  I also take Senator Quinlan's point that there should certainly be a far greater representation from this House.  This House has a good deal to contribute in matters of this kind.  It is not involved so much in the day to day work of Parliament, it has time to consider Bills and other such documents at greater length and to give more time to doing more homework about them.  This Joint Committee would be an ideal setting for bigger representation by Members of this Chamber.</P>
    <P>The question of direct elections to the European Parliament was mentioned also.  Previously I have spoken in favour of direct elections.  I realise there are certain dangers involved in this.  If European TDs or MPs, or whatever, are to be elected in the <Col N="275" /> same manner as local TDs are elected, is there to be a conflict of interest? Are we to have to evolve some other system?</P>
    <P>A point also made, with which I agree, is whether the work in the European Parliament will become so heavy that our delegates or members of that Parliament will become so involved that they will not have time to do the daily chores which keep a TD in office.  If he does not look after his constituents, he is out at the next election.  He might be a brilliant member of the Parliament in Brussels but unless he continues to look after his constituents he has no future in Irish politics.  That is a fact of life.  Perhaps a man who stands for the European Parliament should not stand for the Dáil.  If that were to happen, how would he be elected?  Would he be elected indirectly and, if so, one goes a step away from the democratic system of election by the one-man-one-vote principle.</P>
    <P>It is an involved question.  It is not easily solved.  It is easy to talk about direct elections&mdash;I have done it myself&mdash;but I appreciate that there are difficulties involved and certainly we will have to tackle them.  It was said that the whole country is one constituency. That would make it a different thing.  But we have ready-made constituencies in the form of regional development bodies.  We have regionalised health and tourism and then we have regional development organisations.  We have these ready-made constituencies which could, on the basis of population, elect one or more European parliamentarians.  I just put it forward as a suggestion.  It may not be practicable, but at least it will ensure that the country as a whole will have adequate and fair representation in the Parliament of Europe.  That would ensure that the Oireachtas would at least be involved in the workings of the European Parliament but it would not ensure, which I think is vital, involvement lower down the political structures.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more involvement by Mr. and Mrs. Seán Citizen. If the European institutions are to <Col N="276" /> work, and do so democratically, and be seen to work, we must find some system of involving the man in the street in it.  How that is to be done I do not know.  Perhaps if he knew more about what was going on, if there was more dialogue at local level, local authority level, county council level, city council level, and in other institutions, it might make him less restless about the future of the country in this larger body of nations.  It would certainly ensure the support of these people if we could ensure their participation.  I do not think one could be hoped for without the other.</P>
    <P>It is important that this country gains full value from its membership of the EEC in respect of many aspects which were already mentioned in this House&mdash;regional development, particularly in the west and south west. I have seen some rather disturbing statistics and illustrations of our poverty-stricken island.  They make very sad reading and it is suggested, I think&mdash;the Minister may correct me when he is replying&mdash;that the whole island virtually becomes a development area and would qualify for assistance from EEC funds.  I do not know if that is correct.  Originally the idea was that perhaps only the west and north west and other areas of high unemployment and emigration would qualify for assistance.  Now apparently we are talking about the whole country qualifying for financial assistance from the EEC institutions. If that were to happen in a blanket form would it not merely ensure that the present situation continues, that is, the east coast would continue to be the most prosperous and the flight from the west would continue, all things being equal.  If we are to have the whole country qualifying as a development area, within that development there should be some differential to ensure that the areas in the west, north-west and south-west would get preferential treatment over Dublin and the east coast in general. I do not know if this is possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the schools participating to a greater extent in spreading knowledge of Europe and all it entails with more emphasis on <Col N="277" /> continental languages, more interchange of students between this country and the Continent, more European history taught, more travel. We must immerse ourselves in Europe in order to draw from the European funds, and I do not speak only of financial funds because there are other funds in Europe such as history, culture, art, which are immeasurably important.  If we are to be enriched by them and in our turn to enrich them it is just as important in the long term as getting handouts from any European institution, however important that may be.  I do not wish for one moment to minimise the importance of that.  We should endeavour&mdash;from schools at local level up to the parliamentary level&mdash; to be both Irish and European.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a brief speech and to emphasise some of the points which have already been made in regard to our attitudes to the Community. Senator Michael Higgins in an excellent speech hit home some important points.  We may not give enough credit nowadays to those people who opposed the EEC vote in the referendum.  I feel somewhat guilty that, in taking up a position that was so pro-EEC in order to sell what I thought was an important idea in order to get a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote, I, along with many other advocates of entry to the Common Market, tended to slur over the difficult points and the disadvantages to this country.  Now it is time to have a clear look at these disadvantages and to face up to the critical situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We already have had great benefits from our membership of the Community. There is no doubt that, sooner rather than later, we must face up to some of the disadvantages.  We ought to be clear in our minds as to what our position will be in dealing with the Community and in changing the attitude to membership of the people in this country.  That attitude has been a rather supine and negative one and I should like to see a more positive, vigorous and direct approach to the Community by the majority of Irish people.  It is the case of us rocking <Col N="278" /> the Community boat or it will rock us.  If we do not take a vigorous, direct and political approach to our membership of the Community, we will suffer.</P>
    <P>This means having a detailed knowledge of Community legislation, having a detailed pre-knowledge of directives coming from the Community, of what is taking place within the Community, and the most important point of this debate is the plea which has been made by so many Members of this House to increase the size of the joint parliamentary Committee which the Government intend to set up to oversee European legislation at all stages. In concert with many other speakers I should like to see the number of members increased.  There are ten of our European representatives who are automatically on the Committee.  They cannot be here a great deal.  At the moment the proposal is that the total number of members of the Committee be 20, and I should like to see that increased to at least 25, or perhaps more.  One should look at this committee from the point of view of having ten members who will be away a great deal of the time and will contribute very little.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Michael Higgins when he talked about making this more than just a joint parliamentary Committee but giving it the back-up and the research facilities which will be needed and the secretarial facilities which will be needed to make it into a Committee which can get to the critical points which affect Ireland's membership before these decisions have been finally taken in Brussels or in the European Parliament. It is essential that the membership of the Committee be increased.  I should like to make a special plea that not only should there be more than three Members of this House but that it should include those Members who sit as Independents, who are members of no political party and whose leverage is small on that account but whose will to serve is high.</P>
    <P>The point has been mentioned that in the selection of representatives to the European Parliament the Independents <Col N="279" /> were not consulted.  It is not a case of their having any leverage&mdash;if there was a straight vote they probably would not get a representative&mdash;but the situation is that we are here to serve the community, we are elected to serve the community by our constituents. We have among our members certain expertise and we are probably freer to do this type of work than any of the Members of the parties.</P>
    <P>We could, therefore, do a great deal of the detailed and difficult work which will face this Government in the very near future on European legislation.  I would make a special plea, therefore, to have adequate representation from the Independent benches on this Committee and on any other European committees which will be set up.  We can and wish to contribute.  We are well aware of the difficulties that politicians with large constituencies face.  We are in a rather better position, so I hope the Minister will take this into account when he reports to the Government on the feeling in this House on the Committee which is about to be set up.</P>
    <P>I should like to touch on some particular points which have been raised in this report and some particular chapters.  Firstly, I should like to state that it is important to get our foreign policy straightened out and I welcome a clear statement such as the Minister made in the Foreign Affairs debate in the Dáil.  I welcome the clear and concise way in which he set out what he saw and what the Government saw to be our main aims in foreign policy.  I also welcome the vigorous way in which he approached the problem of Ireland's membership of the EEC.  I should like to quote two of his remarks in Volume 265, column 762.  He said, referring to our membership:</P>
    <P>This means that we must enlarge our horizons and be prepared to take the lead where in the past we have been content to modestly follow.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of approach we need. If we are to obtain full value, in the truest sense of the term, from the <Col N="280" /> European Economic Community, that needs a vigorous, positive approach.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another remark which the Minister made in the same column in this debate.  He said:</P>
    <P>In the 1920s this small country made the major contribution to the evolution of the Commonwealth from a group of self-governing units of the British Empire into full sovereign states.  This past achievement should inspire us in our work within the Community.  This Government will be guided by this inspiration.</P>
    <P>We could go a lot further in this direction. I hope that this positive approach will characterise the Government's dealing with the Community and also the manner in which they deal with the problems which membership of the Community raises at home.</P>
    <P>There are many points which we will soon be faced with and on which we must take a strong stand.  One of them is in connection with the common agricultural policy, which is under great pressure from the United States on the outside and from Britain on the inside.  This is one of the very important areas where our representatives must stand firm.  The policy may alter but basically it must remain the same. If we are to benefit fully and if our farming community, who have not until now received due reward for their labour, are to receive the benefits to which we know they are entitled, then we must stand firm on the basic principles of the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>There are other issues which are important and on which we must take a firm stand.  One is the problem of our energy resources inside the European Economic Community.  For example, we will soon face the problem of drafting some legislation which will cover the seabed off the Irish coast. There is a world meeting on this subject arranged for Santiago next year. In this situation, it is much to our benefit to tackle the problem from a world point of view rather than from a narrow EEC point of view, because the EEC countries have relatively little sea coast.  We will find that the European <Col N="281" /> sea coast will be sliced up between the big countries which will put the screw on us.  Essentially, they will wish to take as much as they can get of our coast, which is one of our most valuable assets.  On a world basis, we will have the support of very many countries who are maritime nations, who have large areas of sea coast and who wish to preserve them.  They do not intend to give away their seabed resources to the big, developed, inland countries.  This is one area in which it is essential to treat this problem on a world basis and not just let the EEC countries dominate our thinking.</P>
    <P>On the problem of the external relations of the Community, it is essential that we inject our traditions into the Community policy and emphasise our commitment to the Third World.  There is a very slim paragraph&mdash;4.(14)&mdash;on relations with developing countries.  The report before us is quite inadequate in dealing with the relations of the Community with developing countries.  It gives the impression that very little has been done by the Community for the Third World.  Perhaps this is a wrong impression but it it certainly the one which I get from this report.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the present Government are worried about this problem and that the Minister has taken some positive steps in outlining our foreign policy and, in particular, our relations with the Third World. I will quote from paragraph 742 of Volume 265 of the Official Report of the Dáil in which he stresses as a basic objective of Irish foreign policy</P>
    <P>to contribute to the Third World in a manner and to an extent that will meet our obligations, satisfy the desire of Irish people to play a constructive role in this sphere, and add to our moral authority in seeking to influence constructively the policies of other developed countries towards the Third World.</P>
    <P>That is a most important statement of a basic aim in our foreign policy. If that is one of the five basic aims which the Minister spelled out in his Dáil speech, then it is a pity that the relations with developing countries <Col N="282" /> got such small space in this report. This is one of the areas where it is important that Ireland play a very positive role and insist that the developing world be treated as a priority by the EEC.  As Senator Quinlan has said on more than one occasion, I feel it is essential that the EEC should become an outward-looking body and not just a self-centred, inward-looking group of highly developed countries.  If the latter situation should come about, then it will be on our own head when the final upheaval comes which will overthrow the EEC and all it stands for.  The EEC will have that end coming to it and the only way we can overcome it happening is by developing an outward-looking approach.</P>
    <P>I have seen very little real evidence of this so far but Ireland's job is to press strongly for this outward-looking approach and to insist that the EEC develop a strong, vigorous and generous policy to the underdeveloped world.  It is very easy to develop a policy that on one hand appears to be generous in terms of aid, grants and so on.  If you analyse the policy economically it can be as self-centred as one likes.  This has happened all over the imperialist world and all through imperial history. We must change that policy and make sure through our experience that the EEC's policy of Third World development is a genuine and absolute one.  The commitment must not be reneged.</P>
    <P>I welcome the evidence the the present Government and the Minister are concerned with this problem. Senator Yeats, yesterday spoke rather disparagingly about the Minister for Labour's speech to the International Labour Organisation in Geneva.  I would commend that speech.  I felt the sentiments which the Minister expressed are ones which we could well carry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>There is no restriction through our membership of the Community when it comes to giving aid.  Although we do not have much money to give we have much in the way of personnel. We have experience in relation to projects like the Shannon industrial <Col N="283" /> complex and the Shannon Duty Free Airport which we can share with the Third World.  Because we are not in a position to take them over or are not in a position to squeeze them financially, this can be seen as absolute and genuine aid.  I have no doubt that there are many people in this country who still have the true missionary spirit.  They do not necessarily belong to any particular organisation but they are keen to see that this country's traditional involvement with the developing world is maintained.  In this way we can inject a real spirit of service into the thinking of the Community.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the Minister has announced in the very recent past that he is going to set up a voluntary overseas service agency which will facilitate Irish people in doing this work.  I was involved with a group of individuals who undertook some discussion on this problem and sent in a memorandum to the Minister about 18 months ago.  The only thing that disappointed me is that it took so long to come to fruition.  I am delighted to see this agency is being set up.  This is evidence of our commitment and desire to make use of the missionary spirit in the truest sense of the word.  I have no doubt such missionary spirit exists in this country.  One of the things we have got to do, through our negotiators in Europe and through our representatives in the European Parliament and various other bodies, is to see that this spirit is put forward and incorporated in the Community.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to some of the other points in the report. I am glad to see that the Community are taking the problem of the environment seriously and indulging in some deep and important research projects to measure the extent of the damage to the environment by our highly-industrialised society.  I should like to ride one particular hobbyhorse of my own which is, in fact, mentioned in chapter 17 of the report.  It concerns the effect of various modes of transport on the environment.  In chapter 17, paragraph 14, which concerns <Col N="284" /> the Community proposals regarding transport on the roads, we read:</P>
    <P>The solution to the problem involved in the current proposals must take account of transport economics and road costs.</P>
    <P>I feel this should be formalised and I should like to see our representatives urging the Community to do some real deep and professional research on the problem of costs of various modes of transport.  They will find when the true costings are done that the private car and road transport turn out to be socially the most costly type of transport. This is leaving out items like the &ldquo;Concorde&rdquo; aircraft and these big projects.  This is talking about normal modes of travel.  One of the things we will have to do, in coming to terms with pollution and solving that problem, is to take a firm grip on the private car and on our road transport system.  We will find that the other modes of transport, such as rail, are far more efficient and of far higher social benefit.  I should like to see this problem being sorted out by a real and thorough investigation of costings of various modes of transport. The McKinsey report made a start at doing this, but if we really analysed full costings of road transport versus the other types of transport we would at last begin to realise that, sooner or later, if we want to preserve any reasonable way of life we have got to come to grips with the private car.</P>
    <P>I hope that our representatives in Europe will find that they can inject some of our spirit and traditions into the thinking of the Community and that we can set up a Committee here which will back them up in their work and which will have enough secretarial and research bases to really put some thrust into our membership of the Community.  I feel that the Minister will take this into account when he reports to the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to make one or two comments in relation to that section of the report dealing with the social fund.  I note, with <Col N="285" /> pleasure, that already application has been made for the round figure of £3½ million to be channelled into the development of re-training and resettlement facilities.  In our changing industrial pattern and scene this, of course, is of vital consequence to the interests and welfare of very many hundreds of workers who are already in industries that have, or will, suffer tragically from the impact of the giants of Europe competing against us.</P>
      <P>We also have a large pool of agricultural workers who will be endeavouring to move into the industrial scene.  There is no place today for the unskilled labourer.  Every person seeking employment in any form of industry will require some prerequisite in skill or training.  Here lies the importance and essence of the utilisation of this volume of money as readily and as speedily as possible. Because of the age factor and other factors, many of our workers who will be seeking the benefits of this are in the older age group, and difficulties could well arise because, without early training and facilities for resettlement, they would permanently go on social welfare, which would be most undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second brief reference I should like to make is that I have some information that from the resources of the social fund our Minister and Commissioner may be able to extract moneys in respect of the development of services for the handicapped.  This is of vital concern to our people.  We fall very far behind the other EEC countries in the services and training facilities that are available for the handicapped.  Because of the lack of such training and facilities many such people are still condemned to remain in institutions or among the unemployed. It would be a tremendous asset if the Minister could assure us that all the resources he has at his command to make the case that can be made in respect of this section of our community will be made.  In the absence of training schemes and facilities at the present time the care of such people and their development mainly rests with voluntary organisations whose <Col N="286" /> resources, in money, facilities such as sheltered workshops, skilled personnel and training are entirely inadequate to meet the demands of this human problem.</P>
    <P>I am glad to learn that the Government will shortly be bringing in legislation governing the employment of the handicapped.  I would envisage that, in keeping with European standards, it will be made mandatory on employers to carry a proportion of handicapped people.  Although that is a desirable development, it will not be the end of the problem.  It is unreasonable to ask industry to carry handicapped people unless we set ourselves the job of equipping these handicapped people in the best possible manner to fit into industry.</P>
    <P>I conclude by asking the Minister, and the Minister for Health and the Minister for Labour, who should be in co-operation with him, as I am sure they are, to ensure that Ireland's case in respect of allocations from the social fund will benefit our handicapped by helping the national voluntary organisations who have carried this problem, heretofore, and allow for the setting up of training workshops with facilities and personnel to do justice to our handicapped.  I will mention just one section with which I am conversant: the psychiatric field.  At the moment we have six people out of every 1,000 in the population in psychiatric institutions. The European comparison would be less than two per thousand. That, in itself, demonstrates the massive proportions of the problem.  This money could be used to generate more activity, more enthusiasm, and to help the voluntary organisations that have been doing such an excellent job with too limited facilities in this field of rehabilitation.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to cover all the wide range included in this first report on developments in the European Communities.  Some slight criticisms of the documents have been voiced.  As the Minister said in his speech, this document covers a period of 16 months.  In normal circumstances, subsequent exports will be covering a period of six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> Senators and many of the people in the country have become a little impatient at the seemingly slow rate of progress made in different spheres in regard to social and economic policies within the Communities.  This is something which we must become used to because, by their very nature, we must have here an amalgam of different communities, different nations with different backgrounds.  The only progress we can expect with such an amalgam is progress by evolution, rather than to any agreed plan.  I am not saying that member states and representatives on committees have no say in coming to a decision or arriving at some conclusions. The organic growth of policy can be influenced by the effectiveness of our representation on these bodies. They can be directed in a particular direction provided the time has been spent in committees and in preparatory work for them.  There is one aspect, however, which has been mentioned today, over which we do have control. I refer to regional policy.  Senator O'Higgins read the relevant section in chapter 15.5 (a) which says that:</P>
    <P>Community regional policy cannot be a substitute for national regional policy.</P>
    <P>He pointed out that this was put there on the assumption that the Community countries have national regional policies. The point already made is that we have not a regional policy in this country and for that reason we have to start now to define clearly what we mean when we talk about regional policies.</P>
    <P>There are vast disparities, for example, between different areas within the Communities.  There are vast disparities within different areas of our own country&mdash;in the east and west, for example.  I come from the West of Ireland and the grant-aided system through agencies like the IDA for the 12 western counties, where there are special incentives over the past number of years, have failed simply because the Government gave the IDA no teeth to direct development into the areas which needed it most.  In my opinion, a regional policy must have some authority <Col N="288" /> to direct development into the areas most in need of development.</P>
    <P>The IDA, even though they have done a job with the limitations within which they work, have still failed to come to grips with the actual problems in the West.  I think they have failed. The Government have failed, particularly the last Government for the past 16 years, because their proposals have been purely economic.  We all know the problems of the West. Viewed only as economic problems, they defy solution.  Here we are dealing with what is basically a social problem. We are dealing with people, with their standards of living, with their environment&mdash;and God knows it is a harsh environment from the point of view of farming.  In my own county, for example,&mdash;and this should give us an idea of the failure in the past&mdash;since 1966, according to the figures presented in the census, we have lost 5,000 people.  This is a damning indictment of the last Government's approach to regional policy, even though it was said at the time that there was an effort being made towards a regional policy.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the different granting agencies like FEOGA, the Regional Development Fund and the Social Fund is that the only way we can derive full benefit from them is by presenting a very definitive policy towards regional development and in so doing we will be able to get those grants and apply them in the area in which they are most needed.  What is needed at the moment therefore is some agency or Department of regional development. One of the great difficulties we have at the moment is this.  We have regions for industrial development covered by the IDA; we have regions under Bord Fáilte; we have regions under the health boards.  They are all different regions.  They are all following along their own lines.  We have no co-ordinating body to see to it that all aspects of life in these areas are being catered for.  A Department concerned with the regional policy would be a co-ordinating agency taking care of all the different aspects of life in the different regions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> I see one danger in having the whole country designated as an undeveloped area.  The danger is that, human nature being what it is, there might be an upsurge in development but that upsurge would take place mostly in the places most beneficial to the people involved, which would be the East coast, near the Community and the services.  This would be to the detriment of the areas in the country in the most need of development.</P>
    <P>I notice in chapter 16.2 concerning the European Social Fund the following:</P>
    <P>The Fund was established for the purpose of facilitating and promoting the geographical and occupational mobility of workers and thereby contributing to improving their employment opportunities and raising their standards of living.</P>
    <P>The area that I come from has had plenty of mobility in the past.  We have had workers going to the far ends of the earth seeking employment. The Government should take a hard look at this idea of bringing work to where the workers are rather than bringing workers to where the work is available.  It is incumbent on us to find out the difficulties of these areas.</P>
    <P>One further point I wish to make is that in the past the people of those areas have not been consulted.  They are the people who are living with the problem and they are the people who know some of the solutions, but they have not been consulted in the past.  I am not seeking autonomous bodies on a regional basis that would run their own business.  Obviously, there must be some constraint on budgeting, and so on, from a central authority; but bodies ought to be set up in regions which would have a say in directing policy to the specific needs of their particular regions.  In the context of the EEC and of making sure that full benefits accrue to us from it, it is essential that we have such bodies spread over the whole country.  They would act in an advisory capacity, and could be given executive powers with, of course, control for budgetary purposes from a central authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> I would strongly appeal to the Minister to consider the idea of setting up a Department concerned with regional policy, with co-ordinating all the agencies which at present are overlapping in many regions and which are leading to inefficiency in many areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few issues involved in the presentation of this document and the treatment of it by the Dáil and the Seanad which I would like to think about.  There appears to me to be one very important one of the principle of democracy to which two people referred&mdash;the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy O'Brien, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy FitzGerald&mdash; in terms which, I think, must be questioned. I make no secret of the fact that I am totally opposed to the whole idea of the Common Market.  I have opposed it as far back as I can remember, right into the fifties, the sixties, and now I am still opposing the idea of a central European cartel replacing the old imperialist powers and designed in order to exploit the poorer countries within the cartel for their own ends.  I have no doubts but that is the basic underlying purpose of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell referred to the high traditions of Europe and what we should bring to it.  The high traditions of Europe: if you look at any of them, France just recently tortured its way out of Algeria; Germany, most of Africa; Belgium, the Congo; Holland, Dutch East Indies; Britain&mdash; we know her record.  If you were to scour the world for a more scabrous crowd of highway robbers than the Central European countries it would be hard to find them.  Anybody who comes here with high ideals looking forward to the great day of uniting with Europe, then collecting what is there for us in it, is bound to be disillusioned. I can pay a tribute to Senator Russell that he did say that, in spite of the overwhelming returns from the EEC referendum, there is now a sense of anti climax, the bright promise is dimmed and there is a sense of disillusionment about the Common Market.  I think that is what <Col N="291" /> is beginning to percolate out here to the periphery.</P>
    <P>I have been in these places for a fairly long time and one of the things I find most difficult to accept is the massive acceptance by the Dáil and Seanad of this extraordinary rejection by a very distinguished, wonderful and historic nation of its effective independence. Senator Russell again, perfectly honourably, put it in a nutshell when he said so many of the policies would be decided in Brussels. One goes back to many of the people that I have seen in these Houses who in their time made enormous sacrifices on both sides for what they said was the establishment of freedom and independence here.  We have been sated and saturated with it in our schools and in our history books over the years.  That this generation, which did so much to establish a free and independent society, should now so unquestioningly accept this agreement to deprive itself of its rights of independence and sovereignty and hand them over to Brussels&mdash;to these countries in the centre of Europe who know little or nothing about Ireland and Ireland's needs&mdash;I find impossible to understand; how arguments put forward could have so poleaxed all the declared aspirations of the successive generations of fine people on both sides in Ireland and make them accept this loss of sovereignty, loss of nationality and loss of power by accepting the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The main dynamic for this has been the need for a wealthy minority here to preserve their wealth.  They are likely to do so within a community with like-minded attitudes and ideologies in Europe.  The democratic principle that I am concerned with arises from the statement by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, when he was acting for the Minister here, that there has been much talk of abandonment of democracy and so on.  I think I was the main person to contribute on that line.  A democratic decision was taken in this matter by the people in May of last year.  It was not the decision that my party hoped to get.  We pointed out at the time, at column 50 <Col N="292" /> of the Seanad Official Report of 1st June, that we believed entry would involve a diminution of the powers of our National Parliament and that in certain cases we would be required to rubber stamp various measures passed in Brussels.  He then puts it to us that the debate is now over and nothing further need be said and nothing further should be said.</P>
    <P>First of all, these three or four throw-away sentences about what we said does very little justice to a speech made by a Deputy which, in my view, in all the listening that I have done in the Dáil and, to a lesser extent in the Seanad&mdash;and I have read a lot of the speeches of my predecessors as well as those I heard during my own time &mdash;was the finest speech that I have ever listened to.  It was a most compelling, well-argued, and cogent speech and, in so far as it has not been answered, was not answered, will stand in time as probably one of the finest that has ever been made, and that was the speech made by Deputy Justin Keating, now Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I think the dismissal of Deputy Keating's wonderfully argued case against entry in these three or four sentences is hardly the kind of loyalty that one colleague should give to another.  I will not weary the House with a long statement, but the motion in his name deplored the inadequacy of the negotiations described in the White Paper and rejected the terms set out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating made many statements including this one at column 1967, Volume 259, of the Official Report for 21st March, 1972:</P>
    <P>My view is that Fine Gael are participating in something that is foolhardy and reckless.</P>
    <P>At column 1968 he said:</P>
    <P>... we will not alone be abolishing the chance of ever growing to nationhood, which we have not yet done, but, in regard to community, population and tradition, we will be abolishing a good deal of Ireland. As somebody said recently, it will be the last action we will ever take as something almost a nation if we vote ourselves in.  Fine Gael will <Col N="293" /> have to bear a very heavy responsibility for that.</P>
    <P>His whole wonderful speech is starred with well-substantiated conclusions of this kind.  He said that our farmers were buying a pig-in-a-poke and were being misled.  I think Deputy Russell echoed that, as he talked about the farmers.  But I could support those statements with statements from Deputy Corish.  I could support them with Statements from Deputy O'Brien himself.  Probably the most memorable statement to me, because of Deputy O'Brien's special knowledge of it, was the statement that we would become part of a neo-colonialist establishment, exploiting the Third World.</P>
    <P>I do not need to go on to establish that point.  It is quite easily done.  Anybody who chooses to read the record will find it there.  The most thoroughgoing, damning indictment of these proposals was made by some members of the present Government.  The most interesting point is that the person who presented this speech here today, who is in charge of this document, Deputy FitzGerald, Minister for Foreign Affairs, continually heckled and barracked Deputy Keating throughout that speech.  But he did not answer his arguments.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of situation in which we face what all Senators recognise as an extremely trying, testing, dangerous time for our community.  Deputy FitzGerald, the Minister, took this point, which I consider to be an odd point, that following the favourable decision in this referendum, the Labour Party had accepted the decision, as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Dr. Cruise-O'Brien says, and we should now go ahead and go in.  He is quoted as saying at column 1850, Volume 265, of the Official Report for 23rd May, 1973 that they acepted the decision of the Irish people and:</P>
    <P>They saw that the future for Ireland, once we were within the Community about which we had had some doubts, would be best served by the fullest participation.  This is in immense contrast to the British Labour Party whose attitude is reflecting no <Col N="294" /> credit on them and doing no good to Britain.</P>
    <P>I think that is a particularly arrogant and insolent reflection on the British Labour movement.  It also is a complete misreading, it seems to me at any rate, of the idea of democracy or the principle of democracy&mdash;whether we must end the debate now or whether we must go on with the debate or whether the debate may go on.  When I talked on the Common Market debate, and I am sure when all the other people talked on it, I was not taking part in an L and H Saturday night discussion, or in the &ldquo;Hist.&rdquo;, taking whichever side on which there happens to be no spare speakers, to debate for or against. I was convinced of the arguments I put forward and am still convinced of the arguments I put forward.  I still believe it to be a very dangerous organisation. Everything that we have seen in the short time since membership continues to establish, in my view, the validity of the points made by Deputy Keating. For instance, on the question of prices, because of this system of Government, there can be no significant price control system, because we are in the EEC and because of their attitude to free competition, free enterprise.</P>
    <P>At column 2408, Vol. 259 of the Official Report for 23rd March, 1972, Deputy FitzGerald said:</P>
    <P>To my simple-minded calculations, in respect of one-fifth of the goods we buy the removal of protection will reduce prices by 10 per cent and that knocks 2 per cent off the cost of living.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of hokum that the unfortunate people accepted as gospel. Of course, within a matter of weeks they know to their cost that the prices of food, particularly the prices of essential goods, were continuing to soar, and that there was no known way for permanently controlling prices in the EEC context.  Again at column 2408 he said in respect of the effect on the cost of living:</P>
    <P>Three and a half to 4 per cent has been suggested.  I think that is too high and I have gone into these figures very carefully.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing he took care over <Col N="295" /> them or God knows what he would have said.  The annual rate since has been in the region of 11 to 12 per cent, and I do not believe it will be controlled by the manipulation of VAT, the transfer of prices across to clothes and so on.  We shall still pay, and the shopkeepers are making certain we will pay by the artificial increases at the moment.  Even if temporary price control is introduced, it will be merely a face-saver in order to allow trade union leadership to negotiate another wage agreement. The lid will come off again and the worker will find himself chasing too few goods with too little money.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the principal point here, I could give you many precedents for decisions taken by the people which had not been accepted by the Deputy FitzGeralds or the Deputy O'Briens.  I could take any general election in which the decision has been made to return Fianna Fáil and all their policy.  To their credit it did not silence the Opposition.  They fought and fought until they got back again and reversed policies they did not like.  Mr. de Valera did not like the result of the constitutional referendum to establish the Free State Constitution.  When he got around to it he came in to the Oireachtas and worked himself into a position to reverse the decision of that referendum and brought in his own Constitution.</P>
    <P>There was nothing wrong about that, perfectly correct, but it is still wrong for these people to tell us: &ldquo;Hush, it is all now settled.  There is no more.&rdquo;  This is a very interesting debate.  I saw one very patronising, paternalistic reference by Deputy Fitzgerald: &ldquo;it was great fun having it.&rdquo;  I remember once when it was not great fun having it and Deputy Fitzgerald went for me at the time when I was opposing the Common Market and because I opposed it I was a communist at that time.  &ldquo;We had a great student debate which is all over now.&rdquo;  It would be very wrong if the Seanad were to accept that attitude. I was glad that Senators West and Russell both attempted to disabuse them of this fact that they have now <Col N="296" /> got <i>carte blanche</i> and they can carry on regardless.  I could remind Deputy O'Brien of his own attitude to another Constitutional provision which was accepted.</P>

I am not charging him with that at all, but I am charging his colleagues, Deputy O'Brien and Deputy Keating with that.  But it is the reality that he has to face, that the British Labour Party are not going to let this issue die. What happens then?

      <P>Everybody knows that the greatest failure in our society has been the fact that to a considerable extent the generation who negotiated this treaty had little room for manoeuvre, for the simple reason that we are tied like a can to a dog's tail as a result of this silly policy of successive Governments over 50 years.  There is very little the British do that we will not have to do. It is precisely the same position now. If the British Labour Party were returned it is quite conceivable that they could negotiate again and we would be faced with a completely different set of propositions.</P>
      <P>What happens then?  Do we get Deputy O'Brien and Deputy FitzGerald coming back with a new set of proposals, a new referendum to amend, to give them the power to implement these proposals?  What are the arguments then?  Why did they change their minds or their principles: &ldquo;These are my principles.  If you don't like them I'll change them.&rdquo;  It looks rather like that.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that if the British Labour Party goes in again we will have to go into serious negotiations again and if they opt to get out, which they could do in certain circumstances, then we get out too.  We are not in for ever and the debate must go on and should go on.</P>
      <P>It is quite wrong on the part of Deputy O'Brien to try to get the rest of us to condone his <i>volte face</i> on this particular issue for his own ends whatever they may be&mdash;office I would assume.</P>

      <P>I do not think saying that successive Governments over the last 50 years have tied us like a tin can to a dog's tail could be said to be praise.  If it is you are easily flattered. The case is there.  It is as real now as it was then.  Every day is proving it to be so.  The tragedy is that certain members of the Government have simply not had the courage of their convictions.  I find it difficult to understand how, with this very powerful, deep-seated conflict of beliefs, without a major betrayal on one side or the other, serious conflict will not inevitably eventuate.</P>
      <P>Surely one of the most dismal comments of all was again made by Senator Russell that the whole country is now qualifying for outdoor assistance, as it used be called.  We are now a development area&mdash;what an extraordinary admission.  This has been 50 years of Government in which we have adhered so rigidly to the iniquitous private enterprise capitalist system and suffered so much in consequence.  I presume, because of the predominance of the Fine Gael Party in the Coalition, that this kind of suffering must go on &mdash;unemployment 7 to 8 per cent. emigration, defective social services, education services, <i>et cetera</i>, which we have known since the State was formed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder would the Minister tell us about a matter which interests me a lot, namely, the ideal they have for the ultimate united Europe.  What do they intend doing on the question of <Col N="299" /> defence commitments?  This is a question of enormous importance to us all and I am concerned with it because it goes back many years.  I have always felt that there might ultimately be an attempt to justify a link with the NATO alliance.</P>
    <P>As far back as I can remember there has been this attempt.  One of the people involved was the present Attorney General, with whom I was involved in debate nearly 20 years ago, in which he was advocating membership of NATO.  Later on, Seán Lemass, the Taoiseach at the time, and Mr. Moran, Minister for Justice at the time, also flew this kite&mdash;the need for us to fight for Christ in Europe and so on by joining NATO.  Mr. Hillery, the then Minister for External Affairs, went along and offered our services to NATO.  Of all the crass idiocies perpetrated by any statesman in any community, this was probably the most outstanding.  As Deputy Conor O'Brien told him at the time, &ldquo;Whatever you might think, certainly that was a foolish thing to do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder could we find out what it is now proposed to do? There is obviously a very big bloc of support for the idea of a defence commitment.  The Minister has only referred to it in very vague terms in passing that it would be reasonable to defend any Community of which we are a member and yet very serious attempts are made by all Ministers to play down the possibility that we might be involved in any kind of defence commitments.  I would be glad if the Minister would deal with that matter.  The only people I know who are unequivocably opposed to it are the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, and Deputy Keating.  I wonder what is the present position on this issue?  Is that opposition to be shelved for the cause of bringing about European unity in a military sense?</P>
    <P>There is this statement in the document that the best way of achieving progress in the matter of political unity within the context of an enlarged mandate given to the Foreign Minister is to study.  What does the Minister <Col N="300" /> believe is the implication of the achievement of ultimate political unity should that happen?  On the question of mineral development what are the prospects of the Government uniting the two one-time disparate ideological beliefs within the Cabinet: the good radical socialist attitudes of Deputy Keating and other comrades associated with him, and the extremely conservative free enterprise capitalist attitudes of, say, the Taoiseach, Deputy Donegan and others such as him?</P>
    <P>We know well that we are in the extraordinary position of finding ourselves to be one of the wealthiest countries in the world because of the remarkable mineral finds, but up to the present, so far as the public are concerned, the nation has been raped of these riches, something on the lines of the Union Miniére of the Congo, of the British at their worst imperialist phase in Africa, India and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The public are not getting the money which is there.  The enormous wealth which is there is estimated at something in the region of £2¼ thousand million I understand and because of agreements arrived at by the preceding Government, the amount available then has virtually left the country. Certainly it did not become diffused in social, educational or other cultural benefits for the people as a whole. There is this enormous residual wealth still.  What agreements will be made in relation to royalties to these people who are presently coming in, some of them directly from outside, Canada and elsewhere, acting for enormously powerful wealthy foreign companies or disreputable Irishmen acting in their name in many cases, acquiring shares so that eventually they will be able to pillage this great wealth belonging to our people.  What arrangements will be made about the raw materials?  How will the two conflicting interests within the Coalition Government solve this problem?  Is there any likelihood that a small country like ours could be given the needed assistance from the European Community to enter into, on behalf of the Community, the exploration and development facilities, technological, physical, chemical, needed to exploit these wonderful riches of which I hear.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> So long as I can remember I have been told, when proposing anything for education, health, social services or anything else, that we are only a poor country.  The poor mouth answer was always given.  That is no longer true, as long as these raw materials are developed for the people as a whole.  Equally, we are now entering, as another Senator mentioned, oil development.  Here again, there is enormous opportunity for great wealth being made available for our people, for the services which we all want for our people.  Britain, as we know, has misused her opportunities. Norway, on the other hand, appears to be particularly tough in its bargaining in regard to the development of these resources.  For the granting of prospecting licences, they were insisting on the toughest possible deal for those who happen to find oil, going up as high as 95 per cent of royalties, as happened off the west coast of America&mdash;95 per cent going to the Government and 5 per cent going to the exploiters.</P>
    <P>I believe that we should not accept this as a closed argument.  It would well repay the Minister, Deputy FitzGerald, if he would re-read, as I said earlier on, a magnificent speech made by the then Deputy Keating.  If he is honest with himself he will, with what is now very special knowledge, begin to see that his remarkable efforts to publicise the virtues and the unlimited <i>el dorado</i> aspects of the EEC for the Irish people were grossly exaggerated and completely misguided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister is coming in at 4.15 p.m. so I will say what I had intended, stringing along over a fairly lengthy speech, in the period left.</P>
      <P>Now that we are in the Common Market it is up to every citizen to make the most of the opportunities which are presented.  Senator Browne has pointed out many of the disadvantages. There will be the standardisation of personality and education. People in the long-term, over the centuries, can never be the same again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> I am glad that the debate today has risen above narrow political interests. I welcome the Minister's suggestion for the Joint Committee.  This is most important.  Recently I was a representative on a public service delegation to Brussels.  To use a paradox, the most we found out there was that we found out very little.  We asked very searching questions of the people representing the information section of the Social and Economic Committee. We found the answers most vague.  They gave us very little information.</P>
    <P>We pointed out that we were in an awkward situation in Ireland in so far as our membership was only from 1st January last.  When we pointed this out and that we had to rubber-stamp 22 regulations, on which we had no debate in the two Houses, the answer was, &ldquo;Well, when you try to get on a moving train there is always the danger of coming down between the train and the platform.&rdquo;  That is the sort of situation in which we find ourselves today.  Fortunately, this can be corrected by the Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect, and I must conclude with it, of the report to which I should like to refer and it is the one in which I am most interested. It is paragraph 16.28 of chapter 16.  It is headed &ldquo;Co-operation in the Sphere of Education&rdquo; and reads:</P>
    <P>There has been a working party considering the question of general policy and the means of its implementation in relation to a proposal to set up a European Centre for the Development of Education (the so-called Guichard Plan).  Ireland has been represented on this working party.  Its report has been forwarded to the Council.</P>
    <P>No teachers' organisation was consulted in the slightest way with regard to the activities of this committee. We think this is deplorable.  All the discussion apparently took place between civil servants in Europe and civil servants from Ireland.  Teachers should be represented and certainly the managerial parties who are, in the last analysis, responsible for the <Col N="303" /> fundamental philosophies of education and control the schools.  If we are to be moved into a common pattern of education in Europe, we must put on record that there are philosophies of education which are entirely repugnant to the Irish people.  These we will not readily accept.</P>
    <P>The point I should like to make for the Minister is that further discussions on education will take place because the other day Dr. Dahrendorf, who is the Commissioner for Research, Science and Education for the Commission of the European Communities, submitted a document, one sentence of which states:</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers should meet, therefore, at the latest in Autumn 1973, to decide upon the realisation of co-operation in the field of education within a common frame.</P>
    <P>As a spokesman for a teachers' organisation I can say that we will be very disturbed if we are not consulted about this type of frame.  There are frames of education into which we will not be moved.  We have our own national philosophy of education and we are not prepared to be moved into a situation which would be totally repugnant to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, listening to Senator Browne, it would be an understatement to say that he had veered somewhat off the terms of the motion before us.  I should like to refer briefly to some of his remarks before I speak on the motion.  He spoke of the bright promise held out before the referendum last May being replaced now by a sense of disillusionment.  From the tone of the debate here last night and today I would say that far from there being any sense of disillusionment there has rather been a sense of the challenge and opportunity confronting us in Europe.  It was most enlightening to hear those two points raised time and time again.</P>
      <P>As regards the report put before us by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I should like, first of all, to congratulate him on the speed with which this report was formulated within two months of his taking office.  I extend my congratulations also to the officials of his Department.  The problem confronting us is largely one of indifference on the part of the public not only in this country but throughout Europe as regards accepting the principle of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here again it is the age-old problem of communication.  Communication in business or otherwise is always a two-way method.  It must be both upwards and downwards.  I would leave it to the European Parliament itself&mdash;I am glad to see that they are taking steps in this <Col N="305" /> direction&mdash;to give themselves more teeth, to make themselves more attractive and to find and touch public opinion.</P>
    <P>Communication upwards is largely left in the hands of the Government of each individual state to take whatever means they can to acquaint the public, first of all, of the implications of membership of the EEC and with the favourable and unfavourable points of such membership.  The EEC is not a bonanza for anybody.  It is not a form of authoritarian membership.  It is largely finding a consensus amongst the member countries.  The Government should pay special attention in trying to touch this public opinion and making people interested.  There is no point in seeking direct elections to Europe unless pressure for such direct elections comes from the public.</P>
    <P>The problem confronting the Government is to turn a negative attitude, which is really one of indifference on the part of the public, into a positive attitude.  I was glad to hear the Minister's statement last night that the Joint Committee would be a help in this regard.  The more means of communication we have with the public the better.  It is largely a question of the difference which has been evidenced in a number of decisions and recommendations of the European Parliament.  A certain amount of diffidence with regard to political and economic co-operation, a certain vagueness as regards its final terms of reference and as regards final implementation of political co-operation appears in this report.</P>
    <P>On the question of environment, whether by coincidence or not, the chapter dealing with this matter consists of a sole page.  It is good to see, from the Minister's report last night, that the EEC countries are giving a certain amount of funds towards research projects.  We in Ireland have a lot to gain from the experience and omissions of the member countries in this regard.  It is only in recent years that it has been accepted that the earth and the land on which we stand is a finite resource and that pollution operates across land, sea and air and knows no frontiers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> In the broad context, while talking about economic, social, industrial and regional funds and the benefits to be gained therefrom, it is impossible to discuss these matters without talking about the political implications involved. As we cannot deal at any great length with social, regional or industrial matters we are dealing with the political implications of these matters.  Here again the certain amount of diffidence which has crept into the EEC and the European Parliament in regard to ultimate political co-operation is something which contains a danger for the EEC itself. Its very inactivity in regard to political co-operation can only lead to inactivity and a certain amount of frustration and lack of confidence in the EEC itself achieving its aims under the headings I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise just one other point and that is that yesterday evening the Leader of the Opposition made certain disparaging comments about the Minister for Foreign Affairs in regard to his global strategy. The phrase used was that he was tackling shadows rather than substance and making certain posturings. It is fortunate now that we in this country no longer regard ourselves as being of no interest or of not being interested in what goes on outside our confines.  We are now a member of the EEC and as such we must also begin to realise what lies outside the Community.  It is, therefore, most gratifying to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his speech on the budget making quite commendable recommendations in regard to looking around the wide world that exists outside the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I promise the Minister this will be the shortest minute on record.  First, I should like to say how nice it is to see him back in this House, which he graced with such distinction, in the capacity of a Government Minister. I should like to join with Senator Markey in protesting against the inequitable distribution of time allowed to speak.  I was in the precincts of this House from the beginning to the end of this debate and I now find I am <Col N="307" /> allowed to speak for one minute.  Three Senators had to squeeze their contributions into 15 minutes.  I think the Whips will have to make arrangements for a more equitable distribution of time.</P>
      <P>I have just two very brief points to make.  The Government are to be commended on their commitment to direct elections to the European Parliament and the Taoiseach is to be congratulated on his recent statement to that effect.  Perhaps the Minister could explore, with the Governments of Holland and Italy, some type of joint action in order to speed up this process which has now been ground down into the dust for almost 14 years.  Perhaps the new Labour Government in Holland would be a willing ally to any such move and the socialist party now about to take up Government in Italy would be a willing ally.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party would support the pleas made here to enlarge the Committee, which the Minister announced this morning, in order to ensure adequate representation from the Seanad, particularly from the Independent Members.  We would hope that the Committee would comprise between 16 to 20 Members and would in the words of Senator Higgins, also have adequate research facilities appended to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to do justice to a very interesting and wide-ranging debate by replying as nearly as possible to all the points made.  Time will be a problem for me as it was for the Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I have to make is that I regret very much that for various reasons the debate terminated so quickly.  I feel I am personally responsible for that because I did request that it should terminate at 5 p.m. owing to other problems with which I have to deal.  One thing is clear and that is the need for more debates on this subject. We have not exhausted the potentiality; we have scraped the surface.  Certainly for my part you will find me willing to come to this House to debate these problems when the House wishes, subject <Col N="308" /> to my being in the country at all, which sometimes I am not for various reasons.  That is without prejudice to what I may say later about the Committee and general comments on the whole question of the Dáil and how Ministers might report on what is happening.</P>
    <P>I will take very quickly the individual points Senators have made and I will go through those first of all, chapter by chapter, and then come to more general issues.  I will start with chapter 4 as nothing was said with regard to chapters 1 to 3 other than certain references to the summit which we can take up when we come to deal with the particular chapters.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats felt we should have explained in the report that the relationship with Greece was frozen. That is fair comment in view of the fact that such is the case and it is a very significant fact.  That should have appeared in the report and I accept that criticism.  He suggested that the EEC should have been more generous to EFTA.  I am not clear what he meant by that.  The various EFTA countries have been the object of negotiations by the Community.  I think they have come to satisfactory conclusions. I have not heard complaints from them and I am not sure we should complain if they are reasonably happy.</P>
    <P>He was critical of the Minister for Labour's recent speech at the ILO in Geneva.  I believe I dealt with that at the time.  There was some misunderstanding as to whether the Minister for Labour was referring to trade or aid.  Clearly he was referring to aid.</P>
    <P>The particular language he used might not be that which Senator Yeats would use himself.  It seemed rather ironical that the slightly poetic language of the Minister for Labour should be criticised by Senator Yeats. I would stand behind what the Minister for Labour said and it is our concern to ensure that the whole system of relationship between the Community and developing countries will be one which will eliminate remaining elements of neo-colonialism or attitudes <Col N="309" /> deriving from the colonial period.  The Minister for Labour was quite right to stress that.</P>
    <P>Senator West was critical of the size of the report.  I may have an inadequate note here, on the subject. Senator Robinson commented that it should not be any bigger and then proceeded to add to it so much that everything in it would need to be removed to make room for what she wanted to add.  There is a problem as to how big the report should be.  That problem will be resolved as the six-monthly reports will be much smaller. There will be more room then to fit in more material.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson suggested that the whole section in chapter 4 should have started with the reference to the relationship between the US and the Community, which is the dominant feature in the minds of the people in the Community at the present time. That would have been fair comment if the report had been written at a much later time than the date in question, but this matter had only been raised and had not come before the Community.  The first reference to it was on the 15th May, which was the date on which the report was prepared, the date up to which it runs.  It is only since then that this matter has been discussed in the Council of Ministers in any detail.  It is anomalous that it should not loom larger in the report but it is partly an accident of timing I think.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan raised the question whether the common commercial policy applied only to eastern Europe. No, it applies widely.  The reason why there is a reference to eastern Europe in chapter 4 is because the extension of the common commercial policy to eastern Europe occurred within the period of the report.  It applied to other countries before that in 1969 and the reference here relates to the particular decisions which extended to eastern Europe.  Incidentally, agreements for co-coperation with eastern European countries are still outside the framework of the common commercial policy.  It is trade agreements that are within it, but that, of course, may change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> On chapter 5, Senator Yeats pressed for the need for customs simplification and I am in agreement with him although I was warned against being too optimistic about the disappearance of the customs.  That would entail absolute ironing out of differences in expenditure and taxes. There are many strong arguments for that being a difficult thing to achieve and not necessarily desirable.  I think that social and cultural differences between countries in the Community which, please God, will remain, and I know they will, are such as to make an absolute harmonisation of taxation inappropriate.  One only has to think of the question of the level of taxation on alcohol to see the relevance of that.  As long as members' taxes are at different levels customs will remain. By the nature of things customs are always complicated no matter how much one tries to simplify the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised questions about the degree of consultation that has taken place under paragraphs 6.7 and 6.14 and wanted to know who had represented us.  In regard to 6.14 the consultations are taking place in a committee established by the Minister for Education.  They sat on 20th May and 20th June.  Those represented on them are the presidents of UCC, UCD, UCG, the registrar of TCD, the Professor of Education in Maynooth, Dr. Petty of the Limerick Institute, the chairman of the ATA. the assistant director of the National Council of Education Awards and the Irish Vocational Education Association.</P>
    <P>In regard to 6.7, I was represented on the working party by the assistant secretary in the Department of Education and a principal officer from the Department of Health.  I shall come back again to the question of consultation; I am giving the factual position now.  I am not suggesting that it is entirely satisfactory.  Without wishing to be unduly political I think the previous Government did have a somewhat more restricted concept of consultation than we would have and it will take time to adjust to that.  The pressure is on staff who, in many technical areas are extremely short, <Col N="311" /> make it difficult to undertake additional consultation with interests outside the public service.  That is the general problem we have but we are very conscious of the need to have much more realistic consultation and we are working on that.</P>
    <P>On chapter 7 there was a remarkable conflict between Senators Lenihan and Yeats leading for the Opposition. Senator Lenihan called on us to develop an alternative policy to the common agricultural policy.  He said we should not allow our stance on the common agricultural policy to impede a study of alternatives.  Senator Yeats said that we should stand fast to the whole concept and must not budge an inch.  I leave them to sort it out between them as to which is the Opposition policy but as far as we are concerned we regard the common agricultural policy as of vital importance. We regard it of vital importance and not purely for selfish reasons, although we very properly have regard to our national interests here.  I read an article in the last few days criticising and ostracising me in particular for protecting this country's national interest.  I make no apology for that.  The Community will be built by each country protecting its vital national interest and seeking within the limits that it imposes to develop a genuine Community which can eventually become a political union.  The two are not incompatible and, indeed, if any country fails to seek to protect their national interest an imbalance would arise which could be destructive of the Community.</P>
    <P>In any event, the common agricultural policy is much more important than simply a question of protecting our national interest.  The common agricultural policy is the one really working common policy of the Community. It is the one thing that binds it together.  It binds it together in a way which stimulates a further development of the Community because in order to protect the common price policy it is logically necessary to move towards a monetary union.  And the monetary union logically requires a political union.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> Therefore, the common agricultural policy is the starting point of an inevitable process moving towards a political union.  Because we believe that it is in that direction that we should move, even if we have not got a vital interest in the common agricultural policy, we will be concerned that it should remain as a lever and moving many forces in that direction.</P>
    <P>I will not go into that for the present but I want to stress that it is not simply a question of self interest.  Of course, there are negotiations that are about to take place.  Provision will have to be made in some way for agricultural products but that must be done not only within the framework of the principles of the common agricultural policy but the mechanisms of that policy must be preserved.  We have had the experience &mdash;not alone during many centuries of British rule but, more disturbingly, during 50 years of political independence&mdash;of being, in effect, though not, no doubt, with intention, exploited by Britain by means of the British cheap food policy.  We, above all the countries of Europe, are sensitive to any suggestion that we should depart from the concept of the same price being paid for farmers throughout the Community.  That is basic to the whole concept of the Community and is vital to our national interest and after the experience we have had we do not propose to go back to the situation at any time where different prices will be paid to our farmers and to farmers elsewhere.</P>
    <P>On structural policy, Senator Yeats raised the point about hill farms. There is some confusion here but to be fair, on reflection, the relevant paragraph in the report, 7.5 is inadequate It is drafted in a way that does not disclose fully all the complex elements involved here and it is understandable that Senator Yeats should, therefore, have been misled by it.</P>
    <P>There are three different ways in which the policies in relation to poor farming areas operate.  This is not clear from paragraph 7.5.  There is the category of land where the ground is sloping.  There is another category of generally poor farming areas additional to the sloping ground areas and then, <Col N="313" /> in addition to that&mdash;this is where the 2½ per cent comes in&mdash;outside these areas of poor land a further 2½ per cent of land can be specially designated where, although it is in an area of good land, the particular subsection of land is in a different situation on the coastline, perhaps, in a tourist area where it is necessary to take special action.</P>
    <P>There are three elements here.  It is only as an additional element that you have this 2½ per cent thrown in on top of two other categories which are not, in fact, limited in quantity.  Frankly, nobody reading chapter 7.5 could have known that and we should have displayed the position more fully there.  I apologies to the House for the inadequacies of that particular paragraph.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan referred to weaknesses in presenting our case for certain grants.  Although he spoke in the context of regional policy, he may have had in mind or have been led to this comment by remarks in the press some time ago relating to applications for grants from FEOGA under the agricultural policy.  The position here is that they advertised the possibility of grants in several Press releases.  They have received several applications and the cases are being prepared, analysed and set out in detailed form in consultation with the people applying.  Some have already been submitted to FEOGA and the deadline for application is the end of this month.  I am glad Senators have given me an opportunity to advertise that fact once again.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan criticised us for not having presented them in time.  The deadline has not yet been reached and anything that has been submitted to the Department and is at all appropriate to this purpose will, of course, be submitted.  We are dependent here on people's willingness to take up an opportunity to which their attention has been drawn.  So far as I am aware, the presentation of the claims is adequate.  However, in view of the point the Senator raised I will look into the question of whether there is any defect in this regard.</P>
    <P>On chapter 8, state Aid, the question was raised about the examination of state aid.  This has been completed <Col N="314" /> at official level but we shall not know the final result before the end of the year.  Nothing was raised on chapter 9. On chapter 10, Senator Yeats asked if there was a Government decision on the fifth directive, the one relating to participation by workers in all companies with more than 500 employees. This matter is one that has not yet reached a point of decision.  Divergent views were expressed on this point. Senator Harte remarked that the ICTU had been studying this since 1957 and that much work had been done and he suggested that it should be left to Congress. He referred to intellectuals bamboozling workers.  I am not quite sure what he had in mind.  I hope nothing that I have ever done would fall into that category.  I am sure the noun &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; was not meant to apply to me anyway.</P>
    <P>I recognise that trade unions have a vital role to play here but I think we have to face the fact that in this respect the trade unions who are representing such a large part of our population, although they are the most representative group in the country, nonetheless have in this respect an interest like others.  There could be divergent views on this question of industrial democracy, and while the trade union views must be given very great weight they could not be the determining factor in our policy or the Community policy should other considerations make it seem desirable to move ahead with industrial democracy in some form.</P>
    <P>Generally, this Government favour the principle of industrial democracy but would hope to work out with the trade unions an agreed way in which it could be introduced.  We are glad that the EEC itself has taken up this matter and is proposing a measure of industrial democracy in this particular form, such as participation on supervisory boards in companies with more than 500 employees.  This is something which we welcome but the way in which this would be worked out would have to be done in consultation with the trade unions.</P>
    <P>On chapter 11, Senator Robinson made reference to the enforcement of maintenance payments and felt more should be said about that.  She raised <Col N="315" /> the question of what consultation there had been on this point.  There has been certain informal contact with members of the judiciary.  There have been no formal consultations with the Incorporated Law Society or the Bar Council.  The proposals on the convention and on the explanatory report are public documents and are available to those bodies and they could take the matter up if they wished to do so.  This is one of the many areas of consultation where there may still be some reflections at this stage but these we are seeking to resolve.</P>
    <P>Under chapter 12, Senator West said he was glad the EEC was taking the environment seriously, but Senator Markey pointed out, very relevantly, that it was the shortest chapter in the report, which reflected the possibility that the EEC may be taking the matter seriously but has taken it so seriously recently that so little has been done there is not much to say about it.  Of course, that is true of governments generally throughout the world.  This problem is one to which we have only become alert in recent years.  The Community is no better than the rest of us in this respect and a lot remains to be done. It is a matter with which the Community is concerned, with which we are concerned and which, of course, is a matter that goes beyond the Community itself.  Pollution can go from Germany to Sweden, from the Community to another country, and no doubt vice versa if the winds are right.  It is something to be looked at in a wider context and is something which the Council of Europe are looking at also.  We have to be sure we avoid duplication of effort in this area.</P>
    <P>On chapter 14, Senator Yeats raised the question of why the public sector only seemed to be involved in schemes for the European Investment Bank. The position is that there were three applications so far.  Two of these have not yet been announced&mdash;I think they are infrastructural in character within the public sector&mdash;and the other one is backed by Comhluch Siúicre Éireann <Col N="316" /> for £2.8 million to finance a factory modernisation programme.  I understand this is the first loan given by the European Investment Bank in a new member country.  It is not the business of the Department of Finance to process claims to the European Investment Bank for the private sector.  This is a matter for the applicants themselves. However, the Department are aware that some firms are negotiating with the European Investment Bank and, of course, the Department will give information on this subject to firms concerned, through the CII or directly, and do everything they can to help.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the possibility of getting money from this source to improve our telephone service.  It sounds a very good suggestion, if I may make a proper comment on the administration of another Minister, and one which I shall pass on to him. What is good for Sardinia in this respect could, of course, be good for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Senator Lenihan to the previous Government having applied for money for the Dublin-Galway road and there was a suggestion that an 80 per cent grant would be available for this purpose.  I think there is some confusion here. There was no such application by the previous Government.  While I take it as a good suggestion for this Government to look at&mdash;the question of an 80 per cent grant&mdash;I think there may be some confusion as to the size of the grant.  No such figure is known of.  In any event, the European Investment Bank lends money; it does not grant it.  The only near figure to that is the 75 per cent figure for grants from FEOGA for certain agricultural purposes. I am afraid I cannot place the 80 per cent figure.  If Senator Lenihan &mdash;or perhaps it was Senator Yeats who raised that point&mdash;has any further information on that I shall be glad to have it.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats, in raising the question of VAT, suggested that the harmonisation of rates is perhaps nearer than we think and was obviously desirable.  For the reasons I have mentioned earlier I am not convinced that harmonisation of expenditure tax <Col N="317" /> rates, whether VAT or any other, is necessarily desirable.  Because of the many difficulties involved I am not sure that is nearer than we think.  It may be further away than we think but that is a matter of opinion.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats also asked if there were four rates of VAT anywhere else.  There are in Belgium and France and there are five in Italy.  There is no question of our being unique in this respect.  Other countries also see the wisdom of a number of different rates for goods of varying degrees of necessity to the consumer.  Our policy here is in line with that of a number of other members of the Community. The Opposition could also find examples of other EEC countries which go for less rates and have, perhaps, less regard for the social interests.  There are both categories in the Community.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats also raised the question of cheaper letters to the EEC countries.  I saw recently a suggestion that this proposal had fallen by the wayside as far as the three applicant countries are concerned and I cannot promise on that at this stage.  As a private individual it seemed to me to be a good idea but there may be some technical reasons of which I am not aware.  I will take the matter up with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>A lot was said on chapter 15 and rightly so.  Senator Lenihan stressed the importance of having projects ready.  He named a date, 1st October, as the date on which the proposals are to come forward to be adopted by the Council.  Of course, projects should be ready as soon as possible, but the date for submitting them could perhaps be later.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan referred to the importance of maintaining our existing inducements&mdash;the tax-free base.  We are very conscious of that and it will of course be the policy of this Government. He also placed emphasis on the north and north-west of the country&mdash;the centre of regional policy. Here we are in agreement.  There is the whole question of something to be done about geography there: the region of northern Ireland is something <Col N="318" /> which is actively engaging the Government's attention.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats pointed out that the peripheral areas have not yet been announced and he wondered if they had been agreed.  Consultation on this matter has not yet taken place; it has been a bit delayed.  He suggested that it had been unfortunate for us that a large part of Britain was so classified.  This could have some implications with regard to the proportion of the total sum available to us, and the Government of course are aware of that.  He stressed that we should not agree on an aggregate sum.  It is vital that the sum provided for the purpose of regional policy should be such that, from our point of view, our share of it would be big enough to make some impact.  We must remember that we have a public capital programme of £300 million, so the fund must be such that our share of it should be something that should add substantially to that, if it is going to make any impact here.  I entirely agree with Senator Yeats on that point.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised by Senators Robinson and Higgins about the lack of any definition of regions.  Another Senator raised questions on this as well.  Senator Robinson raised the question of different kinds of regions and the question of cultural regions being perhaps not fully taken account of by the Community.  There could be some truth in this.  It may not be a problem for us but it may well be. Because of the role of national governments in defining regions, and because some national governments are less concerned about particular cultural minorities than others, there could be some difficulties there.  However, I do not think it creates a great problem for us.</P>
    <P>Several Senators made the point that we have not got a regional policy and that, therefore, we could be in some difficulties in seeking the benefit of pursuing a regional policy. The Government are well aware that although this matter has been under discussion since 1962, when it was raised by the Commission on Regional <Col N="319" /> Organisation, no regional policy was ever fully worked out or implemented by the previous Government.  It is a matter of concern and a matter for priority but it will take a little time, starting from scratch&mdash;or somewhere not very far from scratch&mdash;to do the work which was not done previously. It is something that will have to be tackled if we are to get full benefit from the Community's regional policy.</P>
    <P>The other point that was made by Senator O'Toole&mdash;and I think also by Senators Higgins and Robinson&mdash;is the lack of representative structures in our system.  Even if you designate regions, it does not follow that the people in those regions have any sense of involvement in the development of their regions or would be able to get themselves involved in the Community regional policy.  The Government are also conscious of this and the whole question of adequate devolution of responsibility is something which is exercising us in this as in many other fields.</P>
    <P>On chapter 16, Senator Brosnahan suggested that in relation to the matter dealt with in paragraph 16.28 teachers have not been consulted.  I shall look into that matter.  Senator Brosnahan spoke at the end of the debate and I had no time to check on this and I cannot comment beyond saying that I shall look into it.</P>
    <P>The question was raised as to who represented us on the European University Institute&mdash;paragraph 16.29. On the preparatory committee for the European University Institute we were represented by the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Education and by Professor Masterson, representing the Higher Education Authority.  The Institute has been discussed in a committee established by the Minister for Education on the equivalence of degrees and diplomas.  Posts in the Institute have been advertised in the Press and brought specially to the attention of educational interests.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the post of President of the Institute has not yet been filled.  I do no want to go into any details about <Col N="320" /> persons.  I should only say that the Government approach to this matter is that we shall support the candidate who seems best academically qualified, most likely to earn the success of the Institute and will not be influenced by political considerations or horse trading with other countries in that matter. It is something which I took up at an early stage, when I became Minister, but it has not been settled yet.</P>
    <P>Many matters come under the heading of chapter 16.  In this connection Senator Harte stressed&mdash;I think it was in relation to this chapter&mdash;that under our social system the underprivileged are liable to lose out.  He made the point that the unions can and do look after their own, but there are many people not represented by unions&mdash;the weaker groups in the community&mdash;and that there is a problem here which we have to look at.  I am very conscious indeed of this.  It is the primary purpose of this Government to look after these groups.  We are aware of the many problems involved.</P>
    <P>At the OECD meeting a fortnight ago I raised the important technical problem that arises because of the difficulty in transferring income. When the tax system is arranged as it is at present, any increase in taxation is resisted not merely by the rich &mdash;who are less numerous and therefore politically less important&mdash;but also by the workers who resist an increase in income tax.  The workers also, in relation to an increase in expenditure tax, are naturally tempted to seek an increase in incomes to compensate for the price increase and thereby take the money back from the underprivileged, to whom it has been given in the budget.</P>
    <P>This poses a very serious problem for all the countries of Western Europe.  I raised this at the OECD and suggested that this matter should be examined.  I was glad to find that the OECD officials are already conscious of this and are examining it to see what might be done.  We shall be grateful for their advice on how we can tackle this problem in this country.  I am therefore entirely with Senator Harte on that point.</P>
    <P>Senator Moynihan raised a point <Col N="321" /> here in regard to paragraph 16.2.  He said he was glad that £3½ million worth of projects had been put in for grants and raised the question of money for services for the handicapped. He will be glad to know that the scheme is in course of preparation, through the Department of Labour, seeking assistance from the social fund in respect of the Rehabilitation Institute, which undertakes the rehabilitation of handicapped persons.  I am glad to say that we are seeking assistance from the fund for that purpose.</P>
    <P>On chapter 17, Senator West raised the question of the environment and stressed the need for studies of the effect on the environment of the private car, which he described as inefficient and socially objectionable.  This is a point on which everybody is agreed; but we all either own or aspire to own, cars.  There is a conflict in each of us here.  The ideal environmental situation is one in which each individual owns a car but nobody else does.  There is a problem here which every country faces, we as well as others.  The only thing to be said for this country is that our density of population is only one-seventh that of Britain.  Even if we reach enormous prosperity and everyone owns two cars, the traffic on the roads will still be a lot less bad than it is in neighbouring EEC countries&mdash; unless they all come over here to drive their cars.</P>
    <P>On chapter 18, Senator West raised the question of energy policy and suggested it should be tackled from the world rather than the EEC point of view.  He was speaking of the possibility of resources under the sea.  There are other maritime nations that might support us in seeking to protect our interests here.  I note that point.  We are already preparing ourselves for this conference next year and the Government will be examining what line they should take there and how their relationship with the EEC should interact on their policy in regard to that conference.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most individual points.  I hope I have not skimped too much but time does not permit me to go into detail.  I tried to deal with each individual point that was raised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> I now want to deal with more general criticisms.  On the report itself, there were some congratulations for it, notably from Senator Markey, who spoke of the speed with which it was produced.  Those congratulations are certainly due to the officials concerned. I was astonished at the brief interval that elapsed from the moment I approved of the report, I went over it and suggested many changes in it, and when it appeared a few days later in print.  I did not believe it was possible to deal with all the points I had raised and to get it printed in the time available.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats pointed out that some directives were not listed by number and some not by date.  These are oversights which we shall certainly try to correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an oversight on the European Regulations Act.  The numbers were not on that either.  It was a pity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  We are all oversighting so we shall have to do something about that.  It was raised in the other House also.  A number of Senators raised the point&mdash;indeed it was quite a theme in the debate&mdash;that the report does not deal with policy. This raises a very major issue and I am not going to give a conclusive reply on this today.</P>
      <P>I see great difficulties about introducing policy into the report, and some disadvantages, even from the point of view of Senators, not because I do not think Senators are not entitled to know what the Government's policies are, but because it may not be the best way of informing them.  To have a factual report where everything is hard fact and can be relied on and things are not opinion is a useful kind of document.  Once one gets into the policy area one gets into areas of argument and debate.  It may be better to keep that separate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the report is a six-monthly one, and really Senators should not be willing to wait six months to know what the Government's policy is.  They should be <Col N="323" /> pestering the Government to know what their policies on current issues are.  I am sure they will be and I hope the Government will respond.  It may well be that it may be better to deal with this very natural concern about Government policy through the Committee, or alternatively, through Ministers making statements in the Dáil on aspects of policy where the Government, through the Council of Ministers, are taking up a particular position.</P>
    <P>I have an open mind on this and would be glad to discuss informally, as well as here in the House with Senators, as with Deputies indeed, what may be the best way to tackle this.  I would need more persuasion than I have had that the best way is the inclusion of policy reference throughout the report.  This would very much slow down its production, because you would have to get the agreement of all relevant Government Departments to every reference.  I am not convinced that this is the best way to tackle it.</P>
    <P>Several Senators suggested that we should be more willing to seek outside expertise on various matters.  I think this is something that certainly can be looked at.  It is not always in the Government, nor even in the Public Service, which has an extraordinary amount of wisdom and knowledge.  We must be willing to take assistance from outside.  I am very open on this.  I shall be early endeavouring to ensure that I get assistance and advice from as wide a range of sources as possible.  That is something which we can consider.</P>
    <P>A number of small points were made that the names of Irish appointees should be included in the report.  I will look at that.  The Government have a function only in respect of the very highest grade of appointees; below that they really have not got a significant role in appointment.  Whether it is appropriate in the report to deal with matters which are not a part of the Government's responsibilities, I am not sure.  I am willing to look at that and <Col N="324" /> see that we can give the maximum information possible.</P>
    <P>They are the main points which struck me on the general comments on the report, but there are obviously matters there which I will have to look into further and on which I will have to come back to the House.</P>
    <P>Moving for a moment to foreign policy before coming to the question of the Committee itself, some points are raised on general foreign policy but related to the EEC.  The question was raised of the role of the Foreign Ministers of the Nine meeting separately, and not as Council of Ministers of the EEC.  This is something which the House is naturally concerned about. One has to be careful here&mdash;one is bound to be&mdash;that when the Foreign Ministers of the Nine meet together, they meet together with a view to seeing if they can agree on a common foreign policy.  This is an executive act, just as the Government of this State might meet together and decide what line to take on foreign policy. The Government's deliberations on the matter would not properly be subject to publication.  The decision that is taken is probably the subject for publication in the debate.  In regard to the deliberations of the Foreign Ministers of the Nine in relation to foreign policy, although a certain amount gets out&mdash;and it is thought reasonable a certain amount should get out at the time the meeting takes place&mdash;there are limits on the disclosure of the position and certainly limits on the disclosure of what line other countries have taken. There are some problems here and we can only go a certain distance in meeting the wishes of the House in this respect.</P>
    <P>There was a criticism from Senator Lenihan about shadow and substance and the suggestion that we were posturing and moving into areas far beyond our means.  Senator Lenihan has simply failed&mdash;and his very short term in the Ministry did not give him very much opportunity&mdash;to find out about this.  I am not sure if he even had the opportunity of attending any meeting, and certainly not more than one in the short period.  The fact is that at the <Col N="325" /> meetings of the Foreign Ministers particularly, but also in the Council of Ministers, we are required to state our position on problems anywhere in the world, because this Community is the greatest trading force in the world and has interests everywhere, and we are part of it.</P>
    <P>We have with 1 per cent of the population between 5 and 8 per cent of the decision-making power of this Community.  We simply cannot opt out when we are asked what should we do about Bangladesh or should we recognise North Korea.  We cannot say we do not know or that we have no interest, because there would be no surer way to damn us as a country not playing its part and not to be taken seriously&mdash;a country which could, therefore, be ignored when its own interests come up to be considered.</P>
    <P>If we are concerned to protect our interests we must abandon the provincialism which this country has had for a very long time past and which has been happy to be represented, apparently, by Britain anywhere outside Western Europe.  This country has felt no need to concern itself with any other area of the world, except perhaps Britain and the United States.  This will not wash any longer, and Senator Lenihan's speech in this respect showed echoes of an attitude of mind which I had hoped was dead and I hope I now have, perhaps, finally killed it.  A foreign policy in this country is not too expensive a luxury.  It is something we cannot do without, if our vital interests are to be protected.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson and Senator Browne, whose speech unhappily I I could not hear as I had to answer questions in the Dáil, raised the question of our attitude to NATO.  I thought I had set this out clearly in my foreign policy speech.  That is the position which I adhere to and will continue to adhere to in the relevant international bodies.  Our position is that our fellow-members of the Community are allied to certain countries outside the Community&mdash;some outside Europe; others in Southern Europe; some of them not very democratic countries&mdash;for defence purposes.  They find this necessary, and indeed in the <Col N="326" /> present stage of development of world affairs they are probably right in that. We do not feel that it would be desirable or helpful for us to involve ourselves in that exercise and we do not intend to do so.  Obviously, we accept their freedom to do so.</P>
    <P>If at some stage countries of the Nine, moving towards a European union, and beyond that perhaps to some kind of confederation or federation decide as part of that process to adopt a common defence policy of the Nine separate from other countries and not involving external alliances&mdash;and this is not likely, as I can see, for a very long time to come with the present balance of power in the world &mdash;if that happened we would be prepared to play our part at that stage.  To say otherwise would be to proclaim our dishonesty in respect of the Community; to go beyond that would be to engage ourselves in activities and alliances which the Irish people do not wish us to engage in.  I hope I have made that position clear.  It is extraordinary how much misunderstanding can centre on it, especially sometimes when people want to find things wrong with our policy attitudes.</P>
    <P>Other questions were raised about the Helsinki Conference, Middle East and Bangladesh.  Time does not permit me to deal with them now because I must deal with two other matters&mdash; the European Parliament, and the Committee that we are establishing.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne raised a number of points.  He raised the question that, if Britain re-negotiated, where would we stand.  Would we all stand on our heads?  I am not sure what is meant by Britain re-negotiating.  First of all.  I do not think it is possible for Britain to re-negotiate.  If Britain does renegotiate membership and modifies the terms, she will still be a member.  We will still be a member.  I do not think that is in any way likely.  Perhaps what he meant to ask was: if Britain left the Community what would we do? That is a matter the Government would then consider.  But I would certainly not assume, as he seemed to be assuming, that we must always do what Britain does, and if Britain left it <Col N="327" /> would be in our interest to leave also. I do not assume that that is necessarily the case at all.  However, I do not have time to pursue some of Deputy Browne's hares at the moment, as I must before concluding deal with these two other important matters.</P>
    <P>On the European Parliament, people raise the question of direct elections, and the question of more power for the Parliament.  Which comes first?  I am quite clear in my own mind as to the sequence of events.  We must first get more power for the European Parliament.  It has now so little power that nobody would be bothered voting in a direct election.  Having got more power to the point where people begin to see it as a reality, we must then secure direct elections so that the Parliament will then draw its authority directly from the people of Europe and then demand more power again to the point where it becomes fully democratic. It is only by that sequence, stage by stage, that we shall secure democratic control over the institutions of the Community.  Let me assure this House that it is the settled policy of this Government to pursue that aim.  It is one of our principal diplomatic objectives. Already in the short time I have been in this post I have made contact with other Foreign Ministers with a view to seeing where there are like-minded people pursuing the same aim with, I hope, the same dedication we will show.  Tomorrow I go to Luxembourg to discuss this and other matters with the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg, a country whose attitudes in this issue are very similar to our own.  We will, therefore, pursue this to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>We would hope that substantial increases in power would come to the European Parliament by 1975.  We would hope that that would provide the basis for an argument in favour of direct elections a couple of years after that, and that would, in turn, lead to further power for the European Parliament by 1980 by which time it will have to have democratic control of the institutions of the Community if there is going to be monetary union.  We certainly <Col N="328" /> will not accept a monetary union under which there will be complete interdependence between the countries of the Community, unless there is adequate democratic control and an adequate governmental system under democratic control.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak at greater length on that but time does not permit me.  Perhaps one needs more time to examine the Commission's proposals and to discuss them in the Council of Ministers and to discuss with other Foreign Ministers their position in this matter.  I hope in a short while to be able to speak more fully on the attitude of the Government, and in a more detailed way on their attitude to particular proposals.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I come to the question of the Committee.  I listened with interest to the points made and although we have reached such an advanced stage that decisions have been taken on the form and shape of the Committee and its members&mdash;and I had hoped to get agreement between the Whips to establish it immediately, possibly today or tomorrow&mdash;in deference to the views expressed by the House I am prepared to re-examine the question of the size of the Committee and its membership.  Such an overwhelming view was expressed by so many Senators&mdash;Senator Robinson, Senator Russell, Senator West, Senator Ryan, Senator Quinlan and Senator Halligan&mdash;on the size of the Committee it would be wrong not to re-consider it in the light of these views.  There is force in this argument.  I speak for myself as, clearly, I will have to take the matter to the Government again and, not being present in the House, they may be less easy to persuade than I have been by the excellent arguments put forward.  There is force in the argument that the members of the European Parliament will find it very difficult to attend regularly and, therefore, in effect the Committee's effective membership could be not much more than ten and, therefore, they should be enlarged to cover this point.</P>
    <P>The impression I have from the debate is that while some Senators <Col N="329" /> would go as far as a Committee of 30, others felt that might be a little too large and that something like, say, 26&mdash;the ten European Parliament members and 16 others&mdash;might be appropriate.  I shall look at that again and take the matter back to the Government.  It will mean a delay of a few days in establishing the Committee but it is worthwhile doing it well.  Let us get it right.</P>
    <P>There was general approval for the changes we have agreed to make in amending the European Communities Act.  We, in Opposition, argued that that Act did not give adequate democratic control to the Oireachtas.  It is logical then that we should, in Government, maintain our position and amend that Act as we have now decided to do with a view to introducing this new procedure.  There was some criticism of this, some of which was a little misplaced.  A system under which the Committee has three bites of the cherry, and can have three different stages to examine the evolution of secondary legislation, is a good one.</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised about the powers of the Committee. Senator Robinson, not with very much support, pressed for the power to send for persons and papers.  I am not prepared to concede that at this stage.  I do not exclude it for the future.  The right way to operate in the first instance is for the Committee to have an adequate secretariat.  This it should seek through the Committee of Procedure and Privileges and seek the authority from the Minister for Finance to obtain the necessary money.  I have done all I can in raising and pressing the matter.  It will now be a matter for the Committee.</P>
    <P>That secretariat will have access to Government Departments and it can be sure of the fullest co-operation in getting any information it wants.  The Committee should try out that system first before it seeks to change it.  The Committee will be better with an independent secretariat seeking this information, evaluating it itself and putting it to the Committee critically, rather than finding itself dependent upon the very officials in various Departments <Col N="330" /> whose actions it was seeking to scrutinise and examine critically. An &ldquo;arm's length&rdquo; operation has something to be said for it.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is a practical reason for not conceding this request at this time.  The fact that the foreign service was not expanded in the sixties due to the neglect of the previous Government, and that despite the strenuous efforts of my immediate predecessors to remedy this, the burden of work has increased so rapidly&mdash;with the Northern problem and the EEC&mdash;that the resources of staff are quite inadequate for the present work, especially in the EEC area.  This would make it impossible to concede this without a total disruption of work.  The pressure under which people are working, and the long and continuous hours, and the lack of any break in this work, means that one could not impose any further strain on those concerned at this stage.</P>
    <P>The House must indulge the Government to the extent of permitting us to try to resolve the heritage we have been left with in this respect before we can do anything about it.  The Committee should try this other system of working first.  If in, say, a year's time the Committee having seen how the system works, remains unhappy with it, it can be raised again.  We do not suggest that this is the only possible solution, but it is a way to start working.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised about how and when Ministers might report.  I come back again to the complaints about the lack of policy content in this report.  The Oireachtas is entitled to know how Government policy is evolving and what line the Government are taking at various meetings.  Within the limits imposed by the parliamentary timetable, this wish should be met.  I am authorised to say that Ministers would be happy to appear before the Committee and to discuss matters with the Committee arising directly from secondary legislation.  On the question of Ministers reporting on policy more generally I have an open mind as to how best this could be done.  There may be something to be said for its being done in the House rather than in the Committee, because of the more <Col N="331" /> general interest in policy and that this Committee's primary concern will be as a watch-dog on secondary legislation.</P>
    <P>This will be examined by the Government further, but I can assure the House of the goodwill of the Government towards making available to both Houses of the Oireachtas an adequate account of Government policy, and the line the Government are taking, subject always to the need to safeguard our negotiating position. The House will appreciate there will be times when, in seeking to secure some end in the Council of Ministers it may be unwise to disclose our whole hand in public at a point in time.  The Executive have a particular function here which they must safeguard.  But subject to that, we would wish to take both Houses as full as possible into our confidence, and will devise the appropriate means of doing so.</P>
    <P>Several other points were raised, such as the right to publish without getting authority from the Dáil.  I am just not sure what the powers of committees are in this respect.  I have not even a clear recollection of what the position was at the Committee of Public Accounts, but I will look into it.  There is the possibility of the chairman being paid.  The Committee should start off in the ordinary way, and if it finds the burden on the chairman is so great that this seems appropriate, they will have to take that matter up through the usual channels with the Department of Finance.  The same applies to the right to visit Brussels.  There may be occasions when members should do so and they will have to make a case for themselves.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that when the Committee is established it will be a committee of these Houses.  My function in regard to it will be no different from any other Minister, except to ensure that the information is channelled from other Government Departments to it through the secretariat, because we have a general supervisory role here, although the Committee will deal directly with each Government Department.  Apart from that, I will attend before it as required, but it will not in any sense be my committee; it <Col N="332" /> will be a committee of these Houses. All I am concerned with is to get it established in a form that is most likely to work and to prove satisfactory. I hope we will achieve that.</P>
    <P>These were the main points raised in the Debate and I have managed to terminate my remarks to within one minute of the time allotted to me, at some cost to those who have to transcribe the proceedings.  I hope I have answered all the points raised, and look forward to coming back frequently to this House to discuss the kind of matters we have been talking about yesterday and today.</P>

    <Title>Private Business. - Social Welfare Bill, 1973: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to implement <Col N="333" /> the proposals in the budget for improvements of the social insurance and social assistance schemes.  It also includes provision for the abolition of the remuneration limit of £1,600 for social insurance.</P>
      <P>In drafting the Bill a special effort has been made to make the text of the Bill this year easier to follow than similar Bills in former years.  This together with the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill should help Senators in their examination of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The budget proposals provided for a very substantial increase in the rates of non-contributory old age and blind pensions, for a considerable easement of the means test and for the reduction of the qualifying age for pension from 70 to 69 years.  The maximum weekly personal rate of non-contributory pension is being increased by £1 from £5.15 to £6.15 for those under the age of 80 and from £5.65 to £6.65 for those aged 80 and over.  Because, however, of the changes in the means test whereby the first £4 of weekly means will be ignored, all existing pensioners under the age of 80 whose pensions are at present between £1.90 and £4.90 will qualify for the maximum pension of £6.15, while those aged 80 and over whose pensions are from £2.40 to £5.40 will qualify for the new £6.65 pension.  In addition, increases of pension for qualified children of pensioners are being raised by 50p a week to £1.65 for each of the first two children and to £1.25 for each further child.</P>
      <P>Some 108,000 persons will shortly have the maximum rates of pensions as against some 21,000 at present.  The easier means test will give existing pensioners whose pensions are less than £1.90 considerably higher pensions and will allow some additional 10,000 persons to qualify for pension. The reduction in qualifying age, will also bring several thousand new pensioners into the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-contributory widows and orphans pensions are being similarly improved; the weekly maximum personal rate of pension will be increased by £1 and as in the case of non-contributory <Col N="334" /> old age and blind pensions the first £4 of weekly means will be ignored.  The weekly amounts payable for qualified children, however, are being increased by 65p which include a special increase of 15p in recognition of the problems of such one-parent families.  The new maximum weekly rate of non-contributory pension for a widow will thus be £6.15 with a further £2 for each qualified child.</P>
    <P>Taken in conjunction with the existing amounts of earnings which may be disregarded in assessing a widow's means, the ignoring of the first £4 of weekly income will allow a widow to avail of opportunities to supplement her income by taking up employment without risking the loss of her pension. Thus a widow with no other means and with no children could earn up to £4 a week and still draw a full non-contributory pension of £6.15 a week, while if she had two children she could earn £7 a week without affecting her right to a full pension of £10.15 including increases for children.  A widow with four children could earn up to £10 a week and still be entitled to a full pension of £14.15.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the increases in rates and the changes being made in the means test will enable some 15,600 widow pensioners to receive higher pensions and some 3,000 widows not already receiving pension to qualify for pension.  Reduction of the qualifying age for old age pension to 69 will result in some 1,100 widow pensioners transferring to old age pension thus becoming entitled to free travel and, assuming they meet the other conditions necessary, qualifying for free electricity allowances and for free television licences.</P>
    <P>The new weekly rates and the easing of the means test in the case of non-contributory widows pension will apply also to deserted wife's allowance and to the new allowances for unmarried mothers to which reference will be made later.  The position of deserted wives is also being improved by some amendments which are being made in the statutory regulations covering the scheme.</P>
    <P>The maximum weekly rates of unemployment assistance for persons in <Col N="335" /> urban and rural areas will be raised by £1 in the personal rate and by 50p for an adult dependant and for each child dependant.  This will give a maximum weekly rate of £5.35 for a single person in an urban area and of £5.05 elsewhere; while the rate for a married couple will go up to £9.25 in an urban area and to £8.85 elsewhere.  The payments for children will rise to £1.65 for each of the first two and to £1.25 for each additional child.</P>
    <P>Two major changes in the general scheme of children's allowances are being made in the Bill.  The first is a general increase of £1.50 a month in the amount for each qualified child. This will bring the monthly amounts up to £2 for the first child, £3 for the second and £3.75 for each additional child.  The monthly allowances will then be £8.75 for a three-child family and £16.25 for a five-child family. These new rates will compare favourably with the rates payable in Britain and Northern Ireland where under the general family allowances scheme there is no payment for the first child and the monthly payment for a three-child family is £8.23 and for a five-child family £16.90.</P>
    <P>The number of families who will receive increased allowances is approximately 359,000, involving just over one million qualified children.  The other improvement being made in the children's allowances scheme is the extension of the qualifying age limit for allowances from 16 years to 18 years where the child stays on in full-time education, or is apprenticed or is physically or mentally incapable of self-support. It is estimated that some 85,000 additional children will qualify for allowances under this extension.</P>
    <P>Extensive publicity has been given to the proposal to &ldquo;claw-back&rdquo; the increase in rates of children's allowances by reducing the tax-free child allowances in the income tax code. This will, of course, be dealt with in the Finance Bill.  In so far as the children's allowances scheme is concerned everybody will get the increase in children's allowances and the &ldquo;claw-back&rdquo; will only apply to families where the taxable <Col N="336" /> income is more than £2,500, which in effect means that the actual income will be well in excess of that figure.  It might be mentioned that in Britain and Northern Ireland not only is there a &ldquo;claw-back&rdquo; but the total family allowances themselves are treated as taxable income.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for increases in rates of pensions and short-term benefits under the social insurance system similar to those already mentioned for the non-contributory schemes, that is to say there is the £1 a week increase in the personal rates and 50p for adult dependants and qualified children. In the case of widow's contributory pensions, however, the increase for qualified children is 65p, including the extra 15p provision for children in one-parent families.  In the case of retirement or old age contributory pensions the increase for an adult dependant who is aged 69 or over will be £1 a week.</P>
    <P>The new weekly rates of unemployment and disability benefit will be £6.65 for a single person with an increase of £4.25 for an adult dependant and of £1.85 for each of the first two qualified children and of £1.50 for each further child.  This will give a married couple with two children £14.50 a week, and a couple with four children £17.50 a week.  The personal rate of widow's contributory pension will go up to £6.60, and the amount payable for her qualified children to £2.15 for each child.  Thus a widow with two qualified children will get £10.90 a week as against £8.60 at present and one with four such children will get £15.20 as against £11.60 at present.</P>
    <P>In the case of retirement pensions and contributory old age pensions the personal rates go up to £7.20 a week where the pensioner is under the age of 80, and to £7.70 a week if he has attained that age.  The amount payable for an adult dependant will go up to £4.65 for one who is under the age of 69 and to £5.15 for one who has attained that age.  Thus a married couple both of whom are aged over 69 would get £12.35 by way of weekly pension, or £12.85 if the pensioner is aged over 80.</P>
    <P>The pensionable age under the <Col N="337" /> social insurance system is being reduced to 69 years.  This affects not only the qualifying age for contributory old age pension but also the maximum age up to which social insurance contributions are payable and the short term benefits, such as disability and unemployment benefit can be paid.  The reduction in the age limit at such short notice may give rise to some transitional problems for example, in the matter of transferring current recipients of these benefits to pension.  Steps will be taken to ensure that in such cases payment of benefit will continue until such time as the pension comes into payment.</P>
    <P>Part of the extra cost of the improvements in the social insurance services provided for in this Bill will be borne by the Exchequer and to meet the balance of the cost it will be necessary to increase the rates of social insurance contributions payable by employers and insured persons.  The position up to now has been that employers and insured persons shared the cost of the contribution almost equally.  Under he Bill employers will be required to carry a much larger proportion on this occasion.  This is being done partly to bring the basis of financing the social insurance system more into line with the pattern of the schemes in most other member states of the EEC and partly because of the relief in rates which employers in general will enjoy as a result of the budget proposals for transferring part of the cost of the health services from the rates to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>A total increase of 57p in the rates of contribution which cover all benefits of the social insurance system is necessary and it is proposed in the Bill that the employer should pay 42p of this and the employee 15p.  Lesser in creases apply where all the benefits are not covered.  However, in the case of female agricultural workers and female domestic workers, regulations are being made to remove a restriction on their entitlement to unemployment benefit, following a recommendation of the Commission on the Status of Women.  As a consequence, the special reduced rate social insurance contributions hitherto payable in respect of such employees <Col N="338" /> because of their restricted right to unemployment benefit must be increased more sharply.  Thus, while the employees' element is being increased by only 15p, as in the case of other workers, the employers' shares of these contributions are being increased by 45p and 54p respectively.</P>
    <P>The new ordinary rates of social insurance contribution will be £2.80 for men, of which the employer will pay £1.62 and the employee £1.18. For women the new ordinary rate will be £2.69 of which the employer will pay £1.57 and the employee £1.12. These rates include the element for occupational injuries benefit but do not include the health contribution of 15p.  Neither do they include the present redundancy contributions of 8p for men and 6p for women which are being increased by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>In line with the improvements in the general social insurance system provided for in the Bill, it is proposed also to increase rates of benefits payable under the occupational injuries scheme.  The basic rates of injury benefit and disablement benefit are being increased from £8.10 to £9.10 a week, while the married man's rate will go up from £11.85 to £13.35, and if he has two children from £14.55 to £17.05.  Pensions for widows are being increased by £1 a week to £8.60 with an increase of 65p for each child bringing the new payment for children in this case to £2.15 for each child. It is not proposed however, on this occasion to increase the weekly contribution to the occupational injuries fund from which the cost of occupational injuries benefit is met.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides two other improvements in the occupational injuries scheme.  These relate to unemployability supplement and constant attendance allowance.  In order to qualify for unemployability supplement a disabled person must be permanently incapable of work, but a claimant may be treated as being so incapable if he is unable due to loss of faculty to earn more than £104 a year.  This figure which has not been altered since the scheme commenced will be increased to £234 <Col N="339" /> a year, thus bringing it into line with the corresponding limit in the British industrial injuries scheme.</P>
    <P>Constant attendance allowance is payable to persons in receipt of 100 per cent disablement pension who require such attendance as a result of loss of faculty.  The normal maximum weekly rate of this allowance is being increased from £3.00 to £3.50 to keep pace with the prescribed relative and old age care allowances under the general social insurance and assistance schemes.  No increase has, however, been made since 1967 in the higher allowance limit of £4 a week which was then provided for cases of exceptionally severe disablement and it is proposed to increase this limit now to £7.  This restores the original position whereby the higher limit was double the normal limit.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to abolish the remunration limit of £1,600 for social insurance which applies only in the case of non-manual workers.  This distinction between manual workers and non-manual workers is a survival from the days when the levels of pay and working conditions of &ldquo;white collar&rdquo; workers were greatly superior to those of manual workers. These differences no longer exist to any appreciable extent and, indeed, the question as to what constitutes manual work or non-manual work is now very difficult to answer in many areas because of technological advances and developments in skills, as for example in the field of electronics and computers.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the limit is flexible and does not have regard to marital condition or family size.  There is no similiar limit in the national insurance scheme in Britain or Northern Ireland or, indeed, in any of the member states of the EEC.  Finally, the forthcoming introduction of the pay-related benefit scheme which is based on the principle that the higher a person pays, the higher the benefit payable to him and the contribution payable by him should be, is a further strong reason for removing the limit.</P>
    <P>The proposal to abolish the limit for social insurance purposes should meet with general approval but its removal <Col N="340" /> will have consequences outside the social insurance field.  A person who is insured under the Social Welfare Acts is, <i>ipso facto</i>, eligible for the limited health services available to members of the middle-income group, and any extension of the social insurance system thus has implications for the health services.  These are at present under active consideration and it is hoped to have an early decision in the matter. In the meantime, however, it is necessary to secure the legislative authority to abolish the limit for social insurance purposes.  The provision in the Bill will enable this to be done from a date to be fixed by ministerial order.  The abolition of the limit gives rise to the need to remove from the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966 a provision which debars civil servants covered by that Act from the benefits of the scheme for compensation for death or injuries in the course of their duties which is provided under the Superannuation Act, 1887.  This provision would act unfairly in the altered circumstances brought about by the abolition of the limit.  The Minister for Finance is anxious, therefore, to have it removed and to deal with the question of double entitlement to benefit by the scheme administered by him under the Superannuation Act.</P>
    <P>The deserted wife's allowance scheme introduced in 1970 has been reasonably acceptable and there are at present some 2,150 allowances in payment. Many difficulties have, of course, been encountered, particularly in regard to the question of what constitutes desertion, but the bulk of these have now been resolved and amending regulations are being made to clarify the position in these respects.</P>
    <P>One criticism of the scheme has been that while it purports to treat the deserted wife as if she were a widow, it takes no account of the fact that where the deserting husband has been insured, his wife, would, if he had died, have qualified for contributory widows pension.  The Bill will remedy this by providing a specific benefit in the social insurance system for deserted wives on broadly the same lines as the widows contributory pension scheme, which will be payable subject to contribution conditions which may be <Col N="341" /> satisfied by either the husband's or the wife's insurance as at the date of desertion.  The fact of desertion will be established in the same way as for deserted wife's allowance under the revised regulations.</P>
    <P>There are provisions in the Bill for four developments to meet recommendations made by the Commission on the Status of Women.  The first of these is the introduction of a scheme of social assistance allowances for unmarried mothers who keep their children which will be broadly on the same lines as the scheme of deserted wife's allowance.  This is entering rather unexplored territory is so far as the Department of Social Welfare are concerned and, accordingly, power is being taken to prescribe detailed conditions of the scheme by regulation, which will be used flexibly to ensure that the scheme operates effectively.</P>
    <P>The second development relates to the special condition which requires that in order to be eligible for unemployment assistance, widows and spinsters with no dependants must have paid 52 social insurance contributions at the ordinary rate in the four preceding contribution years.  It is most difficult for a woman whose main occupation is in agriculture or domestic service to satisfy this condition because she pays special rates of contribution in these employments.  The Bill will ease the condition by allowing any paid contribution other than voluntary contribution to be reckoned.</P>
    <P>The third development will relieve widows, deserted wives and unmarried mothers who are receiving pensions or allowances as such under one or other of the Department's schemes of the liability to pay the employed contributor's share of the social insurance contribution when in insurable employment. This concession will be worth up to £1.12 a week to the persons involved and should they become ill or unemployed they will, as widows do at present, be paid the half rate of benefit in addition to their pension or allowance without having paid any contribution.  The employer will, of course, be liable to pay his share of the contribution.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is proposed to remove a <Col N="342" /> further long-standing source of grievance among insured women workers. At present an insured woman who marries is paid marriage benefit but regardless of how much insurance she may have had before marriage, she is disqualified for certain benefits until she has worked in insurable employment for at least 26 weeks after marriage.  The Bill will remove this disqualification, and abolish marriage benefit, thus allowing married women to use their pre-marriage insurance for benefit purposes immediately after marriage.</P>
    <P>All except three of the proposals in the Bill will come into operation from the beginning of July next.  Apart from the proposal to abolish the remuneration limit for social insurance which, as already indicated, will be brought in by ministerial order, the exceptions are the proposal to ease the conditions for unemployment assistance in the case of certain widows and spinisters, and the proposal to abolish the condition which requires married women to have 26 contributions after marriage, both of which will come into operation at the beginning of October, 1973.  As the main budget increases will be brought into operation much earlier than in previous years very heavy demands are being made on the resources of the Department of Social Welfare and of the other Departments involved in staff, accommodation and equipment.</P>
    <P>This extra work must be done while the normal day-to-day work of the Departments concerned, which cannot be held up, continues.  The following figures give an indication of the size of the task.  A total of 23 million new social insurance stamps at 22 different rates must be printed and put into stock in post offices before 1st July next.  At the same time, new or revised pension order books must be printed and distributed to some 260,000 existing pensioners while provision must be made by way of special stamps for the payment of increased rates of children's allowances to some 359,000 existing families.  All of these figures are apart from the many thousands of new cases which the extension of the various schemes and the new schemes <Col N="343" /> will bring in.  Those payments which are made by cheque from head office or in cash at local offices of the Department will be increased immediately the new rates are effective, as will also all payments made by way of pension order books or allowance books.  There may, however, be some little delay&mdash;a matter of a week or two &mdash;in getting the special stamps distributed to all children's allowances cases.  All efforts will be made to avoid delays but in view of the exceptionally heavy pressure of work, it would be unreasonable to expect that some isolated cases of delays will not occur.</P>
    <P>This Bill involves a very heavy increase in expenditure on social services. On the social assistance side, including children's allowances, it is estimated that the increased cost to the Exchequer of the proposals in the Bill will be £41.1 million in a full year and £30.68 million in the current year. On the social insurance side, the gross increase in expenditure is estimated at £21.14 million in a full year of which £16.47 million will be met by increased contribution income, leaving £4.69 million to be borne by the Exchequer in a full year and £3.52 million in the current year.  Thus out of a total increase of £62.24 million in expenditure on social welfare which this Bill will bring about in a full year the Exchequer will bear £45.79 million.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in recommending this Bill to Seanad Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill as an attempt to remedy some defects in our social welfare provisions, a genuine and worthwhile measure to bring our social welfare standards and benefits into line with those of the other EEC countries.  The very large sums involved mean a very real and worthwhile financial improvement in the social welfare benefits which will be awarded by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the position of widows, deserted wives and unmarried mothers has been materially improved.  In the case of unmarried mothers there was virtually <Col N="344" /> no State provision for them up to this. I am very pleased that the Parliamentary Secretary has assured us that there will be a scheme instituted for unmarried mothers and this scheme will be broadly on the same lines as that designed to give allowances for deserted wives.  I am particularly pleased also that the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women have been taken into account and that these have influenced the Department in drawing up this legislation.  I would ask that in the interpretation of the regulations a generous attitude be adopted because there are problems in legally proving desertion and many of the people who have difficulty in proving that they were deserted are in extreme hardship and undergoing great difficulties.  I hope that the Department of Social Welfare, when they investigate the individual cases, will take a generous and realistic view of the woman's position.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to one specific point concerning a category of person who is debarred from these benefits because he is described as being self-employed.  This category is the clergy.  When the Principal Act was passed in 1952 certain categories were excluded from contributing and therefore excluded from receiving any benefits by statutory order.  Among these categories are the self-employed.</P>
    <P>My plea is that the Department should look again at the position of the clergy in their regulations connected with this Bill and, particularly, the position of the Protestant clergy who are generally married, have families and have the attendant financial problems.  The incomes which they now receive are minimal.  I regret to say it but it is a fact.  They have been debarred from contributing and, therefore, they receive no benefits from the social welfare system.  Where a clergyman dies leaving a widow and family behind great problems are created for those families.  The State should take account of them in their social welfare measures.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to the Department on behalf of the Protestant clergy.  It is a difficult <Col N="345" /> problem to deal with.  The difficulty arises from the fact that the majority clergy in Ireland are, at present, not entitled to marry and have families, so if we try to deal with the clergy in one category, the Roman Catholic clergy, if they were to contribute, would get very little back from the scheme.  This is the type of hairsplitting from which this Bill seems to be free.  The generous attitude which the Department have adopted, I hope, will be extended to take account of this difficult problem.  I would like to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to this problem in the hope that something can be done to include the Protestant clergy and, in fact, all clergy should they wish to come into the scheme so that they can benefit from it.  As I have already pointed out, their salaries are minimal.  They are people who do an important job of work and need assistance.  They pay taxes like everybody else.  Why can they not contribute and thereby receive the social welfare benefits other categories of people are entitled to?  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the problem of these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this measure.  It is an indication of the thinking and of the social conscience of the Government.  Many people will say the benefits are not adequate and maybe we will agree with that, but any country will admit that the social welfare services are something which cause problems.  In every country we hear the cry that more money should be given to the social services, but such benefits cannot be given without extra taxation.  I am glad to acknowledge the generosity of the Irish people.  They never mind paying something in taxation when they are satisfied that it goes into the pockets of the people who need it most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was gratifying for us to hear the Parliamentary Secretary announce these benefits today.  It has always been said that the inadequacy of our social welfare services created a barrier or impediment to the unification of this country.  It is nice to realise now that we are almost on a par with the <Col N="346" /> Northern Ireland social welfare benefits. Were it not for a recent budget in England, which increased social welfare benefits in the North, we would be ahead of them now and have a higher scale of payments.  That is something of which we can all be proud.</P>
    <P>There is one extension of the service which will benefit the unmarried mother.  That is something which we all have looked forward to for many years because they were neglected and often through circumstances outside their control were being deprived of finances to support their children.  Because of this they were often driven to abandoning their children in an unchristian way.  It is gratifying that we have at least found a way of helping those people.</P>
    <P>We have extended a further increase to deserted wives but, as Senator West has pointed out, there may be legal difficulties involved.  However, from the Parliamentary Secretary's opening statement the Department are prepared to meet those difficulties.  It is time that that section of community were helped in the way we would all wish.  I notice there is one particular extension where a widow with four children could earn up to £10 a week and still be entitled to a full pension of £14.15.  It will now be possible for a widow with four children to have an income of £24.15.  That is not an alarming amount.  No woman, irrespective of how thrifty she may be, could live in luxury on that sum but it is a big step forward.  Great credit is due to the Government who are such a short time in office and were a long time in Opposition and who have brought about such improved benefits.</P>
    <P>For too long we could hear the whispers, particularly approaching election time, that should we have a change of Government our people would lose their pensions, their children's allowances and their dole.  That little whisper was heard throughout the country for a number of years.  It was heard in convents, schools and other institutions but, thank God, the day has come when the people were prepared to take the chance and change the Government.  The change has turned out to be a great success.  This <Col N="347" /> is a budget that the underprivileged people will never forget.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House much longer because we have been in the House for a number of days and other Members might like to contribute to the debate.  I hope, in the near future, that our national wealth will allow us to increase further the social welfare benefits and thus help the people who most need our help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to welcome this Bill.  Anything that will help the less privileged among us to live in better conditions and to enjoy more comforts is always very welcome.  We are very pleased with any benefits that may come in the form of increases to old age pensioners, disabled and the unemployed and to all the other sections within our community who, through no fault of their own, are often unable to provide for themselves and for their families.</P>
      <P>It is true that increases have been granted through this budget and I welcome them very sincerely.  I can assure the House that were it not for the fact that over the last 16 years we had a Government who strengthened the economy to an extent that made this possible these increases could not have been granted.  It has always been our policy that as the wealth of the country increased, we should try to share that increase in wealth with the less fortunate in our community.  I am glad to see that this is being done and I hope that it will continue.  While a great effort has been made, many of the increases being granted will be eaten up by the increased cost of living before they are actually paid.  Some of the increase in the cost of living may be due to external causes but that will be no consolation to these people, who will expect to benefit immensely.  The matter of prices is tied up closely with this.  The Government will have to keep a very sharp eye on prices, if these increases are to be of any benefit at all. In actual fact, the people who receive them will be in the same position as they were this time last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the increases that are being given in children's <Col N="348" /> allowances.  It is well known that were it not for the fact that there are children in this country, there would not be any need for Dáil or Seanad or schools.  Those who rear families, especially in present circumstances, when the cost of living is so high, are making a tremendous sacrifice for the nation and for themselves. We should always aim to try to increase children's allowances.  In many instances it is an incentive to the children themselves to become conscious of the savings movement.  If a little can be saved out of it the rest is used for helping to provide food for them. We have advanced a long way in trying to provide for our children by having equal opportunities in education. Those of us who may be reasonably well-off would not begrudge giving to the children of this nation so that they would not suffer in their youth because of lack of money.  The Government should lean backwards to attain this and to try to provide for needy families.  There are many families trying to live on incomes that, under the present-day price system, are now totally inadequate and instead of enjoying a little frugal comfort they find great difficulty in eking out a mere existence.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I welcome all the increases and I hope that the Government will continue the good example that has been set over the past 16 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the provisions in this Bill for the improvement of conditions for the underprivileged sections of our community.  While I recognise that, to some extent, what Senator Dolan said about the cost of living may be true, this Government have created the precedent of bringing in their new rates of benefit and assistance from July, instead of October, which had been the procedure heretofore.  If there is a catching-up process constantly going on between the cost of living and benefits, this Government have taken the important step of reducing that by 25 per cent, since they have given it three months earlier than had been done by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of this Bill <Col N="349" /> because they are a significant step forward on the road to social justice for the weaker sections of the community. In addition, they bring us closer to a levelling off point between the benefits granted here and those granted in the Six Counties.  Anything which brings about greater harmonisation of life, or levelling off of services of any description, on any plane, between our State here and the Six Counties must, naturally, bring closer understanding and bring us a step nearer to the day when we shall, perhaps, attain unity with the people of the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to old age pensions and pensions generally.  It is a fact that there is no special consideration for the old age pensioner who lives completely alone.  If a married couple require £14 a week to live, then a single person, living alone, would require considerably more than half of that amount.  This fact should be taken into consideration by the Minister.  Naturally one kettle or one fire will suffice for two people, whereas a single person must have his own.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to disabled person's allowances.  I come from a rural area where quite a number of people who are not insurable are in receipt of a disabled person's allowance. This is a very sore point, because I have seen people who were in receipt of as much as £7 unemployment assistance while in their health, and able to work their small, inadequate farms and able to provide for their families to some extent.  Having become disabled and requiring hospital treatment for perhaps two months, they were forced to live on £3 a week disability allowance on returning home.  This is one field in which the Minister should interest himself and have an adequate survey carried out to find out how many such people exist.  There are many such people in the west who are forced to live on a most inadequate income, which is completely unjust.  It is unjust that a man in his health, in similar circumstances, should be in receipt of more than twice the amount of money that a sick man is able to get.</P>
    <P>In common with other Senators, I <Col N="350" /> am very gratified with the improvements. Nevertheless, there is still more important work to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKerrigan" hpid="Mr. Kerrigan Mr. Kerrigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerrigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome the Bill.  I congratulate the Government on a massive injection into the social welfare field.</P>
      <P>The new provisions are more broadly based than before.  This shows the sincerity of the Government in looking after the underprivileged. More people have been included by the easing of the means test.  Certain features mentioned by Senator West, such as the extra people who were brought within the social welfare code, are most desirable.  We must realise that this is only a step and that the Government are sincere in their efforts to bring about social justice for everyone.</P>
      <P>There are still many anomalies in the social welfare field.  I do not think this is the time to go through them.  This is the time to look at what has been done. The benefits which are moving more and more into health shows that an all-embracing comprehensive social welfare code is what this Government will eventually bring about.</P>
      <P>There are one or two anomalies in this social welfare scheme.  I should like to refer to one, home help.  Great hardships arise here.  When people give up work to care for somebody at home, and keep somebody out of hospital, they are not available for employment. The Parliamentary Secretary, and the Minister, should look at this to try to introduce some regulation so that these people will receive home help allowances.  This is one of the points at issue.  I know of many people who are caring for their aged parent, or parents, but find they cannot get any help allowance.  I welcome the Bill which, I believe, augurs well for the future of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few remarks on the Bill.  I should like to join with the other Senators who have given a very warm welcome to this measure.  It is a very generous measure, undoubtedly the most generous one of any Government in the history of this State, and every Senator, in fairness, recognises that fact.  If we are to <Col N="351" /> describe ourselves as a Christian community, we must accept the obligation that those of us who can bear the burden must help those who are not in such a fortunate position.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister for Finance, in this year's budget, extended the benefits to include such categories as deserted wives, unmarried mothers, and others, who, unfortunately, are a growing proportion in our affluent society.  This is something to which we will have to regard to a greater extent in future years. In every corner of our country today one meets sad cases of deserted wives. They are in need not only of charity but practical justice.  I am glad that the proposals in this budget, outlined in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, goes, at least some of the way, to help those under very difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to two categories that have been brought to the attention of the Minister, and the Parliamentary Secretary.  They are a continuing source of concern to anybody who is involved in health or social welfare concerns.  One is the dependant of prisoners.  I know this has been raised before.  I raised it with the local authorities of which I am a member in the Limerick area, the Western Health Authority and the Limerick City Council.  I know others have raised this problem in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As things stand, according to the law, the wife, and family, of a prisoner confined to jail cannot obtain unemployment benefit because he, naturally, does not conform to the requirements that he is able, and willing, to work.  He may be willing but he certainly is not in a position to take up employment.  I know representations have been made on this matter and it is a difficult nut to crack.  These unfortunate women, and children, are a particularly deserving section of our community. They are now thrown on the local home assistance schemes payable by the ratepayers for help.  That is not right.  They should form a part of our social assistance code and, as a <Col N="352" /> matter of right, at least the wife and family, should receive some payment from the State.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary might give some more information on the constant attendance allowance which is paid, I think I am correct in saying, to a prescribed relative.  A prescribed relative, I understand, cannot be married.  If that relative is married the person concerned does not get the allowance. It is quite a small allowance, £3 now raised to £3.50.  I had a case recently where such a person was debarred on that ground.  A married relative looking after an incapacitated lady of 85 years did not qualify for the constant attendance allowance because she was married and her husband was considered the breadwinner.  That should be looked into.</P>
    <P>I understand also that, where a person gives up their time to look after an incapacitated relative, or friend, or elderly person, and goes out to work the allowance is cut or reduced.  That should not be so.  In a case where a relative of an elderly person has to give up his, or her, livelihood entirely, the amount which they can get from the State is wholly inadequate.</P>
    <P>We all know of instances, perhaps there are only a few, where a devoted relative, usually a woman or a girl, gives up her career to look after an elderly mother or father.  She cannot go out to work.  The amount she can get out of the State fund is a hopelessly inadequate substitute for what she could earn if she was working.</P>
    <P>Another point which has been raised with the Minister's Department on a number of occasions is the centralisation of the social welfare system, particularly the system of payments.  I am long enough in public life to recall when the system was administered on a local basis.  I remember in the city of Limerick when the local assistance officer got up on his bicycle at a late hour at night to ensure that the recipients would have the cheque in their household that evening.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that, for various <Col N="353" /> reasons which I do not want to go into now&mdash;not all the fault of the Minister's Department&mdash;there are constant delays in the payment of certain social welfare benefits.  Anybody who is a member of a local authority will agree with me when I say that quite an amount of their time is taken up dealing with cases where there are delays.  The Department says that the medical certificate did not arrive on the prescribed day.  The person who is entitled to payment says it did.  The home assistance officer, or a public representative, telephones and, generally, there is quiet an inordinate delay.</P>
    <P>I remember a few years ago when there was a 'flu epidemic in the Department of Social Welfare nearly all payments were held up, in some cases for several weeks.  These things can happen.  It is not the fault of the Department.  I suggest that in this day and age where the whole social welfare code is to become so complex, and so widely based, that some measure of devolution, decentralisation, is necessary to various areas on a regional basis.  It would make the whole system more human and personal to have a local assistance officer dealing with the recipients rather than, as at present, a wholly impersonal basis, where the only contact is the person at the end of a 'phone call in the Department concerned. I do not wish to seem critical about this matter but I mention it as one who has had considerable experience of it as a public representative. I am sure my experience is shared by many others in other local authority areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it only appropriate that one should draw the attention of the House to the statement of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions welcoming the Social Welfare Bill, particularly since the Parliamentary Secretary did not have the opportunity of drawing the attention of the Dáil to it.  It places in its context the historic importance of this Bill.  I am quoting from <i>The Irish Times</i> of Tuesday, 19th June, on page 9.  The statement was to the effect that the Congress:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>recognises the Bill as by far the most important advance in the social <Col N="354" /> security services since the introduction of the comprehensive scheme in 1952.</P>
    <P>Possibly, to answer the objections of some Senators, for example Senator Dolan, the statement went on to say that:</P>
    <P>overall the increases in social welfare benefits which would be applicable next month amounted to £62 million a year, a rise of 38 per cent on the present level of benefits of £163 million.  This substantial increase, notwithstanding the sharply rising cost of living, will mean a significant improvement in living standards for the three-quarters of a million persons who are wholly or largely dependent on weekly social welfare payments, as well as for the vast majority of poor families with children.</P>
    <P>The report is extensive and laudatory and I will spare the Parliamentary Secretary some blushes by not quoting from it any further.</P>
    <P>The Bill is revolutionary in a number of ways.  When the history of social security in this country is written this Bill will be recognised as a hall-mark, particularly in respect of the means test.  As the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, instead of 21,000 persons getting the non-contributory old age pension as a result of this Bill the figure will be expanded to 108,000.  Fourteen of the existing 17 categories will be wiped out by the Bill.  There is also the innovation of the reduction of the pensionable age by one year to meet the commitment of the National Coalition of eventually reducing the age to 65 years.  The Bill displays great social courage in tackling problems which, until quite recently, were put under the moral carpet.  I am referring particularly to those innovations in respect of the unmarried mothers' allowance and also to the more humane treatment of deserted wives.  There is a reflection of the increased social concern in the special provisions being made for one-parent families.  The Congress statement correctly draws attention to the change in the allocation of the increase in the social insurance benefit. This not only brings us into line with <Col N="355" /> conditions in Europe but also takes into account that the employers received a considerable relief in rates. This, along with the corporation profits tax, was the means of taking back in a claw-back fashion some of the savings to them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the meeting by the Government of four of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women.  This, too, is a historic move and one which has not got sufficient recognition.  The Minister and Parliamentary Secretary are to be congratulated on this.  Senator McCartin mentioned that children's allowances are now equivalent or superior to those in the UK in many regards and, in some cases, just below them.  As the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out in the UK these allowances are taxable, therefore, in real terms they mean more to the families concerned in this country.  The overall increase means that for any four-child family whether it be a one- or two-parent family, there is an extra £5 per week in benefits</P>
    <P>The abolition of the £1,600 limit on social insurances is most welcome.  As pointed out by the Parliamentary Secretary, this does not obtain in the UK or in the EEC and it is obviously a move towards the objective in the statement of intent by the National Coalition to introduce a comprehensive social security system.  The Bill can be commended as a move towards achieving the alleviation and elimination of poverty.</P>

      <P>I was not here when the Parliamentary Secretary was speaking.  There is one point which should go on the record, namely, that the amount spent on social welfare last year was £11.6 million if my figures are correct.  This year the amount will be £51 million.</P>

      <P>I welcome the obvious appreciation that has been expressed by Senators of the achievements which have been made possible in this year's budget in social welfare advances.  So far as the Department and the Minister are concerned, as Senator Kerrigan expressed <Col N="356" /> it, although the advances made in this budget have been considerable they are regarded by the Government as a breakthrough.  We fully realise that there is a very considerable amount remaining to be done in the field of social welfare.</P>
      <P>Senator West expressed concern about the position of clergymen being excluded from social welfare benefits. I was made aware of this some weeks ago and the position at the moment is being examined in the Department to see if some means can be found by which clergymen, and other categories who are now excluded and would wish to be included in the social welfare scheme, would be allowed to do so. The Senator indicated that he was aware of certain existing legal difficulties. I can assure him that so far as the Department are concerned they are very sympathetic towards the circumstances in which this category of person find themselves.  Every effort will be made not only to include clergymen but also other categories of workers who, because of their present position are excluded at present.</P>
      <P>Mention was made by Senators of the legal definition required to prove desertion.  This has been looked at and the definition for a deserted wife who would be eligible under the scheme has been eased considerably and while all that may be desirable has not as yet been achieved, the matter will be examined further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dolan welcomed the advances made in the Bill and he subscribed the achievement to 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government.  This is not a matter on which I wish to dwell too long but the achievement for last year indicates the previous Government's attitude towards social welfare generally as they saw fit to spend £11.6 million while the present Government spent in the region of £50 million on social welfare.  Senator Russell mentioned the question of prisoners' families.  This links up with something which should be expressed to the Seanad at this time.  No provision is made for the family of a prisoner and this creates considerable hardship for that family.  The Minister is aware of this difficulty.  Recognition <Col N="357" /> has been given in the Bill to innovations in the field of social welfare.</P>
    <P>While the financial increases have been very considerable, they are not the most significant factor in these proposals.  The most significant factor is the indication that there is a change of thinking as to what constitutes social welfare, that a new concept of the term and the application of social welfare is now recognised by the Government.  Although it was not possible to do anything at this stage, the matter raised by Senator Russell regarding prisoners' families is one which is worthy of very serious and urgent consideration by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> I do not wish to delay the Seanad any longer.  I want to thank Senators for their co-operation in getting the Second Stage of the Bill through and for their appreciation of the achievements which have been made in the short time since the new Government took office.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take the remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>
