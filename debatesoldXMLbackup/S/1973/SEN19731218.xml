      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is briefly to authorise the Minister for Finance to advance moneys up to a limit of £175 million for continued development of the telephone service.  The sum of £50 million provided for by the last Telephone Capital Act passed in 1969 is exhausted; hence the need for a new Bill.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the telephone service falls under two broad headings. One is current expenditure on day-to-day operation, maintenance et cetera. This is met out of moneys voted annually by the Oireachtas which are more than balanced by telephone revenue paid into the Exchequer.  The other is capital expenditure on development works such as provision of new exchanges and trunk routes, buildings, laying of underground cables <i>et cetera.</i></P>
      <P>Telephone Capital Acts do not sanction expenditure; they are enabling Acts empowering the Minister for Finance to make issues out of the Central Fund for telephone development. They also authorise him to borrow for that purpose.  The issues are made to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on foot of annual Capital Works Estimates approved by the Minister for Finance.  Capital and interest are repaid by annuities extending over a period of 25 years.</P>
      <P>The Telephone Capital Act, 1969, passed in March 1969 authorised the Minister for Finance to issue a total of £50 million for telephone development. There had been on hand at 1st April, 1968, a balance of £3,658,000 from previous legislation.  Expenditure during the 5 years ended 31st March last amounted to £51.5 million leaving a balance of over £2 million.</P>
      <P>The £51.5 million was spent as follows: £26.2 million on subscribers' lines and installations, £15.3 million on exchanges, £7.5 million on trunk routes and the balance of £2.5 million on sites, buildings, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum of £50 million provided for in the 1969 Act was intended to cover the cost of a works programme designed to meet requirements from mid 1968-69 to mid 1973-74.  As it <Col N="327" /> turned out, the £50 million spent in this period was worth about £37 million in 1968 prices.  Clearly, expenditure on this limited scale was insufficient to enable the proposed programme to be carried out.</P>
    <P>In the event, some 117,000 new connections were made during the period resulting in a net increase of some 78,000 new subscribers lines; over 650 new kiosks were erected; almost all existing exchanges were extended; about 200 exchanges were converted to automatic working and 7,200 additional trunk circuits were brought into service.  The works carried out, extensive though they were, fell short of targets set in 1969. At present, more than 34,000 applicants for telephones are on the waiting list; the number of trunk circuits is inadequate on many routes; there are arrears of underground cableing for local development and of building works essential for the installation of equipment.</P>
    <P>Severe capital restrictions in 1970 and 1971 necessitated special measures which slowed down the whole programme. The effects have continued since August, 1971&mdash;when the restrictions were lifted&mdash;and are still being felt.</P>
    <P>This was an unfortunate example of a stop-go policy being applied where it did great damage&mdash;to a service which had arrears and was striving to accelerate to meet a steadily increasing demand.</P>
    <P>The present position is that the capacity of the telephone system needs to be greatly enlarged.  Many exchanges in Dublin and throughout the country have insufficient equipment to take on all the applicants for service until extra equipment can be installed.  Likewise many exchanges, particularly in Dublin, are overloaded to some degree in the busy hours. The trunk system is also short of lines and equipment.</P>
    <P>Since capital restrictions were relaxed in the latter part of 1971 efforts to expand the capacity of the system have been pressed ahead as rapidly as possible.  The value of the plant and <Col N="328" /> equipment being installed or on order is at present more than £40 million. However, much more needs to be done.  While many large contracts for equipment have been placed to date, quantities ordered have been limited by the availability of accommodation. This problem is receiving special attention.</P>
    <P>The importance of a good telephone service to economic development is now generally recognised. There is a very obvious relationship between the speed of industrial and commercial development and the ease of communications available to the business community.  A high quality telephone service is a valuable asset but it has to be paid for by heavy investment.</P>
    <P>The scale of the investment required for modern telecommunication systems can be judged from the fact that in Britain a 5-year £4,000 million telecommunications development programme has been approved.  The French telecommunications capital budget for 1973 is about £800 million and will rise to close on £1,000 million in 1974.  We must be prepared to invest heavily too, bearing in mind that we have much leeway to make up as we are in a comparatively early stage of development.</P>
    <P>Once a programme of heavy investment has been launched, it is important that it should normally follow its planned course.  Experience has shown clearly that even a relatively short period of financial restrictions can affect the programme for many years ahead.  A further point is that telephone development at a satisfactory rate is dependent not only on finance but on expansion of skilled manpower resources, acquisition of sites, provision of new buildings, time required to instal equipment. There are practical limits to the speed with which progress can be made under these heads.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the agreement of the Minister for Finance to the sum of £175 million provided for in the Bill representing the estimated cost of the programme, at 1973-74 price and wage levels, which it is anticipated, the Department will be able to carry out before mid-1978.  I should <Col N="329" /> like to stress&mdash;and I should like this emphasis to be understood in the debate to come&mdash;that this represents the scale of the effort to be undertaken. If the amount of £175 million is eroded by rises in price and wage costs the Minister for Finance will make good the deficiency and has agreed in advance to do so.  That would mean introducing a new telephone capital Bill before the expiration of the five-year period.</P>
    <P>The programme to be undertaken has a number of broad objectives. The first priority is to raise the quality of service of existing subscribers to a satisfactory standard by clearing local congestion and providing larger capacity links between the principal exchanges.  The second general objective is, of course, to reduce and eventually eliminate the waiting list for new telephones.  The conversion of manual exchanges to automatic working must also be pressed ahead as rapidly as possible to satisfy justifiable public demand and to overcome the growing accommodation and staffing difficulties at the larger manual exchanges.</P>
    <P>The programme, which it is proposed to carry out before mid-1978, provides for a net increase of 190,000 subscribers' lines&mdash;from 270,000 to 460,000.  It is planned to reach treble the present connection rate and to increase the number of telephones by 250,000 to more than 570,000.  This would result in our telephone density being raised from 12 per 100 of population at present to 19 per 100 in 1978.  We would then have about the same density as France has at present.  The density figures in other EEC countries are higher.</P>
    <P>In the &ldquo;01&rdquo;&mdash;Greater Dublin&mdash; area 24 new exchanges are proposed, replacing smaller exchanges in 13 places.  A number of these new exchanges notably a 20,000 line exchange at Ballsbridge, 20,000 at Tallaght, 16,000 lines at the GPO, and 10,000 lines at Santry are at present at the installation stage.  The subscriber capacity of almost all the remaining exchanges in Dublin will be increased.</P>
    <P>In Cork a new 20,000 line automatic exchange will be provided at Quaker Road, a major trunk and automanual <Col N="330" /> exchange building will be erected at Churchfield and most other exchanges in the area will be extended.  Two new automatic exchanges will be brought into service in both Limerick and Galway and major extensions of the existing automanual exchanges will be carried out.  Automanual exchanges and trunk traffic equipment at the other major centres throughout the country will also be expanded as will very many of the subscriber exchanges.</P>
    <P>It is planned to convert more than 200 manual exchanges, including all the larger exchanges, to automatic working.  This will leave some 380 manual exchanges which it is estimated will be serving some 28,000 subscribers in 1978 when the system should be 94 per cent automatic as compared with 85 per cent at present. However, it is intended that a good deal of the preparatory work, for example, acquisition of sites, erection of standard type buildings, provision of trunk circuits, for the conversion of the remaining manual exchanges will be done during the period.</P>
    <P>The major trunk schemes to be carried out during the period of the programme will include upgrading of the southern and northern co-axial cables from 600 to 2,700 circuits each and the western cable from 960 to 2,700 circuits; and commissioning new radio link systems and co-axial cables to serve numerous centres.  Some 3,000 additional cross-channel trunk circuits will be provided.  Overall the number of trunk circuits will be more than doubled.</P>
    <P>New exchange buildings and extensions of existing buildings are to be provided at virtually all the main switching centres and about 200 other places.</P>
    <P>Other developments under the programme will include the provision of coinbox telephones with trunk dialling facilities; substantial increase in the number of mobile automatic exchanges to meet temporary needs; an increase of one-third at least in the number of kiosks and the improvement and expansion of the International Service.</P>
    <P>When the new International Exchange in Dublin, at present in the <Col N="331" /> final installation stages, opens for service about March next, the number of circuits on direct routes to various European and North American centres will be almost doubled. The connection of calls will be expedited as operators in the exchange will have the technical facilities required to dial calls directly to subscribers with automatic telephones in Western European countries and in the USA and Canada.  International Subscriber Dialling will be introduced from the busy city centre exchanges in Dublin towards the end of the year and will be expanded later.  STD facilities to London and Belfast will be extended to a number of our provincial centres.</P>
    <P>It is likely that expansion of international traffic will make an earth station here for satellite transmissions viable in the late 1970s.  In the meantime, we will continue to use satellite circuits through the Goonhilly earth station in Cornwall in which we have an investment share.</P>
    <P>The programme will provide employment for some thousands of extra skilled and semi-skilled men and for many engineering graduates.  A substantial part of the stores to be used will be manufactured in the country, thus giving employment to many more.</P>
    <P>Telephone costs have, of course, been affected by inflation but telephone charges over the years have advanced less than consumer prices generally notwithstanding very steep increases in telephone pay rates.  The telephone service is essentially a profitable one and there need be no doubts about its ability to service the big investment now proposed.  As announced recently, the Minister for Finance has negotiated on favourable terms a loan of £7.5 million from the European Investment Bank to finance in part the telephone capital programme for 1973-74.  We hope to get similar loans for future years.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned elsewhere on a number of occasions lately that I am giving consideration to the question whether the telephone service is best provided by a Government Department. Proposals for any radical <Col N="332" /> change in an institution, such as the Post Office, which in its present form has served the public well for such a long time, would clearly require very thorough examination and full consultation with all likely to be affected: that means substantially the whole community.  So far as my own consideration of the matter is concerned, I still have a very open mind and if Senators wish to state their views I shall welcome them.</P>
    <P>To return to the Bill, it is clear that the telephone service requires a massive programme of expansion&mdash;of buildings, equipment, of skilled staff resources.  Satisfactory progress depends on heavy capital investment which the Bill will authorise.  The amount provided for is indicative of the Government's determination to carry through the programme required. I am sure the Bill will commend itself to to Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly speaking the Bill does commend itself to the House. It is a very practical and sensible extension to the Telephone Capital Bill. 1969, which enabled £50 million to be raised for telephone development since 1969.  I appreciate the Minister's point that to some extent this is eroded by inflation in the period subsequent to the passing of that Act and, in effect. he said that in 1969 terms this was worth £37 million.  In the even more galloping inflation that we are experiencing now this is going to erode to a substantial extent the £175 million that we are enabling to be raised for telephone development under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not enough to say that the Minister for Finance will make good any such deficiency that may be caused by inflation in the implementation of this programme over the next five years. Fundamentally, it is the Minister for Finance, and the Department of Finance, who will be concerned about controlling inflation.  Such guarantees. whether made verbally or in writing to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, or whether in an inter-Departmental communication between the Department of Finance and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. in my experience, mean very little <Col N="333" /> when it comes to the reality of what the Minister for Finance has to deal with having regard to the present world situation financially and economically in the months and years ahead.</P>
    <P>It is illusory for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to say that the Minister for Finance has agreed to meet any shortfall that may be caused by inflation over the next five years by which he will need more than £175 million to maintain his public capital programme in regard to telephone equipment.  This is illusory and based on a Department of Finance or ministerial agreement, whether in writing or verbally.  There is nothing in this Bill about it.  All we should be concerned about as parliamentarians is what is in the Bill.</P>
    <P>If the £50 million which was quite substantial in 1969 was eroded to the extent of £37 million in the period since then I hesitate to contemplate the sort of erosion that will arise with regard to the £175 million in the present situation of the £1 in the world market with rampant inflation.  I am issuing a cautionary word to the Minister, which I am sure he fully appreciates himself, that ultimately any plans he may have will be subjected to the sort of control that will arise in the financial sense faced with the economic recession and very grave economic difficulties into which we are going.  That is a side issue.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is a welcome one.  We need this capital money for the extension and improvement, as outlined by the Minister in his introductory speech, of our telephone service, particularly having regard to the very heavy capital requirements involved in installing equipment for this purpose.  Forgive me for introducing a constituency note here but I am glad that through the good offices of the Industrial Development Authority the main Swedish supplying firm to the Post Office in regard to telephonic equipment, Ericsson Limited, now located in Athlone, will be employing up to 600 skilled male personnel on this type of work and that the regional college <Col N="334" /> there is designing courses to suit this type of development.</P>
    <P>This ensures that we have an industrial base through which and out of which the Post Office, or whoever replaces the Post Office in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, or whichever semi-State body may be established, will be enabled to (a) have a manufacturing base here for telephonic equipment, (b) that that base is guaranteed by part of the industrial conglomerate of the world's leading telephonic communication manufacturers, and (c) that the personnel are being trained there to ensure that the operation is a success. There is a built-in manufacturing base here for the supply of telephonic equipment that will enable the type of programme outlined by the Minister to succeed.  It will provide, as far as we are concerned, a certain defence against any fall-back in the supply of such essential equipment or any outrageous price increases that would leave us open to the world market in the supply of telephonic equipment. The efforts made by the Industrial Development Authority to establish a manufacturing base in regard to the production of such equipment will help in the difficult years ahead to ensure continuity in the volume of supply of equipment which will enable the Minister to carry out his proposals.</P>
    <P>There are certain other queries that I should like to raise.  First of all, I am aware that both in regard to the World Bank and the European Investment Bank, proposals submitted by the previous Government have been followed on by the present Government in regard to securing loan advance to initiate this programme.  A lot of noise was made about the £7.5 million loan for the first year but in view of the magnitude of the problem I would consider that loan inadequate. I do not know what proposals are on foot to secure further loans in this direction, but certainly £175 million is going to be spent, and it will need to be spent in the next five years and, having regard to what I said earlier on about inflation, probably a lot more than that in actual <Col N="335" /> money terms.  I would consider a £7.5 million pounds loan in the initial year, for 1974-75, to be inadequate.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this is the first year, but certainly if the Minister, with his enabling legislation, is thinking in terms of at least £175 million expenditure over the next five years, then it is ridiculous to talk of a loan in the region of £7.5 million for the first year, unless there is a very real escalation in the loans that will come from the European Investment Bank over the second, third, fourth and fifth years of the programme.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Minister has any information about the prospects for a substantial increase in that loan advance from the European Investment Bank over the second, third, fourth and fifth years of the programme.  Unless there is a very real escalation and improvement in the £7.5 million for the first year, I would envisage at least three, four or five times of an increase, if the programme is going to be achieved over the next five years.  I mention this because this sort of money represents a very heavy burden on our resources.  That is why it is important to go to loan agencies to which we have access and the obvious one, having regard to our membership of the European Economic Community, is the European Investment Bank. When the big noise was made by the Minister for Finance in regard to this £7.5 million, knowing the facts I considered it highly inadequate.  I mentioned 1974-75: I appreciate that is for 1973-74.  It is the present year we are taking about, not next year.</P>
    <P>This highlights what I am saying.  If we have £7.5 million from the European Investment Bank for the telephone capital programme for the year up to March of next year, then I should like to hear more about what we are getting from March, 1974, to March, 1975, and from then on, depending on the change, of course, of the public and capital and current programmes to the annual January/ December basis.  But on whatever basis, all we have from the Minister for Finance is that we will get £7.5 <Col N="336" /> million in the current year, from March of this year to March of next year.  We have heard nothing from him about what sort of funds are going to be made available for capital development in regard to the telephone service in each of the four succeeding years.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we have information on this because expenditure of this magnitude is going to bear very heavily on our resources and much more heavily when we see the next budget, and the capital and current figures for the next budget. having regard to the sort of expenditure to which the present Government are already committed.  I can see very serious difficulties, if we are going to rely on our own resources for the substantial expenditure that will be needed for the Minister to carry out his programme.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise one other matter&mdash;it is something that may be more relevant to the Minister for Finance&mdash;and it is in regard to seeking whatever assistance we can get. Has any effort been made by the Government to secure a contribution from the EEC Regional Policy Development Fund towards a mitigation of the interest repayments on this loan?  One of the most important aspects in the proposed regional policy proposals which, I understand, will be adopted is a direct grant of three units of account, or 3 per cent interest, towards any country, such as Ireland, that qualifies on all the criteria for regional aid.  This is particularly for countries, such as Ireland, which have such very real infrastructural problems such as this.</P>
    <P>This is a classic example of an infrastructural need that we would find difficulty in meeting out of our own resources.  There is a provision in the regional policy which is non-contentious and which will be adopted.  It enables any country securing money such as this from the European Investment Bank to secure an interest grant of 3 per cent.  Three per cent on a major loan can be quite substantial.  A 3 per cent interest rebate on a loan of £7.5 million is quite substantial, but I would envisage <Col N="337" /> much larger loans than that being required from the EIB over the coming years.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the Government, in submitting their project to the European Investment Bank, should have regard to this very specific provision under the regional policy. Areas such as Ireland and Southern Italy have real problems in regard to infrastructure, where their internal resources are not such as can be taxed to pay for the capital required to deal with infrastructural needs. This should be brought home very strongly to the people responsible. This means co-ordinating applications to the European Investment Bank on the loan side and applications to the regional development fund for interest rebate to projects such as this that qualify under the infrastructure heading. This applies across the board to high-rate developments, such as water add sewerage developments, that are required.  Our major problem as a community has been to raise the massive loan finance that is needed to deal with our telephone problem, our roads problem, and our water and sewerage problem.  In other words, from our own resources we cannot really provide the funds required to deal with these major infrastructural developments.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, welcome this Bill as a step in this direction.  The initial injection of £7.5 million is paltry and is totally inadequate.  If we are going to plan ahead, as the Minister seemingly feels it is necessary to do, then we must have a tremendously increased loan capital made available, working from a basis of £7.5 million for the current year, but substantially increased in the years ahead, if his desired target is going to be achieved.</P>
    <P>I suggest that he should discuss with his Government colleagues a way in which the Exchequer could find a mitigation or a reduction in regard to the interest repayments that would be our burden in regard to such loans. There is the immediate three units of account or 3 per cent mitigation that we can secure from the regional development fund to take the heat off our Exchequer carrying the interest <Col N="338" /> repayment which would be the main burden on our Exchequer capital-wise in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I conclude on the basis that the Bill is welcome.  It is a matter of progression from the Telephone Capital Act, 1969.  It is non-contentious.  Any Irish Government concerned about their business would bring in such a Bill. This Bill would have been brought in irrespective of which Government were in power.  There is no contention involved, but there are real questions in regard to securing the necessary loan finance from the European Investment Bank or any other agency, in order to keep the Minister's plans in regard to the investment he envisages alive.</P>
    <P>There is also the very real problem that would be accentuated by the sort of inflation in which the world now finds itself, where the £175 million over the next five years might be totally inadequate.  It will be a matter for the Minister to secure that finance internally.  There is nothing in the Bill about it.</P>
    <P>I, personally, do not trust the Minister for Finance in these matters.  The Minister may have been reassured, but he will find very real problems if the heat is on in the sense of any sort of financial restriction in the years ahead.  He may find his telephone expansion programme in a stop-go situation. I hope it will not happen.  I agree with the Minister that these matters should be planned on a basis which excludes stop-go but one is up against very real problems in dealing with inflation having regard to the financial and economic problems of the world. All I would suggest is that the Minister and the Government get moving very quickly on getting substantial loan commitments from the European Investment Bank that will seal and make certain whatever programme he has in mind.  I would suggest to him that the initial injection of £7.5 million is so totally inadequate as to merit a substantial case for a very real improvement.  It should not be done on a one-year basis.  It should be done on a five-year basis.  It should be spelled out precisely what commitments are involved from the European <Col N="339" /> Investment Bank, what possible assistance can come in the way of interest rebate from the Regional Development Fund, and the whole matter should be done on a five-year basis as the Minister envisages.</P>
    <P>There is no point in having five-year aspirations unless there are five-year capital commitments from the loan and grant agencies involved in Europe which can enable us to carry out this programme.  It is the type of programme which we cannot carry out through our own resources unless we have commitments over the next five years from the particular agencies within Europe which can give us very real assistance to deal with this very important and major infrastructure problem.</P>
    <P>Without a good telephone system in the modern world we are not in the league as far as economic progress is concerned.  It is a fundamental infrastructure requirement, more important than any other.  If we are to do business in the world in future we must have this right.  My only concern is that the Minister ensures that we have the financial commitments, perferably from resources outside our own.  If we are depending too much on our own resources we will be up against the stop-go situation.  If we get definite forward financial commitments in regard to both loans and grants from the two European agencies which I have mentioned, we are in a strong situation; and that is the approach the Minister must go on.  It is that approach which will guarantee success for the Minister in the programme he has outlined.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Minister asked that we say something about the notion which he has bruited abroad about removing the system from direct control of his Department to some State-sponsored agency.  I regard that as secondary to what I have been saying.  It matters very little whether the Minister wants it directly or whether he delegates it to a State-sponsored agency, as long as the capital is forthcoming and guaranteed. The Minister can then plan ahead on <Col N="340" /> a real planning basis.  Who administers the actual programme is secondary.  There are arguments for having it on a State-sponsored basis; there are arguments for doing it directly.  Personally, I would prefer it to be done on a State-sponsored basis through some agency.  However, there are very real problems, of which I am sure the Minister is aware.  He will have to deal with the trade unions in connection with grades and establishment situations across the board in the existing system.  It is easy to set up a State-sponsored agency when you are doing it <i>de novo.</i>  It is another matter when you are seeking to switch 23,000 people into a new situation and deal with their grades and establishment situations.  It is easy to talk about State-sponsored bodies. The Minister has the problem of an existing structure and it will be his problem to switch that structure into a new situation.  Theoretically it is better to have it on a State-sponsored basis, to have it free from departmental control.</P>
    <P>If the Department can get their forward financial situation organised from sources which can supply loan finance and not be dependent on domestic requirements&mdash;because we cannot meet the sort of moneys which are involved in this situation&mdash;if the Minister can get the forward financial planning thoroughly organised and commitments made in regard to that. I would regard the question of the administration as being a very small matter in comparison.  I know the Minister's problem in regard to the making of a State-sponsored agency out of the system.  The idea is right but there are very real problems to be tackled.</P>
    <P>The Bill is generally welcome.  The sooner we get on with it and provide the necessary finance, the better.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on introducing a broad and imaginative scheme to put the telephone service in this country on a highly efficient level.  I do not share the worries of Senator Lenihan in regard to finance.  I do not think he is correct in some of the <Col N="341" /> statements he made relative to that financing.  As I understand it, the loans the country can get from the European Investment Bank are related to the amount of capital which we expend.  In the coming year £7.5 million is directly related to the £90 million it is proposed to spend on the telephone service, or approximately 40 per cent of the total which we expend in this country.  It is sensible to assume if the expenditure increases that <i>pro rata</i> the loans which we can command from outside funds will increase.</P>
      <P>There is another source of funds which should not be overlooked, and that is that the more we invest in the telephone service the larger is our financial investment and the larger our cash flow.  I assume that the Minister, apart from the moneys raised through the normal central funds, can also call on larger outside amounts directly related to the amount of expenditure from our own funds.  From that point of view I would not be greatly concerned about financing because I believe that this country will be able to finance it.  I am sure Senator Lenihan will agree that it is absolutely necessary that we finance it.  Past history has made it quite clear that the amount of expenditure on what is now a vitally necessary service has been hopelessly inadequate. I do not say that in any carping criticism of past Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs.  They have had difficulties with which they have had to contend.  Perhaps the appreciation of the vital necessity of a modern efficient telephone service was not as greatly appreciated as it is today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comment was made in the other House about the depreciated value of the £50 million which was voted in 1968, which at that time looked an enormous figure.  At that time it seemed as if we were going to put our telephone system on an efficient basis.  The hopes of five years ago have not been realised.  As has been pointed out by the Minister in his speech, the £50 million of 1968 turned out to be something like £37 million.  That is why the House should warmly welcome the procedures in <Col N="342" /> this instance.  The Minister is talking about spending £175 million at 1973 price and wage levels.  He is giving the undertaking which has come to him from the Minister for Finance that any adjustments arising out of deflation or increases in the cost of living will be adjusted by bringing in, if necessary, another telephone Bill, or as I would assume Bills, over the next five years.  That means that we are assured that £175 million at the going value of the £ in any year over the next five years will be available to modernise our telephone system.  If that is so it is certainly very welcome news to everybody&mdash;to farmers, shopkeepers, industrialists and the people living in remote rural areas.  They should all be very glad of this assurance and this major commitment from the Department of Finance and from the Minister's own Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister could, with benefit, decentralise the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to a far greater extent. Most of us in public life, have had the experience of constituents coming to us to seek our assistance in getting telephone connections, in most cases for very good reasons.  They are commercial travellers, farmers, veterinary surgeons, people engaged in industry or representing industry who want to have rapid and available communications.  For obvious reasons, they cannot be looked after as quickly as one would like.  I should like to see more contract work done at local or regional level.</P>
    <P>As far as I understand, the procedure is that almost every application has to go to Dublin, has to be processed, and has to come back to the area to be put into effect.  If I am broadly correct in that statement, a vast amount of decentralisation could be done.  I should like to see the Department of Posts and Telegraphs decentralised to something of the same extent as the ESB or CIE where there are regional managers.  Perhaps it is necessary to have some sort of regional committees representative of the broad interests in the area so that the Department could be regarded as a local as well as a national and international service.  I hope that idea will <Col N="343" /> commend itself to the Minister.  I hope it is practicable because certainly it is desirable.  I believe it has proved to be desirable and effective in other branches of the Government services.</P>
    <P>We are living in an age of rapid changes in all forms of communications. We are cognisant of all the changes in the air, on the land and on the sea.  We have not been, up to now, so appreciative of the necessary changes that will come in telecommunications and telex and telegrams and all the other various means of communicating from one city to another, from one country to another, for various industrial or social reasons.  Applications for telephones are now running at something over 40,000 a year.  They have been increasing rapidly.  I think it is safe to assume that in the not too distant future they will rise to something like 50,000 applications per year.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's reply, I should like him to relate this £175 million programme to the expected increase in the demand for telephones and other services supplied by his Department. We know that the £175 million will be used to build new post offices, to provide new equipment, to train new staff, to do a number of other things.  How is that directly related to the anticipated increase in demand for the services provided by the Department? Is £175 million, which seems an enormous sum, sufficient to provide for the rise in demand for services over the next five years?  If it is not, we should now be thinking in terms of even greater sums.  That might sound rather unwise at this stage when money is relatively tight. Now is the time to look ahead in the knowledge that we will have to provide a far greater and more efficient service, and a far more widely based service, particularly in the context of our membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Another thing which, perhaps, the Minister might find time to refer to in his reply is this.  As everybody who has any connection with industry or business, or indeed, any branch of human activity, knows, it is almost <Col N="344" /> imposssible to contract ahead on the assumption that the goods or services or supplies or equipment will be delivered on time or at anything like the contract price.  Every contract now has some form of escalation clause. There is always a way out for delays in delivery.  Anybody who is a member of a local authority will agree with me when I say that all the schemes brought before councillors and which sound so well when they are being proposed, inevitably run into months and sometimes years of delay and inevitably the answer from the city or county engineer or the city or county manager is that it is due to lack of delivery of equipment. I should like to ask the Minister if he would be good enough to refer to that point.  Apart from the question of money, which we now know will be available, certainly in the present very difficult world circumstances unless firm contracts are made with an assurance of delivery there could be a very serious hold-up in this whole programme over the next five years.</P>
    <P>I should like to make another suggestion to the Minister which might be worth considering.  All of us who serve on local public bodies know that we get from time to time criticisms that the gas men or the ESB men have hardly pulled out when along come the Posts and Telegraphs men to dig up the road once more. There seems to be a lack of co-ordination between the various Government Departments who supply local services such as light and heat and telephone services.  Would it be possible in connection with new housing estates, corporation or private enterprise estates, that an application for a telephone could be made at the same time as a person is applying for a loan or a grant?  In other words, to the services they require such as light and heat, would be added a telephone service? It may be completely impracticable.  I put the proposal forward because I can see many advantages in it.  When housing schemes are being developed with 200 or 300 houses, if the Minister's Department were aware that one half of the new owners would require telephones, it would be possible <Col N="345" /> to plan ahead on a comprehensive basis rather than waiting for applications to come up every few months in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>One development which is likely to occur in the future is the necessity for the training of postal staffs in European languages.  I do not know what developments are taking place in that regard.  With the interchange of people in the European context, I foresee the necessity arising for some of the staff in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs being conversant with possibly two or more European languages.  I wonder if anything is being done in that regard.</P>
    <P>Young men and girls going into the Department should feel assured that they have a worthy career ahead of them, that there is something to look forward to, that they are not going into a pigeon-hole job, that they can climb up to the very top.  I should like to see something like a degree in telecommunications. I do not know whether that would be practicable.  If it cannot be organised as a degree there is in Limerick, as Senators are aware, a National Institute for Higher Education which would be an ideal centre for training Post Office or telecommunications staff at the very highest level of education.  That is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I noticed in the discussion in the other House a reference to a 2p telephone call between London and Dublin and <i>vice versa.</i>  Is it possible that other cities, such as Limerick, Cork, Waterford and elsewhere could have the same facility?  Is there any reason why they should not have the same facility?  I think they should.  It is something like the airlines.  There is a cheaper rate between Dublin and London, than between Shannon and London and between Cork and London. There seems to be a certain discrimination against the provincial areas in favour of the capital city and the Minister would do well to eliminate this discrimination as far as is practical or practicable.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked for the views of both Deputies and Senators on the <Col N="346" /> setting up of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as a semi-State body. There are difficulties here but, on balance, I would come down in favour of this.  I do not say that will necessarily make for more efficiency in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, but a semi-State body on the lines of the ESB, Bord na Móna or CIE within a Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications could be of advantage in many ways.  One instance that I can think of is that the personnel of the board of a semi-State body would consist of people broadly representative of various sectors.  I would like to see business people, farmers, consumers, workers and so on represented on it.  Divested of their personal or sectional interests, they could contribute very usefully to the development of the telephone and other telecommunications, including telex, which I know is outside the scope of this Bill but should be brought within the scope of any semi-State body that will be set up.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to congratulate the Minister.  He has shown imagination and foresight in the programme he has put before us.  I am sure the Seanad will gladly, without hesitation, vote the substantial capital sum necessary for the development of our telephone and telecommunications systems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any of us who have been subject to the frustrations of the telephone system over the last few years cannot but welcome this Bill.  We welcome also this imaginative and direct approach to modernising the system.  When we compare our system with the systems operating in the United States and England, where one can readily and speedily dial direct in the knowledge that one's conversation is private whereas here one gets all kinds of cut-ins on conversations, it is obvious the system here badly needs to be modernised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system must be modernised as rapidly as we can accomplish it.  We are all agreed on that.  The world has been coming down to reality very quickly during the past year and particularly during the past month.  We <Col N="347" /> are now finding that many of the things we regarded heretofore as necessaries of life are being pushed back into the category of luxuries or into an area where we have to cut out waste, to co-operate and share.</P>
    <P>The hefty capital bill involved in modernising the telephone system demands that the greatest care be exercised so that we can cut down expenditure to the absolute minimum and, at the same time, get the best possible service for that expenditure. We will have to monitor the progress very carefully in the years ahead.  I am not concerned about whether the system is to be re-organised as a semi-State body or whether it is to be left with the Minister.  I agree with previous speakers that the change is not likely to provide a wholly satisfactory solution to the problem but because of the magnitude of the capital expenditure and investment involved here there is a need for a study team, independent of the present structure of the telephone service and largely independent of the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>There is need for an independent research study team which, in relation to the figure we are contemplating of £175 million in capital investment, would for a sum of £100,000 a year make sure that we get the best possible value for our money.  Only by doing so can we be sure that we have an adequate monitoring of the progress made and the maintenance of an up-to-date approach.  I do not believe any organisation such as the Post Office, or any other large organisation involved in a huge development programme, is in a position to be its own best critic as to whether the money is spent to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that there should be a short-term commission established, even for five years, involving some permanent scientifically trained Posts and Telegraphs people, plus a small advisory committee, something along the lines of the Nuclear Energy Board.  There should be somebody established to keep an eye on expenditure on behalf <Col N="348" /> of the public because we seem to be in a position now from which we can expand fairly rapidly.  Our major industry, agriculture, is set on a very expansionist course and the markets seem to justify that.  We have other facets moving into this expanding economy that we have created.  There is so much pressure on the use of capital that we must ensure that we get the best possible value at all times.  The Government are faced with deciding priorities between some very commendable and necessary schemes but capital is a very scarce commodity.</P>
    <P>I do not look with much favour on foreign borrowing.  It is a dangerous and sometimes risky operation.  Admittedly, we have to borrow from foreign markets which, for a while, is possibly all right, but we have got to service this foreign borrowing.  There is no kick-back to the economy; the interest leaves the country to service these foreign loans, whereas money got from our own people circulates within the economy.  The recipients have to pay Irish income tax and, in general, it does make a contribution to the economy.  Though it may appear that getting money abroad at 8 per cent is a bargain at a time when. perhaps, it costs maybe 12 or 14 per cent at home, yet the difference is nothing like the difference between 8 per cent and 14 per cent, because you have to allow the real effect of the 8 per cent on borrowing.</P>
    <P>I should like then to feel that there is a real need for a study and a rationalisation here.  I find that over half the expenditure incurred during the past five years was incurred on sub-subscribers' lines and installations.  As projected, with an increase in connections from 270,000 to 460,000 it would appear again that the vast majority of these will be private subscriber lines.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to do some rationalising there.  We are all aware of the craze of &ldquo;visiting&rdquo; on the phone.  This is done especially where school children get on the phone about their lessons or something else and may spend half an hour or more on a call.  It is not within our capacity <Col N="349" /> to provide circuits to accommodate that type of traffic.</P>
    <P>In view of the concern about the availability of telephone service for business purposes, I wonder whether the provision of private house telephones could be restricted quite considerably. Perhaps there could be an automatic cut-out of calls after a few minutes, or some strong warning on the line after a period.  If the duration of calls could be cut by half, twice the number of calls could be handled on the circuits, and the overloading factor could be reduced very considerably.</P>
    <P>It has been found in business that the telex service has been proving more satisfactory and there is much less waste of time.  The question is simply put on the teleprinter, transmitted to the person concerned and when the answer is available it is telexed back.  The lines are not tied up for long periods as they can be with telephone inquiries.  When making a telephone query, perhaps the person concerned has to be found and there can be appalling waste of time.  Business is tending more and more to change over to the telex type of communication.</P>
    <P>There is more vandalism in our phone kiosks in this country than anywhere else of which I have experience. When visiting England, America or the Continent one is impressed by the excellent condition of the public telephone booths and the complete absence of vandalism.  This vandalism applies to many other public conveniences as well, but it is especially noticeable in the telephone system.  If vandalism could be reduced it would result in very considerable savings, as well as lessening the frustration of people who are seeking to use a telephone kiosk and find it out of order.</P>
    <P>Would it be possible to enlist the aid of the schools to try to encourage among their pupils a proper respect for public property such as telephone kiosks, <i>et cetera?</i>  There has been a great deal of talk during the past few years about the teaching of civics in the schools.  We have not heard much about it lately.  Perhaps something could be done about this.</P>
    <P>These are all points which the <Col N="350" /> present world energy crisis brings home to us.  We are not going to approach this Bill today in the same type of unquestioning way in which we would have approached it even six weeks ago.  In six months' time we are going to be even much more questioning.</P>
    <P>I put all these points to the Minister. There is a vital necessity to have at least a short-term research organisation and methods unit working on them.  The adequate provision of staff &mdash;especially technical staff&mdash;should be anticipated as far as possible and measures taken to train additional people in those areas.  If they are not all absorbed into the telephone system they will be very well trained for many positions in industry.</P>
    <P>On the question of an advance of £175 million; that is, £125 million and the £50 million that is now exhausted, which the Minister is authorised to make under this Bill, the Minister says the system is profitable.  But will the system be able to carry adequate repayments on such an investment?  I calculate that the payments will be of the order of £20 million a year, which, added to the other running costs of the system, would call for an increase in telephone revenue of, perhaps, £40 million or £50 million a year.  I am not aware of the present figure&mdash;it must be of the order of £15 million to £20 million at the very most.  Therefore, it would mean that we are looking for at least a threefold increase in the five years on the revenue from telephones.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill.  It is long overdue, but I hope we can live up to the capital requirements involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill.  I have listened to the observations of the previous speakers and I am quite satisfied that there are many areas which require investigation, and some proposals should be brought forward to improve the position.  However, regard must be had to the fact that, where provision is made for a service upon which many demands are being made by various Departments of state.  No matter how farseeing the Minister is, no matter how detailed and critical his examination <Col N="351" /> of the problems has been, he is always faced with the situation that he can get only a certain amount of money to do a certain number of things.  Having read the Minister's opening speech I know this critical and detailed examination took place. I am impressed that it was not Dublin orientated.  It has spread very far and has taken in all the rural areas and has looked at the outstanding needs to project itself outside the country.</P>
      <P>Much needs to be done but much has been covered under this Bill and that is the basis on which we should examine it.  A good many matters which have been mentioned here can be dealt with by direct approach to the Minister.  In that sense there has been some quibbling.  The wide scope the Bill gives and the foresight the Minister has shown in making sure that the value of the money he is providing is not lost, are commendable. I should like to be in the position to be able to say to an employer, &ldquo;I do not want to lose the value of the money&rdquo;.  It is a happy position to be in.  This shows great foresight on the part of the Minister and I congratulate him on this, as well as every other aspect of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There are difficulties when one looks for money to provide a service. The only advantage the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have over any other Department is that to some extent they are run on private enterprise lines.  All other Departments owe money to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs because that Department provide a telephone service to the other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This gives the Minister &ldquo;a little edge&rdquo;, but it does not allow him to go any further than people wish. No matter how keen his foresight is, he will come to a point where he must come to terms and compromise at the highest level possible and settle for the greatest amount of money he can receive. On looking back at the 1969 Act and the amount of money allowed and how it has been spread over the four-year period and having regard to the fall in the value of money, the <Col N="352" /> amount of money now envisaged and the scope of the benefits to which it is directed are very commendable When this is, matched against the amount of money under the 1969 Act and when the aims of both measures are compared, it is clear that this situation has been thoroughly examined.  I have no doubt there is more to come from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>We should take the Bill in its entirety and realise that this is a Bill which shows imagination.  It has been subjected to detailed examination.  I am somewhat disturbed about the fears expressed by Senator Quinlan and his remarks about setting up a commission to police the money service. If a Minister in doing his job gets money to spend on his Department it appears Senator Quinlan would wish somebody to police the spending of this money and be there to see that what was stated in the Minister's statement would be given effect to.  This is not necessary. Senator Quinlan may not have meant this but it sounded like it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is doing his job properly and there is no question about this as is seen from the Bill: he has put himself body and soul into his work&mdash;there is no need for anybody to monitor the spending of the money.  The Minister has left himself open in the sense that he is ready to receive the views and opinions of the people.  He will receive them and when the time comes to give effect to these things I have no doubt that this will be done in accordance with the Minister's statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Bill that will result in the provision of extra moneys to improve and expand the telephone service must be welcomed. We must be realistic and admit that in recent years this service has deteriorated.  This is possibly due to the expansion of the service which took place over the past number of years.  When the Minister obtains the extra money I hope he will put his priorities right.  Before there is an acceleration in the supplying of telephones <Col N="353" /> the Minister should improve the existing service.</P>
      <P>When a subscriber lifts his telephone to make a call he is entitled not only to an expeditious service but to a confidential service.  The Minister should use some of the money available to him to ensure that in future all necessary steps will be taken to ensure that the confidentiality of the telephone service is maintained.  If I as a subscriber using a telephone rented from the Minister's Department make a call, nobody either within the postal service or outside it should be allowed to interfere with that call.  I am not satisfied that the confidential nature of the telephone service is being maintained in parts of the country today, nor am I satisfied it was maintained for the last number of years.  The public should have confidence in the telephone service and the service is useless if members of the public believe that it is being tampered with.</P>
      <P>I was rather surprised when in the debate on the Estimates for his Department in the Dáil last June, following a complaint by the Fianna Fáil Deputy from North-East Donegal, the Minister gave the impression that he was not aware of a serious breach in this regard which had occurred in Donegal about 18 months ago.  Perhaps it is understandable because at that time the Minister was only about three months in his Department and naturally could not be expected to know of all the happenings there prior to his entry.  I was even more surprised when one week later the Independent Deputy for Donegal on the same Estimate stated that he knew nothing about it either.  Because of this case, the court case that followed, and the apparent lack of knowledge of some of the participants, in order to satisfy the public and indeed to satisfy me as a subscriber, the Minister should use some of the money he is seeking under this Bill to hold a public Departmental inquiry into this sordid business.</P>

      <P>I am asking for a public departmental inquiry, financed by moneys the Minister is seeking, to satisfy the public that telephone tapping did occur two years ago and some of this money should be used to ensure that it will not happen again.  I can give the Minister sufficient facts to justify such an inquiry. I have an interest in it because the telephone that was tapped was mine.  As a subscriber I believe I am entitled to a reasonable assurance that this simply cannot happen again.  I am disturbed because while one telephonist was brought to court I know that another escaped the net and he is still in the employment of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>On Good Friday of last year I reported to the postal authorities in Letterkenny that I had reason, for some months, to suspect that my telephone was being interfered with, that when I made a number of telephone calls, particularly to the Fianna Fáil Deputy for East Donegal, people were being allowed to tune into the switchboard and on other occasions information was being passed by a certain telephonist.  I discovered that this particular telephonist was on duty on two nights of the week on his own from midnight until 8 a.m. I noticed in the Official Report that a Deputy stated that this information was of no value to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This affair began just two years ago during the election of constituency delegates to the Fianna Fáil National Executive.  While I am sure the Minister is not conversant with the system of election, this particular election resulted in the introduction of phone tapping into Donegal politics, in the dismissal of a telephonist and in a subsequent Circuit Court action.  There were three candidates for that election, two of them being supported by the present Independent Deputy for Donegal and a third supported by the Fianna Fáil Deputy and myself.  From time to time I discussed over the telephone <Col N="355" /> how various Fianna Fáil cumainn would vote in the election.  I gave Deputy Cunningham information of a highly confidential nature.  Some time later, I was surprised to discover that this information was known to our opponents.  I considered the matter carefully and came to the only conclusion possible, namely, that my telephone was being interfered with. I played the role of private detective for a few weeks.</P>
    <P>Eventually, I went to the postal authorities, who were very concerned about the allegation and investigated it thoroughly.  I named the telephonist and I named the people whom I considered to be responsible.  As a result, I discovered that on two nights a week this particular telephonist was on duty on his own.  I arranged with Deputy Cunningham that on a number of occasions I would ring him, that I would spin him stories that were completely untrue but that I knew would be controversial, and that I would wait and see.</P>
    <P>I remember Wednesday morning, 10th May, 1972.  It was the day on which the referendum on our entry into Europe was being held.  I travelled to Deputy Cunningham's house, arranged with him that one hour later I would telephone him from my own business to arrange with him what I would say.  One hour later I made this phone call.  We had a long conversation and I was very interested when, on the next day, at the count on the referendum, I listened to part of that conversation being publicly repeated by no less a person than the Independent Deputy for North-East Donegal. Part of this conversation dealt with a Mr. Patterson, an independent member of Donegal County Council and who happens to be a Presbyterian.  I told Deputy Cunningham that I had instructions from the then Taoiseach to bring Councillor Patterson into the Fianna Fáil Party and that he was to be a candidate in the next election. There was no truth in this and Mr. Patterson knew nothing about it. However, five days later, Mr. Patterson had this story repeated to <Col N="356" /> him.  He was told that he was joining Fianna Fáil and that he was to be the candidate in the next election.  The person who told him this was a councillor&mdash;Harry Blaney.  When I made that phone call, the postmaster in Letterkenny was aware of it.  Early the next morning he checked to see if the necessary ticket was written by the telephonist.  Being a trunk call, it was necessary for the telephonist to write down my number, to write down Deputy Cunningham's number and also the time of the call and the appropriate charge.  He did not write the ticket.  Apparently, he was advised that if there was a leak it could not be traced.  We then decided to make another call.</P>
    <P>On the morning of 3rd June&mdash;about 1 or 1.30 a.m.&mdash;another call was made.  Again, it was discovered that there was no charge and that the telephonist did not write a ticket.  The Post Office investigator arrived on the scene.  Early one morning, in June, 1972, he interviewed the telephonist in the post office in Letterkenny.  The telephonist signed a statement admitting that he had passed information on numerous occasions which he had got from telephone conversations that I had with Deputy Cunningham.  He admitted that on a number of occasions he had tuned a third party on to the switchboard, to enable him to listen to our conversations.  He admitted that one of the people responsible for persuading him to commit this foul deed was Councillor Blaney, brother of the Independent Deputy for North-East Donegal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have, naturally a deep interest in this matter because I believe it was the first occasion in the last century that such a case was taken.  This a tribute to the Post Office service.  The integrity of the Post Office service did not take into account the ruggedness of Donegal politics.</P>
      <P>I am also convinced that another conversation I had was passed on. That conversation was made on a night that this particular telephonist was not on duty.  While the postal authorities did everything in their power to investigate the matter, the bubble had burst and the second telephonist escaped the net.  Nevertheless, it appears to me that there is at least one telephonist in Donegal in the employment of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who, in the past, committed a serious breach of the regulations and who passed on information. The Minister should take steps to ensure&mdash;I realise it is very difficult&mdash;that there will never be a repetition of this sort of business in any part of this country.</P>

    <P>Perhaps, it could not happen in other parts of Ireland because there <Col N="359" /> is only one Deputy Blaney and he has only one constituency to concern himself about.

      <P>In dealing with such an important Bill which comes before us today, having such a sum of money in its context of £175 million, one could be a bit caustic and say: &ldquo;Here we are, almost 50 years after the first Telephone Capital Act of 1924 finding ourselves at the bottom of the EEC countries as regards phone density.  It would be futile to examine the past activities of any Department or Minister to see how this happened. We must accept that we are late starters in the telephone communication field in Europe.  It would be far better to face up to the long haul that lies ahead of us in regard to putting this country on a standard with the EEC countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is somewhat chastening to find that at the end of this five-year programme we will still be the bottom country in the EC as regards telephone density.  The protected figure is about 19 per cent, which figure is applicable within France at the moment.  That gives an indication, even with the expenditure of the type <Col N="360" /> of money that we are talking about of the haul that lies ahead of us.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the extent and the quality of a nation's phone service is a very reasonable index of the state of the nation's economic and social welfare.  The stage which we are today enabling the raising of a sum of £175 million is the easiest stage in the programme.  Assuming that the Minister will be able to raise this money and allocate it as envisaged, it will be essential that we have the &ldquo;back-up&rdquo; forces taking over when we come to spend this money. Sites will have to be acquired and new buildings provided.  There will have to be a plentiful and timely ordering of the plant and equipment needed.  It would help us to tie in with the Minister's encouraging note as regards the programme that lies ahead if he would give us some indication as regards what the investment rate per annum over the coming five years could be.  I do not think we want to find ourselves in the terrible dilemma of having a very slow attitude towards the programme for the first two or three years, in which time we would have to take all the necessary steps to find plant, material, equipment and the necessary sites.  If we had a fairly even scale of momentum during the programme it would leave us all happier in commending this Bill which is before us today.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the telephone service is a good business proposition.  It is a profitable service. The question of dealing with the arrears of telephone connections that lie on the Department's tables at this moment is important.  It is one way of bringing additional funds into central funds, apart from the social benefits that the clearing of arrears will mean. Again, I would like if we could have some indication from the Minister if he can answer it&mdash;although it may be a 60 dollar question, or a &ldquo;chestnut&rdquo; question to him&mdash;as to when we could expect to see the heavy backlog of arrears brought down to a nominal level, which level we would like to see maintained for the future.  We would all hope that we have seen an end to <Col N="361" /> the very old and bad incidence of having two or two-and-a-half years of a delay between the time a person makes an application for a telephone and it is installed.</P>
    <P>Some comments have already been made as to whether there should be a semi-State authority or some form of an agency looking after the future of the telephone service.  Some people seem to think that because of the vast number of people employed in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the amount of moneys that will be allocated to telephones in the years to come these are ready-made criteria for a semi-State concern.  There are other criteria as well.  The most important is that of the quality and extent of the service that can be given to people.  There is no point in having a telephone in every house in the country if the quality of that service and the quality of the phones are not what they should be.  A very important criterion in determining whether a semi-State or any form of agency should look after the future telephone service instead of the Department should be the quality of the service.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not referred to a point on which he invited comment in the other House, namely, the allocation of telephone kiosks in rural areas. There the Minister gave the guidelines on which kiosks were allocated and mentioned that they were expected to pay their way or otherwise they should be a replacement of a sub-post office callbox.  With all respect to his Department, I should like him to parallel their approach in this matter to that of the ESB who have always looked upon the provision of a supply and service in rural areas as something which urban consumers should, through their contribution, assist and subsidise.  In rural areas we are dealing with people who may be living far apart, which leads to the greater need for a telephone service.  Again, we must accept that there are not too many sub-post offices around the country.  This is an historical incidence and with rural development nowadays, the people in these areas need the same access to phones as urban people.  I would ask the Minister <Col N="362" /> and his Department to be a little bit more flexible in the future on this point.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil the Minister mentioned the return on capital invested in the Post Office service over previous years.  Is the Minister satisfied with this?  It has deteriorated in the past couple of years.  Perhaps if we had some comparative figures for the EEC countries, on whose level we are trying to place ourselves, we would be in a better position to say whether we are satisfied with the return on the capital invested in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I sympathise with the problems of the Minister who has to deal with the clear imperfections in our telephone service.  I wish him every success in his attempts to improve, up-grade and modernise our telephones.  I wish to make a few points in connection with the expenditure.  We are talking about a figure of £175 million to be spent, or giving permission for that expenditure over a certain period of years.  I realise that the bulk of the expenditure will be spent on the basics, increasing the number of lines to subscribers, increasing the size of the exchanges and generally increasing what everybody realises to be the basic links between the subscriber and exchange.  Perhaps the Minister could say something more about the more esoteric side of the telephone service&mdash;about the satellite system.</P>
      <P>I know that we have an investment in the system operating from Cornwall. Perhaps the Minister could give us an indication of the size of our stake in that and whether he intends to increase it.  It is obviously an important piece of technology.  I would also like to know something about the microwave systems which are now part of modern telephone technology. What is our stake in microwave systems?  What is the proportion of our total telephone link which comes under the microwave heading?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are clearly in an age in which technology is advancing at a tremendous rate.  I should like to ask the Minister about the planning section in his Department.  I realise that to <Col N="363" /> have a modern telephone service one wants to employ engineers.  It is not enough to have engineers.  With the microwave technology and the other technologies of telecommunications, physicists should be employed.  I would also urge that in a planning department the Minister should include some operational research experts. These would be mathematicians because if we are to have a system which will withstand the test of time and which will meet the needs of this part of the 20th century, the whole planning of our telephone system will need to be most carefully thought out.</P>
    <P>When one is placing contracts worth several millions of pounds one clearly needs to weigh the various tenders very carefully.  With these highly complex pieces of modern technology, it is absolutely essential that an efficient, tried and tested scientific way of sizing up the various types of technology that one will use in our telephone system will be brought into play.  When the Minister is replying I should like him to mention the strength of the planning department in the telephone service at present and how he intends to develop it.  It is not sufficient to have a small planning unit.  One needs to plan the planners as well.</P>
    <P>When our telephone service is being expanded I hope a good deal of attention will be paid to its flexibility.  Many of the private institutions which have their own telephone exchanges put out tenders ten or 15 years ago for their private exchanges.  They got in various quotations and now find that after ten years or 15 years of service their system is inflexible, is incapable of being repaired beyond a certain stage and is incapable of expansion. Some more careful forward thinking when the contracts are being placed and when the tenders are being evaluated would help to get over these problems.  Of course one cannot say what new technologies will occur in telecommunications in the eighties or the nineties but, by having a planning department which has properly qualified people who are graduates from <Col N="364" /> these areas and from the other areas of science and technology which are needed to plan the telephone service, at least we will be able to ensure that the money which we are spending now will not be good money wasted after bad money but will be money which will develop a service with the flexibility and the potential to deal with our population and to deal with the increasing demand which is being made on the service.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to mention, as other speakers have mentioned here and in the other House, that the installation of telephone systems in rural areas is a most important part of the telephone service.  The provision of these services at reasonable costs in the rural and farming communities is a very important subsidy for our farmers and for our rural community as a whole.  The modern farmer must have a telephone if he is to farm efficiently.  He needs to be in constant contact with suppliers of machinery and goods, with veterinary surgeons and so forth, and it is essential that the telephone service in the rural areas be greatly expanded and improved.</P>
    <P>One other point which is of particular interest to people living in the cities is that on one stretch of road one can observe the ESB digging the road up one week and covering it up when they have finished their work; then the corporation come along with their sewerage contractors who dig it up and cover it up and a few months later in come the telephone people who dig the road up and cover it up again.  Could the Minister not form an <i>ad hoc</i> group with the other groups that are involved in this activity?  It need not be an official committee but could be a liaison group which would ensure that when a large road scheme is going on in a suburban area the various groups who are planning to lay cables in that area in the future have a chance to do it all at the one time.  This would save us this constant digging up of roads in suburban areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two important points that I wish to make. The first one is about uniformity of <Col N="365" /> service.  As someone who comes from an area that is very poorly serviced as regards telephone service, I note that if I go into a kiosk in Dublin and call my own exchange area I find that I can get through to the number in less than five minutes.  If I went to book the same call from the other end I would be waiting a half hour or perhaps two hours for the call.  I find this very hard to understand but perhaps there is some explanation for it.  The people in County Leitrim, County Cavan or in the west pay telephone charges at the same rate&mdash;in fact it costs them more to have the service installed&mdash;and some uniformity of service should be introduced as soon as possible.  There are enough disadvantages already in living and working in some of the underdeveloped areas without having this disadvantage.  The telephone service should be operated on a more uniform basis.</P>
      <P>I have little reason to complain about the efficiency of the staff of the telephone service.  However, sometimes at night-time I have known people who have had occasion to ring an exchange for ten to 15 minutes continuously without getting a reply. This is unfortunate but I have no experience of it during normal working hours; in these hours I find the telephone staffs are overworked and very often frustrated.  At night-time a different attitude seems to prevail and I should like the Minister to take note of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the extra money should be channelled into the education of people in the proper use of the telephone service.  In rural areas, where the service is very limited and a kiosk has to service a large number of people, I have seen farmers in the height of the busy season sitting outside the telephone kiosk while some young person was inside the kiosk discussing the dances, the weather or some other triviality with somebody nearby, callously and inconsiderately holding up and wasting the time of a person who needed the telephone service badly.  I never recall seeing any notice in a public phone from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="366" /> reminding people of their obligation to be considerate of other people's needs in their use of the telephone.  If this were done effectively it could reduce the work load on our telephone service by 30 per cent or 40 per cent.  Indeed, I am sure much of the time spent talking on telephones is spent wastefully and inconsiderately.  I do not know what can be done about this problem but it is most important that we should educate people to realise that when the service is not adequate to the needs they should get their business done in the very shortest amount of time.</P>
    <P>I have often stood in offices where the phone rang and rang while people who should have answered the phone stayed at their desks.  Eventually they answered the telephone in a very dilatory manner.  This is ridiculous. The public are not sufficiently aware of the situation.  In my area, I have known businessmen who have had to wait for four hours before they could get a call through to Dublin.  I do not mind if we are unable to provide sufficient finance to speed up this, but it does annoy me very much to think that inconsiderate people are taking up lines and wasting the time of operators on unimportant discussions.  This is the most important point I wish to make and I would ask the Minister to use some money to educate the public in the considerate use of telephones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With other speakers I welcome an opportunity of making a few remarks on this new allocation of moneys which are so badly needed if we are to have an improved telephone service.  The telephone service has expanded enormously over the years.  We will have a continuation of this increase in demand for service. If we are to have the service which the people expect, naturally enough, more moneys are needed and new techniques and skills must be availed of.  All these things cost money and the only way to get this money is to raise the capital for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal for a few moments with the need in the rural community for an improved telephone <Col N="367" /> service and, in particular, for an improvement in the provision of telephone kiosks.  I realise all the problems associated with the expansion of any service and the improvement of existing services.  However, more and more pressures will be put on the Minister and his Department for the provision of additional kiosks throughout rural Ireland.  We are in the midst of a power crisis and people will be demanding a service that will save fuel.  The telephone kiosks located at, perhaps, crossroads or in small villages will lead to a saving in fuel.  We are all aware of the needs of the community at present.  The Minister and his secretarial staff are fully aware of the pressures that are being brought to bear on them to have kiosks provided throughout the country.  I am sure the Minister will see to it that more kiosks are provided in rural areas.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that farming is now a business.  It is no longer just a way of life and every farmer and rural dweller wants to operate as speedily and as efficiently as possible. Because farmers must be in direct and speedy communication with their veterinary office, their artificial insemination centre, their doctor, their merchants and suppliers, their workers, or anybody else they may need from time to time they need a telephone service and they need it to be as efficient as possible.  The telephone kiosk is one service that is used by every section of the community.  Nothing frustrates me more than when the Minister's staff make a report on the needs of an area and say there is no need for a telephone in that particular area.  There is need for further investigation into all applications for the provision of kiosks in rural areas.  Many people cannot afford to pay the rental for a private line and it is, therefore, a social service.  Somebody who is old, infirm or sick could not be expected to pay a continuing rental for a private line; the best service for such people is a telephone kiosk.</P>
    <P>With regard to vandalism and the damage that is being done to kiosks <Col N="368" /> I would make one suggestion.  The Minister and his officials should try to erect kiosks in positions where they would be in constant view of the general public, under public lighting, near a shop, or a publichouse.  I would even go so far as to say that they should be placed as near as possible to private houses so as to curb the activities of the vandals.  We are all anxious to curb vandalism.  I remember one Sunday in Dublin when I wanted to make a call home.  I tried six kiosks and the mechanism of each was badly damaged.  The Department cannot be expected to prevent that but we need more civic-minded people who will look on the service as being vital to the well-being of our community. We should also bear in mind the cost each year of repairing telephone kiosks damaged by vandals.  I do not know what this amounts to but the Minister knows.</P>
    <P>The trend of events in recent weeks and days should induce the Minister to secure an improvement in the telephone service in rural areas.  Particularly so in regard to the establishment of more kiosks in view of the threatened fuel shortage and the likelihood that we are likely to have it for many years to come.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's &ldquo;feeler&rdquo; as to whether the operations of his Department could be better carried out by a semi-State body or by private enterprise, I believe that the telephone network throughout the country could be more efficiently supervised and new services installed under a contract system.  When I say that, I must also bear in mind that the present system is a wonderful source of employment. We know that if the private contractor were brought in, those 23,000 people might find their jobs in jeopardy. Therefore, we must live with the present system for many years to come. The onus is on all of us to submit our views and opinions so as to help in the provision of the best possible service.  I know that the installation of telephones could be done more speedily and more efficiently by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Again, dealing with the provision of new services in rural areas, I feel that <Col N="369" /> there should be greater liaison between the exchange areas.  I live in an area where I have a telephone service from one exchange and my three neighbours have a service from three other exchanges.  About 25 miles of poles are involved, whereas one line of poles would have been sufficient.  I brought this to the attention of the engineers many years ago but they just would not listen.  Some economies could be made in that respect.  When an area is being served, the greatest possible use should be made of the lines already in the area.</P>
    <P>When people are paying a high rental they are entitled to a better service.  We are all fully aware that at present one can pick up the telephone, dial a number and be connected directly to two people having a conversation.  I am not referring to tapping or anything of that sort. It often happens that when you try to dial somebody you may cut in on a direct conversation between two people.  I know this is a highly technical problem but it is one that I know the Minister and his Department will look into.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is anything more that one can say, except that we must continue to provide a better service.  There will be a continued demand for this service and with continually mounting costs I doubt if the Minister will achieve his targets with the capital available to him.  I hope he will succeed because it is one service that we all want to see improved; it is a necessary service and it will be availed of more and more as the years go by.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support and welcome this major development aimed at improving our telephone service and bringing it up to European standards.  We are all conscious of the short-comings of the existing service.  It is no secret that foreign industrialists and tourists, <i>et cetera</i>, have been highly critical of the service. They have been critical to such a degree that damage has been done to the further expansion of both industry and tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, his officials and his <Col N="370" /> technical staff have the goodwill and endorsement of both Houses in regard to the further development of the telephone service.  There is, however, a matter of priority the Department should bear in mind.  We can look at the existing service under three headings.  We have areas of reasonable telephone service, we have areas of very limited telephone service and we have very substantial areas in the west where there is no telephone service at all.  The presence or absence of a telephone service could be the link between life or death from the point of view of summoning medical aid.  Heavy expenditure and major development should not be concentrated in areas of high population density where the same human aspect. the same absence of amenities and the same need for development are not as great as they are in areas in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the Gap of Dunloe there is a substantial population with no easy access to doctor, ambulance or priest. There are hundreds of such areas scattered around the west.  With this proposed development now this should be the last occasion on which any Senator or Deputy should have to raise this matter.  The Department planners and technicians should ensure that the priorities are such that. in addition to the provision of a good service, human suffering and the provision of amenities are taken into account.  If this is done we will have more tourism and more industry in the West of Ireland.  In this spreadout I appeal to the Minister not to leave the inaccessible areas to the last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last speaker concerning the concentration of moneys in those areas most in need.  I know people in the west who have been waiting seven years for telephones.  It is not the fault of the present Minister and neither was it the fault of his predecessor, that moneys could not be found to provide a proper service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in agricultural areas in the west who are in great need of a telephone to operate their business should get priority, particularly those who <Col N="371" /> have been waiting five, six and seven years for this service.</P>
    <P>In the smaller towns, such as Athenry, where I live there is a particular example.  This is a town approximately 12 miles from Galway city.  There are a great many business people living there.  They have to wait one hour and, in rush hours, up to two hours to get a call through to Dublin, Galway or any other area in Ireland.  It is not the fault of the staff in the post office.  They have not got sufficient lines from the town.  I know businessmen who have to depend on minutes to get business.  This is a serious matter.  It is one to which I should like the Minister to give top priority.  Other towns have a similar problem and need help urgently. One could spend a whole day citing examples.  I appeal to the Minister to give special consideration to towns such as Athenry.</P>

      <P>I am in the curious paradoxical position of welcoming the quick investment of capital in the telephone business while personally regretting that the damn thing was ever invented because of the misery it can inflict. Somebody described the telephone to me as a mechanical Jehovah's witness which keeps on ringing and refuses to stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I welcome the Bill and share the view expressed by the last speaker, and by the Minister in his opening speech, that from the point of view of the economic development of the country the investment of capital in this type of communication could not be exaggerated.  With regard to the speaker who suggested there might be some loss of employment resulting from a hiving-off operation, if it were true that there were too many people employed this would be the worst area <Col N="372" /> in which to have such a situation.  It would be the worst area in which to impose an inefficient structure.</P>
    <P>Progress is made possible by the efficiency of our telephone system and its economic viability.  This is likely to generate a great deal of employment. It is rather analogous to the mistaken protection policy which was once imposed and which protected the production of the raw material for another industry which was also protected. This had the effect of making the second industry which was using the raw material more inefficiently than it would have been.  It may be, in a curious way, analogous to the effect of the export tax relief at the moment which encourages the exporters of products which are raw materials for other Irish industries.  It thereby makes it more difficult for the home industries requiring these raw materials to do well.</P>
    <P>With regard to this question, my judgment for what it is worth&mdash;and I do not know anything like enough about it for my judgment to be anything other than a tentative one&mdash;is that the telephone service ought to be hived off.  Later I shall raise the question as to whether it should be a semi-State body or one in which the State participates.  I should say at this stage that any remark I might make with regard to the recommendation of that proposal must not be taken to reflect on the competency of the people who are concerned with the administration of the telephone service at the moment.  The whole question of the administration within the Department is not one for the Department. It is one for the Government, and to a degree one understands that this problem of people who are policy-makers being involved constantly in administrative decisions is being experimented with at the moment in various Departments under the Aireacht concept.  What I say with regard to the performance of the telephone system does not necessarily mean I am criticising the personnel involved in that.  In a moment I shall give other reasons.</P>
    <P>The figure of the approximate return of 6 per cent on capital seems <Col N="373" /> to be absolutely miserable.  If I understand the figures correctly and if I am seeing the gross return without provision for the cost of the money that is borrowed, at the moment it is costing the State over 11 per cent to borrow the money.  It does not appear to be good finance to borrow at 11 per cent and so invest it that you get only a 6 per cent return.  There is something wrong with the institution which so uses that money in what is frankly and admittedly a profitable business so that it can get only a 6 per cent return on money costing 11 per cent.  If it were a credit business it would be bankrupt in a very short time, and without the backing of a State guarantor it could not get the money from financiers.</P>
    <P>If there is not a first charge of the cost of the money which is used in arriving at the 6 per cent figure, which is I believe the figure the Minister gave in the Dáil, we must realise that the percentage figure we are given is a before tax figure so that we are not even getting what would be the after tax returns.  What kind of a dividend could you declare out of a 3 per cent return in a public company that would enable you to retain the confidence of the shareholders?  It seems to be a relevant fact to look at in considering whether the performance economically and financially justifies confidence in the continuation of the present system.</P>
    <P>The strongest argument for hiving off seems to be the account the Minister frankly gave us of the stop-go position imposed on the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in 1969-70.  This stop-go position was, I understand, imposed at an early stage in our history also.  It is entirely wrong that a concern involved in the term planning that this enormous capital calls for should be in such a position financially that considerations other than the financial performance of the business itself should affect the provision of capital to it.  It is quite obvious that we are cutting back capital expenditure at a time which may be justifiable in the particular circumstances &mdash;the Minister for Finance will tend to slash wherever he can get cuts <Col N="374" /> most conveniently&mdash;but if this were hived off he could not slash it.  One of the advantages of either a semi-State body or a public concern in which the State has an interest is that it can make arrangements internationally, and with the best advice in relation to these matters quite independently of the Minister for Finance.  His consent to the whole operation may have to be obtained if it is a semi-State body.  No concern of the sort and size of the telephone business can possibly lay out a plan for a development of the kind needed in this country for the economic and social progress it is desired to achieve without getting a capital commitment matching the projected cost of the development envisaged.</P>
    <P>Is it the only profitable infrastructure? It is a vital one and, as I understand it, a profitable one.  I listened to the Minister's speech on the Second Stage and I read carefully what he said in the Dáil.  I was looking to see if the Minister might have commented on whether there was any suggestion that, in regard to the costing and the performance of the telephone service itself, as distinct from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, any element of a social cost was being borne by the Department.  I do not think there is.  The reason why the return in capital is so inadequate may be the social consequence of the fact that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is involved and that it is a political decision as to whether or not telephone charges are raised.  This means that being a Department it is not able to make charges for its services which match the real cost of providing those services.  This is a further reason for hiving off.  I have no illusions at all that one necessarily finds a better economic performance in a capitalist concern than that provided by a semi-State body or a governmental service.  Not many of us have any illusions about it.  You get bureaucracies built up within private capital institutions just as costly and burdensome in determining what is the true return on the capital invested as you get within State bodies.  There is probably a spirit pervading the <Col N="375" /> whole field of public service which, because of its very nature, prevents achieving the best possible progress. If I may quote to the Minister the title of a book written in the 18th century, <i>Private Vices are Public Virtues.</i>  It may well be that this horrible moral fault of avarice can prove the best return in the exploitation of the capital which is to be exploited.</P>
    <P>There are differences in the quality of performance of the State bodies, but I shall not mention the names of any of them.  One does not get a sense of the people participating in a successful enterprise because they are burdened with carrying social costs, which means that they are not getting a true figure for their own satisfaction as to what their real performance is.  In so far as we impose on these bodies the performance of social duties, the State should pay for them so that the people in charge of them will know that the only test they can apply is that they are performing as well as their rivals would be in a private concern.</P>
    <P>This sense of participation in a successful enterprise is extremely important. I do not see how the people in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs can have that feeling in regard to the performance of the telephone services when they are doing this as only one of the many other public duties which they have to do.  They are not developing the kind of minds with regard to the exploitation of the capital&mdash;I am using that word deliberately&mdash;and getting the best possible return for the community out of it.  They are not even stimulated by the bruhaha and the publicity-seeking that can be seen going on in some State bodies.  It may be all right although it may not be very pleasant.  It seems to get people up early in the morning to rush around in circles when, perhaps, they might be much better in bed but, from the point of view of what they are doing with the money we are giving them to use, this seems to get them to do it better.</P>
    <P>The whole matter of raising capital is a highly sophisticated exercise. <Col N="376" /> There is a great deal of skill and expertise in this city with regard to this.  I am not at all satisfied that it is being used to the best advantage by the State.  It would be better used, if State bodies used this skill and went through the various merchant banks to get at international capital. They know how to get it and can organise international consortia for that purpose.</P>
    <P>A very important matter is the inevitable rigidities within the public service with regard to salary scales. I should like the Minister to give this figure, but I do not know if he can say what is the worth of the concern. We are going to spend £175 million over the next five years.  That is splendid: we have spent money in the past.  What is the value of what we have now?  It is a vital question if you are considering hiving it off to the public because it might be far beyond any capital that could possibly be raised.  I did not understand clearly if there is a provision for depreciation. I notice that there are annuities which are repaid but I do not know if these annuities have been charged in again. in discovering what the return from the capital may be.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some final point.  I have a prejudice in favour of the sort of mixed institution which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been mentioning in relation to another field, where the State joins with private enterprise.  Prejudices against that idea might be examined. The Government should remind itself that in every private enterprise producing £2,500 a year profit the Government gets 50 per cent of the profits, so that it is a partner in every private enterprise at the moment.  Therefore, it might sensibly consider whether all this capital would not be better administered by &ldquo;whiz kids&rdquo;, who overpay themselves and who manage to accumulate substantial capital.  In this kind of combination the State obviously must in this connection stay in the field because we are a monopoly element and if we are doing any hiving off to anything that any private people are engaged in, it could only be done on the basis of retaining the <Col N="377" /> substantial properties which the State holds.</P>

      <P>What strikes me about the Bill is the very concept of its enormity.  The Minister is to be congratulated for facing up realistically to what is an enormous problem in terms of capital and in terms of demand.  I am quite sure that he looked for much more than he has actually got.  The enormity of the expenditure is such that in terms of the proposed new subscriber lines it represents an increase of 140 per cent over what was accomplished during the last five years, in other words, in the next five years 240 per cent of the rate over the last five years. It is clear that the previous plan was grossly inadequate.  The waiting list at present represents 40 per cent of the amount of total installations in those five years.  That is sufficient in itself in terms of condemnation.  The reasons are, perhaps, political rather than technological.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We got a very entertaining&mdash;and I might say tantalising&mdash;account from Senator Lenihan in this debate as to the vagaries of Ministers for Finance, and I was wondering what distant echoes we were hearing of past battles, for the moment confined to secret Cabinet minutes and, indeed, the less secure secrets of interparty and internal party affairs.  The Minister has given us an assurance that what we are dealing with is £175 million in real terms, and not just in money terms.  That is important when one considers that under the previous plan I reckon it would cost about £470 to instal a line&mdash;that is taking the £37 million in 1968 for 78,000 lines.  We are now talking about a rate of £870 per line.  That gives us an idea of the cost in terms of inflation which we have to pay for not proceeding at a much more rapid rate, particularly <Col N="378" /> in the 1970-71 period.  We are now paying a loan for the existing service and are also paying enormously in terms of cost.</P>
    <P>The enormity of the Bill is what I find attractive.  Senator Russell raised the question of whether it is sufficient. If it is not sufficient there will be very few people who five years from now will be able to say to the Minister: &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo; When one looks at the figures one finds that even in terms of the real demand over the last five years, which is the rate of installation plus the existing waiting list, that is 112,000 lines, the Minister is planning for 190,000, that is 78,000 more over the next five years than the real, effective demand over the last five years.  He has accepted that the rate of increase is geometrical.  We cannot fault him in any regard in that respect.</P>
    <P>Lastly, there are four priorities I should like to see for the future development of the services.  First, I should like to see the maintenance of a minimum density per population throughout the country.  That would take account of many of the problems which were raised here by Senators from rural areas.  Secondly, the extension of the automatic exchange&mdash;the extension which has already taken place is to be welcomed; thirdly, the implementation of automatic international subscriber dialling and, lastly, the transference of the departmental functions to a semi-State body.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised a question to which he wanted some answers and indications.  Surely the function of a Department is administrative.  Here we are dealing with something that is technological and economic.  One expects any Minister of Posts and Telegraphs to be equipped with the technological, economic and administrative expertise to be the chief executive of an on-going company.  A Minister is a political figure.  We should not expect him to have these requirements. You might as well ask the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Transport and Power, to be more apt, to be the chief executive of the ESB, CIE or Aer Lingus and to have all the technical expertise at his <Col N="379" /> fingertips to take correct decisions.  I do not know of any other Minister with the responsibilities of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  He is expected to answer, for example, in the other House, immediately and directly for actions of his Department. A semi-State body, as Senator FitzGerald has said, would be more free in its own management processes, particularly with regard to the raising of loan finance and with adaptations towards new technologies.  More particularly, the semi-State body's chief executive would be free from political considerations, to which any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs must be prone particularly at Budget time. A better return in capital would be one of the benefits which would accrue from the change to a semi-State body.  I urge the Minister to stress to the Cabinet the necessity for establishing, consequent on this Bill, a new semi-State body for telecommunications.</P>

      <P>In common with the other speakers, I welcome this Bill. I should like to give my views on the establishment of a new body, if that is possible, to spend this money, be it a semi-State body, which I think would be a very interesting idea, or even, if possible, to hand it over largely to private enterprise.  The most important thing is to get the greatest benefit from the money being expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Department of Posts <Col N="380" /> and Telegraphs is a dreary, drab outfit.  There is a good case for taking the telephone system away from the Post Office end of the Department and having it entirely on its own. What strikes me most about the telephone service and the Post Office service in general is the dreariness and the drabness and the amount of red tape involved.  It would be wonderful if the telephone system broke out on its own like the ESB and instead of having it controlled from the local post office to have a show shop, something like what the ESB have in every principal town, where people could go and do their business.  The dreariness is dreadful, right down to the colour of the vans which operate around the country.  I would ask the Minister to spend some of this money on a coat of paint to brighten the whole thing up.</P>
    <P>Another thing that could be learned from the ESB is that they plan a campaign and inform the public in advance what to expect. They advertise in the local papers the areas that are to be visited and where they are to do rural electrification. They pick area by area.  We are inundated with requests for telephones and we, in turn pass them on to the Minister.  The whole thing just jams up the works.  It would be far more satisfactory if the Minister could explain where exactly they are working or are likely to be working for the next year or so.  We would then be in a better position to advise our constituents as to when they could expect to get service.  The ESB are quite good at this.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs slip up badly.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of red tape in the telephone application business. The application just about goes around the world.  First of all, if you have a main office in your town you fill in a form and you give it to your local postmaster.  He, in turn, sends it to the telephone branch here in Dublin. The telephone branch then send the application back to the engineering branch in the area and ask if this application can be dealt with without top much trouble.  When they have vetted the application they send it <Col N="381" /> back to the telephone branch.  Now, at this stage, if everything is in order, the telephone branch send an agreement to the postmaster who requests the applicant to come in and sign it. When that agreement is signed he then sends it back to Dublin.  Finally, if everything is all right Dublin advise the engineering branch to go ahead with the job.  That seems to be a very roundabout way to deal with a very simple thing like an application to instal a telephone.  I would suggest to the Minister that this type of thing should be streamlined.</P>
    <P>Senator West had a very valid point about the amount of liaison the telephone people have with the local authority, which must be almost nil in most cases.  I have seen this in my home town of Dungarvan over the last few years.  No sooner have the local authority provided a new road or especially a new footpath, which is a very expensive job, then the telephone people come along and break it up with, one would imagine, almost malicious delight.  It must be costing the taxpayers a considerable amount of money because they have got to replace those footpaths.  I would suggest to the Minister that the liaison between local authorities and his Department could be considerably improved.</P>
    <P>The question of rural kiosks was mentioned here today.  This is a big bone of contention between local representatives and the Department.  I do not believe the Department should look on every kiosk as a profit-making operation.  In rural areas you must give a concession.  You must be prepared to lose money in order to provide a service and there is a great demand in isolated rural areas for telephones.  They may not pay but they are vitally necessary.</P>
    <P>It is a bone of contention between local representatives and the Department. I do not believe the Department should see every kiosk as a profit-making operation.  In rural areas you must give a concession and must be prepared to lose money in order to provide a service.  There is a great demand in isolated rural areas for telephones at crossroads or some other central point.  They may not pay for <Col N="382" /> themselves but they are vitally necessary.</P>
    <P>We have had the luck in Dungarvan town and the mid-Waterford area of having the manual exchanges converted to automatic service.  This has been a considerable boon to the area. I suggest you note that the suicide rate has dropped considerably there since the frustration and frayed nerves that went with the manual system have gone and the automatic system is working wonderfully.  However, there are one or two matters I should like to point out as they may help in the future.  The planning of the new numbers, when an exchange is to be converted to automatic working, should be done years in advance.  At present we have the ridiculous situation that if you want to find a number in a neighbouring exchange area you have to get on to the inquiries section.  This must be creating an enormous amount of work in the exchange.  I suggest that the numbers be made out two or three years in advance and be placed in the telephone book previous to the exchange being converted.  I know we get a sheet of the new numbers but it only relates to the exchange in which you are situated.  I would suggest that all the numbers in the exchange area and in the neighbouring exchange areas be placed in the telephone book in advance.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to local directories.  Some chapters of the junior chambers of commerce have done very praiseworthy work in that they have made up local directories for the benefit of the public. However, there seems to be some objection to this from the Department. I do not know whether this stems from copyright considerations or whether the Department are afraid there are inaccuracies contained in the directories but this is a wonderful local service.  I know the Dungarvan Junior Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Department stating that under no circumstances were they to proceed with the printing of this directory.  If the Department do not wish the junior chambers of commerce to publish such a directory then the Department themselves should do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> Finally, I should like to ask the Minister if he has any intention of going underground?  I do not mean to be funny in saying that but is any of the £175 million pounds to be used to stop the countryside from being spoiled by overhead cables as it is at present?  This is more particularly obvious in the scenic areas where the population is sparse.  I know it is not economic to put wiring underground but lines of telephone poles and wires through scenic areas should be avoided if at all possible.  The Minister should use some initiative in this direction in order that we may keep our countryside beautiful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could let this opportunity pass without saying a few words about the inadequate telephone system that I have referred to here on several occasions during the last few years.  The last time I spoke about the Department of Social Welfare I said that there was only one thing in public life which annoyed me more than the Department of Social Welfare and its ineptitude and that was the emasculated telephone service which I had to use to try and contact the Department. Thankfully the situation in the Department of Social Welfare has shown a marked improvement in recent months and I hope that the introduction and passing of this Bill will bring about a marked change in the telephone service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a public representative in the Dublin area who is tempted to use the telephone extensively, there is not a day goes by when I do not curse Edison, Bell and Marconi and whoever else who was intelligent enough to invent the system.  I curse also their successors who were even more intelligent and perfected it and everyone here who has for the last 50 years made a marvellous job of imperfecting it to a glorious degree.  I have every sympathy with those people who have spoken so often about the difficulties encountered in obtaining ordinary telephone service in the Dublin area. I believe the real difficulty is that because the system is there one expects that it should work.  If there <Col N="384" /> was not a telephone system we would all be quite happy to communicate with each other by letter or verbally but because the telephone system is there we take up the instrument and expect that we should be able to get through to the person at the other end of the line.  Often this does not happen.  In this respect it is fair to mention that not only does this not happen in most parts of Dublin but one of the areas where it happens least of all is here in this House.  To try to make a telephone call from Leinster House to any other part of Dublin or to any public service or Government Department is one of the most trying occupations of public life.  At least 30 per cent of the time of any public representative in the Dublin area is spent on the telephone and about 90 per cent of that time is spent in trying to get through to the person at the other end.</P>
    <P>I find nothing more frustrating than having to ring a number in the Dublin city centre area or in the other Dublin exchanges.  I know this is not the fault of the present Minister or of the people who are immediately involved in the telephone system here. The improvement of the telephone service is quite a slow process because I appreciate that the placing of contracts involves a major amount of work and, I understand, each exchange is custom built to the requirements of the area for which the contract is placed.  For that reason it is a very lengthy process and a great deal of time elapses between the placing of the contract and the delivery and installation of equipment.</P>
    <P>I am interested&mdash;Senator Alexis FitzGerald referred to this also&mdash;in the Minister's remark about the stop-go policy which has so disrupted the development of the telephone service. I am particularly interested to hear him refer to a stop-go policy since approximately 1969 and 1970.  I think he is being more than charitable to his predecessors in that regard.  It is very well known both within and without the public service that the stop-go policy in relation to capital development, and the development of the telephone service in this country generally, has been a policy that has <Col N="385" /> been carried out over the last 12 years. It is a policy that has resulted not only in vastly overcrowded exchanges and in many thousands of subscribers seeking new outlets and connections but in the Post Office having extreme difficulty in maintaining a proper quota of skilled technical staff who can carry out the installations and provide proper maintenance of equipment over the years.  When there was a recession or a decision to cut back on capital expenditure in the telephone service, it meant that the number of people in skilled training was cut down and that a number of those in employment left and went into private industry or into such bodies as the ESB.</P>
    <P>It seems to be very important that not only should there be this vast sum of money expended but there should also be a development of a quite large skilled technical force and training school, which the Post Office have run so successfully, so as to provide an adequate number of trained technicians who would subsequently be employed at a rate attractive enough to keep them in the service.</P>
    <P>Every time part of the stop-go policy was implemented the number of such technicians decreased and when money was again provided to be spent on the telephone service, the skilled labour force was not available.  It is important that that aspect should be looked into.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to tell us when people who are connected to overcrowded exchanges in the Dublin area can expect any immediate improvement.  I know the length of time it takes to instal new equipment but I should like to know if subscribers can expect any immediate improvement in making local calls, and in the number of crossed lines and interference one experiences when using the telephone.  I heard Senator McGlinchey complain bitterly, and at length, in a very interesting way about the crossed lines one can get going through a manual exchange. One can pick up the telephone operating from an automatic exchange in Dublin and hear all sorts of conversations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> I remember one day in the House endeavouring, for about ten minutes, to make a 'phone call and every time I picked up the 'phone someone from the Department of External Affairs, as it was then, persisted in sending a telegram to embassies abroad.  I could not get anything else but the text of this telegram, in which I was not particularly interested.  I should like the Minister to tell us if we can hope for more privacy on the telephone.  I know a number of people who are not prepared any more to discuss matters of importance on the telephone, even through the automatic exchange system.</P>
    <P>Obviously the problems of the manual exchange are different.  Senator McGlinchey has explained this to us and I could not help thinking when listening to him that whatever his difficulties were with recent events which occurred in his constituency, what must the difficulties have been for the then Members of the Opposition for so long, when Senator McGlinchey was on more friendly terms with the person who apparently was involved in the operation.</P>
    <P>What were regarded as luxuries of yesterday are demanded as necessities by many people today.  While it was unusual 15 years ago for many people to have a private telephone it is now expected as a necessity of life rather than a luxury that a telephone should be installed in a private home. We are not in a position to supply all the telephones required for some years to come because of the vast backlog which has occurred.  It is obvious that the steps being taken are going to cure this problem, but they are long-term steps of necessity.  What the public want to know is whether in the meantime there can be any hope of improvement.</P>
    <P>The Minister in a brief way referred to the introduction of mobile automatic exchanges which could be used in a temporary capacity.  I should like him, when he is replying, to expand on that and explain if they could be introduced to relieve pressure in congested areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to be a little parochial for a moment and say, speaking from memory, about 18 months ago <Col N="387" /> an inordinately high proportion of the applications for service were from the County Dublin area.  I should like to ask if the number on the waiting list is still as high or if it has improved in any way.  I receive complaints from people from all over County Dublin who have applied for telephone service 18 months or two years ago.  All too often the reply is that they will have to wait for a considerably longer period.  The amount of development in County Dublin is extraordinarily high in relation to the rest of the country but surely the Department must have been aware of the extent of that development which has been going on over the past 12 years.  In that area of the country more than any other the capital development works of the Department have fallen further behind.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his speech that major capital work is being undertaken with the connection of subscribers from the Lucan/ Clondalkin area into a new exchange in Tallaght.  We are grateful for this, but there are many other areas in the county which are rapidly becoming at least as overloaded as the exchanges in the &ldquo;59&rdquo; digital areas.  I hope that urgent attention will be given to the needs of those areas also.</P>
    <P>Very rarely does one get an opportunity to praise people in the public service but I did recently.  In connection with the installation of those additional lines and the heavy duty cable required for the Tallaght exchange I had reason over the last few days to contact the section of the Department which is installing that cable.  Quite accidentally they had arrived with their major excavation machinery to the main street in Clondalkin to commence work during Christmas week.  They were engaged in digging up the street and, naturally, the local traders, and the residents, were very perturbed at this major upheaval of having to cope with a one-way street during Christmas week.  I contacted the Minister's Department and the Telecommunications Section dealt with the problem <Col N="388" /> efficiently and courteously.  They agreed, very readily, that they were creating a disturbance at such a busy time of the year in the centre of a commercial area and agreed to suspend their operations until after Christmas.  It is nice to see that behind the face of bureaucracy there are occasionally some human beings operating who appreciate other people's problems and try to help to solve them.  We ought to thank them.</P>
    <P>Finally, in company with the Minister, I am less than sure whether the activities of the Post Office should be transferred to a State or semi-State body.  I am not too happy about the accountability of some of these organisations, in their operations.  In such a major field as the telephone service, involving such major capital expenditure, one wonders whether this ought to be embarked upon.  Perhaps the Minister could explain to us when replying&mdash;I am afraid I am more ignorant about this than I should be &mdash;what strictures, if any, our membership of the European Community places on the hiving-off of the telephone service or any other aspect of the postal service to a State or semi-State body with a monopoly on the service.  I understood that the EEC imposed some restriction on the amount of hiving-off into monopoly situations which the State could carry out.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly welcome this Bill. Perhaps can we return to that Utopian situation where when one dials six digits the telephone bell rings at the other end.  This is not happening too often at present.  It is not the fault of the Minister.  I am not asking him to apologise for the sins of his predecessors.  I am just asking him to explain how quickly he intends to bring the grace of God down on all our souls in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. The Minister, however, will have to consider the lines on which telephonic development must proceed in this country if the people as a whole are to be equally and justly served by that useful service.  It is not always as useful as it might be in some areas having regard to the expenditure and <Col N="389" /> the facilities which are at the disposal of the Department.  Those living in the cities and towns have had a definite advantage over the rural dweller in regard to telephonic communication. It is possible to have to travel four or five miles in rural areas to the nearest telephone.  In such areas many people would like to instal phones.  The telephone is a valuable means of enabling people to transact their business economically. When a person in a rural area wishes to instal a telephone he is first asked: &ldquo;What is the distance from the nearest exchange?&rdquo;  It may be three or four miles and this makes the installation more expensive.  The applicant is told he must pay four or five years' rental in advance.  Otherwise the Post Office cannot take the risk of an installation of this kind as they could suffer a loss.  The applicant for the telephone on receiving the estimate of the cost of installation is faced with a bill of from £80 to £100. He is the pioneer of telephonic communication in that area, because before he made the effort to instal a telephone the inhabitants of that area had to travel up to three miles to the nearest telephone.  This man's neighbours will come night, noon and morning to make calls on his telephone. These calls will be available if he is in connection with an office where service is provided around the clock.  If not, it will be available up to a certain hour.  These people will still have to depend on a day's service from the rural post office which is serving this area.  This man has had to pay £80 to £100 in advance and also has to oblige all his neighbours.</P>
      <P>The Minister might consider having a telephone installed at a local centre, perhaps near a school, a small country shop, or where people congregate for meetings.  The person who would utilise it for his business could pay a reasonable rent appropriate to the connection distance.  If that were the case more people would get connections off this line and the difficulty at present experienced by rural dwellers would be eliminated in a reasonably short time.  People would have the facility without being fleeced of a considerable sum beforehand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> Another anomaly exists in the telephone service in my home town of Granard, which has a population of 1,500.  The telephone engineers brought a line to Granard from Mullingar for an automatic system.  In the course of the laying of the line they installed an electrical telephone appliance at the rere of the post office which is to be called into use as soon as the Post Office people decide to make Granard telephone exchange automatic.  There is only a wall between and the lines to Cavan are passing the front door.  A new footpath was dug up and had to be replaced at the taxpayers' expense, just as Senator Deasy described.  Until very recently a very difficult situation obtained with nine small local post offices coming through Granard, all trying to get in contact through the trunk line in Mullingar.  I should like to thank the Minister for having eased that situation but nevertheless it is an anomaly that should not exist.  The people in the sub-post office in Granard are most anxious that that should be redressed and I would ask the Minister to do so as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A different situation exists in relation to telephone communications in the rural areas as compared with the city.  Comparisons have been made here with the ESB.  The telephone service in rural areas is very important for doing business.  Lines of electrical services were provided in rural areas and people were invited to make connections.  I accept that the Minister is overwhelmed with applications for connections and that many of these are from people in urban areas.</P>
    <P>While I agree with what Senator Boland said about the difficulties involved in installing underground cables to certain new exchanges, I would welcome the development of an extensive installation of telephone services in the rural areas.  Rural Ireland is so far behind the cities and larger towns in telephone services that the Minister would need to, and I hope he will, devote his attention to using this money to bring telephone communications in rural areas into line with those in the cities and towns.  I hope he will do this as soon <Col N="391" /> as he can.  If he looks at the waiting list he will find out that the disadvantages I have outlined exist in the rural areas.  It would be an advantage to have proper telephone services in rural areas.  I should like to thank the Minister for the many improvements he has made with regard to telephone services in the area which I represent. I hope he will be successful in bringing this capital programme to a very successful conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Seanad for having fully debated and discussed the Second Stage of this important measure.  As Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I am grateful to Senators for the depth of their discussion.  This has now been discussed in all its Stages in Dáil Éireann and in its Second Stage in the Seanad and I may say there was remarkably little overlapping.  On the whole, Members of the Dáil and the Senators covered different areas. The discussions complemented one another and were certainly of value to me and to my Department, as they would be to any other Minister.</P>
      <P>In particular, the Seanad debate has been fuller and more helpful to my Department and to myself in relation to one important point, namely, whether the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should or should not evolve into a semi-State corporation. Very little about that question was said in the Dáil.  Deputies covered other areas in more detail but a number of Senators came in on this and, I think, something of a consensus was apparent among Senators in favour, though not without reservations and qualifications of some sort, of evolution towards a semi-State corporation.  I shall have to take that into account in balancing it along with various other indicators of what public opinion may be on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention the Government have just decided to set up a Post Office Users Council and I want their reaction on that.  Then I would have to discuss it with the staff organisations and the trade unions concerned, whose co-operation is absolutely <Col N="392" /> essential in the event of any such move being made.  I should like, while I am still under that head, to refer to one proposition made here which is that perhaps telephones could be separated from the remaining postal services and run by a State corporation, leaving the remainder of postal services to be run as at present. From initial soundings that is the least attractive proposition from the point of view of at least certain of the staff organisations concerned, and some of the most important ones. That, of course, is a very important factor.  It seems essentially to be a choice between continuing more or less as at present, possibly with the internal changes recommended in the Devlin Report, or proceeding in the direction of a semi-State operation for all the postal services.  I do not think they can be divided up.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan in his speech, to which I gave very careful attention, spoke of the danger of erosion in the sums committed here.  I thought he and some other Senators suggested that it might be difficult for us to provide these services in view of the difficult economic situation, particularly in the case of the difficult energy situation.  The main point to consider here is that we cannot afford not to deal with this problem. We cannot afford not to have enough improvements in the state of our communications because if we do we are going to cut ourselves off from the rest of Europe and accentuate the lag behind that we already have. The second point here, and it is a main point, is this is not a question where we are looking to the benevolence of the Minister for Finance or the long-suffering taxpayer.  Telephones are a profitable service and it should not be hard to raise capital for them.  I do not think it will be so hard.</P>
    <P>As regards energy prospects, this is a reason not for pulling in our horns in relation to telecommunications but, on the contrary, for pressing ahead with telecommunications development.  As far as we can extra polate from the present general situation, it looks as if it will be more <Col N="393" /> difficult and more expensive for business people to travel from one European capital to another and possibly even from centres in Ireland which are far apart.  That will become a more expensive operation and there will be a tendency for business to rely, not less, but more on that form of telecommunications of which the main specimen is the telephone, which is low in energy consumption and relatively cheap, as compared with carrying people around by aeroplane, or motorcar, or what have you.  Therefore, the energy shortage points in the direction of the necessity of making faster progress in this area even than we anticipated.</P>
    <P>As regards the erosion of the capital sum&mdash;£175 million&mdash;I should like to mention one point.  One Senator said he understood this as being £125 million including £50 million of the last Telephone Capital Act.  This is not the case.  The £175 million is in addition to the sum of £50 million included in the last Telephone Capital Act.  It is a large sum.  It may still not be enough for what we require to do in these five years.  If that should prove to be the case, then we would not hesitate to introduce a new Telephone Capital Bill, which we would have to do to complete such works before the end of this five-year period.</P>
    <P>I must take up another reference made by Senator Lenihan.  He referred to the loan of £7.5 million, which we have just got from the European Investment Bank for the present year, as being paltry and totally inadequate.  The Senator has a perfect right to apply any adjectives he thinks proper to a loan from the European Investment Bank.  However, as the responsible Minister, I must utterly reject his language here and the concept it represents.  Senator Russell dealt entirely accurately with this point.</P>
    <P>The position here is that the European Investment Bank has certain norms.  We belong to the bank and our representatives have approved these norms.  One of them is that the bank does not give more than 40 per cent of the annual cost of an ongoing project.  My Department's Estimate for the current year&mdash;<Col N="394" /> which was not, as has been pointed out, initially prepared by me&mdash;was for £19 million.  If the Senator looks at the figures, he will see that the sum provided is almost exactly 40 per cent of that and is, in fact, virtually the maximum that the EIB could have provided for us.  We will spend £25 million this year and we will have to look for a Supplementary Estimate to provide for that.  What we get is not what we are going to provide for, but on a basis of what we have allowed for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The burden of my complaint was that all we had was £7.25 million for the present year, until next March.  We have no indication of how that sum is to be raised to meet the sort of expenditure set out here in the Bill over the next five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator would allow me to complete my remarks.  The European Investment Bank has provided for the current year the maximum which it could have provided.  It cannot now be expected to extrapolate and provide a proportion of what we may be providing.  It has to go on what will be provided and we have good reason to hope that it will continue to provide on the basis which it has provided for this year, that is to say, approximately 40 per cent.  After that, it is up to us.  We know that whatever capital we provide, this project, as such, is approved by the European Investment Bank.  We do not have to go back each year and say: &ldquo;Telephone capital expenditure in Ireland is a good thing.&rdquo;  They know that already and we have a very good case in looking to them for that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that I owe it to our partners in the European Investment Bank to <Col N="395" /> say that I completely reject this language, that the loan is &ldquo;paltry and totally inadequate&rdquo;.  I also reject the suggestion that a big noise has been made about this loan.  The European Investment Bank people came here. They signed this agreement with the Minister for Finance.  They were well received here.  Their visit was well publicised by the media, without any notable manipulation or encouragement from anyone else.  This is entirely as it should be.  Was it expected that these gentlemen were to come here, negotiate this loan, and that nothing should be said about it? It is important that it should be said. It is important that these gentlemen should know that this loan was welcomed here and that more of the same in proportion to our increasing expenditure would be forthcoming in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will.  He used the description, &ldquo;paltry and totally inadequate&rdquo;.  It could only be related to what was forthcoming so far, because he has no basis on which to relate it to any future expenditure.</P>
      <P>We are spending £25 million in 1974-75 and we anticipate that the programme will work out at an average of around £38 million, approximately, for each of the four succeeding years.  If the Senator works out 40 per cent of that in relation to each year, he will see approximately what we will look for.  Senators will appreciate that the precise sum for each year is a matter for discussion with the Minister for Finance within the framework of this Bill.  We are very conscious, first of all, of the need to capture it and, secondly, what I would regard as the real possibility&mdash; I cannot confirm it as a probability, because it depends on others than ourselves&mdash;that approximately 40 per cent of that will be forthcoming from this source.  That is a very important stimulus to our endeavours here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested that the development fund of the EEC might contribute something in mitigation of our <Col N="396" /> repayment cost on this.  My Department would like to see this.  However, it is possible that the Minister for Finance may think that others have a greater claim on at least part of that. It is something that we would be looking into and trying to get, if we can, but I am not promising that we can.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell dealt, on the whole, with Senator Lenihan's points.  He made suggestions about decentralising my Department's activities.  I welcome his support for that idea.  It is something under study at present in my Department and I hope that we will make progress in that direction.  Such progress would be well worth while.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan spoke&mdash;I do not think he intended to speak quite as negatively as he sounded&mdash;of coming down to reality, of cutting down expenditure to an absolute minimum and of something he referred to as the region of luxuries.  We will certainly have to cut down on luxuries but anyone who thinks of the expansion and modernisation of the telephone as a luxury is very seriously mistaken and, if we fail to get the massive investment we require, we will have to cut down on many other things because we will be lagging behind economically. However, I welcome the point Senator Quinlan made about a continuing study team, detached from the executive and policy forming sides of the Department, looking at how the capital programme is going.  This is not an entirely new idea.  My Department during the last few years have made use of a number of consultant groups in various aspects of their work and there will be more, not less, use for this kind of study as the programme goes on.</P>
    <P>I do not know what to say about Senator McGlinchey's remarks.  In so far as these constituted a severe criticism of a Member of the House of the Oireachtas to which I belong, I can only say that I regret that the criticism was not made where the Deputy would have been in a position to reply to it because there is nobody here who can reply for him.  The matter was brought up in a rather contingent way in the Dáil and, no doubt, there will be some future <Col N="397" /> opportunity on which to raise it there.</P>
    <P>As far as demand dealing with confidentiality is concerned, there is no way of totally ensuring against what seems to have happened, at least in part of this case, that is to say, a breach of trust by an employee of the service.  Such breaches are very rare in the telephone service which is one with a high morale and a strict discipline and the Senator acknowledged that the one case concerning which clear evidence could be produced was properly dealt with.  That will continue to be the case.  Such leaks are rare but every telephone service experiences them.  The best remedy is the fullest possible automation and that is the way we are going.  The Senator may be assured that my Department are determined to deal effectively and, if necessary, severely with anyone who lapses from the strictest confidentiality required in manual exchanges.</P>
    <P>I want those Senators, who may be disappointed to find that I have not dealt as fully as I might have with their points, to know that their remarks will be very fully studied in my Department and taken into consideration there.  I will myself study them as I go over the report of the debate.</P>
    <P>Some miscellaneous points were raised.  Senator West raised the question of the State investment in the Goonhilly Earth Station.  That is of the the order of £250,000 and we are already getting development there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  It is a basic sum which makes us a member of the club and, when we get the data, as I indicated in my opening remarks, we may find it worthwhile at some point during the planning period to move over to an earth station of our own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point was made about the relatively low efficiency, particularly in some areas, of the service available at night.  There has been a problem there, a problem of recruitment and an unwillingness on the part of certain people, including most women operators, <Col N="398" /> to work at night.  It is an area where women are generally considered to be more efficient than men and their non-availability for this night service causes some difficulty.  I do not say that in criticism of the night staffs generally; many of them are highly efficient and devoted, but there is a difficulty in getting enough operatives.</P>
    <P>Senator McCartin also mentioned the question of education in the use of the telephone.  We are concerned with that problem and in the recent advertising programme we are trying to do something about it.  We agree that it could be developed.</P>
    <P>Senator Moynihan, Senator Killilea and others raised the point about giving priority to rural areas.  I take the point because I know to what extent development of industry and commerce in rural areas and, in particular, the more remote rural areas, depends on the telephone.  I know it has happened that business people from the Continent, or elsewhere, having looked at a given area, decided that the telephone service was not good enough and they could not operate.  I can certainly understand the concern of Senators on this point. To the extent possible, my Department will wish to give such priority as they can to the development of the telephone service in rural areas and particularly the more remote and disadvantaged rural areas.</P>
    <P>At the same time there is a question of balance.  All these problems hang together.  There is no value in improving the telephone facilities available in a given western area if, at the nearest main centre, the facilities are lagging behind.  The Dublin exchange is lagging behind at present. Continental business people coming into a western area do not care where the bottleneck is, whether it is in the west or in Dublin; all they want is to be able to get through to Düsseldorf, or wherever it is without too much delay.  The problem is an overall one but that does not mean that I underestimate it.</P>
    <P>I take particular note of Senator Alexis FitzGerald's important statement especially on the question of conversion into a semi-State corporation. His statement, together with <Col N="399" /> those of other Senators, will be very carefully considered in my Department. He made one rather philosophical observation.  He said that he regarded telephones as a misery.  I have good cause to agree with him. As in many other spheres of life, perhaps, telephones are a misery but without telephones, misery would only take on another form which might be more acute for the many concerns in which the Senator is interested.</P>
    <P>Several Senators referred to the question of social cost in the telephone service.  Some Senators asked whether there was such an element or whether it was an entirely economic or a commercial service.  It is essentially, but not exclusively a commercial service. It is a commercial service which has to carry&mdash;and this of course, is not unique&mdash;a certain burden of social cost or social contribution.  If it was left entirely to the unaided zeal of a commercial corporation, development in certain rural areas and in the west would be, for the time being, very considerably less.  If, at any point, we are to hand this over to a State corporation or any other such body the State would have, for social reasons, to find some way of underwriting these social costs in the more thinly populated area, which, of course, include such matters as the provision of kiosks in rural areas.  It is not exclusively that.  There is the point as to what extent local authorities give some help in such matters as guaranteeing the cost of kiosks, whether they could come in to a great extent, whether other State boards could come in to a greater extent.  Senator Moynihan mentioned the Dunloe question which is an area very difficult of access.  If my Department were to bring in a proper telephone service there, we would need to put in an extraordinarily high capital commitment per head.  I agree with the Senator that it should be done, but there is a question of how it should be done.</P>
    <P>Senator Halligan also made a very valuable contribution on the theme of turning the Post Office into a semi-State corporation, and his remarks also will be carefully studied.  He <Col N="400" /> made a valuable distinction between administrative and technological aspects of choice He made a very important statement when he said that Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs, including myself, have not been technologists.  It would be rather surprising if they turned out to be; it would be about the happiest coincidence on record if they were good technologists.  Of course, nothing is more dangerous than a Minister or other head of such an enterprise who has some smattering of the subject and inflicts half-baked ideas on everybody. If his ideas are not even half-baked he is not tempted to inflict them so widely.</P>
    <P>As I see it, this is the main advantages of the semi-State idea.  There can be a fan of confidence deliberately chosen&mdash;not emerging through the democratic system&mdash;for the special competences which can bring to bear a useful and effective scrutiny on the operations of the Post Office.  This could be a very valuable thing, not because there is any reflection to be made on either the administrative or technological servants of the Post Office, all of whom are of high competence working with exceptional devotion, but because we can all benefit from informed criticism being brought to bear by people who have a responsibility to exert such criticism on our efforts.  That is one of the reasons I lean in this direction, and I have been encouraged by this debate to do so.</P>
    <P>I have tried to cover the main points.  Perhaps I have gone on at too much length.  Those whose specific points have not been covered will find, I think that I have attempted to cover the main principle of them in my remarks, and individual points will be borne in mind by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say, lest there be any misunderstanding, that we welcome entirely the provision of £175 million, and would take the view that, over the next five years&mdash; and this is in accord with what the Minister said in his opening speech&mdash; it may be inadequate by reason of inflationary developments.  The Minister has given us an assurance that he will go back to the Minister for Finance.  My only remark in my Second Stage speech was that he may find this difficult as time goes on. Certainly, as far as investment is concerned, our approach is that we want more of this.  In my view the presentation has been inadequate.  I would regard the negotiations which have taken place heretofore between the Government and the European Investment Bank as being highly inadequate in regard to planning ahead for five-year development.  It was in that context and in no sense meaning any reflection on the European Investment Bank that I made the statement.  I would regard it from the point of view of proper budget and financial planning. It is highly inadequate&mdash;and to realise this does not require any engineering or technological expertise&mdash;that there should be presented here an enabling Bill providing £175 million over the next five years&mdash;and in all probability the cost will be much more by way of capital injection into the very desirable improvement in telephone services&mdash;without any forward planning other than a bald statement that it has gone to the European Investment Bank and that £7.5 million has been got for the current year that will end on 31st March.  Here we are, at the end of December, and there is no indication as to how the £175 million will be spent over the four succeeding years after next March, which is only three months away.  There is no indication of what type of upward progression the contribution from the European Investment Bank will take. In other works, there is no planning indication here from the Minister either in his Second Reading presentation or in his reply to the debate. There are no broad guidelines indicating the type of planning related to the capital expenditure that will take <Col N="402" /> place over the next five years.  All we have is a global statement that the £175 million, which we all agree should be allocated, may be inadequate over the next five years and that for this year, which will be ending on 31st March, we are getting a loan of £7.5 million from the European Bank.  The Minister said that he has no information on the point I made that there is provision for a rebate of 3 per cent from the Regional Development Fund if such a fund emerges. There does not appear to have been any thought given to that aspect either.</P>
      <P>If this is the sort of attitude involved generally in regard to our capital programme planning in the future and in regard to our applications to European institutions be they bank, loan or grant institutions, I can assure the Minister this country will not be taken very seriously.  It is totally wrong to work, in serious matters of this kind, on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  It should certainly appeal to the Minister, as an alleged socialist, that there should be proper forward planning in regard to capital financial investment.  The Minister complained about a stop-go approach in the past but this is certainly the essence of a stop-go approach because we have no indication here whatever, in either of the Minister's two statements, as to how over the next five years the £175 million will be expended and we have no indication from 31st March of what kind of rise or progressive rise in contribution from the European Investment Bank will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the European Investment Bank will be tied percentage-wise to what we vote.  Indeed, we have a strong case by reason of our special regional position, already agreed and under the criteria already adopted, where we do not have the internal resources to finance the infrastructural investment of the magnitude involved here and in other areas, for that percentage not being adhered to in our position. There is no indication here from the Minister as to what kind of forward planning is being engaged in by his Department.  It is very easy to throw out figures of £175 million and of <Col N="403" /> five years&mdash;we have often been accused of doing this in the past&mdash; but there is no point, if there is to be any real socialist planning in a major public sector area, in coming into this House and telling us that £175 million will be provided and spent over the next five years; that we have £7.5 million from the European Bank until 31st March next year; that we have no indication how we are to get the money for the four ensuing years. That is not forward planning and that is not the way this House should be treated.  I can understand the Bill being an enabling Bill but we might have received some indication, in either the Minister's first presentation or in his reply, about this very important aspect.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Senator Lenihan was listening or whether I was dreaming but my impression is that the Minister went to extraordinarily great trouble in his reply to the Second Reading debate to give the House precisely the information which Senator Lenihan, apparently, thinks was not given by the Minister.  I did not speak on the Second Stage of this Bill and I am glad to have the opportunity, having been provoked by Senator Lenihan, to say how much this House should appreciate the very full way in which the Minister dealt with the points raised during the Second Reading discussion.  Subject to correction, I believe the Minister very fully and very adequately gave the information and the projections which Senator Lenihan apparently missed.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryKenny" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Kenny) Henry Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objective of the Bill is to increase the statutory limit on borrowing by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The present limit as fixed by the Agricultural Credit Act, 1972 is £70 million.  I now propose to increase the limit to £120 million.</P>
      <P>I should like at the outset to review briefly the progress of the corporation and to outline the credit facilities which they offer to the agricultural industry.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation was one of the first public enterprises set up in this country.  Its history goes back to 1927 and in the meantime the corporation have played a notable part in promoting Irish agriculture.  The corporation's total investment in the industry now exceeds £65 million.</P>
      <P>The major expansion in the corporation's business took place during the past five years, due mainly to the improved prospects for agriculture in the European Economic Community. Total advances by the corporation increased from £6.0 million in 1968-69 to £29.0 million in 1972-73.  Business continues to increase in 1973-74 and their total advances for the year could rise to £50 million.</P>
      <P>It is a tribute to the initiative of the corporation and to public confidence in the company that the bulk of this recent expansion was financed from deposits from the public.  These deposits&mdash;which are guaranteed by the Minister for Finance&mdash;plus repayments on earlier loans financed the corporation's entire lending programme from 1968-69 to 1972-73.  To cope with the increase in advances this year the corporation recently got a short-term Exchequer loan of £8.0 million and they may have to borrow a further £8.0 million from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to the loans available. Farmers can get ACC loans for the <Col N="406" /> purchase of livestock, land purchase and improvement, erection of farm buildings and dwelling houses, and the purchase of farm machinery, seeds and fertilisers.  Livestock loans are the biggest single class of loan issued.  In 1972-73 they represented 42 per cent of total ACC advances.  The corporation also give loans to firms in the food processing industry and in this way contribute to the expansion and modernisation of creameries, meat factories and grain mills.</P>
    <P>Repayments generally take the form of equal half-yearly annuities.  The repayment period varies from the type of loan.  For example, the maximum period is five years for livestock loans. 15 years for loans for land purchase and improvement, 20 years for farm buildings and 35 years for farm dwellings. In addition the corporation give short-term loans to merchants to finance the supply of seeds and fertilisers at spring time and the purchase and storage of grain at harvest time.</P>
    <P>During the past year the corporation, as well as the commercial banks, took part in a temporary scheme of loans for farmers at subsidised interest rates. The object of the scheme was to help small farmers to increase their breeding stock in order to benefit from EEC membership.  The interest subsidy paid by the Exchequer was 4 per cent and total loans issued amounted to £4.0 million.  This scheme may be viewed as a forerunner to the EEC farm modernisation scheme under which development farmers may get interest subsidies towards approved farm investment.</P>
    <P>During the past year the ACC also became associated with the World Bank loan for livestock development.  This loan is channelled through the ACC for relending to farmers by the ACC and the commercial banks.  The World Bank contribution is £10 million and loans are available to farmers for long-term investment in livestock programmes. A preferential rate of interest is charged, 11¾ per cent at present, and the loans are repayable over 12 years.</P>
    <P>Clearly there has been a rapid increase in the volume and scope of ACC business.  It is likely that the demand for agricultural credit will continue to expand over the next few years.  Because <Col N="407" /> of better incomes farmers will themselves have more funds available for re-investment but they will still need considerable credit from sources such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>To finance an annual lending programme of £45-£50 million the corporation would have to borrow about £30 million each year: the balance comes from repayments on earlier loans.  ACC's total borrowings at present are near the permitted maximum of £70 million.  In the present Bill I propose to increase this maximum to £120 million.  Section 2 of the Bill makes this provision.</P>
    <P>Borrowings by the corporation may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  The maximum of such borrowings which the Minister can guarantee under existing legislation is £70 million.  To take account of the new borrowing limit, section 3 of the Bill empowers the Minister for Finance to guarantee ACC borrowings up to a maximum of £120 million.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 of the Bill relate to charging provisions which apply to lands offered as security for small loans.  These provisions were put into earlier Acts to speed up the issue of loans.  Existing provisions apply to loans up to a maximum of £2,000 which was fixed in 1965.  To allow for the decline in money values, I propose to increase this maximum to £10,000. Sections 4 and 5 make this change.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 6 of the Bill enables the corporation to make whatever changes are necessary in their memorandum and articles of association as a result of other clauses in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a further vote of confidence in the future of the agricultural industry.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a clear indication of the importance of agriculture to our entire economy. I also welcome the Parliamentary Secretary here.  Being a rural Deputy, he knows all the problems associated with the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable the ACC to have further lending <Col N="408" /> powers.  That is something we wholeheartedly agree to.  It also enables the farming community to equip themselves for the challenge of the future.  It is a challenge and I am convinced that if there is any section of our community to take up that challenge it is the farming community. They have proved that in the past. They have proved that whenever incentives are placed in their way they avail of them and the economy of the country profits as a result.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that this money is properly used.  We must also ensure that we get maximum return from it. Therefore, there must be some new thinking by the officers and the administrators of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  There is need for greater flexibility regarding security for moneys on loan.  There is greater need for simplification of the method adopted by the officers of the ACC in the processing of loans.  We all know from our experience as local representatives that many a good farmer lost the opportunity to prove his worth because, through some technicality, he failed to secure a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation or from any of the other lending agencies.  Perhaps the title to his holding was not in order and he was not the registered owner.  There is great need to overcome many of those minor defects in our legislation dealing with the entire activities of the ACC.  I know that it can be done and it must be done because each day and each week as we progress we realise more fully, especially in time of crisis, the importance of agriculture to our entire national economy.</P>
    <P>The ACC should make an effort to cut down on the high cost of administration. When I say administration I mean the administering of the entire services and activities of the ACC.  I do not know how much they spend on legal costs but I know they charge the borrower quite an amount for legal costs.  That is something that should be cut in some way or other.</P>
    <P>It often takes months, and sometimes years, to process a loan application and during all that time there is only one loser and that is the applicant who applied for the money in the <Col N="409" /> first instance.  Possibly he may have missed his opportunity through no fault of his own.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make some effort to simplify the processing methods adopted by the ACC.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to deal with is how much it costs to process each application.  From my experience of going into the ACC offices, I believe that the cost of processing each application it much higher than if the borrower borrowed from any other lending agency.  The ACC would do well to put into operation a system adopted by the banks.  Time is a very important factor at present and time is money in so far as the farming community are concerned.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to one statement in the Minister's speech.  He said that:</P>
    <P>Livestock loans are the biggest single class of loan issued.  In 1972-73 they represented 42 per cent of total ACC advances.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious reason for that. The greatest scourge confronting the agricultural community today is brucellosis.  Many farmers have had their entire herds wiped out and the compensation they received was never adequate.  As a result they had to secure loans from the ACC to enable them to restock and that accounts for the high percentage of borrowing by farmers for livestock during 1972-73. This is probably not the right time to state this but a fresh look must be taken at our entire brucellosis scheme. There is a loss to the country, to the taxpayer and the greatest loser is the farmer.  I have no doubt that this trend will be borne out again when the 1973-74 figures are available.  However, changes in the scheme are not the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>With regard to repayments generally the ACC should take into consideration cases of hardship.  I am again referring to the brucellosis scheme.  If a farmer goes into arrears over a period he becomes black listed and he will always have difficulty from then on in securing any further borrowings whether from the ACC or from the commercial banks or any <Col N="410" /> other banks.  There should be some machinery written into the various Acts which will allow a hardship clause to be implemented.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look at that aspect of the borrowing system.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the continuance of money being made available solely to farmers as they have proved time and again that they are creditworthy and are regarded throughout the country as a good risk.  If their land certificates are in order and available there is no greater way of guaranteeing repayments.</P>
    <P>Regarding people who are black listed by the ACC it is unfair that if a son of any such person should apply for a loan, he would be turned down because of the situation in relation to his father.  I would like to see that system abolished.  It can and should be done.  The young farmers of today are more inclined to work to a system and a farm programme and they should be given every assistance and not hampered.</P>
    <P>Most of this loan should be made available to farmers.  When I speak about farmers I do not mean businessmen who take up farming as a sideline. I am referring to people who farm for a living.  They should receive priority in the issue of any loan in the future.  Businessmen, <i>et cetera</i> can borrow money easily from the ACC but this body were set up in the first instance to assist farmers.  While it may be argued that there would be a quicker return from borrowers other than farmers, men who intend to live by farming should get priority.</P>
    <P>The fact that so much of the borrowing facilities are being availed of is an indication that the farmers have confidence not only in their own ability but in the future of agriculture and nothing should be left undone to help those people in furthering their efforts and, consequently, in assisting the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill and am glad that the ACC have the power to increase their borrowing power from £17 million to £120 million.  This vast improvement is necessary so that the full benefits for our agriculture in the EEC may be <Col N="411" /> obtained.  Unless we have the power to invest in farming we have no power to invest in the EEC and to gain the true benefits of our entry into the EEC.</P>
      <P>It is necessary now more than ever to pour finance into agriculture.  From the benefits of our investments in agriculture, every section of our people will profit in one way or another.  The purchase and increase of our livestock in agriculture is vital as by this we increase the volume of our beef and milk and of our exports to an extent never realised before our entry into the EEC.  We cannot do that unless our farmers are capable of borrowing money through the ACC. This investment is vital and necessary for the welfare of our country.</P>
      <P>It is also necessary for the development of the farms and the improvement of dwellings and farm buildings so that those living on the land can have a good life.  The drudgery of the past will be gone. We can give all credit to the Minister for allowing the increase in borrowing as that also allows the people to develop their farms properly.</P>
      <P>I should like to speak on the advice that should be given to those people who borrow from the ACC.  Often the loan granted is of no benefit to those granted it unless they obtain the proper advice I should like to ask the Minister what co-operation is there between the ACC and our advisory service.  This co-operation is necessary.  When a loan is granted is the adviser for the area in which the loan is given notified or is he asked for advice before the loan is granted? If he is not then the investment by the farmer is not properly carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in the Bill for investment in the creamery industry. I welcome this investment even though I have read elsewhere that this should not be done.  It is vital that substantial moneys should be loaned to the dairy industry because it is from that industry that we will gain almost all our benefits in agriculture. It is from the cow we get the beef and the milk.  In 1973 the total amount of milk received at the <Col N="412" /> creameries will be about 600 million gallons.  The value of that will be in the region of £130 million.  Of that £130 million, more than £70 million will be exported.  In any one's estimation this is a vital export which brings vital finance back into the country with the result that all sections of the community will benefit.  It does not stop at that.</P>
    <P>By 1980 it is estimated that 1,000 million gallons will be received at creameries in Ireland.  It is estimated that the value of that 1,000 million gallons will be in the region of £270 million.  We will probably use about £70 million of that produce at home and we will export £200 million.  We must encourage the ACC to invest in the dairy industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to make another remark about the dairy industry itself which employs thousands of people. One small section of it in the south of Ireland employs 1,500 people in a rural area.  By 1980 it is estimated that there will be over 2,000 people employed there.  However, it cannot carry on unless we invest and expand. Over the last number of years the industry has expanded enormously. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries paid a visit to dairying areas recently and he now realises what has been done.  He also realises what must be done, what investment must be put into the dairy industry and into the agricultural industry as a whole because the economy of this country is based on agriculture.</P>
    <P>I should also like to raise a number of points.  One deals with the purchase of land.  Has the ACC loan been increased from £2,000 to £10,000? How are applicants for these loans investigated?  Why are some people granted a loan and others are not?  I had a case recently where a person made an application for a loan of £10,000 to purchase land that was adjoining his own.  This person was turned down and I could see no reason why he should have been.  I asked for a reason but was refused.  I can understand this because it is confidential but in a case such as this I felt some indication should have been given, even in confidence, to me.  I felt it was a mistake and I asked the <Col N="413" /> applicant to appeal against the decision.  He appealed and I put in a word on his behalf but I got the same type of reply.  A Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas should be given some idea, in confidence, as to why that person was turned down.</P>
    <P>Loans are given for the purchase of seeds and fertilisers.  In 1974 there will be a substantial increase in the purchase of seeds and fertilisers.  It is estimated that there will be an increase of something between 33? per cent and 50 per cent in fertilisers.  I would ask that ACC take that into consideration and increase their loans by that amount.  If we cut back on loans for fertilisers and seeds then in all probability their use will be cut back substantially.  I am sure everybody realises that unless we use fertilisers and seeds we will not be able to produce the products we require.  The farmer, the economy and everybody will suffer.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to take up this matter with the ACC.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more co-operation between the ACC and the agricultural instructors.  I do not know how many times they meet or if the staff of the ACC know the advisers.  I hope they know each other and that they communicate with each other.  I hope also that when applications for loans are made some form is used to give all the information necessary. Members of the Dáil and Seanad are available to help&mdash;but often their advice is not taken.  I appeal to the ACC to listen to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and to see that something is done in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome the present Bill because anything that makes more capital available for agriculture is in the best interests of the country at the present time.  We read in the Bill itself that over the last few years the activities of the Agricultural Credit Corporation have expanded dramatically.  In fact, it is now beginning to fulfil the role of an agricultural credit bank.  It has been demonstrated how necessary and successful such a bank is in Holland and Denmark.  The dramatic increase in <Col N="414" /> advances in the last year means that the ACC is now lending up to £50 million a year.  That is very useful.  We have heard from the Minister that repayments and other sources finance about £20 million and it is necessary for the corporation to seek borrowing for £30 million.  If my calculations are correct, increasing the amount from the previous £70 million to £120 million is really going to cover only a two-year period, or perhaps less.  I am not objecting to that because it will give us a chance, at the end of that period, to review the situation again, and it is right and proper that we should be in a position to do that.</P>
      <P>In today's papers we read of the report by a committee set up by the Agricultural Institute, the IFA and some other bodies, about our future agricultural potential.  In that, they gave figures that tie in reasonably well with the figures we have before us. They made the recommendation that it is a reasonable and modest target for us to aim at over the next ten years in order to double our agricultural production.  That means an increase of about 7 per cent per annum compound rates on that.  That increase, which would have to be an increase in cow numbers, as the main producers in the field, can be seen to be attainable.</P>
      <P>In 1971-72 we had an increase of 7.8 per cent in cow numbers; in 1972-73 we had an increase of 11.2 per cent. which are both remarkable achievements. They show a great deal of confidence in the agricultural community and in the future prospects for agriculture. We must remember that the total we could get would not be more than about 20 per cent, which could not be attainable.  Last year's 11 per cent was, therefore, excellent and a target of 7 per cent over the next ten years is quite reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mind begins to boggle at the figures involved in such an expansion. The estimate made by this committee was that it would take £1,000 million. That puts the Telephone Capital Bill into the shade, and rightly so.  The sum of £1,000 million, or an investment of over £100 million per annum, must be set against the present net production <Col N="415" /> of agriculture, which is just short of £400 million.  In other words, we are asked to reinvest over 25 per cent of the present production.  That is a very heavy investment programme.  There is also a time lag while we wait for the results.  Obviously, the calf has to be retained to become the future cow, and the cow produces another calf.  It is only when that calf reaches maturity that the money begins to come in.  The time lag here is the most serious factor in it.  Consequently, it is there that the helping hand of the Agricultural Credit Corporation has to be extended and extended very dramatically.  The first years just have to be tided over.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we just could not possibly contemplate financing this expansion from external sources or from savings outside the agricultural community.  The largest proportion by far of the investment would have to come from the ploughed-back earnings of the agricultural community themselves.  This is where the role of the Agricultural Credit Corporation becomes so important, because a discipline can be exercised there on the investment in agriculture. You can see that the investment is coming from the Agricultural Credit Corporation and has to be matched by corresponding investment by the farmer from his earnings.  The two together, therefore, provide the worthwhile capital investment that is needed to gear the industry.</P>
    <P>The report in today's newspapers is nothing new to those of us who have been in fairly close touch over the years with our agricultural potential. It claims that this expansion over a ten-year period would create 100,000 new jobs.  I think there is a familiar ring about that 100,000 figure; most new jobs seem to end somewhere around the 100,000.  Of these jobs, 50,000 would be on the land and the other 50,000 in spin-off industries.</P>
    <P>The main point to be taken from that is that it is being realised that we must call a halt to the drift from the land.  We cannot, on the one hand, expect increased agricultural production and, on the other hand, have a decrease in the work force on the <Col N="416" /> land.  It is the pattern all over Europe that the work force on the land is decreasing, because the pull from European industry is so strong and the alternative opportunities are so great that there has been this flight.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, we are in a different position.  Our land is only half-developed compared with European standards and our population on the land is a very ageing one.  The decrease in numbers is largely due to people leaving in their coffins.  We must try to ensure that there is a recruitment pattern of young people coming back into agriculture to make their mark.  This is where very positive help is required by credit groups. especially the Agricultural Credit Corporation, to encourage and entice these people back on to the land.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the figures involved. The report said that in a developed agriculture we should look at about one worker, fully employed, per 50 cow units.  We all know that today the cost of a cow is somewhere between £200 and £250, and more. There are ancillaries to be provided, such as fencing, passages, milk parlours, housing, <i>et cetera</i>, all of which the study team estimated would be over £500 per cow unit.  For example, 50 cows at £500 comprises £25,000 capital in order to keep one man busy, and that does not include the land on which the cows graze.  Taking the study team's target of one cow per acre&mdash;a very modest figure on the land and which is about £500 or £600 an acre&mdash;that is another £25,000.</P>
    <P>In other words, agriculture today has gone from being a very low capital industry to being probably what is one of the highest capital industries per unit of employment.  We must face that change and realise that in the change itself there is so much capital involved that it proves too much for anyone who has no starting capital to make it on his own.  The emergence of a very sizeable portion of the agricultural income going to repay capital is a reality that has to be faced.  What we need is to ensure that what is left provides a good living for the operator on the land.</P>
    <P>Obviously with a £50,000 investment <Col N="417" /> we must look very carefully at the training the operator of that investment receives.  The training must be of the best quality.  It is not sufficient merely to look at what we have in agricultural credit.  We must look more critically at the agricultural payments.  The correct strides are being made but they are not being made fast enough.  We see the dramatic expansion that is taking place in investment because people with money, whether banks or otherwise, see the returns that can be had by lending to farmers.  This means that far too much of the money is going in paying interest.  That would be all right if the training of the operator matched the investment of capital so that he was in a position to get the best out of the investment.  You cannot service an investment of £50,000 without having a top-grade performance and maximum efficiency in what is produced.</P>
    <P>It is a line of industry which is exceedingly costly.  On the positive side, most of the inputs are home produced.  The increased stock comes from our own resources.  Local buildings and so on are home resources. This encourages us to incur the very heavy financial commitments which are needed to get this industry started.  We must make an act of faith in the future as to whether this industry is capable of carrying the debt in the future and as to whether it is capable of servicing those heavy loans.  We cannot be certain.  We have had agricultural slumps in the past.  We can remember the expansion of the 1920s, where those who had courage to invest wound up in the hungry thirties.  Today we can afford to be more confident&mdash;we have no choice but to be confident.  We can look to the EEC.  It is one mammoth industry in which we have distinct advantages over all our competitors. We can produce the raw material, the grass and so on, much cheaper than anywhere else.  We must look more critically at the world energy situation and be careful of the assumptions we make of availability of ever-increasing quantities of fertiliser or concentrated foodstuffs.  The price of these products <Col N="418" /> is increasing rapidly.  This will make a very big impact on the balance of profitability in European agriculture where they are far more dependent on the supply of concentrates and fertilisers than we are at present.  It may put many of those producers out of business or else make them strive for increased returns on the European market.  We are a stage behind this process so we can face the big investment.  We are mortgaging our future to develop agriculture at the rate at which we are going and we must ensure that both labour and capital, first-class trained labour and capital, is profitably used and maximum benefit extracted from the produce of the land in order that we can meet this fantastic challenge.</P>
    <P>I see that the Agricultural Credit Corporation are still lending money for land purchase.  I thought there had been a go-slow and that the ACC were not lending money for this purpose. The price of land has been inflated beyond its real value.  The work of the ACC should enable those on the land to increase their productivity rather than acquiring more acres.  We read that ancillary industry about which we had some doubts a year ago, for example, the pig industry, now has a great future. If this is so, there is a great future for increasing the income of our small farms rather than trying to increase their size.  In today's <i>Irish Press</i> there is an article which says that from ten lbs. of pig manure suitably treated one could produce as much gas as from ten gallons of petrol.  If this situation comes about we will be producing pigs just for the gas they produce.</P>
    <P>It says that the ACC are lending money for dwellinghouses at the archaic repayment period of 35 years. I would have thought that in the present high interest situation such loans would be absurd.  You would pay so much in interest that the slight increase needed to liquidate the loan over 20 rather than 35 years would be insignificant.  You pay 5 per cent on average to liquidate it over 20 years and you pay 3½ per cent to liquidate <Col N="419" /> it over 35 years&mdash;this is only a 1½ per cent addition.  If you can afford to carry a burden of 12 per cent interest plus the floating of 3½ per cent, that would be 15½ or 15 per cent.  The logic is that these long-term loans are no longer useful.  It is better to make the slight additional effort and get it finished on the 20-year basis.</P>
    <P>The small farm loans are a worthwhile scheme.  I hope we are in a position to take the maximum advantage of whatever benefits can be extracted from Brussels on that score. We must match whatever is produced. We have no option but to make the most of our agriculture.  In that spirit I commend what is recommended in this Bill but I hope the Minister will be back before the two-year period to ask for an increase in agricultural credit.  It is better that the credit should be channelled through what is effectively an agricultural credit bank rather than having it come through all the various agencies and so on.  There is a better chance of having an overall policy carried through if the main bulk of the lending comes through the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>The main policy I see necessary is to ensure that there is £ for £, or better, investment by the farmer from his increased returns.  There may have to be a time-lag; there has to be. The increased stock will not produce for a few years.  Perhaps his return on his investment for the first couple of years will not be £ for £ but after a few years it will be more than £ for £.  Then we will reap the harvest from our agriculture.  With confidence in the future of agriculture, I warmly endorse what is contained in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers I should like to pay a tribute to the corporation on their role in promoting the agricultural industry. The title, ACC, might lead us to believe that the benefit derived from the corporation is confined to the agricultural community.  That is not correct.  I believe when prosperity exists in rural Ireland, that prosperity is channelled to the towns and <Col N="420" /> the cities.  I believe, in fairness to the ACC that they have never really got full credit for the prosperity they have brought to us all over the past 46 years.  The fact that this Bill proposes to increase the borrowing powers from £70 million to £120 million in itself is an indication of the confidence of the Irish farmers in that corporation.</P>
      <P>There are a few points I should like to raise regarding applications for a loan.  I often wonder if there is a certain amount of duplication.  A farmer makes an application and hands it into the local office.  An inspector comes out and assesses his holding and income, goes back to the office and makes a recommendation to Dublin and, after about three weeks or so, if the loan is accepted and approved, then the farmer is notified. Then he is requested to produce his deeds plus all other legal documents and forward them to Dublin.  After another three weeks or so, he is notified of approval.  I wonder could most of that be eliminated by giving more power to a local manager.  I would not go so far as suggesting that a local manager should have power to write out a cheque and forward it to the applicant.  I would suggest that his recommendations should be accepted, that he should notify headquarters of the approval, and they should then forward the cheque.</P>
      <P>This delay can be of very great importance, particularly in 1973, when the emphasis is on time.  A farmer may have an opportunity of buying a farm or a field.  In desperation, to get that field or farm in order to improve his own economy, he is forced to go to a bank for a short-term loan.  He finds, after a while, that time is too short and the repayments are too hefty.  He finds himself in a bad financial position.  He may be a young man with a family.  He then gets a brainwave to contact the ACC and they in turn, will refuse to grant a loan on the grounds that they refuse to take over a bank loan or what they describe as a bank debt.  I do not believe that this is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, in circumstances such as that, there should be no question of <Col N="421" /> refusing that man, if he is creditworthy and, indeed, if the bank gives him a loan he is creditworthy.  For that reason I fail to agree with the powers that be that they should have the right to refuse a bank loan in that case.  I am not criticising the staff in any way.  I found the staff courteous, and efficient, and helpful in every way.  Their inspectors carry out their jobs with the minimum of embarrassment and the maximum of secrecy. The fact that so many farmers repay their loans promptly is a tribute to the farming community.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the ACC is the marriage settlement agreement which is very good.  Take the case of a farmer and his wife with three sons. He makes a will leaving the place to one son who is faced then with having to pay out £2,500 to £3,000 to each of his brothers.  Without such help as is forthcoming from the ACC such a farm may not make the same contribution to our economy as it should. There should be more liaison between the Land Commission and the ACC. The value of land has gone to such a pitch that, as happened in my own county, a number of people refused to accept a portion of divided land because the rent is £70 or £80 per acre.  The Land Commission have really defeated their own purpose.</P>
    <P>Here is an opportunity for the ACC, at least for the first five years. They could have a ceiling on the valuation.  The very fact that somebody qualifies for a portion of divided land is proof that he has not got an economic holding.  The ACC should have some kind of a scale of a reduced rate to help people in that plight.</P>
    <P>I often wonder, in view of the many glaring advantages in the ACC, why Irish people are very slow to invest their money with them.  We should give them more publicity and greater incentives outside of this country. Not alone have investors security for their money, but they are also doing something worthwhile for the economy of their own country.  I welcome the Bill.  If the ACC are as successful in the next 46 years as they were in the past 46 years the people <Col N="422" /> of Ireland need have no fears for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I am glad to see the Parliamentary Secretary introducing the Bill here. Being from a rural area, I am sure he is quite conversant with the needs for this measure.  Over the years the Agricultural Credit Corporation have done a tremendous job but it is only in the last five or six years that really great expansion has taken place.  In the past it was much too difficult for a farmer to get a loan of any kind, and I doubt if it was as difficult in any other country in Europe for a farmer to get a loan through an agricultural credit corporation or through a bank.  Here, not alone would the farmer have to bring in the deeds of his land, but he would have to bring in most of the people living in the townland as guarantors in order to get even a miserable loan.</P>
      <P>This was very degrading from a farmer's point of view.  He was a hard-working citizen, fit to work in any country, and this old system of loans was the most depressing aspect of his life.  It will take a long time before the fear in the heart of farmers seeking loans from a bank or a credit corporation is allayed because the imprint is still on their minds from the old eviction days, the days of the rack rents, and right down to the present day of the degrading process they had to go through to obtain a loan.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation and other people who may advance loans expect to get their money back in a reasonable time, but very often in the past their repayment schedule did not coincide with an opportune time for the farmer and he was often forced to sell his cattle when the market was depressed whereas, if he could have kept them for another couple of months, he might have made a reasonable profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see the Agricultural Credit Corporation getting this extra money.  There are very many capable men, who have a good grasp of Irish farming and of the needs of present day farming, in the corporation at present but I hope in the future that they will be more generous with the <Col N="423" /> farmer.  We are living in a time when agricultural methods have changed more over the last ten or 15 years than they changed over the last 2,000 years.  We are now members of the European Economic Community and we know how much farming methods have changed.  It is unreasonable to expect the small farmer to cope with this rapid change.  I have known of small farmers&mdash;they might be termed cottiers by other people&mdash;who reared large families by ekeing out an existence on small mountain farms.  They and their families made a tremendous contribution to this nation.  It would be wrong if such people were caught out in the present day rush for modernisation and their method of farming wiped out.</P>
    <P>If rural Ireland is being depopulated it is because most of our small farmers are not able to eke out an existence on their farms.  It is the duty of the State and bodies such as the ACC to come to their assistance and stop this depopulation. Many of our industries are based on agricultural products and many of the thousands who are working in well-paid positions in industry would not be there but for the farmer. It is the produce of the farmer which creates the raw materials which keep these industries in production.  Therefore, it is important that the small farmer be given a reasonable chance of survival in today's severe competition.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the average small farmer is sufficiently educated so far as obtaining loans is concerned. The millstone surrounding loans in the past still lives in the memory of these people.  If we could remove that it would be a step in the right direction. The members of the Agricultural Credit Corporation should meet these people and, in consultation with the local agricultural officer, work out a plan which would help the farmer to better himself and his family.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation have been in existence for many years and a great amount of money has been loaned out from their funds; it might be interesting to find out what type of people borrowed this <Col N="424" /> money.  I remember a farmer in the south applying for a loan of £10,000 or £14,000 and getting it while, at the same time, a small farmer in County Cavan was experiencing great difficulty in getting a loan of £100 or £200. That kind of situation should be remedied immediately because in the past many of the people in banks and in corporations such as the ACC were too eager to lean backwards to facilitate the farmer who was in a position to put on a good outward show.  That type of farmer succeeded for a couple of years and then probably went out of existence.  The majority of the small farmers I know are people who never like to owe money.  They have always done their best to try and meet their commitments and these are the people who should be helped by the ACC.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which affect farmers greatly, such as death duties and rates, when they apply for a loan.  It means that a farmer's overheads are too great.  The rapid expansion that has taken place in agriculture during the last ten or 15 years, such as the heifer subsidy scheme, the brucellosis scheme and other such schemes, has pushed this country into a very advantageous position <i>vis-a-vis</i> Europe.  Because of our temperate climate and our great potential for growing good quality grass we are in a unique position and any money spent on helping the farmer to advance and increase production should be welcomed.  For that reason I am very happy, indeed, to see this Bill before the House.  I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on bringing it in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome very sincerely the provisions in this Bill.  Public representatives have wide experience in dealing with State Departments and semi-State bodies but the Agricultural Credit Corporation stand out in their workings as an ideal of what semi-State bodies should be.  In the representations made to me in connection with agricultural credit it is most unusual to find a farmer complaining that he has made application to the ACC and not received a reply, or that he has <Col N="425" /> not got a decision on his application, or that the decision was entirely wrong.  Any representations I receive of this nature are usually from people who are not aware that money for various schemes can be obtained from the Agricultural Credit Corporation. Having put these people on the rails, I normally find that the Agricultural Credit Corporation do their job in an admirable fashion.  I attribute this smooth working of the corporation to the fact that many of the people in head office in Dublin started their careers as field advisers with farmers and were promoted into the ACC.  Hence, in the office in Dublin there is a very wide knowledge of individual cases, of regional and county problems, and of all the factors that are important when this body are deciding to make money available to farmers.</P>
      <P>We welcome this increase in borrowing by the ACC.  It worked in the past, within the limits and within the regulations laid down when it was set up to do the job, and it has been entirely successful.  Senator Quinlan was slightly more pessimistic in his remarks about the forecasts that were made by the IFA livestock committee a few days ago.  He was more pessimistic than I might be in evaluating what can possibly be done by the agricultural community in the coming year.</P>
      <P>From my own observations of some of the pilot areas where intensive advice was made available to farmers, where increased incentives were given to them, and from the increased production which was achieved in the last five years, I am absolutely convinced that the figures that were published yesterday by this committee will be achievable.  I have no doubt about it, because I have seen over the past five years in some of the poorer areas of the country an increase in cow numbers of something like 50 per cent.  Fifty per cent more in the next five years would be a higher target than that which has been set.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of this investment of £100 million a year, which at present is 25 per cent of the entire agricultural production, this <Col N="426" /> would be for the first year and perhaps the second year, and once the fruits of the further investment begin to show up it would be a much lesser percentage of the money.  In relation to the whole question of taxation on farmers, I am convinced that no other section of our industry have used an increased income more wisely or prudently than have the agricultural community.  It is quite obvious from going around the country that farmers have enjoyed a higher income in the past year or two.  It is quite obvious that this money is not being used for the luxuries of life but is being ploughed back into the land and is helping our entire economy.  I have no doubt at all that those 100,000 jobs a year could be provided if investment was available for the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The stage has been reached when progress in agriculture is being hampered by lack of services.  Some services have not been sufficiently financed or modern enough to suit an expanding agricultural industry.  This can be seen where land requires reclamation. It can also be seen in some of the processing industries.  When somebody suggests that money should be made available to farmers alone, I could not agree with this suggestion, because an expanding agricultural industry will require a service industry to keep it going.  In my own area the land reclamation programme is being severely hampered by lack of sufficiently well-financed contractors to carry out the job of improving land.  Very definitely in the bacon industry I can see profits to farmers being reduced because the processing industry has been under-financed in the past and is still being under-financed.</P>
    <P>To a much greater extent than people realise farmers are being financed in their day-to-day working by co-operatives and private firms. These firms should have money made available to them, where greater efficiency can result from it, because this credit is being extended to most farmers in any case.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation do an admirable job.  If we did not have this <Col N="427" /> organisation, think of the position of farmers making applications to banks. The ACC try to create the proper balance in investing their money for the achievement of increased production, taking into consideration the security factor, and the social implications involved.  They lend out their money to a well-formed pattern. Family circumstances of the borrowers are always taken into consideration and also the requirements of the area, the social structure, and the type of farmer who is applying for the money.</P>
    <P>Compare this with the attitude of our banks who in some underdeveloped regions have gathered up more money and have more money in savings than they are prepared to lend out to borrowers in those regions.  In the west some of the banks have more money in savings from the rural community than they are prepared to lend.  Money is being taken out of the poorer areas of this country and reinvested in what is regarded as safer and, perhaps, a more easily administered type of investment in a built-up area.</P>
    <P>The agricultural community should be made aware of the importance of investing their money with the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  By so doing they can be assured that this money will be equitably distributed for the good of a greater number of people in rural Ireland, and for the good of the entire economy.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned that money should not be lent for buying land.  I would not entirely agree with this.  I doubt very much if the lending policy of the Agricultural Credit Corporation has made any contribution to the very high price of land at present. The Agricultural Credit Corporation lend money for land purchase with discretion, and certainly never in cases of speculation that have come to my knowledge.  In cases of speculation the banks rather than the Agricultural Credit Corporation are the offenders.  Very often they have made money available to people who are not dependent on agriculture and who pay exorbitant prices for land in <Col N="428" /> the knowledge that this is a very safe investment.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to mention is that a farmer cannot borrow more than two-thirds in excess of his fixed assets.  This probably militates against the bacon industry at present.  Practically all the agricultural field is under-financed.  Pigs and milk are usually produced on the same farm.  Farmers need to borrow to build up their dairy and cattle industry.  Over the past few years dairying has given a much higher return than any other activity in agriculture.  The farmer has fallen short of funds to expand his pig production, because he has met with this two-thirds obstacle.  The investment in pigs, like the investment in cows and cattle, has become a big money business.  We must realise that it takes almost £300 to provide a building for one sow and her progeny.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to bring this to the notice of the Minister. Some of us believe that this two-thirds limit should be abolished in some circumstances, particularly with a view to expanding the production of pigs on our many rich farms.  As a result of this the pig industry is slipping out of the hands of the small and medium-sized farmer and going into the hands of the much bigger producer.  This may be healthy and efficient for the industry but we would not like to see the smaller farmers losing their grasp on that industry which has been so important to them in the past.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill and the Agricultural Credit Corporation have done tremendous work.  I look forward to seeing the land of Ireland giving increased production and a better return.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill as a man associated with agriculture all my life.  I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for introducing the Bill here.  I should also like to congratulate the ACC on the work they have done in the past for the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something must be done for the small farmer.  The previous speaker <Col N="429" /> commented on the buying of land.  The field at the back of the house of a small farmer is essential to this country.  If he has a son, or is a young man with a family, he will keep the country going for the next generation and for generations after that.  These people have been neglected.  The big farmer can go to the ACC or the bank.  He has the money to buy the farm.  The small man has to go abroad or go into industry.  The small farmer kept this country going and he should be assisted now.  The big farmer can go into the bank and get £50,000 but the small farmer who will take off his coat and work will not get £2,000.  A small farmer will get four cows through the creamery from the ACC. If he has a field to sell he will not get £5,000.  That is what the Government should be looking into.  The Parliamentary Secretary comes from an area where the majority are small farmers. I come from an area where there are both big and small farmers.  I am speaking on behalf of the small farmers.</P>
    <P>Two-thirds of this £120 million will be spent on those who do not really need it.  The small farmer will not get it because he has nothing to offer.  In a few years the Government of the time will be paying the small farmer to stay on the land and he will get money without having to pay interest because he will be an asset to the country.  There will be nobody left to work the land if the small farmer is not looked after now.  He has been the mainstay of the country down through the years.  I ask the Minister through the Parliamentary Secretary, to look after those people and make some allowance in this £120 million for the small man whether he has two or ten sheds or even if he has no shed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to say there has not been one dissenting voice regarding the implications of this Bill.  I am delighted to hear Senator Bob Aylward speaking on behalf of the small man because everyone across the Shannon, so far as I know, would be considered in other parts of Ireland as small men and he quite rightly stated, when he <Col N="430" /> interceded on their behalf, that money should be made available to help those small farmers.  Just one or two extra acres would help them in more ways than we can imagine because in the small farms they make more use of whatever limited acreage they have than in some places where there are stud farms and larger farmers.</P>
      <P>The cost of applying for loans is not very high.  Senator Keegan is under the impression that it is.  The cost of administration under the ACC is less than 2 per cent of the total expenditure. The ACC are constantly reviewing their system and its flexibility and trying to make things less difficult, cutting out as much red tape as they can and giving more power every month to the local officers who can, on their recommendation, have a loan rejected or granted.  Their investigations are rather detailed.  People will always tell the good side of their story but leave out something detrimental to the granting of a loan.  Nobody wants to give a loan to a person who is insolvent and will not be able to pay.  It will create difficulties along the line if people get loans and cannot pay them back.  The ACC have never rack-rented or never evicted or made difficulties which were not already there or were made by the applicant.  Some people are black listed but that is their own fault.  This black listing system is not perpetuated to involve other members of the family.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Butler mentioned that liaison with farm advisers should be got under way.  The ACC employ their own agricultural advisers.  They also avail of the assistance of farm advisers <Col N="431" /> employed by the committees of agriculture and are in constant liaison with these people so as to get true information regarding applications for loans.  Such liaison will become a permanent feature of the loan schemes when the new EEC farm modernisation scheme comes into operation, possibly in January, 1974.</P>
    <P>If Senators have any information about refusals and bring them to the notice of any member of the committee or of the directors of the ACC they will bring it up at the next meeting at a later date and it will be thrashed out there for the second time and under further scrutiny this application may be granted.</P>
    <P>I am replying very briefly because we want to finish by 10 o'clock.  If I do not finish before 10 o'clock it means that we must come here tomorrow morning and, as the Appropriations Bill is to be taken tomorrow, we will have to wait until 12 o'clock before I finish.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan went rather deeply into mathematics.  Such is his bent.  In the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries seminars and courses are held for the training of young farmers to help them to keep in touch with developments in machinery.  Field days are held all over the country.  If farmers visit these events and take courses they undoubtedly will become perfect farmers and the money they get from the ACC or elsewhere will not be wasted.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien complained of a <Col N="432" /> round-about system of dealing with loans.  I find it very difficult to accept this because when somebody applies for a loan red tape is cut in the ACC. If the person is a straight-forward applicant, usually that loan is granted. As regards liaison with the Land Commission, the Senator's remarks will be brought to the notice of the proper authorities.  If anything can be done to improve contact between those two bodies it will be done.</P>
    <P>Every Senator who spoke voiced the same sentiments in regard to investment by the public in the ACC.  It should be in everybody's mouth and it should be a propaganda point in all the farmers' organisations that we should invest in what we have and what we believe in, and that is the farming community.  If we have confidence in them&mdash;and ACC represent the farmers&mdash;everybody should agree that the money of Ireland should be invested in a proper association which will give a proper return.  No matter what anybody says the agricultural industry is the soundest and most fundamental industry in this country. From this on, I trust with the help of the ACC that we shall see Ireland move forward within the next ten years at a rate 100 per cent faster than it did over the last ten years.</P>
