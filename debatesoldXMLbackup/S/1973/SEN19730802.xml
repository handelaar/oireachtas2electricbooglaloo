      <P>I hope that, seeing our attempt to have Motion No. 10 on the Order Paper taken before the Recess was unsuccessful last week, the Government will make every effort to have this motion taken at the earliest possible opportunity in the autumn. Attempts were made to have this motion discussed last week.  It is of paramount importance that we have a debate on this motion and I trust the Government will make every effort to deal with it as soon as possible in the autumn.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the remarks made by Senator West.  The continuous postponement of a debate on this motion would probably create a bad impression.  The views we could put forward on the matter would probably be just as divided as the views that exist in the North.  I think this would be a good time to make our views known.</P>

      <P>I can certainly say to Senator West that I will do what I can to have this debate as early as possible after the Recess.  The only argument I have heard against having the debate was that of Senator Martin. I would hope that this House would not find itself so divided in relation to its attitude on this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to apologise for the absence of the Minister, who is abroad, and on his behalf to present his speech on the Bill's Second Reading.</P>
      <P>The remuneration of Senators, in common with that of Ministers and Parliamentary Officers and of course Deputies, has remained unchanged since 1968.  Under the various pay rounds since 1968 other groups have had their pay increased on four or five occasions.  The position of Parliamentarians calls out for redress and that is what this Bill proposes to do.</P>
      <P>In bringing this Bill before the Seanad I am aware that the increases in remuneration proposed are likely to be subject to more criticism, much of it ill-informed, than the increases for any other group in the country would arouse.  In the past one reason for such criticism was that the delay in making increases necessitated fairly substantial increases in the long run to compensate for depreciation in money values.  The fact that there has been no increase in the pay of parliamentarians since 1968 means that once again relatively substantial increases have to be provided.  There has also been criticism on former occasions of pay increases for parliamentarians on the grounds that they were free to vote themselves their own increases.  There has been a call for the setting-up of some sort of independent tribunal which would determine the appropriate remuneration for Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector were asked by the Government of the day in December, 1970, to examine and report on the levels of remuneration of members of the Government, Parliamentary Secretaries, Attorney General and Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann and the allowances of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The report of the review body was submitted to the Minister for Finance on 11th July, 1972, and published on 9th September, 1972.  Members are aware that the review body made a detailed study of the work of parliamentarians <Col N="807" /> and also examined jobs in the higher levels of the economy generally. The outcome of this study was that they recommended substantial increases in the pay of parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>These recommendations fell to be considered, however, against the background of the national agreement. This led to the announcement by the Government of the day on 27th October, 1972, that, because of the existence of the national pay agreements, it felt obliged to ask the Employer/Labour Conference to advise in relation to the extent to which effect might be given to the review body's recommendations on the basis of and for the duration of the national agreements.</P>
    <P>A special committee of the Employer/Labour Conference was duly set up to examine and report to the Minister.  In its report dated 22nd December, 1972, the special committee indicated the rates which would be appropriate having regard to the general increases under the 12th round and the national agreement, 1970.  This Government decided, as I stated on 20th June, that the new rates of remuneration should apply with effect from 1st July, 1973 &mdash; the date from which the increases in social welfare benefits announced in the budget were to be paid.  The rates set out in the present Bill have been determined, in the light of the special committee's report, on the basis of the increases that applied throughout the public sector under the 12th round and the national agreements. These rates for the most part, in so far as office-holders are concerned fall well short of the rates recommended by the review body.  For example, the review body recommended £654 more for Ministers than they are going to be paid.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that the revised rates which the Bill provides for are entirely justified.  I am equally certain that, having regard to the prevailing national agreement climate, no more appropriate revisions could be made.</P>
    <P>A Deputy's job is unique in that he <Col N="808" /> is at all times at the disposal of the public.  Any person who aimed at a nine-to-five job would be well advised to give up any idea of becoming a Deputy.  The Deputy has no claim to overtime pay and despite the fact that his job may require him to write thousands of letters on behalf of his constituents he gets no allowance for secretarial services.  All expenses that arise in the course of the job by way of entertainment have to be met from his parliamentary allowance.  I have laid so much stress on the Deputy's role because the Deputy's rate of allowance sets the standard by reference to which a Senator's allowance falls to be determined.  What I have said about the Deputy's job applies to a greater or lesser degree to many Senators.  I am satisfied that the revised rate of allowance provided for Senators in the Bill represents an appropriate measure of their due by comparison with that of Deputies.</P>
    <P>The arguments I have used in relation to Deputies apply with even greater force to members of the Government.  Because of their total commitments to office, the continuity of their business or professional interests is broken.  A Minister is responsible for the direction of his Department and for the formulation of policy on those aspects of national life that are directly related to the operations of his Department.  He has also the task of explaining these policies to the Oireachtas and the public.  He may be obliged to travel abroad on official business at frequent intervals. Nowhere else in the economy is there a post, either at managerial or directive level, which carries greater responsibility or imposes greater demands on the occupant.  Despite that fact a Minister's salary, even as increased under this Bill, will still lag well behind the remuneration of the top managers in commerce or in industry, or of the leading lights in the professions.</P>
    <P>In common with Ministers, the Attorney General, who is of course a member of the Dáil, has agreed to refrain from involvement in any other business or profession for the duration of his appointment.  It has been decided, therefore, that his remuneration <Col N="809" /> and pension should be brought into line with the remuneration and pension of Ministers.  The salary for an Attorney General who is not a Member of the Oireachtas is being dealt with in the same way as the other salaries and allowances covered by the Bill, that is to say, by the application to the existing rate of salary of the increases provided under the 12th round and the national agreements.</P>
    <P>A further provision in the Bill enables increases in the allowances of Deputies and Senators and in the salaries of Parliamentary office-holders to be granted in future by way of Government Order instead of by Act of the Oireachtas.  The amending provision requires the Government to lay before the Dáil a draft of any such order and if the Dáil disapproves of the draft order within 21 sitting days the order shall not be made.  The essence of parliamentary control is, therefore, being maintained.  In a situation where Members' remuneration is affected by national pay agreements it is clearly desirable that the delays which take place between the decision to introduce legislation and the final passing of the legislation should be avoided.  There is no good reason why increases in remuneration of Members of the Oireachtas should be subject to obstacles which are not placed in the way of any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>This Bill also provides for a substantial increase in the rates of allowances paid by way of contribution towards the secretarial and research expenses of the Opposition parties represented in Dáil Éireann.  The allowance payable to the current Opposition party will be £25,000, an increase of 66? per cent on the current figure of £15,000.  Up until 1968 the allowance paid was intended to help towards meeting the secretarial expenses only of the Opposition.  The 1968 Amendment Act provided for an increase in the provision for secretarial expenses and, also, for the first time for a contribution towards the cost of research and administrative services.  This Bill follows that precedent.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the first time, for the payment of allowances to the leaders of the Government parties. <Col N="810" /> In their case, however, since the provision of research and administrative facilities does not arise for the Government parties in the same way as for the Opposition, the appropriate rate of allowance is being fixed, in any particular case, at 40 per cent of the rate payable to the leaders of the Opposition. The Civil Service can, of course, be relied upon to provide the Government with the necessary backing in research.</P>
    <P>The remuneration of Members of the Oireachtas has not been increased since 1968.  The increases now proposed are in line with the increases given to public servants generally under the 12th round and the national agreements. For these reasons, I think that it will be generally accepted that the increases provided for in the Bill are entirely justified and I recommend the proposals in the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Seanad will not get into the same sort of parliamentary haggle or hassle as the Dáil got itself entangled in last week.  This is a reasonably good Bill but it had to be wrung out of the Government over long hours of debate in the Dáil. The remuneration increases for Deputies, Senators and Ministers are less than those recommended by the Employer/Labour Conference in regard to their back-dating.  However, the figures are on all fours with the figures recommended by the Employer/Labour Conference.  The Employer/Labour Conference recommended that the increases would be paid as from 1st January and this recommendation has been ignored.  There is an argument as to whether it was a recommendation, but that is merely a quibble.  The reality is that it was a recommendation. It was ignored and in the interests of politicking the increases have been limited to 1st July of this year.  I would describe this as petty political play-acting to so limit the time from which the increases operate and I will say no more about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important, if the Employer/ Labour Conference is to have credibility both with employers and employees, that whatever recommendations emerge from the Employer/ Labour Conference should be acknowledged <Col N="811" /> and adopted immediately and in full, without variation.  The whole basis of the national pay agreements, which we have initiated successfully since December, 1970, relies on the Employer/Labour Conferences being strengthened and on the various agencies of the Labour Court being strengthened, and it is on the respect and regard for these mechanisms that the pay agreement ultimately depends.</P>
    <P>There is an erosion of that principle in not following to the full the recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference in regard to our own remuneration.  Political play-acting by limiting the time of operation of the remuneration has resulted in a very real erosion of the authority of the Employer/Labour Conference.  This authority needs to be upheld to the complete letter of the law.  We will need this authority in the coming months to ensure that the third pay agreement is successfully negotiated and, when negotiated, is successfully upheld and maintained.</P>
    <P>There is one matter I should like to mention which is omitted from the Bill. In the other House the Minister for Finance said he had under consideration the question of parity in regard to Deputies' pensions and Deputies' widows' pensions.  This matter is not included in the Bill and it is a matter in which we through our own lack of moral courage are lagging behind the rest of the community.  Throughout the public service and industry parity in regard to pensions is an acknowledged feature of pension rights.  When pensions granted in a particular year are eroded through the natural passing of time and through an erosion in the value of money, they are regularly upgraded in accordance with the rise in the cost of living or in accordance with the equivalent pay on salary scales operating in that same employment at that particular time.  As in the case of our own remuneration, here again, through lack of moral courage, we are lagging behind the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>I should like to get an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary, who I know would be sympathetic in <Col N="812" /> a matter of this kind, that the promise made by the Minister for Finance in the course of the Dáil debate will be honoured and that even though there is a very real omission in this Bill in that respect that omission will be remedied as soon as possible in another piece of legislation. The merit of having pensions for retired Deputies and their widows put on a parity basis is easily recognisable. Deputies' widows &mdash; in some cases widows for 20 years &mdash; have been living on pittances although their husbands gave a lifetime of service both in the Dáil and the Seanad. This deserves recognition.  There is not a great deal of money involved and it would merely involve stepping up the State contributions to the existing fund to which we all contribute. I am not aware of what mechanism would be adopted but it is a matter requiring immediate investigation. This is an elementary right enjoyed right across the board by all sections of the community who are in insurable or continuous employment.</P>
    <P>The third matter which got everybody into a tangle in the Dáil concerned the question of the allowance for the Opposition.  The Government made an elementary blunder in not including this matter in the Bill as originally framed.  It is no harm to ascribe the word &ldquo;blunder&rdquo; to a Government that is claimed to be a Government of all talents when in fact they have shown themselves on a number of occasions to be guilty of the most appalling incompetence. Not alone was this matter not included in the original Bill but a whole series of fantastic amendments, which could not stand up to examination, were introduced.  Eventually, as the Bill finally emerged last Friday, it went right back to the formula as proposed by the Leader of the Opposition in his opening speech on the debate in the very first instance.</P>
    <P>In opening the debate after the Minister introduced his Bill, the Leader of the Opposition made his speech simply on the basis of the provisions that existed for an Opposition allowance and suggested that that be raised in accordance with the percentage increases <Col N="813" /> which had been given over the years since a Fianna Fáil Government first introduced the principle of an Opposition allowance in 1938.  I might mention, for the record, that first of all it was Fianna Fáil in Government that introduced the principle of an allowance for the Opposition.  We, as a Government, in benefit of the Opposition raised this allowance in 1947, in 1960, and in 1964.  In 1968 we raised it substantially, from £5,000 to £15,000, which was the highest percentage increase ever granted, and, in the interests of making democracy function, introduced the principle of having this £15,000 cover not just secretarial facilities, which it had been until then designed to cover, but also to cover the research facilities which are so essential if an Opposition is to function properly without the Civil Service back-up.  It was for that reason that the then Minister for Finance in 1968 raised the amount of the allowance for the Opposition from £5,000 to £15,000. Members of the Opposition can argue that between 1968 and 1973 they utilised that money to good effect.</P>
    <P>Over the years since 1938 having dealt as a Government generously with this matter &mdash; and dealt with it particularly generously in 1968 &mdash; we find in 1973 a Bill emerging in which there is not a single mention of this matter.  In that Bill it is proposed to increase Members' remuneration and Ministers' remuneration very substantially but there is no provision made for the basic research facilities and research assistance without which any Opposition cannot function.  It shows a complete ignorance of how Parliament functions and the importance of having an effective Opposition.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil made the point quite clear &mdash; again it took a long time to percolate through to the Minister for Finance because of his unfortunate obstructive attitude in the Dáil &mdash; that this increase was not being sought merely for secretarial allowances to Deputies.  The amendments which the Minister for Finance brought in and which were subsequently withdrawn &mdash; I have no doubt at the dictation of the Taoiseach &mdash; showed how small the mind was <Col N="814" /> through which the Taoiseach was seeking to percolate his point of view in that the amendments showed quite clearly that the Minister for Finance was thinking in terms of secretarial assistance only.  The whole purpose of the 1968 Bill, in raising the Opposition's allowance from £5,000 to £15,000, was not just merely to provide extra secretarial assistance for Deputies to write letters but to provide the basic research back-up and information service which is required for every Opposition Member to make his or her proper speech in the Dáil or Seanad and to make his or her proper investigation into the basic facts and details behind Government policy.</P>
    <P>Those amendments were subsequently withdrawn after a long debate lasting into the early hours of Friday morning.  They were withdrawn very sensibly, because, first of all, they were totally impracticable and were shown to be so; and, secondly, they showed a complete lack of knowledge and appreciation of or an unwillingness to appreciate the fact that this allowance to the Opposition is not concerned with Deputies' allowances in regard to secretarial assistance.  Every Member of every political party is paying substantially to his political party to provide such a service.  Some of this Opposition allowance will undoubtedly go towards the provision of secretarial assistance but the great weight of it will go towards the provision of the proper research, information and investigation back-up service that is necessary for an Opposition to function properly, as against the Government that can function with that service available to them from the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Eventually &mdash; I give credit here to the Taoiseach &mdash; reason prevailed last Friday after a very unedifying performance by the Government, and what was sought by the Leader of the Opposition at the start of the debate in the Dáil was given in a simple, clear and un-equivocable manner.  The allowance of £15,000 was increased to £25,000.  We sought £30,000 and £25,000 was given. We acknowledge it.  It is a smaller percentage increase by far than the percentage increase given to the <Col N="815" /> Opposition in 1968.  The point of view we made was acknowledged eventually on Friday after a very undignified display by the Government, a display of incompetent administration and a display of incompetent running of Parliament where the Dáil sat into the early hours and the Seanad could not sit for many hours.  Eventually, a very simple amendment was made which we see here now.  That matter could have been settled in one hour at most on the first day of the debate.  By doing so all of us could have avoided the type of comments that have been made by some people in the media about the matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as it has now emerged and would suggest, regardless of what Government are in power, that in future when we are arranging matters of this kind we should do them with a slightly greater degree of competence and with a lot less ineptitude so that we can convey to the public that we are about our business in a proper way in this House.  We certainly did not convey that impression by the way in which we went about our business in the Dáil during this debate. The way we go about our business is ultimately the responsibility of the Government.  If the business of the Houses of the Oireachtas is mismanaged by the Government and the Opposition have to point this out to them, the Opposition get involved in the tangle as well; but the tangle should not have been allowed to develop in the first place.  All the trouble and the odium that was incurred was directly the result of the mismanagement of this Parliament's business by the Government in the first instance. The very simple, elementary increase recommended by the Leader of the Opposition at the opening of the debate was eventually granted.  All of that could have been done by either the Committee of Procedure and Privileges or by a simple open response to the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition at the start of the Second Reading debate in the Dáil. What emerged last Friday could have emerged within one hour of the Minister for Finance introducing this Bill in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> Every Member of the Seanad knows in his heart of hearts that what I am saying is totally true.  Let us all make a resolution that this type of thing will not happen again.  In particular, I would appeal to the Government to manage their business in a better way, otherwise their talents may become slightly tarnished in the public mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot in what Senator Lenihan has said.  Most Members of the House would be in general agreement with his remarks.  Certainly, his co-operative, sensible and constructive attitude is a complete contra-distinction to what we have heard and read about in the other House during the week.  One must naturally allow for a certain amount of partisanship on behalf of Senator Lenihan.  That is to be appreciated. One of the reasons why this unfortunate hiatus occurred in the other House was the fundamental fact that the members of Parliament generally have been too timorous and too belated in looking at their own salaries and the conditions under which Deputies and Senators operate.  They have nobody to blame but themselves in that regard.  The fact that the Bill before us today proposes that increases in salaries and changes in the conditions of legislators can take place at reasonably quick intervals is a tremendous improvement on the procedure heretofore.  I should like to commend the Minister for bringing in the provision that increases in salaries can in future be made by order of the House rather than by introducing Bills such as that before us today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we are over-sensitive about the question of increases in salaries of Members of the Oireachtas.  The public are becoming more aware of the necessity to pay their public representative better.  They are also becoming more aware of the need to have representatives of the proper calibre.  The day of the silent Deputy or Senator who formerly occupied the position of a glorified messenger boy for his constituents is rapidly passing. Particularly among the younger people today in the electorate, those with votes at 18 years of age and <Col N="817" /> over, there is a rising demand that not alone must we pay our Deputies and Senators adequately but also that we must demand a standard from these gentlemen that would be in accordance with the salaries they are being paid and, more important, in accordance with the responsibilities of their positions.</P>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary said in his introductory speech, Deputies and Senators and men who go into public life generally must make considerable sacrifices.  The whole-time Deputy or Minister even to a greater extent must make a considerable sacrifice as regards his profession, his business or his farm.  He must be paid an adequate remuneration to compensate for the risks he is taking.  Everybody would agree that politics is an insecure profession at the best of times.  Having regard even to that factor of insecurity, there is an even more important factor and that is the fact that if we want to get the best men in the Dáil and Seanad they must at least be paid salaries comparable to those in industry and the professions today.  That is a fact of life.  It is one that is becoming more and more appreciated by the general public.  For that reason I do not think we should be over-sensitive about the question of the revision of Deputies' or Senators' salaries at reasonable intervals in the years.  It should go hand-in-hand with the remuneration increases in other sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>I do not think Senator Lenihan should boast too much about the increase in the payment to the Opposition given in 1968 from £5,000 to £15,000.  I would regard that as a delayed operation and something that should have been done years before that and a belated recognition of the principle that the Opposition parties require not only secretarial assistance but also research and information services. That this necessity was realised in 1968 is a criticism of the fact that the then Fianna Fáil Government did not appear to realise until five years ago that an Opposition in order to be effective and efficient must have an allowance that is adequate to supply them with research and information <Col N="818" /> services.  It was a belated recognition even though it was a very welcome one. The fact that the sum was increased three-fold is not a valid argument for increasing the remuneration payable to the Opposition party or parties at this stage three-fold again.  The increase suggested by the Minister of some 66? per cent is a very generous figure in the circumstances and in a way breaches the 37 per cent suggested by the Employer/Labour Conference.</P>
    <P>Some play has been made about the date of retrospection.  Reading between the lines of Senator Lenihan's contribution, I thought he admitted there was room for two interpretations. The Opposition party in the Dáil took the point of view very strenuously that it should be retrospective to January 1st.  The Minister and some of the Government spokesmen took a different view.  In all the circumstances and having regard to the date on which we decided to pay the less well off sections of our community, 1st April was a fair date.  I do not think we should cavil at that.</P>
    <P>The general question of research and information facilities for Opposition and, indeed, for Government Deputies and Senators is one I am glad to see being recognised.  It is long overdue.  There was a feeling that the Opposition only needed to be provided with research and information facilities.  But the back-bench Government TD is in just as isolated a position as an Opposition TD in regard to having these very necessary facilities.  It is proper to recognise that fact also.  All TDs should be equal in regard to their needs and the necessity to have these facilities. It should not be just a question of giving the Opposition Deputies extra remuneration to provide these facilities. The back-bench Government Deputy is in exactly the same position. If he is going to retain his seat he must be in a position to have these facilities at his elbow.</P>
    <P>I read through some of the Dáil debates.  I would agree with Senator Lenihan that they are most unedifying reading.  It is not true to say that only the Government Deputies were unedifying in their behaviour.  On all <Col N="819" /> sides of the House, I am sorry to say, discredit was brought to the Oireachtas. The whole thing was a most unedifying spectacle.  The impression gathered by the public was that the Opposition party were adopting an Oliver Twist attitude in the matter.  I do not believe that is fundamentally true but that is the impression among the public.  They were dissatisfied with what they were getting.  They were kicking up a row and wanted a lot more.  The debate was never lifted on to a plane in which it could be looked at coldly and logically so that the public could see that here were public representatives rightly concerned about their remuneration and that they would have the necessary facilities to serve the public better.  It never got on to that plane.  People I have spoken to of all political persuasion regarded it as a most unedifying performance.  It is a sad reflection on the other House.  I want to commend Senator Lenihan for adopting a completely different and more responsible approach.  All the Senators on this side of the House would join with me in that commendation.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;traditions&rdquo; and &ldquo;principles&rdquo; were hurled from side to side in the other House during the course of that acrimonious debate.  In the matter of salaries, remuneration and research facilities, you cannot talk about traditions and principles.  The hard fact is that if you do not pay a TD enough money you will not get the right man. There should be no squeamishness about looking at it from that point of view.  If this means breaking what I would regard as previous practices which seem to have been confused with principles, we should not hesitate to do that.  If in the years ahead it is necessary to upset the present arrangements which are now generally accepted, we should not hesitate either, not only in the interest of the Dáil and Seanad but more particularly in the interests of the country so as to ensure an efficient and proper administration.</P>
    <P>This Bill will have our full support. It is a step in the right direction.  I hope when the necessity again arises to give our TDs and Senators better remuneration that it will be done in a <Col N="820" /> more dignified manner.  Talking about TDs and Senators, as Senator Lenihan rightly said, we should remember the dependants of TDs.  They share their husbands' anxieties in life.  Many TDs' wives do not get the credit they deserve. They do a great deal of work. They look after the family and quite often a business as well.  This work does not get any recognition.  The only way in which we can recognise their worth to the community is to ensure that if anything happens to the breadwinner, the Senator or TD they will be looked after in the best possible manner by the State.</P>

      <P>The Seanad is now being given an opportunity to discuss the Bill raising the salaries of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and of the Government which had such a troubled passage through the Dáil.  I note with interest the defensive attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary in bringing this Bill before the Seanad. He says in the third paragraph:</P>
      <P>In bringing this Bill before the Seanad, I am aware that the increases in remuneration proposed are likely to be subject to more criticism, much of it ill-informed, than increases of any other group in the country would arouse.</P>
      <P>We ought to ask ourselves why this should be the case; why, when they appear to be justifiable on economic grounds, there should be such a defensive attitude to raising the salaries of Parliamentarians and Members of the Government, particularly when these salaries have been considered by a review board and the Employer/Labour Conference.  One of the great deficiencies in the debate which took place in the Dáil &mdash; I hope we will not have the same limited debate here &mdash; is that this question was not asked in sufficient depth.  Why is there such resentment among the public at raising the salaries of parliamentarians and of members of the Government?  This is a fundamental question.  We must not blind ourselves to the fact that there is a good deal of criticism, ill-informed or not, and a feeling of malaise; a feeling that the Parliament is not fulfilling an adequate role in the latter part of the 20th Century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> I should like to make it clear that I fully support those who emphasise the importance of parliamentary democracy, the necessity to pay people who are forming part of the democratic forum an appropriate salary and to give them the necessary resources for research, information and the necessary secretarial back-up.  This approach is essential, but at the same time we cannot avoid the more serious question of why there is this criticism and resentment; why there is the feeling that, once again, Deputies and Senators are looking for more money and they are not justifying such an increase. This is the question we must ask ourselves. Are we justifying our roles as parliamentarians at this point of time in Irish life?  If not, in what way can we perform better in return for getting better salaries and facilities.</P>
    <P>I should like to look first of all at the different roles of Deputies and Senators.  Deputies consider that they work a very long working day, that their wives work for a large part of the time without any recognition or remuneration and that the public ought to be more satisfied.  Perhaps the reason there is not satisfaction but continued resentment is that a large part of the time Deputies are not doing what they should be doing.  They have misconceived their role.  In Ireland we have condoned a system of parliamentary life which is not adequate.  Deputies spend far too much time as local grievance men, answering letters from constituents, performing a role of writing to Departments on behalf of constituents and very largely building up a local graft system in some circumstances. This type of role is bad for the political health of the country.  It is wrong that people round the country think that they can only get whatever they are looking for through their local Deputy.  This is not the proper role of Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputies have a two-fold function, a representative and a legislative function. The first function is that of representation of their constituents.  It involves being in touch with their constituents, to represent them in Parliament by voicing their views, knowing the particular local interests <Col N="822" /> and being aware of the particular needs of the community.  Secondly, there is the role of legislating.  Far too much of Deputies' time is diverted to an activity which ought to be met by other mechanisms.  Far too little time is devoted to what we have heard Senators Lenihan and Russell speak about, and that is research and analysis of legislation going through.  There is very little research or analysis of legislation going through either House of this Parliament, as we are all too well aware.</P>
    <P>Deputies should not be asked to perform the local role of advocate to the various Departments on behalf of their constituents, of trying to redress local grievances to particular individuals.  We ought to build better mechanisms which are not subject to political abuse or to this danger of graft.  These mechanisms would be very easy to institute.  For example, if we had a proper system of citizens' advice bureaux it would meet a lot of the present workload of Deputies.  It would give the people impartial, independent advice and would prevent them feeling that the sole solution to their problems was in the hands of the local politician. We should immediately build up such a system of citizens' advice bureaux.</P>
    <P>We could also provide free legal aid in civil matters and establish around the country.  This would meet many of the problems which Deputies have to tackle.  Very often the problems are legal ones.  Very often the Deputy will find himself writing to the Department of Justice or somebody else, then sending a copy of the letter to the individual concerned.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we ought to institute the office of an ombudsman to examine abuses in administration at every level, such as in the Government Civil Service, in local government, and in the police which affect the individual and make him feel discriminated against.  If somebody is complaining about the activity of the Land Commission and alleging that there is discrimination against him, there should be a better mechanism than to waste the time or absorb the time of the local Deputy in this sort of grievance work.  The inherent danger is that the attitude has grown up that the local Deputy is the <Col N="823" /> person who can solve these problems, and that the person who complained is under obligation to him for doing it, allowing the Deputy to build up his own power base in this way.  The result is that he does not have sufficient time to engage in the necessary research, consideration and analysis of legislation. Hence, there is not enough legislative initiative coming from the Opposition of the time and there is far too little real in-depth analysis of measures which come before the Houses of Parliament.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for such wide public discontent is the reporting of parliamentary debates.  The public, reading the account for instance of how this Bill was debated in the Dáil, as well as other pieces of legislation, is sadly disillusioned.  I have heard Deputies criticise the parliamentary correspondents, calling them drama critics and stating that they pick out the catchword or something to focus on and do not endeavour to give a rounded account of the particular debate which is taking place.  On reading the record of so many debates, more so in the other House than in this House where the standard is higher, it is rarely that one finds a really in-depth analysis or consideration of the legislation. The debates are superficial; they focus on rather minor, often politically divisive, points rather than on the merits of the particular legislative proposal and they do not show evidence of research and evidence of independent analysis.</P>
    <P>Therefore there is reason for serious public discontent at the manner in which Deputies are fulfilling their functions on two grounds: firstly, the way in which the representative function has been distorted in the absence of other mechanisms to deal with public complaints, and secondly, the lack of proper attention to the legislative process. The only way this discontent can be crystallised is by voicing criticism each time Deputies and Senators come looking for more money.</P>
    <P>Looking at the role of the Seanad, in this Bill we are proposing to vote for ourselves, retrospective to the 1st <Col N="824" /> July, salaries of over £2,000.  Yet the public are aware that the Seanad meets on an average about 30 days per year.  Senators do not have the same heavy commitment to their constituents.  Are we giving a sufficiently satisfactory performance to justify the salaries we are looking for?  We ought to be paid an appropriate salary for the parliamentary function which we ought to be performing but which we are not.  The Seanad is not being used adequately. We are not given sufficient scope to have the impact on Irish life which it is possible to have and which the calibre of people represented in the Seanad would allow us to have.  The Seanad is a very appropriate forum for debates on public issues, either as a result of a serious report such as the debate we had last week on the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women or on matters of public interest.  There is time for such discussion in this Chamber and the debates are reported which gives full opportunity for the expression of different views.</P>
    <P>We have seen efforts by some of the Independent Senators to have a debate on Northern Ireland.  It can be argued whether this is appropriate at the present time, but we should not shirk the very important public issues in this House.  We have more time for debate and there is a real value in seeing the record of people's views on these particular subjects.  We should have more sittings for the purpose of debating the various important reports published each year and other matters of real public interest.</P>
    <P>The Government have stated that they will continue to introduce in the Seanad more Bills which are non-contentious. This is welcome because the Seanad has a record of looking more to the merits of legislation than to trying to make political capital out of the particular provisions.  If such measures are non-contentious they will get a good first run here before they go to the Dáil where there is always less time for debating.  I should like to see more non-contentious Bills initiated in this House and also more evidence of Opposition proposals for legislation <Col N="825" /> and Private Members Bills being given time.  The Government should not have, as they have had since the foundation of the State, the virtual monopoly of legislation.  We are all legislators; we all have our own legislative powers and responsibility.  It is a narrow view, not shared by other Parliaments, that only the Government can initiate and put forward legislation.  I would welcome more evidence of initiative by the Opposition Members based on better research facilities and more funds available so that we could have a healthier legislative process.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of using the Seanad more to initiate legislation we should examine the possibility of having a prelegislative stage.  Here again we can argue that the Seanad would be an appropriate place to have this as we have more time and the size of the body allows a full debate to take place within a relatively short time.  Where there is an important measure which is still in draft form, and where there are options on how to proceed so that it is still flexible, it would be most valuable to have a prelegislative consideration of the draft in this House.  This need not necessarily involve a vote so much as the expression of opinion by those who represent the various important interest groups in the country.  Senators are elected from panels which relate to agriculture, labour, industry and commerce, professions, language and culture.  That is the composition of this House, so the views of Senators ought to be extremely useful before a legislative proposal gets into final draft form after which there is little room for amendment so that the amendments are of very minor details and often only matters of grammar.</P>
    <P>If we could create this prelegislative stage, which has been done in other parliaments, it would give a flexibility and power to parliamentarians to influence policy.  It would also mean that when the Bill was finally drafted as the Government of the time decided it would be more likely to get a favourable reception in the Dáil when introduced as a Bill in the normal way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> So much for the possibility of improving the performance of the parliamentarians and the use to which we put both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The lesson is that if we were to show a serious intention to fulfil our functions and a serious endeavour to improve the image of the Oireachtas, there would be less criticism of raising salaries of parliamentarians and of members of the Government.  The public would be more receptive to the idea of helping the individuals concerned to do a better job.  It is recognised to be a difficult, time-consuming and responsible task either to legislate or to carry out the executive role of the country, and there would be a public response to evidence of an intention to perform these roles in a significantly better and more relevant way than has happened in our parliamentary tradition to date.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the mechanism set out in sections 5 and 11 of the Bill is the best way of providing for future increases in the salaries of parliamentarians and of members of the Government. This would allow the Government whenever they so think fit by order to increase either or both the Dáil or Seanad salaries.  It would allow them to give retrospective effect to these increases, and the draft order would be laid before the Dáil subject to annulment within 21 days.  Anybody who is familiar with parliamentary practice will know that unless the Government support a motion annulling an order of this kind it will not be annulled because the Government have the majority of the votes.  Therefore, this is not a real mechanism for control, although it provides an opportunity to debate the matter.</P>
    <P>What I find unsatisfactory about section 5, relating to increases in parliamentary salaries, and section 11, relating to increases payable to the Government and other officers, is that the criteria for giving such increases are not written into the Bill itself. They give the Government a discretion in the matter, a discretion not just to increase the salaries but to give the increase retrospective effect.  I know that the response to this comment will be that the Government will of course refer to the Employer/ <Col N="827" /> Labour Conference and will take into consideration the national wage agreements. But why not write this into the Bill and make it clear that the Government is not looking for a sole discretion to raise its own salaries and the salaries of Members of Parliament every so often?</P>
    <P>We legislate for an indefinite future and we ought to build in safeguards into legislation.  We should do so particularly when we are legislating about our own salaries.  We are in that sense the most privileged group in the nation.  No other group has the power to legislate for its own salaries.  This puts an onus on us to be particularly careful about the terms of reference by which we do so.  We ought to be seen to be being fair.  We ought to build into the wording of the Act itself an undertaking that the Government will abide by the recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference or will tie the increases in salaries to the national wage agreements in a specific way so that it is not left, as it is under the wording of sections 5 and 11 of this Bill, to the discretion of the Government.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment Senator Lenihan on the manner in which he addressed himself to this Bill.  He set a very high standard and it was very gratifying to observe his approach to it.  For years the approach to giving increases in remuneration to Deputies and Senators has been wrong.  I welcome the Bill we have before us today, because under the terms of this Bill it will not be necessary to bring in legislation for future increases.  They will be paid in line with future national wage agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Bill should be made retrospective to 11th July, 1972, which was the date of the publishing of the report of the review body.  In saying that I am aware that it will not affect me personally because I was not a Member of this House at that time.  It would, however, include former Members of the Houses who were not successful in the last election.  Some of those former Members have given <Col N="828" /> great service to the country and I should like to see them covered in a retrospective provision in this Bill.  It seems the Minister is determined not to go further back than 1st July, 1973.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan spoke about the position of pensioners.  Nothing has been done to improve their position since 1964.  I was glad to hear that the Minister has promised to bring in some legislation to cover those pensioners and the widows of pensioners.  I should like to see them being better catered for.  Some of them are in a very, very bad way indeed.  They are quite old now and are trying to live on very small pensions.  I would ask the Minister to bring in the intended legislation as quickly as possible so that those people can benefit.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan referred to the £10,000 that was given to the Opposition in 1968 for research and he also spoke about the large percentage increase that was given to them at that time.  It was realised at that time that £5,000 was not a figure that would cater to any degree for the type of research that is necessary.  Another £10,000 is being given to them under this Bill.  The Fianna Fáil Government gave £10,000 in 1968 and the present Government are giving an additional £10,000 in 1973.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson made a valid point when she said that not enough use is being made of the Seanad and she doubted to some extent whether we were worthy of the increase we are getting under this Bill.  I agree with her on that point but last week we had a debate here which was one of the finest debates I have ever heard in either House.  Had it not been for the fact that the Taoiseach had come into this House we would not have merited two lines in the national press.  It has been the custom of the press down through the years to ignore the debates of the Seanad. For that reason the general public have very little idea of what takes place in the Seanad.  We have to depend on the national Press to give us our due amount of publicity so that the public will know that the Seanad is playing its part in formulating good legislation.  I should like to see the <Col N="829" /> Seanad meeting more often and becoming more and more involved in the political life of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary rightly said at the start of his speech that since 1968 other groups have had their salaries increased on four or five occasions under the various national wage agreements and that, therefore, this Bill is long overdue.  The reason why it is five years ago yesterday since Members of the Oireachtas last received any increases in their allowances is because we, the Members of the Oireachtas, have to fix our own allowances.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson said that we were the only group in the country who were so privileged as to be in the position of being able to fix our own allowances.  However, I would be inclined to look at that matter in another way.  Of all the people in the country we are the least privileged, as politicians, in having to fix our allowances. We are obviously the source, each time we do it, of a great deal of ill-informed and somewhat malicious criticism.</P>
      <P>When the debate on this Bill began in the Dáil one of the Dublin newspapers carried a heading across four columns, entitled &ldquo;Leinster House Listens to the Happy Sound of Tinkling Chequebooks&rdquo;.  There is some implication there that politicians are the only people in the country interested in such mundane things as their own allowances.  Journalists, of course, would not dream of such a thing, though I cannot imagine any newspaper in the country that would still be in being if the journalists had not had any rise in their incomes in the past five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal of political odium involved in a Bill of this kind. It was this fear of public opinion that caused the Government to turn down the suggestion of the Employer/Labour Conference that there should be retrospection as appropriate from the 12th round and the 1970 National Agreement. This would, for example, have meant that Deputies would have had the first part of their rise under these rounds to a figure of £3,029 on 1st <Col N="830" /> January, 1972, and there would have been a couple of rises since, ending up with the actual figure that is being awarded now.  Senators also would have had equivalent rises.  The Government decided not to do this.  The only argument put forward was that put forward by the Minister for Finance in the Dáil that it would have been quite improper for us, as politicians, to get any money before the new social welfare increases took place on 1st July last.</P>
    <P>I am unable to see what social welfare, or social welfare payments, have to do with the matter.  If they have anything to do with it, one might legitimately say that there were increases in social welfare under Fianna Fáil in 1969, 1970, 1971 and again in 1972.  On none of those occasions was any additional payment made to Members of the Oireachtas.  If it is not right that Members of the Oireachtas should get an increase until an increase has been given in the social welfare allowances, then what about the judges and the higher civil servants who are being paid retrospectively?</P>
    <P>As has already been pointed out, one unfortunate result of the retrospection recommended by the Employer/Labour Conference has been that those who either lost their seats in the recent general election, or, as in a number of cases, retired have been deprived of the opportunity of getting the equivalent in increased pensions.  Like Senator Lenihan, I was very happy to hear it stated in the Dáil that the Government are going to consider this entire question of the pensions of former Members of the Oireachtas.  It is, as he mentioned, an appalling situation that former Members of the Oireachtas, and in many cases their widows, should be trying to exist in this day and age on pensions which, particularly if they date before 1968, must be very small indeed.</P>
    <P>As Senator Robinson mentioned, there is clearly a need for really well qualified Senators and Deputies.  Apart from the constant increase in the complexity of modern life, there are the matters that we have to deal with <Col N="831" /> in the two Houses of the Oireachtas and our entry into the EEC quite clearly poses a whole range of new problems for us.  For this reason it was extraordinarily ill-advised of the Government to have omitted altogether in the first draft of this Bill any reference to increased money for the Opposition to pay for research, particularly in view of the additional problems posed by our entry into the EEC.  Fortunately, with a great deal of unnecessary trouble and difficulty, the situation has been righted.  The draft for the Bill which comes to us now does include a reasonable sum for research for the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that in future these matters of increases in allowances should be dealt with no longer by legislation but by Government order.  I do not agree with Senator Robinson that this is a bad thing.  This is a good decision.  It is a tidier and more efficient way of dealing with the matter than this business of bringing in legislation each time increased allowances are to be paid to Senators and Deputies.</P>
    <P>In the Bill as it comes before us there is, however, one very serious omission, both in section 5 and section 11.  These sections provide that, where an order is proposed to be made under these sections, a draft is to be laid before Dáil Éireann and, if a resolution disapproving of the draft is passed by the Dáil within 21 days after the draft has been laid before the Dáil, then the order should not be made.  Why is Seanad Éireann not included in this?  Under this Bill this is going to be the last time that Seanad Éireann will ever again be in a position to discuss its own allowances, or the allowances of the Cathaoirleach, Leas-Chathaoirleach, members of the Government, or indeed Members of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>This seems to be an extraordinary omission which I am unable to understand. I propose to put down an amendment on Committee Stage to remedy this matter.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, I think the new system is on the whole an improvement. There is one vital thing that the <Col N="832" /> Government must at all times keep in mind.  Under this proposal, they must report regularly.  What has created all the difficulty, not merely on this occasion but on previous occasions, has been that because we as politicians were, in what Senator Robinson curiously called the privileged position of fixing our own salaries, and because of the public odium thereby involved, long periods were allowed to elapse.  Even to keep up with the cost of living what seemed to the public like very large increases had to be awarded.  It is therefore essential that the Government at least as often as there is a national wage agreement, and in the absence of such an agreement at least every two years or so&mdash;not more than two years &mdash;should make whatever consequential changes are needed in salaries for Deputies, Senators, Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and officers of the House.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing that we should understand precisely the nature of the increases we are awarding to ourselves in this Bill.  On the face of it in money terms they seem high.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in the course of his speech introducing this Bill, said that the increases now proposed were in line with the increases given to public servants generally.</P>
    <P>That is simply not correct.  He added: &ldquo;Under the 12th round of the national agreements&rdquo;.  I will accept that part of it.  But what about the earlier rounds which he mentioned at the start of his speech?  It is worthwhile considering how we have fared in comparison with other sections. Take one single income instance&mdash;figures that we were given as an incentive proposed recently for average earnings and hours worked by skilled and unskilled operatives in the building trades.  Between December, 1970 and December, 1972, a period of two years, the average earnings per hour of skilled operatives went up by 36.7 per cent and of unskilled and semi-skilled operatives by 40.2 per cent.  It is five years ago yesterday since any increase was awarded to Senators, Deputies and Ministers, the Cathaoirleach and so on.  The increases being given in this Bill to Senators and <Col N="833" /> Deputies are in each case less than that.  In five years we have been awarded less than skilled, unskilled and semi-skilled building operatives were able to obtain in 24 months. Perhaps it might be said that this is not a particularly good comparison. There are reasons why in the building trades wages and earnings would increase considerably more rapidly than the actual cost of living.</P>
    <P>Let us take the Civil Service itself. Let us consider a typical figure for higher executive officers.  They are under the control of the Minister for Finance who has brought in this Bill. The figures are rather interesting.  A higher executive officer, for example, who in August 1968&mdash;that is the month we last got an increase&mdash;at the minimum of the scale had £1,400 per year, just £100 less than a Senator at that time, in July 1973 would have had £2,330.  In other words, he started off £100 a year lower than a Senator in August 1968, and he now has £307 per year more.</P>
    <P>Take the example of a higher executive officer at the maximum of the B scale who in August, 1968, had £2,300, £200 less than a Deputy's salary at that time, last month had £3,574.  He started £200 lower than a Deputy and in five years he has climbed up to £158 ahead of a Deputy.  These are typical figures, not just individuals here and there, covering many hundreds and, perhaps, even thousands of civil servants.  I am not suggesting that the allowances fixed in this Bill should be increased but we should be quite clear that we have slipped back very seriously over the past five years.  Since one gathers that in future under these Government orders we are to be kept abreast of new pay rounds, national wage agreements and so on, we may take it that we are never going to catch up again; we have been downgraded in our salaries and for a number of years to come, it is quite clear, that is the way we are going to remain.</P>
    <P>I do not know why matters were arranged in this way but, apart from Senators and Deputies, it does appear to be altogether extraordinary that the Cathaoirleach, for example, should have been given an increase of 12.15 <Col N="834" /> per cent and the Leas-Chathaoirleach, for some reason, did rather better and got 20.3 per cent.  In each case the figures were vastly below the actual increase in the cost of living and vastly below what everybody else, including journalists, got.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say on the Bill except to urge the Government with all the strength at my command that it is absolutely essential that there should no longer be these long gaps of five years, or longer, in making these changes.  Much smaller changes at more frequent intervals in line with what civil servants and other sections get are what is needed.  I would stress again that the amendment I propose to put down is one of vital importance from the point of view of the Seanad. It seems to me altogether extraordinary that a Bill like this should be brought in completely depriving the Seanad on any future occasion of the right to discuss our salaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSanfey" hpid="Mr. Sanfey Mr. Sanfey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sanfey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at the outset to endorse what the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Russell and other Senators said with regard to the granting of parity to Oireachtas pensioners and particularly to their widows.  The principle of parity in pensions payable in the public sector has been recognised for years as being correct and equitable.  It is unfair that Deputies and Senators and in particular their widows should be denied this parity.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this point and I hope the Government will introduce legislation in the near future to cope with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the allowances provided for in this Bill for parties in general, I should like to congratulate the Minister on recognising the need for the payment of this allowance to the Government party in respect of the research facilities to be provided for backbenchers.  This point was conceded in the debate in the other House by several Opposition speakers.  There is no difference as far as the rank and file Deputies are concerned whether or not they serve on the backbench of the Government party or on the Opposition party.  In the party to which I belong the transition from Opposition to Government has not meant that a <Col N="835" /> magic wand has been waved over the backbenchers as regards the information available to help them with their work.  This I believe has been the experience of the Labour Party also.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned in several debates in this House during the last few weeks that the volume of work consequent on our entry into the EEC has increased tenfold.  Government backbench Deputies have, of course, the same need for assistance in dealing with this.  It is true to say that the experience of the average Deputy on the Government side of the House has been that the transition from Opposiion to Government has meant that work has doubled or possibly trebled and anything the Minister can do to alleviate their lot is more than welcome.</P>
    <P>Again, on the question of the allowance payable to parties, I notice in this Bill and, indeed, in the Act of 1968 that it is referred to as &ldquo;allowance payable to the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Government, the Leader of the party&rdquo;, <i>et cetera.</i>  I am sure it is not necessary to stress this point in this House, but the wording &ldquo;an allowance payable to the Leader&rdquo; has in my experience given rise to misconceptions at various levels of the organisation.  I wish to take this opportunity of saying in respect of the Fine Gael Party, that the allowance which was paid to us in Opposition was entirely devoted to the betterment of the facilities available to Deputies both by way of research facilities and the secretarial work associated with that.</P>
    <P>At the risk of labouring the point, I want to spell out that the Leader of my Party did not get one penny from this allowance either by way of extra salary, extra expenses or payment under any other guise.  What other parties do with their money is, of course, their own business.  I would not like anything I say to be interpreted as telling them what to do with their money, but I want to put it on the record of the House that as far as our party are concerned this money was entirely devoted to the betterment of the facilities available to Deputies and Senators.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> Another point in regard to this allowance was made by an Opposition Deputy in the Dáil when he said that as far as the Government Deputies were concerned it represented a hidden salary increase.  He went so far as to say that it was an increase given to Deputies of the Government party in defiance of the national wage agreement. He gave the impression that he believed that the payment of the small sum now provided for the Government party would relieve Deputies and Senators&mdash;of the Fine Gael Party at any rate&mdash;of paying the monthly levy which we all pay to help with the secretarial facilities of the party.  I want to refute this.  It is not true.  As Senator Lenihan mentioned, it is the practice in all parties that Deputies and Senators make a reasonably substantial monthly contribution to help with the secretarial facilities available to them.  The payment which the Government envisage for the Government party will go some of the way to supplement this contribution, but it will not relieve Deputies and Senators of the need for paying it in future.</P>
    <P>On the whole question of the expenses of political parties, I do not have to labour the point, talking to fellow Senators who are well aware of the expenses which face a political party, that the great proportion of the money which we need to run our party is raised by the organisation throughout the country.  This will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>Finally, I find myself in disagreement with the point made by Senator Robinson about the steps which the Government envisage for dealing with the problem of Oireachtas salaries in future.  I am particularly glad to note that Senator Yeats is of the same opinion.  Twice in the past six years I have seen the time of both Houses taken up with this question of increases in allowances to Deputies and Senators.  As Senator Yeats rightly pointed out, the manner in which it has been handled has caused considerable public odium.  I will not go in any detail into what happened in the House last week, but there is no doubt that the manner in which these increases have been handled in <Col N="837" /> the past has annoyed the public and given rise to much unfavourable comment.  For that reason, I am very pleased to see in this Bill that the Government propose in future, when the question of Oireachtas allowances arises, to deal with it by way of a regulation to be laid before both Houses.  I commend the Minister for Finance on his courage in that respect.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  The most important sections, and the ones to which I give a particular welcome, are sections 5 and 11, under which the Government have rightly taken the power to adjust salaries by Government order as and when required. In a period of inflation, in which we are at present, and to which there does not appear to be any foreseeable end, this is the only logical approach to all salary adjustments.  It is absurd that we should have to have a Bill every time the salaries of Members of the Oireachtas have to be brought into line with cost-of-living increases.  It is worse than that, because in the past the Government of the day always allowed the adjustments to pile up and were unwilling to bring in an adjustment Bill more frequently than every three or four years.  This meant that the increases to be brought in at that stage appeared to be totally out of line with what was being given at that time in the then current wages agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen the disruptive effect of this approach in the past.  We had one grotesque situation where the increase brought in amounted to 50 per cent because the Government had not done their duty over the previous five or seven years.  The present increase, which in the case of Dáil salaries is almost 30 per cent, appears to be out of line even with the 9 per cent which is due on 1st July.  This is due solely to the fact that no adjustment was made since 1968.  The disruptive effect of this apparent bad example by the Government of these very sizeable increases has been evident over the past 12 years.  We have appealed again and again in this House and elsewhere for the Government to take the steps which <Col N="838" /> they are now taking under sections 5 and 11.  Personally, I cannot see why previous Governments did not take this very simple and obvious step.  I commend this approach.  It will remove the question of Oireachtas salaries out of the realm of unjustified criticism and will not allow it to be used as a disruptive factor in wage agreements.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to ask: does Parliament really value the service which is given?  It is acknowledged that Members of the Dáil are, by and large, full-time.  I doubt that many Members of the Dáil spend less than 40 hours a week on the job.  With the representations they have to make, they are spending much more time than that.  They are full-time servants in the service of this State.  They are in a leadership role.  On them depends the maintenance and development of our democracy.  Is it not farcical to suggest that a Deputy should be paid £3,400 per year when a junior lecturer, grade I, in the regional technical colleges is paid £3,800 a year.  That is the going rate and he is worth it.  A lecturer, grade I, is paid £4,300 per year.</P>
    <P>As quoted by Senator Yeats, if we take corresponding Civil Service grades, the executive and administrative arm of the State, we find that the maximum for the higher executive officer and the administrative officer is £3,600, that is over £200 a year more than Deputies.  It can be said that the administrative officer grade is a career grade.  On entry into the grade, promotion is more or less assured within six years, if the person performs adequately.  In the same way, the higher executive officer is in the career structure and neither of these salaries is subject to many of the expenses that fall on Deputies with party contributions <i>et cetera</i> all of which are allowed or accepted as being real by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Is it fair to expect whole-time service from Deputies at salaries much lower than the relatively middle Civil Service grades, without any permanency or any of the other advantages associated with the Civil Service or the teaching profession?  I mentioned the scales in the regional <Col N="839" /> technical colleges.  Today they are about the same as the lecturer scales in the universities&mdash;about £300 less per annum.</P>
    <P>If that is the level we must be realistic and face up to being in Europe.  We can no longer confine our attention to this little island.  I appeal to the Government to give some thought to this after the recess.  Do we accept that membership of the Oireachtas is to be confined to a class who have money and profession and cannot be contemplated by anyone in a career position from which he has to take leave of absence?</P>
    <P>We need full-time service if we pay full-time salaries.  At present we are only paying part-time salaries for full-time service in the Dáil.  We need full-time service for full-time salaries.  Full-time service is required of the relatively few Members there are in the Oireachtas when set against the tasks of keeping abreast of affairs today and especially the complications in the EEC.  The solution is quite simple and is not even original as it is in operation in the Netherlands and elsewhere. A Member of the Oireachtas, especially a Member of the Dáil, would be required to be seconded from his post which means that the salary of a replacement would be paid.  Anyone in a regular position could have somebody appointed in secondment.  A farmer devoting all his time to this work could have a full-time assistant paid to take his place in his occupation.  Senators at present are paid a part-time salary for part-time work.  That is fair enough. But a part-time Seanad is not good enough for the duties we must face.  We should gradually work for a more full-time type of Seanad and the secondment principle, when introduced into the Dáil might in time, depending on the development of an adequate committee system and a justification for the services involved, be applied to the Seanad also.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Government, we have fewer than 180 Members between the Dáil and Seanad.  In a modern complex society, with the complex relations we have with the EEC, unless we are prepared to leave all that to the <Col N="840" /> career civil servants, it will take even more than 180 committed and full-time Members of the Oireachtas to ensure that the outside view is brought in, that the non-Civil Service view is present and is brought in to balance out the Civil Service view in an attempt to develop our own country within the EEC and so make some positive contribution to the development of thinking in Europe.  Undoubtedly, we have a strong contribution to make there. We have much to offer with our strong Christian tradition, our traditions of democracy and the difficulties and travails we had in reaching that stage.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Government have taken in sections 5 and 11 the powers to adjust what is there.  This does not enable the Government to make secondment payments.  That would mean introducing a new Bill but it is very well worth while and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to bring it to the attention of the Government.</P>
    <P>While the level of salary proposed for Ministers which is approximately £8,000 and for Parliamentary Secretaries which is £6,000 seems, in our full-time management career structure to be reasonable, by contrast the £3,400 to a Deputy who is giving full-time service obviously appears to be inadequate.  This affects all parties whether in the Opposition or in Government.  There is a need for the ordinary rank and file of the Government party in any Government to make themselves felt in Government circles and to ensure that the Government of the day, whatever party they are, do not slowly settle in again to being merely messengers from their civil servants.</P>
    <P>On the question of EEC affairs, the Government should make provision for travel for members to and from Europe or take a liberal view on that to ensure that Members of both Houses become familiar with the matters in Europe in which they are interested or to which they can make a contribution.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Robinson on her criticism of sections 5 and 11.  This is something we have been asking for years.  We should not laud the question <Col N="841" /> of debate.  While we have some excellent debates in the Seanad, a debate is essentially a rather 18th century approach to affairs.  There is not the cut and thrust which is the hall-mark of a proper committee.  The contribution of the Seanad should be measured not alone by the number of hours we spend in the Chamber but on the contributions the Seanad makes to committees. At present these are nonexistent apart from the Statutory Instruments Committee and one or two other Committees that meet very rarely.</P>

      <P>I know that.  We have made a beginning, but rather than trying to spend greatly increased hours here in the Chamber it would be far better for us to spend those hours in committees to which we can make contributions.  There is no point in sitting on committees in which we are not interested and to which we have not a contribution to make.  Let us divide up the work and make the European Communities Committee the first of many specialist committees working from here.  That is the best way in which we can make our contributions.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I wish to support the strictures that have been made on the Press reporting of the proceedings of Seanad Éireann.  It is an absolute disgrace that Liz Taylor and Richard Burton got far more headlines in our national newspapers than a serious three-day debate on the state of the nation got last January.  At that time we had an excellent debate here ranging over the different economic aspects of our country on the Appropriation Bill.  The following day I scanned two of our national daily newspapers&mdash;I will exempt the <i>Cork Examiner</i> as it carried some report of the debate&mdash;for a report on the proceedings of Seanad Éireann. We might as well have not disturbed our Christmas vacation to meet here on 11th January for all the coverage we got in the Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an excellent, very moderate and very constructive debate on that occasion, but there was no mudslinging <Col N="842" /> in it so it did not make the headlines.  I hope the Press will adopt a sense of balance and will endeavour to get away from sensationalism and give adequate coverage to the Seanad proceedings.  The Dáil, I believe, is reported excessively and almost verbatim in an effort to try to create the sense of some type of wild debating society.  Again, I do not think that kind of reporting does justice to the Dáil.  The Press have a serious responsibility and they should live up to it.</P>
    <P>That famous institution up the road called Montrose should realise that before giving prominence to Members of Seanad Eireann it is necessary for us to become pets of theirs but once we disagree with the official Montrose ultra-liberal line we are out. I got two invitations to appear on television programmes over the last 12 years.  One was for a one-and-a-half minute appearance on a United Nations programme.  Whatever person was the brains behind that programme conceived that I would be the critic and the attacker of the United Nations to wind up the programme.  I made it clear to them that they had me cast wrongly.  I may be critical of the United Nations at times but we are far better off with such an organisation than we are without it. At that stage I found that the programme's interest in me was receding. In any case I told them I was far too busy to come to Dublin to appear for one-and-a-half minutes on a television programme.  They said they would send a taxi to collect me but I declined the offer.</P>
    <P>About two years after that experience I received another invitation to appear on a programme on censorship. I found myself cast&mdash;and I agree with the drama criticism&mdash;in the role of the man who was totally pro-censorship. Where that idea came from I do not know, but I pointed out that that was not one of my special fields of study. My field is education, agriculture and a bit of national economics.  I have never made a special study of censorship and I told him I was not prepared to go on such a programme but I would be only too pleased to appear on a programme on a subject I am interested in and to <Col N="843" /> make a contribution to it.  That was five years ago and the silence is still deafening.  That is not facing up to responsibility.</P>

      <P>I know I am straying from the Bill but I should like to get on the record the &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; approach of Montrose to what they think public representatives should do.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Government again on sections 5 and 11. The Opposition should be complimented on succeeding in having increased the allowance to the Opposition which, I believe, is justified.  On the other hand, the fact that the Government listened to the strong case put forward by the Opposition augurs well for the future.  It encourages groups around the country, whether they are parent/teacher associations, school groups and so forth, never to accept no for an answer.  If you have a case, go and make it.  I hope it will become a characteristic of this Government, after a hard case has been made to them, to admit that they may have been wrong and that the Opposition were right.  This is a characteristic of good Government.</P>
      <P>I can never understand why politicians have to place so much reliance on feeling that they have not changed. Our whole society is changing.  Science is changing.  The hallmark of a scientist is to be able to admit that there are more facts available, more experiments available and more knowledge available now and that their previous theories or decisions were inadequate and wrong and may have to be reversed.  The same can be said of the science of politics and the science of Government&mdash;things are always changing.  Therefore, I hope the Government will not in any way be tied by this fear of change but will relish the opportunity of getting up and saying that the facts have changed and their decision has changed also.  I commend the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with those who have paid <Col N="844" /> tribute to the standard of the debate in this House.  Many people who have spoken have decided to address soul-searching questions to themselves. Senator Robinson has asked such questions, by implication, as &ldquo;How relevant are we?&rdquo; In most cases the discussion has been, rather than concentrating narrowly on allowances, on the general principle as to how we can improve the standard of parliamentary performance.</P>
      <P>When we are discussing raising our allowances or salaries we face the type of criticism that the Minister has made reference to in his speech. We are voting ourselves the increase and, more than that, this places us in a particular position in our society.  To put it in more fundamental terms, when people ask you: &ldquo;Are you going to the Seanad this week?&rdquo; they usually say: &ldquo;I am sure you are.  You are voting yourselves an increase.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When we are voting ourselves increases, it is appropriate that we discuss and justify the rules of both Chambers of the Oireachtas.  When an increase in the salary of a Senator is proposed, one should spell out what the future of the Seanad is going to be. I believe the structures of Parliament in both Houses are not suitable for the modern legislative process.  The role of the Deputy and Senator as defined in the procedures of both Houses represents an uncritical acceptance of institutional structures of another century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure many Deputies and Senators feel this and many of them have been commenting on it.  Senators have said that they want to do more work, and do this work more efficiently. Senator Robinson, in her speech, drew our attention to the two facets of a Deputy's or Senator's life, on the one hand, that of representation and, on the other hand, that of legislation.  We really need to ask ourselves the question: are we effectively representing people in the true spirit of democracy at all?  When it comes to legislation, there are a number of procedural changes which probably would enable us to legislate more effectively.  Taking the first of these, that is the business of representation itself, I am becoming more convinced that we need to <Col N="845" /> devolve as much decision-making as possible on natural local communities if we are to preserve democracy.  Last week I heard a person on this side of the House say he had fought for our entry into Europe&mdash;with respect I was one of those who fought to keep us out of Europe.  Whether we like it or not we are in Europe and decision-making has been removed from this country to a new centre.  We need to counterbalance the centralisation of decision-making by devolving as much decision-making as possible to natural communities and particularly to the regions.</P>
    <P>Removed from the crush of very immediate minor matters, the Deputies and Senators could be representative of an area at a more general, possibly a more remote sense.  Again, in regard to legislation when people speak&mdash;for example, and I was glad to hear it in the Seanad&mdash;they did not quibble about the exact sum given for research and secretarial assistance.  I do not believe&mdash;and I said it on my first day in this Chamber&mdash;that the provision of an increased sum of money will change radically the role of either House.  I believe the only way we will effectively give both Houses more power and involve more Deputies and Senators is by the establishment of a legislative research bureau.  I spoke about this before and I want to say exactly what I mean.  I think Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas should have access to a body of expert and critical opinion. If I might take one example of this, concerning the elimination of poverty&mdash;to put it more fundamentally, the removal of inequality in our society&mdash;there are a number of strategies which are appropriate and which have been tried in industrialised capitalist countries.  There are strategies which have been tried in countries which do not hold with such a philosophy.  Any Deputy or Senator should have a bureau to which he could go and simply say: &ldquo;I believe that there are interesting approaches towards the elimination of inequality, towards the checks on developing bureaucracy in a particular eastern country&rdquo; and such a package would be prepared for him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" /> In relation to poverty he might want to say: &ldquo;I believe that the pretence of eliminating poverty in the United States has failed, that it has been a disaster; I believe there have been changes in some States.  Could we have information on this?  The idea then of a Senator, for example, or a Deputy going along taking any particular theme and receiving advice on it is one that goes far beyond merely giving an extra £1,000 or £2,000.</P>
    <P>I should like Members of both Houses to give some kind of comment on or commitment to such procedure. It would mean that any Deputies, backbenchers, particularly in the Dáil, and Senators would be far more involved. I disagree with one sentence in the Minister's speech.  On section 12 he says:</P>
    <P>The Civil Service can, of course, be relied upon to provide the Government with the necessary backing and research.</P>
    <P>With respect to the Civil Service&mdash;and I think they have been blamed far too much in the history of the State for a number of things for which they are not guilty&mdash;I humbly suggest that there is a particular kind of information which they can provide.  They can provide a Minister with some description of the implications of his decision.  But what they are offering is a rather narrow pragmatic opinion based on immediate facts.  It would be far too much to suggest that the Civil Service, as at present constituted, is capable of taking several alternative approaches, drawn from different ideologies, and placing these before the Government or before Deputies and Senators. Rather than having, on the one hand, suggested allowances and secretarial help and research facilities for people who are not in Government and the suggestion that the Civil Service can fulfil the role of research for the Government, we should move towards the establishment of a new bureau.  It would certainly involve Members far more than they are at the present time.</P>
    <P>Such a bureau in many cases as I have described it before, would help dispel a myth that is involved in this country, that is, that you have a strange <Col N="847" /> breed of people who scurry around the country kissing babies and shaking hands who have long suffering wives with sprained wrists from writing letters and these are &ldquo;the Government&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Opposition&rdquo;.  We should realise that there are a number of people who do not want to get involved in the bustle of politics but who should contribute to the life of the nation.  I should like to put on record that I believe that the history of academics in Ireland has been a disgraceful one.  In many cases, quite rightly, they have defended their right to academic freedom.  They have chosen, however, with marked and distinguished exceptions, to exercise their academic freedom by silence.  I should like to see, in such a bureau, academics drawn from the home community and from foreign universities and institutes participating within it.</P>
    <P>To return more centrally to the Bill itself, I have said the Minister, in his speech, spoke about the role of the Deputy.  I have been speaking about a procedure which would increase the legislative effectiveness of a Senator and Deputy.  Senator Robinson has said that in the course of debate Deputies find themselves writing letters and doing jobs and tasks which would more accurately be performed by an ombudsman, a citizens' advice bureau, <i>et cetera.</i>  The Minister, in his speech, mentions in the discussion of the Deputy's role the Deputy has no claim to overtime pay and despite the fact that his job may require him to write thousands of letters on behalf of his constituents he gets no allowance for secretarial services.</P>
    <P>I am against patronage systems.  I think patronage systems emerge where bureaucracy has intervened between the natural rights of the citizens and the decision-making apparatus of the State, but the point is that without the intervening Deputies and Senators many people in our society would be in a state of great bewilderment.  Many people are ignorant of their rights.  I support the proposal to establish citizens' advice bureaux, to appoint ombudsmen, <i>et cetera,</i> and to relieve the Deputy for the more serious tasks of reflection and of legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="848" /> Let us be clear.  I doubt if any Deputy welcomes this chore of writing thousands of letters.  It is very easy to come into either the Dáil or the Seanad and simply pillory Deputies.  Deputies and Senators have been victims to some extent of the structures which exist.  At a date very soon in the future we should examine the role, purpose and operations of both of our Houses.</P>
    <P>In discussing the increased remuneration proposed for Senators people have said we are part-time workers in a part-time Assembly.  Some people want us to be full-time workers in a full-time Assembly.  Other people want us to be seconded to the Seanad and have people doing the jobs from which we fled promoted.  If we are to be an effective Assembly we should be a fully critical Assembly.  We should be allowed, in the structure of the ordering of business by the Government in power at the time, to discuss matters of national and international importance. We should be capable and willing to discuss all aspects of human life in so far as it has implications to the society for which, theoretically, we are legislating.  We should be able to discuss ideological issues.  I often get the impression, listening to some of the debates in the other House, that we are involved in one vast housekeeping exercise rather than in a legislative process.  It is generally assumed that we have no control over certain types of influences which affect our society and our economy.  It is presumed, for example, that inevitably we must react to international economic influences. We may never question them or ever seek to control them.</P>
    <P>When I read the Official Reports of both Houses of the Oireachtas in discussing the notion of inflation it is presented as something between pneumonia and the 'flu.  It happens.  Somebody&mdash;out of charity I will not give his name&mdash;referred to the problem by saying there is inflation everywhere. That is like saying the whole country is down with the 'flu.  This notion that people sitting in both Houses are powerless, hopeless people, who must react at best in a kind of a housekeeping fashion, is unsatisfactory, to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> A committee system drawn from both Houses of the Oireachtas would change this.  Other Senators have spoken about the advantages of the committee system and I do not wish to be repetitive.  A developed committee system would involve a greater number of Deputies and Senators.  In the Seanad people differ ideologically. There are many of us who have different views concerning the philosophical basis of different economic and social systems.  The Seanad is an appropriate place to discuss these problems. If we cannot discuss them here then we are just a very shabby, poor version of the other House.</P>
    <P>I would agree that the economy and society have to be managed, but I am getting a little weary of people not referring to basic questions, such as, for example: why do people work? In what way are people's lives governed by working in circumstances over which they have no control?  To what extent are human populations moved by the demands of capital investment? If we cannot ask these questions, then we are being a little dishonest in giving ourselves more money.</P>
    <P>I see the Seanad as a critical body examining all aspects of society and allowing for differences.  I am a socialist. I do not believe that people who practise the private enterprise system are doing it because they are possessed by the devil.  They have been acculturated into a set of norms and beliefs.  They have a certain theory of human nature.  Man is naturally acquisitive. Man is naturally greedy.  He must be forever acquiring goods. Human concerns are impractical concerns. The idea that the economy would serve social and human goals is not acceptable to them.  We should be able to explain where we stand towards each other.  We should be able to present our reactions fully, generously and honestly.  If we did this we could inform legislative instruments. This is the role I would have in mind for the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Somebody said to me: &ldquo;I believe you are in the Seanad now.  What does the Seanad do?&rdquo; You could give people like this all this documentation <Col N="850" /> we get, which would lose you a friend for life.  It might be useful.  In reading through the Seanad debates I believe that the first Seanad was a good one. It was a good Seanad because they were able to discuss fundamental human issues in a very generous, broad and flexible manner.  The Seanad of which Senator W.B. Yeats was a member was an excellent one. It lost a lot when it was reconstituted in 1937.  But the time has come now for us to examine again our structure and our role.  We should do so, but not by giving ourselves more money. The proposal in the Bill to increase our remuneration raises another question. It would be unfair to expect it in this Bill, but I should like if at some future date there could be a discussion on the salaries of those who will constitute the regional assemblies, structured as they may be in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to what Senator Quinlan said.  He has attacked the Press for reporting inadequately on the proceedings of the Seanad.  In fairness it should be remembered that reporters are under a certain amount of editorial pressure.  Sometimes their material is printed and sometimes it is not.  The Senator also attacked Montrose.  Now that we are going to have better-paid people in the Seanad and now that we have an indication that we may be moving towards a committee system, perhaps the Press will report on our proceedings more adequately.  One of the surest ways of getting coverage for ourselves is to begin to assume a more responsible, complete, humane and honest role. We should not apologise to anybody for increasing our salaries.  What we should do is to use the opportunity in getting a long-overdue raise to explain to the public that we wish to change these 19th century structures in such a way as will enable us to perform a useful and critical role in the 20th century.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill, but I am disappointed that a section dealing with pensions was not introduced. I was glad to hear Senator Lenihan in the opening words of his speech <Col N="851" /> stressing the importance of revision of pensions.  I know how important a pension is because my mother is in receipt of a pension.  She was the wife of a Deputy in the Dáil from 1922 to 1927.  He served as a Senator for 28 years.  The total sum she is receiving for that period of public service given by her husband is £365 per year. When I became a Senator I made it my business to approach the then Minister for Finance to discuss this problem with him.</P>
      <P>The impression I got was that the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; was bare and nothing could be given.  That is the reason I hoped that some provision would be introduced in this Bill dealing with pensions. My mother gave service to the State because she was the wife of a Deputy from 1922 to 1927.  They were difficult years.  She reared a family of seven.  She had to stay up at night waiting for her husband to come home.  She worried a lot.  The pension she is receiving was contributed to by her husband.  She has to pay tax to the State on that pension.  I am glad mention was made of pensions because it gives me the opportunity to urge the Minister to do something urgently about them.</P>
      <P>There are many other aspects of the Bill on which I should like to speak but there is one point I should like to make after listening to the debate, and that is that the Seanad has served the country well since its foundation. Very little change should be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was supporting the increase for Members of this House.  There are two different roles a Senator can play and the two different types of Seanad Members have completely different functions and different approaches to this House.  I try to understand the Senator who is very eloquent and who can do justice to himself and do his homework and research and do a fine job in the Seanad, then picks up his papers, walks out and that is almost the end of his contribution.  In many cases these are highly professional people such as professors or lecturers or those involved in bodies closely associated with parliamentary work. It becomes easy for them to deliver a fine speech.</P>
      <P>All too often we must accept criticism from these people about the need for a Member of the Seanad to get involved in the day-to-day problems in rural areas.  They say this is unnecessary and that a Member of the Seanad brings this upon himself. I should like to think that half the Members of the Seanad and especially those who are elected are also members of local authorities which involves them in practical work such as meeting constituents.  The Senator must equip himself with knowledge of the administration in the local authority. He must know who is entitled to a medical card, who is entitled to social welfare benefits and all the various grants, aids and everything the rural community are entitled to.  This knowledge can only be obtained if you are actively involved and attend meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the experience of attending a county council meeting on a Monday, a health board meeting on a Tuesday, a meeting of the Seanad on a Wednesday and Thursday, a planning meeting on a Friday, a clinic on a Saturday and two or three other meetings on a Sunday.  There are numerous other demands on our time such as attending meetings in connection with local development schemes, <Col N="853" /> group water schemes and the further development of areas.</P>
    <P>This is an aspect that cannot be seen, or understood, by the people who come into this House and deliver very fine speeches having undertaken research into the subject matter.  They are two different approaches.  I try to understand those people who deliver very eloquent speeches and who look at the administrative side purely from the theoretical point of view.  However, I hope those people will acknowledge that there is a practical side to being a Member of this House.</P>
    <P>I find it very necessary to be actively involved in administration.  I am not boasting when I say that most weeks I exceed 300 letters, and I write these letters not because I wish to have any monuments erected to me as a great correspondent.  I find it difficult work wading through a pile of notes and unfinished work.</P>
    <P>The salary is a very small consideration for this job.  It is very small and I have no hesitation in stating that I am in favour of increasing it.  I hope that it will not be embarrassing for any Member to support the increase which is meagre enough.</P>
    <P>I hope the time is at hand when it will not be necessary for the Members of the Dáil and Seanad to grant themselves increases.  Let us look at the salary a Senator receives at present.  I get £110 per month which is just the same as a postman gets for working 30 hours.  In fact, a sorter in a post office gets more.  After the elections very few Members of the Seanad, especially those Members who had to work hard to be elected, had a credit balance in the bank. That, in itself, indicates that the reward for being elected a Member of the Seanad is not all that the public are led to believe by those who talk most in this House.  It is a pity that those Members who make such very fine contributions do not get down to meeting their own supporters and find out their needs.  They might have the theory but they do not have the practical knowledge.</P>
    <P>Many Senators are lucky because their own people do not find it easy <Col N="854" /> to approach them.  They manage to steer a course where they do not have to come into contact with their supporters but they should consider the Members of this House who are daily in contact with the public.  I have no desire to prolong this debate and I shall conclude by saying that it is absolutely necessary that the Members of the Seanad should be rewarded for their efforts on behalf of the public.  I hope this Bill will be carried, that every Member of the House will support it and that we will not find ourselves having to come back here to go through this procedure again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the whole subject of Members' allowances, whether we are entitled to get the increases or whether we are treated equitably compared with people who are dealt with under the national wage agreements, has been well and truly covered by now.  There can be no argument about the question of the increases because since 1968 we have had about four or five rounds of increases.  The percentages that have been gained outside since 1968&mdash;whether by a free-for-all or through national agreements&mdash;would compare more favourably than the increases that are being considered here today.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that people here might get upset about the effects of salary increases on public opinion.  It depends on what they are talking about when they say &ldquo;public opinion&rdquo;.  Is it their own friends they mean?  To say that the working classes would object to such increases is an insult to their intelligence.  What they do is to react and they do so because the amounts seem to be substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one particular wage agreement, under the various anomaly clauses, one can negotiate a flat increase of £2 plus £2.50 for productivity.  That is a sum of £4.50 for one year coupled with the second phase, which has yet to come, which is based on an escalator clause and which will yield up to another £2 per week.  In other words, under an 18 months agreement, it is quite possible for an ordinary worker to receive an increase in the region of £6 if he uses the national wage agreement <Col N="855" /> correctly.  Taking that into consideration, and the fact that there have been four or five rounds of increases since the last review of Members' salaries, nobody need worry that the workers will not understand the reasons for our increase.</P>
    <P>They will, naturally, react, but the confusion which now exists in their minds could be allayed by doing what is suggested in this Bill.  It is indicative of the new approach by the Government that they wish to make a ministerial order and give 21 days for people to argue against it, and time the increase to coincide with a general upward trend in wages.  A £10 increase looks very large when taken in isolation, but if you examine the agreements I have spoken of you will find that a £10 or a £12 increase has been exceeded, coupling the four increases that have come together.</P>
    <P>The real injustice lies in our dealings with people who have gone out on pension from the Oireachtas.  They have been living in a situation where there was a 10 per cent increase in the cost of living between 1972 and 1973 and the actual cost of food went up by 17 per cent.  Anybody trying to live on the present Oireachtas pension, without any other income, is very badly off compared with other people who come under pension schemes which are negotiable and revised from time to time.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ask the Minister, when he is looking at this question of Oireachtas pensions, to go back through the years and observe how the pension has lost its value in the sense of the inflationary terms we have and in the sense of real money incomes.  They will find there is justification there to introduce some sort of an augmentation system to bring them into line.  It might mean some people would get more than others depending on the period of time they have been out on pension, but there is need for some augmentation to bring up those people who have been a long time out, who have not been re-elected for many years; the same argument applies in the case of their widows.  A clause on the <Col N="856" /> lines I suggest would be very desirable.</P>
    <P>The other point is that we have now got in this year's Finance Bill a death in service benefit.  At one time one could realise only a year and a half or two years' pay but it will be possible under this Bill for an employer to pay up to four years' salary to a widow.</P>
    <P>There is no point in talking about the cost of living and leaving out one particular aspect of money incomes. When we talk of equity then we must be equitable in all spheres, with all sections and in all categories.  In this case the disadvantage of the pension scheme for Members of the Oireachtas is that there is no regular provision for looking at the cost of living. A clause could be inserted whereby the pension, if the cost of living went up by 10 per cent, could be reviewed or reviewed at the end of a period of two years.  The question of helping money to retain its value could be dealt with by means of a betterment clause.  This is not uncommon in pension funds.  If we are talking about falling into line or trying setting an example of the trend to be followed by people, acting only in accordance with what the national economy can stand and gearing their claims for salary and wage increases on that, these should all coalesce to avoid confusion.  The cost would not be very great in the context.  Things must start somewhere.  The first step is to augment the small pensions of people who have been a long time out on pension, in the interests of the men themselves or of their widows and, of course, the death in service benefit would be of great advantage to those women who suffer the hardships, as Senator Butler mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>The tone of the debate has removed all contention from the Bill.  The Dáil, in their little bit of a free-for-all, if you like, cleared the air and that has made discussion easier in the Seanad.  I should like to thank Senator Lenihan for his approach and Senator Russell for the way in which he responded to the tone set by Senator Lenihan.</P>
    <P>A contribution was made by one of my colleagues in which he argued there <Col N="857" /> was a greater function for the Seanad. I do not necessarily understand all the argument, but I agree with it in principle.  If we are saying that we must be looked at in a proper way and have salaries adjusted in accordance with national trends, and, if a meaningful role is to be played in society and public service, then I would agree with the Senator that some changes are needed in the present structure.  The only question is as to how one would go about this.  It appeared to me we were not actually talking about future reforms but as if we had already been reformed; we are merely in the process of trying to achieve reforms.  We would agree with any ideas of a gradual improvement in the functions we can perform, particularly in the initiation of constructive legislation for the benefit of the community as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill and I make no apology for starting on the question of pensions.  It is tremendously important that we recognise that some of those who have served this House well have lost their seats through no fault of theirs and found themselves and their dependents with no means of support.  We should concentrate on this issue.</P>
      <P>There are then those people who have been in this House since 1968 and who have not got any increase whatsoever while, under the national wage agreement, practically everyone in the public service has got the usual increases in each round.  The fault lies, more or less, with Deputies and Senators themselves.  The service they give the community should be adequately remunerated.  It is vital for the success of Parliament that people should be encouraged to enter politics provided they are capable of helping to shape the destiny of the nation.  To fail to remunerate them adequately for their labours is not the type of approach I would expect a Parliament to have towards its Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people in this House who have lost pensions because they have missed a day or two, something very small like that; they are borderline cases.  They occur in all spheres of employment. These cases in particular <Col N="858" /> should be re-examined because the Members who suffer have paid contributions. Pensions are really deferred payments.  Money earned by the Deputy or Senator is paid into a fund, but because he has not the necessary eight complete years he is deprived of a pension.  If he is not granted a pension he should be refunded the money he paid into the fund.</P>
    <P>With regard to the work of public representatives, Senators and Deputies, and I have experience in both Houses, who offer themselves as public representatives and are elected, they immediately cut themselves adrift from family life.  The amount of time they can devote to their own personal interests is definitely very limited. The usual way of life is late nights and early mornings.  It is true to say that their own homes are never really home, because they have to utilise possibly the finest room in the house as an office; a telephone must be installed if they are to remain in business and they must meet constituents at all hours of the day.  Even Sunday is never a free day.  That is the type of life of a rural Deputy or Senator. Most Senators have been Deputies and many Senators become Deputies so they have experience in both Houses. Once one is elected as a public representative to either the Seanad or the Dáil one can safely assume that for the rest of one's life one will certainly be approached by many, many people and never again, unless one moves out of the district, will one be able to revert to private life.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Senator McGowan said, that the average Senator is also a member of the county council, the vocational education committee, the regional development board, health boards and various other bodies connected with public life.  It is necessary for the public representative to keep himself reasonably well informed.  He must attend political and various other meetings.  Despite the fact that we are Senators we have been elected on political issues.  We have got to keep in touch with the ordinary man in the street.  We have got to take the lead in many cases.  When you are a public representative, and a Member of the <Col N="859" /> Oireachtas, it is necessary to attend meetings of voluntary organisations and other functions held in your constituency and to which you are invited. These things are expensive.  I can say from my own experience&mdash;and most Senators will share my view&mdash;that the remuneration we receive is hardly enough to enable us break even.</P>
    <P>It is very important that a public representative should be in a sound financial position.  He should never allow himself to get into debt.  If he is in a sound financial position like the village blacksmith &ldquo;he can look the whole world in the face for he owes not any man&rdquo;.  He will be able to stand up at a meeting of the County Council, or in the Dáil or Seanad, and speak out his mind plainly and bluntly.  Those are the type of public representatives I would like to see.  That is the way public representatives from all spheres of life look upon their duties.  It is a healthy outlook in any democracy.</P>
    <P>I would not like to see the position of a Deputy or a Senator being graded so low that the remuneration paid to them would not encourage others to enter into politics.  Politics can be a very satisfying type of life if you take the right interest in it.  It is the means whereby you can get things done.  Those who enter politics and drop out after a few years lose many golden opportunities which they would have had, had they remained in their professions or in the ordinary work in which they were engaged before they took up politics.  They are advanced in years. They are past the age limits.  They are unable to apply for positions and because of that they suffer financially. The public representative should be adequately paid, and should be worthy of his hire.  We should not fear in any way criticisms from outside or inside of what we are paid, provided we give a good account of our stewardship.  The public will soon decide that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome the introduction of this Bill. I also welcome the attitude adopted by the Opposition in debating it.  There has been so little dissension and so little acrimony in the debate that I am <Col N="860" /> reluctant to drag in one little note.  In his speech I thought Senator Lenihan harped a little too much on the ineptitude and incompetence of the Government and of the Minister of Finance. Everyone can cast stones.  He also mentioned that the allowances were not retrospective except to 1st July, 1973. I would point out to the Senator that the Government of which he was a member got the report in July, 1972, and did not get it back from the Employer/Labour Conference until December.  If that is so, they too can be charged with a certain amount of carelessness in regard to this matter. Senator Lenihan approached this in a very dignified manner and I hope I have made my point in an equally dignified manner.</P>
      <P>Another question has been raised here which has highlighted the role of the Seanad in a very spectacular way, that is, that we could stand up here and debate something in a very rational and logical way.  We have had many fine contributions on the broader issues of the role of the Senator, the role of the Seanad, the role of the Deputy and of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson mentioned that Senators and Deputies spend too much time in writing letters and that they misconceived their role as public representatives. This is a question which has very wide implications.  The fact that Senators and Deputies spend so much time in writing letters and making representations is part of the life they have taken on.  They accept it on those terms.  Prior to elections, prospective Deputies and Senators tell the public that they are prepared to work on their behalf.  They enter politics on this basis.  Because of that, the public expect a service from them. It would be at his peril that any Deputy or Senator would ignore the demands of the public in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Senators suggested that many of the problems dealt with by public representatives could be more efficiently and effectively dealt with through ombudsmen, information bureaux, <i>et cetera.</i>  Taking into consideration the attitude of the ordinary man in the street towards what is known as the bureaucracy, he would <Col N="861" /> view an ombudsman or bureau with the same jaundiced eye.  The Deputy or Senator would find himself going to the ombudsman in the same way as he finds himself today approaching the Minister or a civil servant seeking information.  By creating ombudsmen and bureaux, even though basically they are a very good idea, the public attitude towards them would be much the same as it is towards the Civil Service at the moment.  You could end up creating a second bureaucracy at a second level.  We in the Oireachtas would still be the buffer between the ordinary man in the street and this newly created bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>The increases are very welcome when we consider, as other Senators have pointed out, that the increases in other fields of activity since 1968 have been very large and that we have been left out in the cold.  We have created a bad image for ourselves in that we have to come to the Dáil and make a case for ourselves.  This is what we have to do because we had not the farsightedness to look to our own side of things in the past five years and make sure that our remuneration kept in line with national wage increases.</P>
    <P>The most welcome aspect of this Bill is the fact that from now on we will be in a position to take our increases in accordance with other sectors of the community.  This will do a great deal to remove the public cynicism which is often expressed when we have something like last week's debate in the Dáil, and people get the wrong impression. It is hard to blame the Press for this.  In general the Press give fair expression to what they see, but the public attitude towards the attitude adopted by us in the Oireachtas must be changed.  This provision in the Bill whereby we can increase our allowances on a par with other increases in other sectors is the most welcome portion of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to welcome the Parliamentary Secretary to the House for the first time.  I think I am voicing the views of all sides of the House in expressing that welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> There are just two points I should like to make.  They are a reiteration of points already made several times.  One deals with parity of pensions.  One of the first motions I ever tabled in this House was on the principle of parity of pensions.  It was debated, with the late Dr. Jim Ryan in the Chair.  I have pursued this principle on every possible occasion.  It was with tremendous satisfaction I observed that the principle has finally been accepted in respect of people in the public services.</P>
    <P>If it is logical to amend and increase salaries because of inflation, loss of money values and rising costs, it is equally so to argue that pensions should also be upgraded.  The reference to the upgrading of pensions made today by Senator Lenihan is most welcome. I understood from him that a promise has been given by the Minister in the Dáil to look into the matter.</P>
    <P>My second point is relevant to sections 5 and 11.  Those who were Members of the Houses at the time received from the review body a questionnaire asking about the role of Deputy or Senator as the case might be.  It asked about remuneration, hours of work and so forth.  Under the section headed &ldquo;Any other observations&rdquo; I wrote that part of the outcry which is usually made in public about Members of the Houses voting salaries to themselves&mdash;what we are doing here today &mdash;arose from the fact that the Houses themselves neglected to make available to themselves what they had already made available to the public, namely, automatic adjustment on the basis of cost of living, inflation and depreciation in money values.  This system is good enough for everybody else in the public sector but Members of the Dáil and Seanad never accepted the principle.  In this way they left themselves open to the charges which have been made recently in the Press and on every other occasion on which this type of exercise had to take place.  I also wrote that when it was thought necessary, for the reasons already given, to award increases in salary to the public in general, this should also be the case for elected representatives.</P>
    <P>In that way we could have avoided over the years the type of criticism <Col N="863" /> which has been made by the public because they have a point.  The public do not go into great detail when they read the newspapers.  They read, in a simplistic way, that the Members of the Oireachtas are voting increases in salaries to themselves.  They know that bus fares, telephone charges, postal charges, the price of meat, <i>et cetera,</i> are increasing.  Then they see this news item and they say to themselves: &ldquo;Here are the boys who are responsible for the whole thing voting extra money for themselves.&rdquo;  They do not analyse the situation.  I am glad that, finally, under the terms of sections 5 and 11, this type of exercise will never have to be repeated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Bill because I thought it was one which should have been put through very expeditiously this morning. The longer the debate has gone on, the more I have been prompted to mention two points.  Some of the remarks made smacked to me of a certain element of the very symptom which has been at the root of this problem over a number of years, namely, wailing aloud that the public do not understand our position.  We come here and tell each other that we are doing a grand job and that the public do not understand what we are doing.  This is not a proper approach to a Bill such as this.  The public will always accept the work of its public representatives as long as the work is carried out in a proper and efficient manner.  It is up to the Parliament of a country to attract men of calibre, of quality and efficiency.  This reminds me of an old slogan that a tortoise only makes progress when it sticks its neck out.  This is what we should have been doing over the past decade.  We should have insisted on what we felt was the appropriate rate for the public representative. We should at least have put ourselves on a par with what is given in equivalent occupations.</P>
      <P>It is the function of both the Dáil and Seanad to see that people with the necessary qualifications are enticed into parliamentary life.  Such men will not enter Parliament unless they receive an adequate salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> Another point which I feel has not been sufficiently clarified&mdash;I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will do so when he is replying&mdash;is that the central reason behind the considerable debate on this Bill has been the delay in bringing such legislation before the Dáil and Seanad.  Five years have elapsed since the last pay increase. While the Bill presented to us is a considerable improvement on the position obtaining hitherto, it still needs further clarification.  The Parliamentary Secretary said in his opening speech:</P>
    <P>The increases now proposed are in line with the increases given to public servants generally under the 12th round and the national agreements.</P>
    <P>I should like to take it from that statement that in future if a national agreement is drawn up Deputies and Senators will receive an increase corresponding to the same national agreement. Yet section 5 says that the Government may, whenever they so think fit, by order increase either or both of the allowances.  The confusion in my mind relates to the conflict between the opening speech and the actual wording of this section.  I should like that point to be clarified. I look forward to the Parliamentary Secretary assuring the House that in future, when a national agreement is made, Deputies and Senators will receive an allowance <i>vis-a-vis</i> the national agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that many aspects of the Bill have been discussed by other Senators but I have a few important remarks to make, principally about the role of the elected representative, whether in the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one of those people who believe that the primary purpose of either House of the Oireachtas is to legislate. One must realise that the remuneration must be sufficient to compensate somebody of intelligence and ambition for making the sacrifices necessary in order to become a member of the Oireachtas. The members are primarily legislators but it is not sufficient to be a good legislator, to know about the framing of laws and the wording of the Constitution. <Col N="865" /> We must also be able to understand the wishes of the ordinary people whom we represent.  From this point of view the contact which the average Member of this House has with the public is very important.</P>
    <P>However, I agree with those who point out that far too many Members of the Oireachtas are merely glorified messengers.  Many of us can find examples of people who have never made a single contribution to the legislation in either House but who still are considered to be the right people to be returned by the electorate.  It should be the primary ambition of all of us to bring about a situation in which people with problems would consult us only as a last resort.  At present too many people who have problems see the elected representative as the first person whom they should contact.  I get a number of calls and the vast majority of these could have been adequately dealt with by any local authority official or civil servant.  I agree with those who stated we should have citizens advisory officers.  I should like to see all the Members of this House working towards a situation in which the average member of the public would come to us only as a last resort.</P>
    <P>In neither House of the Oireachtas do we fulfill the role of legislators as it should be fulfilled.  We are tied up in a system of Government and Opposition, of what is right and wrong when you belong to a party. Neither House has sufficiently thought out ways and means to work out the best procedure of discharging their functions.  There has been too much talk here today about the contribution we can make in this House to debates.</P>
    <P>Since I became a Member of this House, what have I achieved through the few words I have spoken?  There have been some eloquent speeches made here since I became a Member but what has been achieved through them?  Have Members asked themselves this question?  A large number count their achievements in the number of lines they succeed in getting in the newspapers.  I am not being uncharitable in stating this, but I cannot see what else they hope to achieve. <Col N="866" /> Many of the finest contributions made in this House have been given by Members who walked in with a bundle of papers under their arm, sat down and at the first opportunity made their speech and walked out again.  It was obvious they were interested only in putting their own point of view as they did not wait to hear anybody else's.  They were not the least bit interested in what other people had to say.  Anyone who genuinely wishes to improve on a Bill or whatever other business is in progress in this House must be interested in the views of other Senators.  Few of us are so wise as to be able to make our decisions without hearing other people's points of view.</P>
    <P>There should be more opportunities for the average Member of either House to participate in the actual making of legislation.  It is accepted in this House that this is the prerogative of the Government and perhaps the civil servants.  This is a small number of people but various bodies such as teachers, farmers, industrialists, <i>et cetera</i>, should come together occasionally and talk about ways of being more useful.  I have never known this House to discuss seriously how they might improve their role or function, how to be more useful to the community, how to eliminate some of the abuses.</P>
    <P>There is a particular subject down for discussion.  A Member who has not much to say on it widens the subject and brings in other matters in an effort to cover the distance and perhaps to get a headline.  This attitude is not good enough.  We are all guilty of contributing to this line of thought.</P>
    <P>Those who have tendencies and abilities in various fields should have the opportunity of serving on committees and such committees should have a say on all legislation before it comes publicly before the House.  This would eliminate the need for people to speak regardless of whether they have views to offer.  It would give the people who really care an opportunity to get in at the stage when it becomes important for them to do so and would do a lot towards improving the effectiveness of this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> We all have our own particular style for getting votes.  We cannot say what is most acceptable to the electorate. There are many types of people who can get votes but we must be genuinely interested in making a contribution towards the running of this House, getting through more and better legislation and in making this House a more democratic place.  There are many Members who came here after the last general election and who will not, until the Government is dissolved, have an apportunity to change effectively or make a single effective contribution to any legislation.  This House should endeavour to develop ways and means of making a more useful contribution to the Legislature.</P>
    <P>The adverse publicity given to the increases in salaries of Deputies and Senators in the past stems, as Senators Yeats and O'Higgins pointed out, from ignorance of the salaries available to other people.  Many people know when the bus fares are increased but they do not know when the bus drivers and conductors get an increase in wages. They do not know what the local Garda sergeant or the local forestry inspector or teacher is getting.  They know what the Deputy is getting because that gets more publicity, and therein lies the reason for some of the adverse comment.</P>
    <P>The average citizen will not underestimate the role we can play or the fact that we resign a lot of our freedom the day we become Members of either House and the people will not begrudge us sufficient remuneration for the work we do, but we should endeavour to be effective in this.</P>

    <P>References have been made today to the harmonious discussion we have had on this Bill but we must admit this is due primarily to the fact that at a late hour last week the Government went part of the way to meet the wishes <Col N="868" /> of the Opposition.  Late or early, it was a welcome sign and as a result we have been able to have a more harmonious discussion this morning than possibly we might have had.  When I was elected to this House in 1961 the allowance paid to Dáil Deputies was £1,000 and to Senators £750, a differential of £250. Following the next increase Deputies received £1,500, Senators £1,000, a differential of £500 and following the next increase Deputies received £2,500 and Senators £1,500, a differential of £1,000.  Now it is proposed to extend that differential again to more than £1,400 by giving Deputies £3,400 and Senators something more than £2,000. In 12 short years the differential between Deputies and Senators was extended from £250 to £500 to £1,000 and now to £1,400.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is replying, to explain how this was allowed to come about.  I know quite a number of Senators who would agree with me that they would like to see the differential of 1961 maintained to the present day.</P>
    <P>I do not intend repeating what others have said, but most of us who are reasonably active in public life realise that the allowance paid to both Deputies and Senators is really only a pittance.  Successive Governments since the foundation of the State have failed to place upon Members of the Oireachtas a proper and true value. Now with the advent of the Devlin Report and national wage agreements it would appear that Deputies and Senators will never be placed on a proper financial footing.</P>
    <P>My main purpose in rising to speak is to comment on one aspect of the Bill.  There has been, particularly in the Dáil, considerable controversy as to the allowances paid to the various parties.  It is proposed to give the Opposition £25,000 and the Government backbenchers £10,000.  This money is to be spent on secretarial services and research facilities.  Therefore the three political parties in this country will get a miserable sum of £35,000.  That sum is being spent in order to provide the Members of those parties with the proper advisory <Col N="869" /> services and technical knowhow.  It is a pittance for all the parties because the better the research facilities these parties have the better it will be for their members, for the particular party and for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>We should consider for a moment the amount of technical advice available to the manager of a local authority or to the chief executive officer of a health board.  It would be interesting to find out in any one county what it costs to provide its technical and research facilities.  I should think that in any one county it would cost as much as the £35,000 proposed in this Bill for the three political parties.  It was said that 1968 was a beginning when they were given £10,000, but as we look to the future we all realise that research facilities for all of us are becoming much more important.  I should like to see, at some stage, possibly an all-party committee examining this aspect of politics.  I am quite sure if they were to do this they would come to the conclusion that it is in the interests of the nation as a whole that this sum of money be greatly increased in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by welcoming the Bill.  I have no doubt that this increase in salaries is richly deserved and I wonder if it is, in fact, adequate.  I was particularly impressed by the remark made by Senators Dolan and McGowan on the work of those Senators who are so much concerned with the work of local government, health boards, other committees and with other social and public occasions throughout the country.  More privileged Senators do not realise the amount of very dedicated, hard and important work which is being done at that level and which makes this increase seem well earned if, indeed, not inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to move on to those sections of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech which had to do with the role of the parliamentarian, of the two Houses of Parliament, the Oireachtas itself and to some extent the role of the Deputy and the Senator. This has been argued on both sides of the House and argued adequately.  The <Col N="870" /> role of the Deputy as a messenger boy, as it has been described, approaching departmental personages and Departments of Government for individual members of his constituency, is obviously a role that is being overused, although I would take the point made by Senator McCartin that it does lead to a far greater rapport with the needs and the grievances, the lacunae, in Irish life than would be achieved if all this activity of representation were to be handed over to a more impersonal body such as an ombudsman or a citizens' advice committee.</P>
    <P>One of the disadvantages of such a role has not been stressed.  It is an important disadvantage in a situation where one party is powerfully entrenched in an area, and when the Deputy is seen as the chief means of gaining a privilege, or even a right, for a citizen the chances are that, in those who have not backed the right horse and who support the other party, there grows up a sense of frustration, a sense of remoteness and a sense that they are unlikely to get a fair share of either rights or privileges. That is a strong disadvantage and it is one that exists in the more remote areas where the party machine is seen as being more powerful than even the Government or the Civil Service itself.</P>
    <P>This brings us on to the notion of the legislative role of the Houses of Parliament, and particularly of the Seanad, which, everybody admits, is the primary role of Parliament.  The Parliamentary Secretary anticipated that these increases will be subject to criticism.  He seems to be admitting some kind of failure on our part either to represent ourselves to the public or to perform our functions properly.</P>
    <P>A just charge against the Seanad, in particular, would be that it tends to do very little more than ratify what is going on in the Dáil; whereas it has a great deal more leisure and time available to it and a greater, in a sense, diversity of talents coming from different vocational areas.  It has a greater opportunity, I think, to act more philosophically, more creatively and more dynamically in the function of <Col N="871" /> assessing its own role and assessing the role of its Members.  For instance, on the Order Paper for today, there are a number of motions down which we will never get to.  Many of them are non-contentious motions about the Arts Council, the Manuscripts Commission, <i>et cetera.</i>  It looks as if we will perhaps never get round to these. We seem to be spending all the time in ratifying what the Dáil does.</P>
    <P>That is not sufficient for the Seanad. The Seanad should be generating thought and energy about the very institutions of Government which are so important to us and which have undergone fairly radical changes since our accession to the European Economic Community.  Many of us are aware that a great deal of our power and sovereignty has shifted to Brussels. In other words, power has become that much more remote from, say, the outlying regions of Ireland.  At the same time there has been a huge move towards centralisation of government; that has been the whole tendency of our society.</P>
    <P>There has been very little philosophic debate on that within the House but there has been an extraordinary amount outside the House.  I am thinking of a series of very important studies like Charles McCarthy's <i>The Distasteful Challenge</i>, T.J. Barrington's Addendum to the Devlin Report, various lectures published by Professor Ivor Browne, <i>A Man and his Environment, The Human Development of Towns and Villages, The Need for Survival, Environment and Mental Health</i>&mdash;highly philosophic and challenging articles about the way our society is organised.  Similarly, a whole series of challenging pamphlets from such a writer as, say, Desmond Fennell, particularly his latest ones, <i>Sketches of a New Ireland</i> and the views put forward, say, by the Cearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta about the whole notion of perhaps self-government for the Gaeltacht.  All these have one particular trend in them and that trend is the devolution of power, the giving to local communities of more and more control over their own affairs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> I take this as an illustration of the very point raised: the figure we cut as a Seanad, as a legislative House, as a centre of political energy in the eyes of the public.  Senators McGowan, Dolan and McCartin represented to us the role of the Senator throughout the country.  It is obvious that at that level they are working hard, but the general profile which we got was, I think, one of considerable latitude and one in which the Seanad seems just to trot behind the enactments of the Dáil in a manner sometimes almost humiliating. Consequently, with reference to that particular area, the Seanad should examine itself and, if necessary, think in terms of committees; but it should actually become more dynamic in considering its own role.</P>
    <P>I should like, having said that, to welcome the Bill.  It is unexceptional in every possible way and it has been of course harmoniously received right across the House.  I hope the Seanad will make some more positive and dynamic attempt to assess the function of its own role within the Irish body politic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to echo Senator Martin's plea for a more expansive approach to the Seanad by our Government.  I am not going to be hypocritical and say I oppose a rise in salary for myself or indeed for Members of the Dáil, Ministers, the Taoiseach or the Attorney General.  Particularly in the case of Dáil Deputies their services have been undervalued by the nation for many years.  Many TDs who have no other occupation have found their previous salary barely covers their expenses.  If they have a wife and family to keep there is very little left over unless they have some other means of income.  I welcome the increases being given.  In the case of Members of the Lower House I would say the increases should have been greater.  I am glad we will not have to go through all this hassel every time we wish to further increase the salaries. I hope they will be tied in some way to the national wage agreements and that when there is a 12th round, a 13th or 14th round the salaries of Members of the Oireachtas will be adjusted accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> When one considers the problem of agreeing to a rise in one's own salary it inevitably makes one question one's function as a Senator and, in fact, the whole function of the Seanad.  I echo Senator Martin's eloquent plea for a more constructive use of the Seanad. I also feel that in the two-and-a-half years I have been a Member of this House we have just been acting as a rubber stamp for the Dáil on so many occasions, that there are many other functions which we could fulfil and many other ways in which we could show the public that we are of real benefit to the nation.  I hope the present Government will consider them and will not just feed us with legislation which has been passed by the Lower House and give the general impression that the whole idea is to get Bills through the Seanad with the maximum speed and the minimum amount of fuss.  People on this side of the House, and particularly the Independents, should make a protest about this, should ensure that the role of the Seanad is expanded and should do their utmost to see to it that we have an opportunity of fully carrying out our duties as Members of an Upper Chamber of the Parliament.</P>
    <P>Most of the motions on the Order Paper are non-contentious.  In any case, the Government have an enormous majority and can afford to be generous. There are motions dealing with the Report on the Reformatory and Industrial Schools Systems and the Report of the Council of Trustees of the National Library.  These are not motions which will raise contentious issues.  They are not motions in which there will be a vote at the end which will signify a Government defeat.  In any case, as I have said, the Government have probably a bigger majority now than any Government since 1937, so they can afford to be generous.  They can afford to take these motions.  They can afford to deal with subjects for which this House is eminently suited and which will not be dealt with by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I realise we have been sitting for three months and there is tacit agreement&mdash;it is more than tacit agreement: it is part of our Standing Orders&mdash;that if possible we should <Col N="874" /> take one motion per month.  That is too little because I do not think we are under great pressure for most of the year.  In the three months we have been sitting we have taken one motion.  As I pointed out on the Order of Business this morning, the Independent Members have made strenuous efforts to take Motion No. 10, the motion dealing with Northern Ireland.  It is always possible to dig up reasons why one should not take a motion such as Motion No. 10.</P>

      <P>I have to ask the Senator to relate his remarks more to the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will do so but I am trying to make a general point and I was giving a specific example. One can always find reasons why a certain motion should or should not be discussed.  Unless we kick up a bit of a fuss on this side of the House none of these motions will ever be taken, in particular the motions which are critical.  I am not saying that we would have had an easier passage with the last administration; indeed it was just as difficult.  It is symptomatic not of a party attitude but of a general attitude to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>It is time we changed this attitude and that there was general agreement that more use should be made of us as Senators, that more use should be made of the fact that we have a great deal more time than the other House &mdash;we have less constituency work to do, we have a wide range of talents, there are areas of expertise in this House which perhaps the other House does not have, and we are eminently suited for dealing with these issues. Many of them are clearly non-political issues and there is absolutely no reason why we could not work harder and therefore give the nation more benefit for the £100,000 per year that is paid by the national Exchequer to finance the operations of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to welcome the more expansive approach to the need for secretarial help and research facilities.  I hope the Government will look into this whole question and do something to increase our effectiveness, to allow us to use our talents, to help <Col N="875" /> us to make the best use of our time and to assemble facts and figures on particular items whenever they are required.  The university Members of the House are in a privileged position in that they can usually go back to their institutions and dig up relevant information which sometimes it is hard to get without the library facilities.  For other Members of the Seanad there are very few facilities of this nature and unless one has a real back-up service, and unless the Government provide the finance for this, a lot of the money that is spent on the running of this House is generally wasted.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to add my voice to the other Members who have spoken about the position of pensions and widows' allowances.  I am glad to hear that the Government are to look at this whole area again.  As in many other categories, the pension allowances, and particularly allowances for widows with families, are inadequate. I hope that they will also be tied to a sliding scale, that we will not have to debate a motion every time the widows' allowances are to be raised and that they will automatically be raised on a general level.  This level should reflect the inflation and rise in the cost of living.  I hope that the older Members of the House, those who have retired and their widows and families will receive the benefits which are not fixed but which float with the general cost of living and reflect the current situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  I do not intend to take up the time of the House but I have a few remarks to make.  I should like to refer to something which is not in the Bill and which I believe should have been included. There is the anomaly that when the Dáil is dissolved Deputies cease to be on the pay-roll while those of us who are Members of the Seanad continue on the pay-roll until the result of the Seanad election.  If we are fortunate enough to be re-elected it means that we are continuously on salary.  We would all agree that this is an anomaly that should be cleared up.  When the Dáil is dissolved and a Deputy has to go back to his constituency <Col N="876" /> it is an expensive exercise to try to get re-elected.  Whether he is re-elected or not, in many cases the expense is the same.  The bill has to be met irrespective of whether he is on a Deputy's salary or on the pension, if he is lucky enough to qualify for one when the election is over.  Many of us might be unfortunate enough to have a popular ex-Deputy put on our panel for election to the Seanad and the result might not be too helpful to those of us who aspire to continue in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I do not know if my information is correct but we must be one of the very few countries in Europe and indeed in the EEC in which such a situation exists.  Since we entered the EEC and Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas have been going to the European Parliament and meeting parliamentarians from other countries, they carry back information to us that makes us envious of the members of parliament in some of the member countries of the EEC.  I would respectfully suggest that something should be done in relation to this.  An examination should be made of what is happening in the more progressive countries of Europe so that this type of anomaly would not exist.  Parliamentarians in other countries are treated much better than parliamentarians in this country.  When a Bill of this kind is introduced in the Dáil or the Seanad we always seem to be apologetic in voting ourselves an increase in our salaries.  Perhaps that is understandable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general public think that we are too well paid for the amount of work we have to do.  It is time something was done about this cheese-paring.  On the day on which the Dáil is dissolved a Deputy ceases to be on the pay-roll. I regret that something is not being done about it in this Bill.  I am surprised that, with all the amendments which were brought before the Dáil, somebody did not put forward an amendment on these lines.  It may appear unusual for a Senator to be making a case for Deputies when they have allowed not only this but many similar Bills to pass through the Dáil without adverting to this anomaly. Having said that, I welcome the Bill <Col N="877" /> and hope that in the very near future something will be done to bring the Members of the Dáil into line with what is being done in the more progressive countries in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator McGlinchey was talking about actual figures in terms of money it struck me as a bit vulgar to introduce the matter of money at all.  Why do we have to have fixed sums for Opposition and for Government backbenchers, <i>et cetera</i>?  Surely it would be more satisfactory if these services were provided for all Deputies and Senators and that there were no allowances.  A special service should be provided for the Front Bench of the Opposition to counteract the back-up which the Government has from the Civil Service, but that certain sums should be allocated in substitution for that service seems rather ridiculous.</P>
      <P>When I first came to the Seanad I assumed that this type of service would be provided; that we would have research and advisory services and technical knowledge at our disposal. We have nothing whatsoever. These services should be provided. This building might not be capable of holding and servicing the type of proposals envisaged.  In that respect, the Parliamentary Secretary might consider balancing the real estate value of this building against one which would be able to withstand the pressures which such a system would demand and have it, perhaps, ten miles out in the countryside.</P>
      <P>Senator Martin made a valid case for bringing our type of debate and work up to scratch.  As he pointed out, it is not good enough to have us passing Bills which have gone through the Dáil.  We should introduce Bills in the Seanad.  I should like Senator West and Senator Martin, who have experience, to suggest some ideas in this regard.  We did not come here to do this type of work, much of which is quite boring and not to the point.</P>
      <P>We could fulfil a very useful function. As Senator West has stated, there are numerous motions and Bills which will not be debated and which should be, if we had more time and were not restricted by the Dáil Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> Going on to the function of a Senator, in certain cases it is very much like that of a Deputy.  Probably it is not the same for the university Senators but even more boring for them to come here because we have quite a lot of constituency work with which to deal.  People have mentioned the service which Deputies give the public. I sometimes wonder if we do not give the public a disservice in our attempts to win favour from them.  We have a political system which is geared to keep the Deputy or Senator in power and not, to queer the pitch, as they say.  It is not an honest system.  If graft is involved, it is involuntary. We take political advantage out of the fact that people rely on us to get things done.  The man who is elected is the one who can get things done. Very often this is to the detriment of a section of the community.</P>
    <P>In our efforts to promote the case of a person who has consulted us, we pressurise officials and civil servants to obtain this favour.  The end result is that this person jumps the queue. People who are more deserving can quite often be relegated and will not get justice.  It is part of the system which is quite revolting.  Our whole system of Government in this respect and the manner in which we deal with the Civil Service should be reviewed. It is a system where the civil servants feel they must please the politicians and the politicians, in return, feel that they give the civil servants a free rein. It is a thoroughly dishonest method. We should see that people who are most deserving get their requirements first.</P>
    <P>We are tied up continuously, as Senator McCartin has stated, with constituency work, which is too trivial a matter.  Our time should be devoted to legislation, bringing about reforms which are badly needed.  Definitely, we should have facilities such as a citizens' advice bureau, and an ombudsman. The vast majority of the problems with which we deal should be dealt with by these people.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the committee service would be very valuable in the Seanad. We could get out of the stranglehold in which we are at present, where we <Col N="879" /> are committed almost entirely to passing Dáil legislation.  Perhaps with the committee system we could initiate reforms and Bills which are badly needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill, like the other Senators.  I am very happy at the attitude of all parties to the Bill.  We have heard many suggestions as to what the role of the Senator should be. Some feel that it should be that of the legislator.  Others feel they should be representatives.  Whichever we prefer is a personal matter.  The vital thing is John Citizen; the people are what matters.  This has been said by some people of this increase for public representatives.  This discussion is a very good one because it brought home to people the exact amount of salary paid to both Deputies and Senators. Many find it hard to believe that Members of the Government are prepared to work so many long hours and to serve the people for such a meagre salary.  I often wondered if the position of Deputy or Senator were advertised in local papers, not associated with a political party, what would be the functions and duties outlined by the interview board for the applicants.  I do not believe anybody would apply for such a position when they heard the hours they would work and the functions they would have to perform. It is very difficult to convince people of the amount of salary we receive: they believe it is higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Graft was mentioned but I do not believe there has been any in politics for a long time.  The service rendered by a public representative could only be given by somebody with a vocation. The Departments are in no small way responsible for the amount of work which is loaded on public representatives. Take, for example, the social welfare guide.  The ordinary man in the street is not capable of digesting the information it contains and knowing exactly to what he is entitled.  The same applies to old age pension, widows and orphans pensions and to income tax forms.  The general public cannot understand these forms and I do <Col N="880" /> not blame them because even public representatives at times find them difficult to follow.</P>
    <P>If the public representative did not exist what would the impact be on local authorities or on the Departments? How many people would have to be employed in a local authority to deal with the queries from people?  The same would apply to a Department. I think that the service rendered by public representatives is needed.</P>
    <P>There was mention made today of the service of an ombudsman.  I have seen that in Australia, where this system is in operation, only 1,500 made representations to have their problems solved.  Any public representative who is active in his constituency will deal with between three and four thousand people in a year.</P>
    <P>The salary is not adequate to give the type of service necessary.  In 1973 the public representative who wishes to give his full time and proper attention to a constituency has little time for his private business.  I welcome the increase which was long overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryKenny" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Kenny) Henry Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my appreciation, and admiration, to the Members of the Seanad of the standard of debate and to compliment them on the expeditious and precise manner in which they dealt with this Bill during the Second Reading. In the course of this debate very little that was acrimonious was mentioned, no personalities were introduced, no unparliamentary expressions were used, yet each speaker had his own points of view, argumentative or otherwise, which he placed before the House in a constructive, realistic and logical manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to comment on some of the major points raised during the course of the debate.  It is very clear that there is general support for the provisions of the Bill from all sides of the House.  There were some criticisms, and suggestions, which were not deeply involved with the Bill or its contents but with the Seanad and its possible reform to enable it to play a wider role in the national life.  The criticisms were constructive and the <Col N="881" /> suggestions made were reasonable. The debate on the Bill hinged around a few main factors: allowances and salaries and the comparisons of these salaries with the salaries or allowances of other groups; Secondly, retrospective payments of increases; thirdly, increases shall henceforth be paid by order not by an Act; fourthly, some further suggestions, and criticisms, were voiced on the Government and Opposition allowances for secretarial expenses and for expenses regarding research and information. Last, but not least, most of the Christian-like people, knowing the facts at home and knowing that some of the personalities who went through this House got little benefit, pleaded and appealed to the Minister for parity of pensions, which may come or which were guaranteed to come during the debate in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Regarding salaries and allowances it must be understood that these were calculated and assessed on a basis and during a period which goes back for the last two years at least, by a review body and later on while the national agreement was in being.  This had to be further filtered by a conference of the Employer/Labour Conference. The review body, through questionnaires and detailed information received and secured from every possible social walk of life, came to a conclusion, and on this were based guidelines for the assessment of the salaries now produced in this Bill.  A salary comparison was made by Deputy Yeats and the appropriateness of the comparison with skilled and semiskilled workers who normally benefit from minimal increases in wage revisions has been doubted by the Senator.  At least, he expressed reservations regarding the figures.  On the comparison with civil servants it must be remembered that the salaries of parliamentarians and higher civil servants were considered simultaneously by the highly qualified and responsible body set up by the Government to advise on higher remuneration in the public sector.</P>
    <P>These are not the Government's figures but they made their figures on the guidelines suggested by this body, <Col N="882" /> and, after detailed examination, they arrived at the figures now contained in this Bill.  Many Senators mentioned retrospection and phrased their query in this particular way: &ldquo;a retrospection recommended by the Employer/ Labour Conference.&rdquo;  Many Senators have used this expression, or similar ones.  I must again emphasise that the Employer/Labour Conference made no recommendations at all about parliamentarians. They merely stated that on the basis of certain assumptions the remuneration would be at certain levels on certain rates.  The Government were free to decide on any operative date and there is no question of their having breached any Employer/ Labour Conference recommendation in this respect.  They decided, in their wisdom, that these increases should be paid on 1st July.  It was a wise choice because I know, coming from a rural area where people are more politically inclined than in urban areas or in cities, that there would be a public outcry if benefits were given retrospectively to people in the higher grades and withheld from people in the social welfare recipient classes.</P>
    <P>Regarding the allowance made for the first time to the Government party and to the Opposition party, this allowance was first started in 1938 for the Opposition party but it was not recognised, in principle, until 1968.  It was then a figure of £15,000.  For the first time the Government party will now receive an allowance of £10,000 for secretarial expenses.  It must be understood that in every party individual Deputies pay a certain amount every month to defray the expenses of secretarial staff.  I do not know how much this amounts to in the Fianna Fáil Party but it is a pretty widely-known sum in the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan, dealing with this allowance for the Opposition and for the Government, implied that a blunder had been made because it was not included in the original Bill.  If blunders were made blunders have been made before now.  Somebody said years ago that to err is human and all humans know that blunders have been made but, in this particular case, these alleged blunders have been satisfactorily <Col N="883" /> corrected in a very amiable way, by consultation and compromise. It may have been the business instinct or the bargaining instinct of the Fianna Fáil Party or the tendency to compromise within the Government party that led to this, but at least it has led to an amiable agreement.  In the Dáil, after many hours of acrimonious dissension, this was fixed at £25,000 for the Opposition parties and at £10,000 for the Government party.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson made a wonderful speech in a very academic way and she suggested that everybody in the Dáil and in the Seanad should approach parliamentary life in an academic way&mdash;in other words, that we should all be legislators.  If we approached the long path to Leinster House in the academic way she suggested the Kildare Street entrance of Leinster House would be strewn with the bodies of disappointed candidates and with frustrated applicants both for the Seanad and for the Dáil.  People must understand that unless you mix with your constituents you have not a hope of getting into the Dáil.  It is a 24-hour a day job, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out in his speech.  You are at the beck and call of every constituent, because if you are not then your colleague or your opponent will be.  I should like to tell any prospective academic candidate for Dáil Éireann that if he went down to the West, to Kilbeggan or to Cavan or any such place outside the limits of Lucan he would get a very great surprise.</P>
    <P>The same Senator asked why should there be criticism of salaries for Deputies and Senators.  There are bound to be criticisms because that is one trait of the Irish character.  We are the greatest &ldquo;knockers&rdquo; in the world. Some people here might think that Deputies get paid; they do not.  Deputies get allowances and so do Senators; but office holders get salaries.  That is the kind of distinction I did not know existed until I had to come in here, at a few hours' notice, and stand in for the Minister.</P>
    <P>Why are people so resentful and critical of salaries given to Senators and <Col N="884" /> Deputies?  First of all, we have to wait too long for an increase.  Therefore, over that period the increase must be large and we hear criticisms from most counties, where honest rural people live, such as: &ldquo;He is getting a rise of £1,000&rdquo;.  They rarely realise that this increase covers a very, very long period. That is one of the reasons why people are so critical.</P>
    <P>I have another reason for that resentment and it is the greatest reason of all. We have been given the complete and absolute free hand down through the years in giving ourselves our own increases.  Everyone says: &ldquo;When they get the freedom to give themselves something, they take the lot.&rdquo;  We have at last dispensed with this liberty by withdrawing it in this Bill.  I think that by far the wisest section in this Bill is the section that provides that in future, by order, we may give ourselves an increase, and that, if there is any controversy about it, within 21 sitting days that order may be annulled and no increase may be forthcoming.  Up to this there has been an outcry in the country for some independent, neutral body or tribunal to assess our value and calculate the sum to which we would be entitled.  That is now being done here.  It is another good point in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I seem to have Senator Robinson on my mind, but in answer to her and Senator Markey's question as to why not write review criteria into the Bill, nobody can be certain that the institutions we have at the moment, such as the Employer/Labour Conference, will continue indefinitely, or will continue in their present form.  Neither can we say whether there will be more national pay agreements.  Nobody can be sure of that.  This national pay agreement was established over the past three years just to keep in line the increases for various bodies in the country as a kind of a bulwark against inflation.  It would be too difficult to write the review criteria into the Bill.  Already, without actually writing it into the Bill, the Government have given a guarantee in the Dáil that the remuneration of parliamentarians will be increased whenever there is a nationally accepted formula for so doing.  This guarantee <Col N="885" /> is just as good as writing it into the Bill.  Senator Yeats was against that, and so also was Senator Sanfey. Senator Mary Robinson suggested that this review criteria should be written in.</P>
    <P>Senator McGlinchey queried the widening of the differential between Deputies and Senators.  The Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector carried out a full survey of what Deputies and Senators do and of the time taken up by their public duties.  On this basis, the review body proposed new rates for Deputies and Senators which, in their view, represented the proper relationship between the two.  In other words, £3,440 for a Deputy and £1,860 for a Senator.  The figures proposed in the Bill, namely £3,416 for a Deputy and £2,023 for a Senator represent a more favourable relationship from the viewpoint of a Senator.  I think that answers Senator McGlinchey.  If there are any more points which need clarification they may be raised on Committee Stage. Each section will be examined and gone into in detail.  If there are any more criticisms, they may be raised at that time.</P>
    <P>I was very appreciative of the fact that we have in the Seanad many Christian people who realise that there are people throughout the country who have been dealt with unfairly legally in regard to pension parity for former Deputies and Senators.  Each of us realises very well that there are individuals all over the country who really need a certain amount of financial help because over the years&mdash;as can be seen from the figures supplied &mdash;salaries and allowances in this House were very niggardly.  The Minister indicated in the Dáil that he is not unsympathetic to the idea of making some move towards parity of pensions.  I can repeat that sentiment.  This matter is under consideration at present.</P>
    <P>I might mention, however, that a provision for pension parity would not be appropriate to the present Bill. Parity of pensions could not possibly be included in this Bill.  This parity of pensions must be provided by resolution. The procedure for amending the Members' pension scheme is by way of <Col N="886" /> resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  To end, I just want to mention that Senators Lenihan, McAuliffe, Sanfrey, Butler, McGowan, Harte, Brosnahan and West, mentioned in public their sympathetic consideration of the parity principle.</P>

      <P>There are one or two matters arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech on this question of retrospection.  He mentioned that the Employer/Labour Conference did not recommend that there ought to be retrospection.  That is so but they told the Government that in their view retrospection would be acceptable under the national pay agreement and the 12th round.  It is open to the Government to introduce retrospection. They went further than that.  They laid out certain increases which in their view could take place on certain dates under these awards and which would be in accordance with their general provisions.  As I mentioned in my speech, they laid out, for example, that a Deputy could get a figure like £3,023 on 1st January, 1972, and Senators accordingly.  There were various steps laid down.  They certainly did not tell the Government that this is what they ought to do but they told the Government that if they did this it would be fully in accordance with the national pay agreement and the 12th round. That is the point I wish to make on the question of retrospection.  It is in accordance with these wage rounds and, what is more to the point, it is in accordance with the kind of treatment <Col N="887" /> that every other section of the working population got under various awards. We alone are left without any element of retrospection.  The purely technical matter as to whether or not there was a recommendation is not important.  It could have been done and it should have been done in accordance with the views of the Employer/Labour Conference.</P>
      <P>In regard to the comparison with the salaries of civil servants, the Parliamentary Secretary said that, after all, the higher civil servants had their salaries fixed by the Devlin committee, the same people who fixed our salaries, that there was no real grievance since the Devlin committee dealt with both matters.  I believe I am right in saying that the group of civil servants whom I quoted, the higher executive officers, are a very large group and, so far as I know, they had nothing whatever to do with Devlin.  My understanding is, and I may be wrong, that for many years their salaries have been governed by arbitration.  It was the civil servants in higher positions than higher executive officers, for example, those in the administrative grades, who were covered by Devlin.  I am not particularly interested in whether Devlin did this or Devlin did that.  The basic factor that should be of importance is the comparison with the cost of living rise since 1st August, 1968.  On that basis we have been given 35 per cent in the case of Senators and 36 per cent in the case of Deputies to meet a cost of living rise of very nearly 50 per cent.  The Cathaoirleach has been given the magnificent rise of around 12 per cent to deal with the same rise in living costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Devlin reported in early July, 1972. Nearly 13 months have elapsed since then.  In that time there has been a cost of living rise of about 12 per cent.  We are all that much worse off than last year.  Yet no allowance has been made for this in the salaries now being awarded.  It is not a question of technicalities as to who reported, who did this, who did that, who made what recommendation.  Since five years ago yesterday all of us in this and the other House, Government Ministers, officers of the House, the Cathaoirleach, the <Col N="888" /> Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle have been downgraded.  They are that much less well off than they were five years ago yesterday.</P>
    <P>For example, a Deputy if he was just to be left in the same situation in relation to the cost of living as he was five years ago should have had another £300 given in this award.  A Senator should have had a couple of hundred pounds more.  The point is that we have all been downgraded not merely in relation to the cost of living but also in relation to the much higher increases that almost every other section of the population has had, going in most cases far beyond the technical increase in the cost of living.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to insert in line 13 &ldquo;and Seanad Éireann&rdquo; after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo;, and after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; in lines 14 and 15 to insert &ldquo;or Seanad Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This recommendation is a straightforward one and one with which Senators should agree.  The issue involved is fundamental.  Under subsection (3), when the Government have made an order fixing the salaries of Deputies <Col N="889" /> and Senators and of the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Dáil is given the opportunity of discussing the order and putting down a resolution disapproving of the draft if they so see fit.  The Seanad, I presume through inadvertence, is not mentioned.  There are two main reasons why we should not accept this.  First, there is the simple issue limited to this particular matter: that if our salaries and those of the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach are being discussed it seems an extraordinary situation that they are open to discussion in the other House and not in this House but there is another and far more important issue and that is the general matter of principle, that where orders of any kind are to be laid before either House of the Oireachtas as a general rule they should be laid before both Houses.  I cannot see any justification whatever for omitting Seanad Éireann from this list.  I hope, therefore, that the Parliamentary Secretary will accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>The same issue arises under section 11 but, in the absence of an undertaking that the Minister was going to accept the amendment, I did not think it necessary to circulate one on it, too, but it can be very easily brought up on Report Stage if the need arises.  I would be interested to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary whether he proposes to accept this recommendation and if not, why not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Yeats in this amendment. He has made the argument very well that it is customary, especially when the orders are laid in draft so that the Parliament has a greater role to play, that either of the Houses may annul such orders.  In other words, either House may raise them for debate, comment on them, and subsequently annul them if it is the view of the House that they should be annulled.  In a case where the interests of the Seanad are very much concerned and where it would be possible to envisage, for example, that the salaries of Members of the Dáil alone were being raised, the Members of the Seanad might ask: what about us? But they would have no power to consider <Col N="890" /> the draft order.  Or, secondly, where the salaries of Senators alone were being raised or varied, why should the Seanad be deprived of the possibility of considering an order to that effect when in draft.  This is a deprivation of a proper function for the Seanad in the matter.  It is very difficult to see why the Seanad is excluded from the possibility in the normal way of having the order laid in draft before either the Dáil or the Seanad, allowing the Seanad to raise the matter and to move for the annulment of the order within the 21 days provided.  On the grounds of previous practice in this matter, as Senator Yeats pointed out, and on the grounds of a very genuine interest and concern on behalf of the Seanad, this amendment ought to be accepted.  I appreciate that we are in a sense talking in a very academic environment since the other House has recessed for the summer but the matter is one which is sufficiently important for the Minister to consider when the Dáil reconvenes&mdash;and there is talk about an early reconvening.  I support this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very important matter of principle involved and not only in relation to this Bill.  It is something which could have ramifications in a very wide way.  There has been a tendency in recent years for Governments to introduce certain measures by order rather than by way of a Bill going through both Houses. The reason given&mdash;sometimes it is perfectly valid&mdash;is that even though a Bill is not being introduced in both Houses to enact whatever legislation is necessary, an order will be laid before the Houses and that either or both of the Houses can raise the matter and discuss it and say whether or not they approve. This is the first time that I am aware of where this principle has been introduced but where only one House is given the right to agree or disagree with what is done.  Certainly, in this and in any other case, if this principle were to extend to other situations in the future and measures, which would normally be introduced by Bill and be capable of being discussed by both Houses, were being introduced by way of order&mdash;and that order was only <Col N="891" /> being laid before one House&mdash;then this would be quite unacceptable and clearly infringing the rights of this House.  It would be a measure against which this House would have to fight very strongly.  Consequently, whereas it may not be all that important in this instance, the principle involved is very important and one which the Seanad could not possibly allow to pass without protesting in the strongest possible manner.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words on this matter.  Most Members of the Seanad would appreciate the points which have been made by Senators Yeats, Robinson and Ryan.  They would feel that it is proper that those points should be raised on this Bill in the Seanad.  However, we have to go a little deeper into the matter.  When we do this we will see that it is not a question of discarding previous practice.  Senator Robinson seemed to be under the impression that it was.  A moment's thought will show us that this is not so.  There has never been any practice of increasing parliamentary allowances by order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  There is a distinction between that in relation to any other Bill and in relation to this particular Bill.  The first point I want to make is that there is no precedent in relation to this Bill because the system did not obtain up to this, that the allowances of office holders were increased by order.  It was necessary to bring in legislation so that the increases could be sanctioned.  Consequently there is no question of a departure from an established practice.  There was never such a practice of bringing either orders or draft orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is fairly general provision in legislation dealing with ministerial orders either to lay them before both Houses of the Oireachtas or, if they are being introduced in draft form, to allow power to either House of the <Col N="892" /> Oireachtas to introduce an annulment motion.  Before I come to the distinction between that in general legislation and in this Bill, I should like to say that with the whole-hearted support of Senator Robinson, Senator Lenihan and Senator Ryan that practice was very seriously breached only last week in this House on the Bill dealing with the European Economic Community orders.  I was the only Senator in the House who objected to the provision introduced.  This House solemnly, with the blessing of Senators Lenihan, Ryan and Robinson, passed over from this House to a Special Committee the sole right of initiating annulment proceedings in relation to those orders, which may and probably will be of greater significance and importance not only to Members of this House but to the members of the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;than any order which might be made under this, but the Members of the other House were also deprived of what one would have regarded as their entitlement as individual Deputies to commence proceedings for the annulment of those orders.  We passed over to the other House the sole authority to initiate that proceeding to a Committee of 26 of the two Houses.  Therefore, if there is any departure from precedent it was done in this House last week with the blessing of Senators Ryan, Lenihan and Robinson.  That is only a debating point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a good one.  The essential difference between this Bill and ordinary legislation is that this is a Certified Money Bill and there is, as all Senators are aware, a constitutional difference between the procedure in the case of Certified Money Bills and ordinary legislation.  It is provided in the Constitution that Money Bills can only be initiated in Dáil Éireann.  It is also provided in the Constitution at least by implication, although there is possibly a distinction without any great difference <Col N="893" /> in words, that the Seanad cannot amend Money Bills.  We can make recommendations with regard to them but cannot amend them.  If we do make recommendations it is then provided in the Constitution that we must within a period of 21 days return the Bill to the Dáil and if we do not do that it is deemed to have been passed in its original form by both Dáil and Seanad notwithstanding our recommendations. The same applies if having made recommendations the Dáil does not accept them, so there is a fundamental and constitutional difference between a Money Bill and general legislation with regard to the status of this House and the rights of Members in relation to it.</P>
      <P>What orders can the Minister make under section 5 of this Bill?  He can only make an order increasing Members' allowances and that is the order objected to by Senator Yeats.  It is unlikely he would get general support in the House for an effort to annul an order increasing Members' allowances. You cannot increase it beyond what is allowed by the Minister and if you had the right to annul the order and succeeded in doing so the net effect is that you do not even get the increase proposed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that is involved here is a question of an order which can only increase allowances.  This amendment is fighting for the right to tell the Minister that he should not increase the allowances as he proposes.  Neither in this House nor in the other House can an amendment be accepted. Senator Yeats, as an ex-Cathaoirleach, will be the first to agree with me when I state an amendment cannot be moved which would have the affect of increasing the charge on the Exchequer, so there is no question of being able to amend a draft order in such a way as to increase the increases which have been proposed by the Minister.  As is stated in section 5 of the Bill, there is no machinery for amending the draft order which the Minister brings before the Dáil.  The Dáil either accepts the increases the Minister proposes to them or they reject them and it is a matter then for the Minister whether or not he will make another order.  There is no <Col N="894" /> question of the Dáil or the Seanad having any authority whatsoever to amend these orders.</P>
    <P>If the object of this exercise is to tie the hands of the Minister, it would not tie them effectively to insist on these matters being debated in the Seanad.  If the object of the exercise is to express in some sense a spirit of opposition to the idea of parliamentary allowances being increased it would appear this amendment is in sharp contradiction to the sentiments expressed by Senator Yeats on section 4.  If Senators feel that allowances should not be increased, each of us has his own remedy in his own hands as regards that.  We need not accept the increases, and this draft order can only increase.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that it is important that Senators should watch the privileges and powers of this House in relation to legislation and if the Minister were to consider amending this by future legislation, I would not be in opposition to such a move.  I do not use this as an argument of any importance, as I have always objected to it being used at this stage in a Seanad session, but it is known to all of us that the Dáil has risen for the Recess.  That being so, if a recommendation were to be made by this House on this Bill two things could happen: either the matter could be delayed until the Dáil comes back or the Dáil could be recalled.  From a practical point of view, it seems most unlikely that the Dáil would be recalled. Whether Senator Yeats and his colleagues feel that the other course is one that would recommend itself generally&mdash;namely, that the matter should in the final analysis be deferred until October&mdash;is something on which I cannot adjudicate.  I said earlier that so far as I personally am concerned I do not mind whether the Seanad deals with this Bill this side of the Recess or not.</P>

      <P>Since coming to sit in the seat he occupies at present Senator O'Higgins has acquired a certain brand of political innocence that I would never have attributed to him in the days he used to sit on this side of the House.  Taking his last point <Col N="895" /> first, I hesitate to pronounce on such a matter in case I might dislocate whatever reputation I may or may not hold as an ex-Cathaoirleach.  I think I am right in saying that, if a recommendation is passed in this House, and is ignored by the other House, in 14 days, or some relatively short period like that, the Bill becomes law in the absence of any action by the Dáil and that the question of deferring it or delaying it does not arise.</P>

      <P>On that point, I would urge Senator O'Higgins and other Senators opposite simply to make the gesture.  There will be a vote on this recommendation.  I would suggest that they all vote for it because they know perfectly well that it is a recommendation that ought to be supported. They are not that long over on that side of the House that they cannot appreciate that.  I would suggest, on that basis, that it could be passed with no harm done to anyone.  It would at least have made the point that we feel should be made.  The Bill would in due course become law.</P>
      <P>Taking some of the other points that Senator O'Higgins made, what he said in effect was: &ldquo;Why bother to have it discussed by Seanad Éireann since after all they could not amend the Government order in any event.&rdquo; I take it the suggestion is that the Government have a majority anyway and would object to any such effort to overturn the draft and, therefore, why bother.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a strong indication to that end.  On the same basis, why have this subsection in at all?  Do we not all know that, if the Dáil discuss it, in practice no resolution disproving of it will be passed? Surely the whole point of the parliamentary process is that Members of Parliament in a democratic country have the opportunity of discussing matters brought before them by the Government.  Democratic Governments <Col N="896" /> very often defer to the views they hear in these debates.  This is the whole basis of the parliamentary process.</P>
      <P>I do not visualise anyone putting down a resolution disapproving of the draft with a view to having it overturned because there is a parliamentary means of discussing the situation.  What is happening here is that if we pass this subsection as it stands never again will we in this House have an opportunity of discussing these matters.  Senator O'Higgins made the point, which the Minister very often made, that after all when this matter comes up for discussion again in another amending Bill we might be able to do something about it and so on.</P>
      <P>Let us be clear that there will be no amending Bill.  This is the last time that this matter will be dealt with by legislation.  From now on it will be dealt with by Government order.  No question therefore arises of any kind of an amending Bill and no opportunity will arise under which this matter can be remedied.  We are taking part in the last debate that will ever take place in this House on these matters unless this recommendation is accepted, and later accepted by the Dáil.  I agree with Senator O'Higgins that that seems an unlikely situation.</P>
      <P>Another point I should like to make on Senator O'Higgins's speech concerns his rather curious interpretation of what happened in this House and the other House on the Bill setting up the Committee to deal with EEC secondary legislation.  As I understood it, we had a situation that a Committee was set up with representatives on it from both the Dáil and Seanad.  That Committee will consider all these matters and in particular will consider Irish Government regulations incorporating into Irish law these various directives and so on we get from the EEC.  That Committee can recommend to both Houses of the Oireachtas that they should be accepted or rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each House of the Oireachtas can discuss these matters.  There is even a provision whereby, should the Seanad be in recess for more than ten days, <Col N="897" /> that one-third of the membership of the Seanad can ask the Cathaoirleach to call us together to discuss these matters.  In so far as it is a precedent it is a very, very strong precedent because only last week, against the opposition of Senator O'Higgins, we created a very strong precedent in favour of giving ourselves the kind of power which we are seeking in this recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I failed to follow a good deal of Senator O'Higgins's reasoning, partly, I think, because it was not exactly relevant to the amendment which had been put forward by Senator Yeats and which I am supporting. I think his comments on the European Communities Bill referred to quite a different mechanism.  Senator Yeats said that this provision, which would allow the Dáil only to consider a draft order is not a departure from existing practice because this will be a new procedure: it will be the first time that the question of raising salaries will be provided for in this way.  This is precisely the underlying importance of it, and I think Senator Yeats made his point very well when he said that this is the last opportunity the Seanad will have to discuss and debate the question of the raising of Members' salaries. Let us not be under any illusion about that.  That is a very substantial departure from practice in the real sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the departure from practice which I referred to earlier. When orders are made in draft by Ministers they are laid before both Houses.  I thoroughly agree with the analysis given by Senator Yeats&mdash;in case anybody is under the illusion that the Seanad can without Government support annul an order of this sort&mdash;that this is not to annul the order but to provide the trigger for a debate.  This means that the Seanad has authority, by putting down a motion to annul the draft order, to debate the question of whether the salaries should be raised, by how much, how far retrospectively, what relationship should exist between Dáil and Seanad salaries and Government salaries, <i>et cetera.</i>  We at least have the jurisdiction to do that.  We <Col N="898" /> are now depriving ourselves of that jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand the lecture on Money Bills which we were given by Senator O'Higgins&mdash;because in section 5 we are not concerned with an amendment of legislation: we are concerned with a draft order which has no legal validity unless after a period of 21 days it has not been annulled.  This is the legal significance. Therefore, the Seanad is not amending a Money Bill.  This is a quite different procedure.  I think it is open to the Legislature to write in, even to a Money Bill, a mechanism which provides for a draft order which has no legal validity after a period of time but which will be made a valid order if it has not been annulled, and that the Seanad can play a part in this process.  The reason why the Seanad must be allowed to play a part in this process is the obvious one that it is the only way in which the Seanad can be allowed to have jurisdiction to debate this whole question of the raising of salaries.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill I made the point that I regretted the fact that both in this section and section 11 no criteria were set down as to how the Government would exercise the power to increase salaries by means of a draft order.  It is important in the absence of specific criteria and because on the face of the section we give an unfettered discretion to the Government, that this matter should be within the jurisdiction of both Houses which subsequently, through the means of tabling a motion annulling the order, have an opportunity to debate it as we are debating today.  I think the debate in the Seanad today has been a very useful one.  Most Senators must regret that this will be our last opportunity to debate an increase in salaries in this way.</P>

      <P>I have said already I recognise the validity of having this raised here.  It would be a pity if Senators Robinson and Yeats, by over-painting the picture, were to militate against the case which they themselves are making.  There is no question, of course, of this being the <Col N="899" /> last opportunity for the Seanad to discuss Members' allowances.  Senator Robinson in particular has shown a degree of expertise in the Seanad for triggering off&mdash;I think that was her expression, debates by way of motions. If Senators look at the Order Paper at the moment, they will see there are ten motions all of which in due course will be discussed.  To seven of them the name of Senator Robinson is appended.</P>
      <P>There is no need at all for people to throw up their hands in horror and say this is the last opportunity we will have of saying what we should be paid.  That is not so.  It is open to any Senator to put down a motion to discuss the question of Members' allowances here any time they like.</P>

      <P>You cannot initiate a Money Bill or discuss anything by that means in the Seanad.  The Senator is correct.  It cannot be done by way of a Money Bill.  One would have to fall back on a motion.  The principal point here is that the only discussion that could take place, if it were permitted, would be to annul an order in précis.  Senator Yeats has made it quite clear that a motion to annul would not really be serious&mdash;it would be merely for the purpose of discussion.  We are back again to the question of discussion.  That can be done by a motion.  It certainly is not the last opportunity we will ever have of discussing it.  It might be better that it should be done in a way which would have a direct influence in the sense that the Minister for Finance would be here which would, presumably, be the case if a draft order were to be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only suggestion I can make at this stage is that Senators might like <Col N="900" /> the Parliamentary Secretary to carry back the message to the Minister that there were strong views on this and, perhaps, he would have a look at it with a view to considering whether a further Bill should be introduced here. ing with it.  I do not think there is any question of a breach of precedent here. The normal procedure as far as money orders are concerned is that they come before the Dáil alone, not the Seanad.  I do not pretend to be in a position to quote precedent on that but I believe this is the practice that has been followed here with regard to orders dealing with money matters, increases of that sort in various fields. I do not think there is any question of precedent being breached.</P>
    <P>The only thing of importance is whether the privileges and powers of the Seanad are being in any way diminished or offended or breached by this provision.  Personally, I should like to see the situation where the question of discussing parliamentary allowances would not come before the Seanad in any shape or form, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the recommendation because I think there is a principle involved here which, with all his expertise, Senator O'Higgins has not completely succeeded in obfuscating with his particularly skilled presentation of the case he put forward, and most of the points raised by him.  Senator O'Higgins said there is no precedent being breached here.  That is probably true but a precedent is being created here.  That is the important worry that people like Senators Yeats and Robinson both have.  Senator Robinson I am sure will not feel blinded and deafened by the weight of the flattery which Senator O'Higgins was kind enough to pay to her to the extent that she will not point out to him that she has used her skills to a great degree in the past by using the various devices which she has been clever enough to find out, but why on earth should she sit idly by when she sees one of them which has been the most useful to all of us&mdash;in the Dáil I have used it on many occasions&mdash;this right to discuss an order, being undermined? <Col N="901" /> It is a wonderful device.  For people who want to question Government action without feeling that they have any right to deter the Government, in formal terms, then any opportunity that a Senator might have of bringing a matter formally before this House for discussion, no matter what the outcome, seems to me to honour the one important principle for existence of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Over the years I have fought very hard against the Seanad having powers.  I am glad it has no great powers beyond the right to debate, the right to discuss measures which the Dáil, in its wisdom, has passed from time to time and then for the collective wisdom of all the talents of the Seanad to be brought back to the Dáil and then let them do as they like thereafter.  But at least this very important right to put a point of view before the Seanad, to attempt to influence the Dáil should be very carefully guarded and very carefully preserved.  In fact, the only purpose that I personally would have in being in the Seanad is the right to comment from time to time.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in his excellent and most interesting closing speech&mdash;I take this opportunity of welcoming him to his position and many years of success in it&mdash; pointed out what he called, in loyalty to his colleagues in the Cabinet, the alleged blunder&mdash;but it appears that there was a blunder of considerable proportions, about £35,000 or was it £20,000?  It was quite a blunder anyway which was later remedied peacefully by discussion in a civilised, mature way.  A blunder did take place and it was possible that a blunder of that kind might not have been discovered in the Dáil.  But there was a very powerful vested interest involved in the blunder and therefore it was discovered in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Blunders can be made by cabinets. But they compounded the blunder by making another omission or minor blunder&mdash;minor in so far as there is not the same powerful vested interest fighting for its recognition here&mdash;in relation to the unfortunate people about <Col N="902" /> whom Deputy Kennedy spoke very feelingly: the former Members of the Oireachtas who are out now on rather miserable pensions because of the absurdly small allowances paid to Deputies in the early years.  These people have been ignored.  There are two points, the second of which is not worth discussing because it cannot be included in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We then have the final, rather school-masterish, frightening, <i>in terrorem</i> exhortation from the Leader of the House, Senator M.J. O'Higgins, who tells us we will not get paid until Christmas if he does not get his Bill. This is a sort of collective punishment which he is imposing on the Seanad and I do not think it is quite fair.</P>
    <P>There is a good reason why we should try to preserve this right to have matters of this kind brought before us.  There was the curious debate between four Senators&mdash;Senators Robinson, Lenihan, Yeats and M.J. O'Higgins&mdash;on the question of whether they were right or not to give to a Joint Committee certain powers in relation to the EEC.  They do not appear to be able to make up their minds whether this very important right to debate here has been handed over to a sub-committee of the Dáil and Seanad.  This, again, is part of the general anaesthetising effect which the whole EEC has had upon both Houses of the Oireachtas: the right to debate, which is implicit in the whole idea of democracy, has been completely curtailed.</P>
    <P>I recollect that in one of the first Bills we dealt with here, where millions of pounds were spent, when I asked the Minister did he know where it was going, he admitted that he did not.  I admit that was an unusual set of circumstances in which a collection of items had to be brought before the Seanad rapidly, but this method seems to me to have been in action last week in the discussion on the Joint Committee. We have in some way reduced the powers of the Seanad by handing it over to a Committee rather than having this as the Committee and having our debate carried on in the usual way.  If it is possible for this amendment to be accepted, it should be.</P>

      <P>Just to clear one point, Senator Browne took up a phrase I used that there was no precedent being breached.  He based his case on his own phrase that there was a precedent being created.  It is relevant in this connection to say that I appear to be correct and Senator Browne with his own particular expertise appears to be wrong.  I have here the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment No. 2) Act, 1968.  This is an Act which dealt with a matter which many people might regard in the public sense as being of greater importance than allowances to Senators and Deputies.  This dealt with the payments to be made to the judges and district justices.  This provided:</P>
      <P>The Government may whenever they so think fit by order increase the sums payable by way of remuneration to the several judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court and the Circuit Court and the several justices of the District Court.  An order under this subsection may, if so expressed, have retrospective effect.</P>
      <P>If one reads down the section we are discussing one will see a certain similarity. It states at (c)</P>
      <P>Where an order is proposed to be made under this subsection a draft thereof shall be laid before Dáil Éireann and if a Resolution disapproving of the draft is passed by Dáil Éireann within the next subsequent 21 days on which it has sat after the draft is laid before it the order shall not be made.</P>
      <P>There is the particular precedent which was followed in the drafting of section 5 of this Bill.  This is a precedent dealing with the payment of the Judiciary. It is contained in an Act which was passed by the previous Government so that whatever might be said about the question of not being able to discuss Seanad allowances except by the exercise, if I may use the word again, of the expertise of Senators in putting down motions we have been precluded for the last seven years by an Act of the previous Government from discussing draft orders in relation to payments of members of the Judiciary.</P>

      <P>Taking the first point made by Senator M.J. O'Higgins in his earlier intervention, I do not think he quite appreciated the full power of his suggestion that, after all, we need not worry and we could always discuss the matters by putting down a motion. Leaving aside the obvious and wellknown problems of getting motions debated, what he is saying in effect is&mdash; I know he did not mean it in that way but it is the meaning of what he said &mdash;why bother having legislation coming out of the Seanad at all?  Why bother with Finance Bills, Bills about the EEC or Bills about anything else? After all, if anyone feels like discussing them they can always put down a motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>One has no power on legislation in Opposition either unless you can persuade some Minister to amend it.  In the case of an order of this kind it is perfectly obvious Ministers will stick by it.  The Government of the day will have a majority and that will be that.  It is the parliamentary process.  One hopes to be able to persuade Ministers to see what we in Opposition think to be reasonable.</P>
      <P>With regard to the interesting piece of legislation that Senator O'Higgins has dug up or been handed dating back to 1968, he let a very interesting cat out of the bag.  It shows quite clearly what I personally had suspected and at which I hinted when I first spoke on this amendment: that those who drafted this Bill nearly forgot that there was a Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know the way parliamentary draftsmen go about dealing with legislation.  Wherever possible, they like to be able to dredge up some <Col N="905" /> subsection, like that read out by Senator O'Higgins, from a previous Act which seems to fit the bill.  This is the precedent, here we are, down it goes.  No problem.  Nobody will get into any trouble.  It has been done before and, therefore, it can be done again.</P>
    <P>In adopting the measure this time, and it is quite clear that Senator O'Higgins is right in saying where it came from, they forgot the simple little matter that these orders which are being taken away from us under this Bill relate to our own salaries and those of the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach, not those of district justices.  We all know that, as between the Dáil and the Seanad on strictly <Col N="906" /> money matters, the Dáil is the superior House.  The Dáil under the Constitution, and in practice, is given a status which we do not enjoy and do not endeavour to enjoy.</P>
    <P>The point here which completely upsets this so-called precedent as an adequate precedent is the fact that our own salaries are being discussed.  Whoever dug that handy subsection out of the Act in 1968 merely forgot this point.  It is absolutely clear, from what Senator O'Higgins has said, the cat that he set out of the bag, that it was simply an oversight in this Bill.  It is an oversight which should be remedied.</P>

      <P>I welcome strongly the putting of this matter under in order procedure from now on.  We have had sufficient evidence over the past two weeks in the debate on this and we have had evidence over the years in regard to, at times very unseemly, debates on judicial salaries to warrant this procedure in regard to judicial salaries and Members' remuneration and allowances.  The benefit of the order procedure, which the former Government introduced first in regard to judicial salaries, is now incorporated here.  This is something we would have done in regard to Members' allowances and its incorporation <Col N="907" /> in the section means we will in future have just one debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>The order, which should be laid before both Houses, and that was the purpose of Senator Yeats' amendment, can be debated within 28 days. We will have one straightforward debate. We will not have the long tedious debates on various Stages in both Houses.  We will state our views, vote on it and that will be the end of the matter.  This sort of thing has been a time-wasting matter over the years in both Houses.  It is important that this new procedure be adopted so that, in future, when engaged in debate we do not appear to be engaged in an unseemly wrangle over sections and subsections on various Stages over long periods conveying a totally wrong impression of the matter to the public.  We should be seen to be dealing with these fundamental matters of the salaries of the Members of the Oireachtas and members of the judiciary in a responsible and clear-sighted manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to subsection (3) (a) (1) which states: &ldquo;The Government may whenever they so think fit by order increase, <i>et cetera.</i>&rdquo; The operative words here are &ldquo;whenever they so think fit&rdquo; and the question arises: how often are the Government going to think fit?  They have suggested in the debate in the other House that they would make an order altering the salaries of the people concerned whenever there was a new national wage agreement.  This concept of a national wage agreement is a relatively new one.  We hope it will become a regular feature of our economy and that, every couple of years, instead of having these free-for-all wage rounds which took place over so many years, there will be an orderly process of amendment of wages by a single national wage round.  I can see no problem in that regard if one can assume that the Government will, in such an event, make an order following approximately the percentage increases in national wages with regard to the salaries and allowances of Senators, <Col N="908" /> Deputies, Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
      <P>Human nature being what it is, we must expect that on at least some occasions in years to come there will not be any national wage award but a process of free-for-all bargaining such as we had over so many years.</P>
      <P>I should like to be sure that in such a case the Government will not just hang around and do nothing, and wait until some time when there might be some orderly wage round again, but that they will make it their business at fixed intervals&mdash;say a maximum interval of two years&mdash;to consider this matter and deal with it rather than allow these very long delays to arise. Such delays can only mean either that very large rises are given, thereby coming into conflict with the more ignorant sections of public opinion and the newspapers, or, as is happening now, that rises are given which, while also antagonising public opinion, do not come near to bringing us up to the amount required to cover the increase in the cost of living.  I hope the Government will make it their business to see that, at the outside, not more than an interval of two years will elapse between the making of these various orders.</P>

      <P>I particularly welcome the contribution by Senator Lenihan.  It was realistic and expressed the viewpoint of most Senators, and also the general public in relation to this matter.  With regard to the point made by Senator Yeats, I think all of us would appreciate that there is a lot of merit in it, but we should hesitate in asking the Minister to give an assurance which would tie him to any particular timetable.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in introducing the Second Reading of the Bill, spelled out the Minister's intention in this regard when he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a situation where Members' remuneration is affected by national pay agreements it is clearly desirable that the delays which take place between the decision to introduce legislation and the final passing of the legislation should be <Col N="909" /> avoided.  There is no good reason why increases in remuneration of Members of the Oireachtas should be subject to obstacles which are not placed in the way of any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>That is the spirit in which section 5 has been included in the Bill.  It is important to note the point I made earlier in dealing with the recommendation proposed by Senator Yeats that the Minister can only increase the allowances.  If the situation were to arise&mdash;it does not seem very likely &mdash;where the cost of living were to go down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The indication given by the Minister in relation to this provision is well within the spirit of what was recommended by Senator Yeats and I would be prepared to accept that we should leave it at that.</P>

      <P>This section seems to me to be an example of remarkably sloppy drafting.  Paragraph (b), which relates to the allowance to be paid to the Attorney General, provides:</P>
      <P>... in case a Member of the Oireachtas holds the office&mdash;the sum of £4,430.</P>
      <P>This, originally, as it appeared in the other House provided:</P>
      <P>... in case a member of Dáil Éireann holds the office ...</P>
      <P>This has lead to a curious situation, which was pointed out to the Minister in the Dáil, where paragraph (a) fixes a certain salary for a person who is not a Member of the Oireachtas and paragraph (b) fixes the salary for a Member of the Dáil.  In the unlikely event of a Member of the Seanad becoming Attorney General there is no salary fixed at all.  Since the relevant section of the Principal Act is repealed by this section, there is no way of paying him any kind of a salary.  This was pointed out in the Dáil and, apparently, with a hurried stroke of the pen this amendment was made.  Instead of &ldquo;a Member of Dáil Éireann&rdquo; being mentioned it now reads &ldquo;a Member of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider what the result of this is.  Let us consider a Senator who becomes Attorney General.  He is paid £4,430.  On top of that he has his Seanad salary under this Bill of £2,023. This gives him a total of £6,453, whereas a person who is not a Member of the Oireachtas is paid £7,213.  In other words, because he has laid upon himself the additional duties of being a Senator, he is to be paid some £750 less than he would be paid if he became Attorney General without becoming <Col N="911" /> a Member of either House of the Oireachtas.  I am not putting this forward as an important point.  At the moment there is no immediate likelihood of any Member of the Seanad becoming Attorney General but, nevertheless, this will be an Act of the Oireachtas and this seems to be an extraordinarily slipshod way of writing a section.  Is there no explanation as to how it is framed in this way?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If you like I will give an explanation.  The Attorney General's salary is fixed under section 4 of the Principal Act.  New rates were fixed in 1947, 1960, 1964 and 1968. The present figure of £5,500 was fixed by section 6 of the 1968 amendment Act which was substituted for section 4 of the Principal Act.  The increased salary will be £7,213 when the Attorney General is not a Member of the Oireachtas and £4,430 when he is a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>An Attorney General who is a Member of either House of the Oireachtas will thus be in exactly the same position as a Minister who is a Member of either House.  Under the provisions of this Bill an Attorney General who is not a member of either House will be paid £760 a year more than either a Minister or an Attorney General who is a Member of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>It was originally intended to make no provision to cover the position of an Attorney General who was a Member of the Seanad because of the anomaly that would be created if an Attorney General Senator were to have a lesser rate than an Attorney General who was not a Member of the Oireachtas. However, the view was expressed in the debate in the Dáil that an even greater anomaly would arise if a Member of the Seanad were to be appointed Attorney General and no rate of salary were prescribed for his post.  In deference to that view, the provisions of this section were amended by the substitution of &ldquo;the Oireachtas&rdquo; in paragraph (b) for &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an Attorney General is a Member of Dáil Éireann he gets the fixed salary plus the Deputy's salary.  If he is a Member of the Seanad he gets the fixed salary plus the Senatorial <Col N="912" /> salary which is less than the TD's salary.  That is the reason why the Attorney General who is not a Member of either House of the Oireachtas gets more than an Attorney General who is a Member of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very strange.  If the present Attorney General became Taoiseach and he had to appoint a new Attorney General and if he decided to appoint Senator O'Higgins or Senator Alexis FitzGerald&mdash;two excellent men for the position&mdash;it would pay them to resign from the Seanad.  If they chose to remain as Senators they would be paid £760 less.  That is very strange.  I am concerned about them in case they should be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask Senator McGlinchey why does a Deputy get more than a Senator.  Compare the Attorney General who is a Deputy with the Attorney General who is a Senator.  Why should the person whose allowance is coupled with his salary get the same as an Attorney General whose salary is coupled with his fixed sum?</P>

      <P>I very much sympathise with those Senators who see defects in drafting.  Legislation should be properly drafted.  Members should not be embarrassed by having to divide on inaccurate drafting.  However, now we are having confessions of penury from all sides, we are to have Attorney Generals who are solicitors poorer than Attorney Generals who are also TDs, who are in turn worse off than Attorney Generals who are neither Members of the Seanad nor of Dáil Éireann. Perhaps there could be a very honest commitment from every Member of the Oireachtas to declare our interests. This is something I referred to on an earlier occasion.  Let us all&mdash;Deputies and Senators&mdash;publish our incomes and where we are getting them from. Then we will see who is in penury and who is not.  We could have a very realistic discussion then on penury and on honesty and on who is in hardship and who is not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all clear what the meaning of that last contribution <Col N="913" /> is.  What penury has to do with it?  I am interested in a curious, not to say eccentric, situation.  It appears that if a Senator becomes an Attorney General, he may gain £760 a year by retiring from the Seanad. I do not know what that has to do with penury.  It seems to me to be eccentric, no matter what the origin may have been in the Bill.</P>
      <P>It occurs to me that one of the reasons why all this problem arose was perhaps that on this occasion, because the Attorney General was a Member of Dáil Éireann it was decided to give him two salaries, one as a Member of Dáil Éireann and one as Attorney General.  Before I go any further on this point there is one piece of information which I should be very glad to have if the Parliamentary Secretary could give it to me.  Is this a new idea or was this done on previous occasions when the Attorney General of the day was a Member of the Dáil?  This has happened several times.  Was he paid his full salary as Attorney General and his Dáil salary?</P>

      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirleach, I am very sorry you are in the Chair at this present time.  Even at this stage the Oireachtas discriminates in jobs between men and women, despite all the talk about &ldquo;Women's Lib&rdquo;.  Anybody eligible for the position of Attorney General, whether he comes from the Seanad or the Dáil, is entitled to command the salary attached to that position.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This applies whether his salary in the Seanad is £2,023 a year as from 1st July last&mdash;we have not got our increase yet but we hope to get it&mdash;or his salary from the Dáil is £3,216.  Whether he comes from the Seanad or the Dáil, he is entitled to the same salary.  He is serving Ireland, he is filling the position that he has been appointed to by the Government of the day and he is entitled to the salary.  This Seanad should put a recommendation to Dáil Éireann to that effect.  I do not think it has happened yet that an Attorney General was appointed from the Seanad; but <Col N="914" /> with the number of legal men we have in the Seanad it is quite possible that at some future date it could happen. We have had Senators appointed Ministers. They are entitled to the same remuneration as if they were Members of Dáil Éireann.  We are equally as important as Dáil Éireann.  Maybe in certain circumstances we are more important than the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should be getting more than £2,023.  In the last Seanad I represented a part of the constituency where there was no Deputy.  Thank God that position has changed.  I am not sorry.  My opposite number, Senator O'Toole, is now a Senator in part of a constituency where there is no TD.</P>
      <P>A man appointed to the job of Attorney General, no matter where he comes from, should have a set salary.  It should be the same salary whether he comes from the Seanad, the Dáil or outside.  His Dáil or Seanad salary should not be taken into consideration at all.  There should be no such thing as a different salary for a Minister appointed from Seanad Éireann.  The only difference is that he does not go through the Lobby. The salary for the Attorney General should be a fixed figure.  That is my contention, and I think I am not far wrong.  If one man can do a job another man can do it equally well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>May I clarify for Senator Yeats the point he raised?  It is rather long drawn out, but I will deal with it.  Section 3 of the Principal Act deals with Deputies' and Senators' allowances.  The rates were fixed by subsection (1) and (2) respectively of that section.  Each time new rates were fixed in 1947, 1960, 1964 and 1968 new subsections (1) and (2) were substituted for the original sections of the Principal Act.  That is the Act of 1938.  The same is now being done on this occasion.  The remaining provisions of section 3 of the Principal Act provided that the salary of a parliamentary office holder, such as a minister, would be deemed to include <Col N="915" /> his Deputy's or senatorial allowance; and that the Deputy's or Senator's allowance or the allowance part of a parliamentary office holder's salary would be exempt from income tax.</P>
      <P>These provisions were abolished by the 1960 Amendment Act except in so far as the first provision continued to apply to the Attorney General.  It followed that a parliamentary office holder other than the Attorney General could get both his salary as an office holder and his allowance as a Deputy or Senator.  But worst of all, affecting every one of us, was the provision that a Deputy or a Senator's allowance and his salary if he is also a parliamentary office holder were no longer exempt from income tax.</P>
      <P>A specific provision was inserted in the Act of 1960 to cover the case of the Attorney General.  If he was a Deputy or Senator his salary was deemed to include his allowance.  The provision relating to the Attorney General is no being deleted.  Provision is made in section 8 of this Bill for the case of an Attorney General (1) who is not a Member of the Oireachtas; and (2) who is a Member of the Oireachtas. In the latter case the salary paid to the Attorney General will be the same as that payable to a Minister, namely £4,430 and his Deputy's or senatorial allowance will be payable in addition. That clarifies the point that if an Attorney General is a Member of Dáil Éireann he gets £4,430 plus his Deputy's allowance.  If he is a Member of Seanad Éireann he gets £4,430 plus the senatorial allowance.  Does that clarify the position for Senator Yeats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not clarify the position as far as I am concerned.  The Attorney General, whether he comes from the Seanad or the Dáil, does the same job; and there are many Members of the present Seanad who are probably equally as capable as is the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have many men here with legal training.  They have established themselves throughout the country as talented members of the legal profession. Why should a person just <Col N="916" /> because he is a Member of the Seanad have to suffer a loss of pay if he is appointed as Attorney General? There should be a fixed salary for the Attorney General regardless of his Deputy's or Senator's allowances.  The Parliamentary Secretary may laugh.</P>

      <P>While the Parliamentary Secretary has attempted to clarify the position, to me at any rate it sounds just as absurd now as it did before the clarification.  I am not comparing the allowances paid to a Deputy and a Senator.  I am comparing the salary paid to a person who is not a Member of the Oireachtas and to a Senator who may be Attorney General.  The Taoiseach may have before him the names of two people for the post of Attorney General&mdash;Mr. X, Senior Counsel, and say, Senator Alexis FitzGerald.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Legally it is right. according to law it is right, and that is the law we must go by.  There is a fixed sum for the Attorney General. The Attorney General's emoluments include his Deputy's or Senator's salary.  Add the fixed sum to either of these salaries and then you will find the Attorney General's remuneration.</P>

      <P>Hold the solemn thought for a minute and you will see whether I agree or not. Senator McGlinchey's point seems to me to be a valid one: that the Attorney General who is not a Member of the Seanad would get more in salary as Attorney General than the Attorney General who is a Member of the Seanad would get when you combine the Attorney General's salary as a member of the Oireachtas plus his Seanad allowance.  There would be a gap there.  The person who is not a Member of the Seanad is in a more advantageous position.</P>
      <P>Senator McGlinchey is quite right that that is the factual position.  I do not understand fully why that should be except to this extent that it was made clear in the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks at the beginning in relation to the present position that you have an Attorney General who has given a commitment not to engage in private practice.  Presumably that would be a precedent to be desired by Members of the House generally and I daresay would be followed by Attorney Generals who are Members of the House.</P>
      <P>As against that you are dealing with an Attorney General outside the House who may or may not.  If he decides not to continue in private practice he has no supplement such as an Attorney General who is a Member of the House has, in relation to the Dáil that is substantial.  In relation to the Seanad it will drop.  It is a matter for himself whether in those circumstances he would accept the post.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the ideal solution &mdash;I do not expect tht it will recommend itself to the Minister for Finance &mdash;would be to have Deputies' and Senators' allowances the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself basically in agreement with much of what Senator Garrett has been saying.  The reason for this curious anomaly which <Col N="918" /> has arisen seems to be that the attempt is being made to equate the salary of the Attorney General to that of a Minister by including the Dáil salary. As Senator Garrett has pointed out, a sum should be fixed for the Attorney General, sufficient to encourage the right person to take up the job.  If he happens to be a Deputy or a Senator, then that allowance should be added to his Attorney General salary.  The position since 1968 was that the Attorney General was paid £5,500.  If he was a Dáil Deputy he got another £2,500 bringing him up to £8,000.  All right, this sum gave him a higher salary than a Minister.  Unfortunately, there are plenty of people in the country who get a higher salary than Ministers.  What has happened here and what has caused all the trouble is that somebody somewhere came to the conclusion that it was wrong that the Attorney General should be paid more than a Minister, and attempted to reshuffle all the figures to avoid this taking place.  I cannot see the real justice of this.</P>
      <P>If an Attorney General is worth £7,213, then that is the correct figure for him to receive.  The fact that he has all the additional burden of being a Dáil Deputy is a reason why he is entitled to get another £3,400-odd in addition to his Attorney General's salary.  This will give him a lot more than a Minister, but there are large numbers of people who are paid more than a Minister so I do not see why an Attorney General should not also particularly since the sort of people who become Attorney Generals, in very many cases, are earning salaries at the bar which are already vastly in advance of anything that a Minister could possibly get.  This is what has caused the trouble.  Far be it from me to urge the Government to pay an Attorney General more.  The Attorney General is able to look after himself. Nonetheless, it is cheeseparing which has caused all the trouble.</P>

We have in Seanad Éireann solicitors, junior and senior counsel, who are as highly qualified as those in Dáil Éireann.  If any of these gentlemen are picked to fill the Attorney General's position will they suffer the stigma that they were not sufficiently qualified to obtain the top salary?

      <P>As this Bill is closely related to the budget for the current financial year, it would be appropriate, at the outset of my speech, to describe the economic background to the budget and to outline the action taken by the Government to improve the overall position.</P>
      <P>Last year, unemployment among insured persons averaged 8.1 per cent, a level higher than in any year since 1958; the number of unemployed on the live register last year averaged 72,000; the total number at work fell to 10,000 below the 1971 level.</P>
      <P>The consumer price index was up by 8½ per cent last year&mdash;the fourth successive year of high price rises&mdash;with food prices rising especially strongly and there was a ubstantial spillover effect on price in the current year.  For the past three years, the growth of GNP was running at about 3 per cent. Although there were indications that the economy would expand at a rate of about 4 per cent, this was unsatisfactory because a far greater improvement is needed if we are to make fuller use of productive capacity, reduce the level of unemployment and raise the all-round standard of living.</P>
      <P>Faced with these difficult problems of inflation, hardship due to poverty, unemployment and under-utilisation of resources, the Government set out to remedy the situation by way of an expansionary budget planned to get the economy on to a higher growth path and the granting of large social welfare increases which more than compensated the less well-off for the rise in the cost of living.  The removal of food from the scope of VAT was a further step of major social significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> The principal fiscal action to stimulate the economy was the rise of about £190 million in the combined capital and current budgets.</P>
    <P>The capital budget for this financial year shows a rise of about 23 per cent over last year's outturn.  This increase has been widely spread with substantial additional sums being earmarked for housing, industry, agricultureand telephones.  These increases aredesigned to lift the growth rate appreciably and, by enhancing resources and making for their fuller use, will add to employment and boost the general levl of prosperity.</P>
    <P>Current outlay, up by about 20 per cent, will also contribute to the stimulation of economic growth.  Significant increases in the non-capital budget were attributable to the fresh instalment of the phased transfer of housing subsidies and health charges to the Exchequer, higher outlay in the sphere of education, a higher provision for security and many other items.  A main feature of the current expenditure side of the budget sas, of course, been the addition to the social welfare outlay.  The 1973 budget did more in the social welfare field than any of its predecessors.  An idea of its extent is gained from the fact that, in a full year, the improvements will cost £68¾ million of which £52½ million will fall on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>This is a brief summary of the policy underlying the 1973 budget and an outline of the planned expenditure pattern which has both social and economic implications.  Since borrowing to meet fully the financing requirements of the budget would over stimulate the economy, we had recourse to some increases in taxes and charges.</P>
    <P>These increases, however, were relatively moderate when compared with net increases imposed in other recent budgets.  The full year effect of the 1973 tax changes will be an increase of about 3½ per cent in tax revenue, while the budgets of 1970, 1968, 1966 and 1963 resulted in increases of 8½ per cent, 6½ per cent, 9¾ per cent and 10¾ per cent, respectively.</P>
    <P>The major social welfare concessions <Col N="923" /> and the substantial projected rise in overall Government expenditure do not, I hope, minimise the Government's equally considerable tax reform programme launched in the budget, or the variety of tax reliefs being provided in the Finance Bill. This Bill is but the first concrete step in the realisation of this long overdue reform and it is our intention to proceed quickly with the necessary research and other background work, already begun, so that reform may be a reality at the earliest possible date. I shall refer to the question in greater depth later, in my outline and brief commentary on the provisions of the Bill, when dealing with the various taxes involved.</P>
    <P>I now turn to Part I of the Bill which deals with income tax, including sur-tax, and corporation profits tax matters.  Senators will agree with the view that the plague of unemployment has ben with us for far too long and that it is of fundamental importance to put our economic activity on a firm and expansionary footing for the highly competitive years ahead.  Every encouragement must, therefore, be givn to the xploitation of new ideas and improved methods which will help to secure and indeed widen employment opportunitis here for all our pople.  As a supplement to the direct measures already taken by the Government to this end, the Finance Bill provids a number of indirect, but none the less valuable, incntives for increased investment, research and innovation in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to renw for a further two years, to 31st March, 1975, the special accelerated capital allowances for plant, machinery and industrial buildings so as to speed up investment and bring about faster growth.  Section 9 renews the 100 per cent initial allowance for capital expenditure on new plant and machinery, enabling such expenditure to be written off in on year, and also ensures that a trader will not get allowances, apart from the additional 20 per cent investment allowance&mdash; being renewed in section 16&mdash;which applies in the designated areas, of <Col N="924" /> more than 100 per cent of the cost of plant and machinery.  Section 11 ensures the recovery of excess capital allowances which may have been obtained by virtue of an unintended loophole in existing legislation.  Section 17 renews the provision for the free depreciation of new plant and machinery provided for use outside the designated areas and section 10 renews the 20 per cent initial allowance for capital expenditure incurred on industrial buildings.</P>
    <P>Section 8 secures that the 40 per cent shipping investment allowance will not be available in respect of future contracts during the currency of the free depreciation provision being renewed by the Bill.  Income from patent royalties arising to any person resident in this country will be exempt from both income tax, including sur-tax and corporation profits tax under section 34, provided the work in connection with the devising of the patented invention is carried out here, and section 21 provides tax relief for payments made by traders or professional people to any Irish university for the purpose of enabling that university to undertake research in, or engage in the teaching of, industrial relations, marketing and other approved subjects.  I am hopeful that these two reliefs will herald a new bloom of creative endeavour for the benefit of the community at large.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the other reliefs provided in Part I of the Bill.  At the outset, I should mention that while the Government would be glad to be in a position to increase personal tax-free allowances in this Finance Bill, it is, however, not possible because of the present heavy commitments on the limited resources available.  It is the Government's earnest wish that the special expansionary measures to which I have just referred will amply bear fruit and thus provide the resources for further alleviation of tax burdens where they bear most heavily.  Within the limited resources available, the Government decided to provide relief at this time to a number of special categories.</P>
    <P>Section 2 increases from £74 to £104 the maximum special earned income relief in respect of a wife's earnings <Col N="925" /> and is designed to reduce the comparatively heavy tax burden on working wives and thereby ease the staffing problems encountered in a number of sectiors.  Section 4 raises from £295 to £347 the limit on a dependent relative's income to ensure that the full dependent relative allowance can be claimed where the dependent relative has no income other than the caximum non-contributory old age pension which was increased in the budget. Section 19 exempts from tax payments to or in respect of Irish thalidomide victims from the German foundation.</P>
    <P>With a view to facilitating the adaptation, over an extended period, to the 1972 code of occupational pension schemes approved for the purpsoes of tax reliefs under pre-1972 legislation, section 7 enables such schemes to pay in lump sum form a tax-free death-in-service benefit of up to four times the deceased employee's final remuneration, as permitted under the 1972 legislation. Section 12 raises from £350 to £450 the limit on the maximum annuity payable by registered trade unions enjoying tax exemption in respect of the income from which such annuities and other provident benefits are paid.</P>
    <P>Section 14 secures that the benefit of the tax exemption in respect of non-bedded minerals is passed on by a holding company to their shareholders when they are paying dividends out of exempted income.  I should mention in this context that the Minister for Industry and Commerceis at present reviewing the fiscal policy in relation to mining in the light of the report of the interdepartmental committee.  Section 33 and the Third Schedule to the Bill extend the charge to tax of profits derived from activities and of income from employment on our section of the Continental Shelf.</P>
    <P>This country has, I regret, been somewhat lethargic in its adoption and in its promotion of the observance of international conventions relating to fundamental human rights and freedom. In order to stimulate more public awareness of and direct involvement in this very important task the Bill makes a special two-fold provision for tax relief.  Section 20 provides <Col N="926" /> exemption from income tax for certain consultative bodies whose objects are the promotion of observance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and/or the implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, while section 15 provides that annual payments under covenant to such bodies for a period of three years or more will be recognised for income tax purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 36 extends to 31st December, 1973, the exemption from corporation profits tax which applies to certain public utility companies, the Agricultural Credit Corporation and building societies.</P>
    <P>Sections 13, 31, 32, 37 and 38 of the Bill arise out of and give effect to the agreement and protocol of 2nd May, 1973, between the Irish and the British Governments in regard to new arrangements for the avoidance of double taxation of dividends flowing between the two countries.  The texts of the agreement and protocol are set out in the Second and Fourth Schedules, respectively, to the Bill. The new arrangements will, however, continue for a period of two years only, commencing on 6th April, 1973, and the negotiation of a further agreement will, of course, then arise.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the new arrangements ensure that, as far as possible, the position of the Irish Exchequer and of Irish residents who have shares in companies located in Britatin or Northern Ireland will not be adversely affected during the currency of the new arrangements.  Under these arrangements the tax credit relating to dividends allowable under the new British system will be paid to all shareholders resident here other than direct investors, that is, companies with a stake of 10 per cent or more in the company paying the dividend.</P>
    <P>Direct investors, however, will be allowed a credit against Irish income tax in respect of so much of the British corporation tax on the profits out of which the dividends are paid as cannot be allowed against our corporation profits tax.  On the other hand, British residents will continue to be entitled to exemption from Irish <Col N="927" /> income tax in respect of dividends received from companies in this country except that, in the case of dividends paid by Irish companies to direct investors in Britain, income tax of up to 5 per cent on those dividends will be retained here so as to safeguard the Irish Exchequer.  Britain will, however, give relief against corporation tax for Irish income tax so retained, as well as for the Irish corporation profits tax underlying dividents paid to direct investors in Britain.</P>
    <P>Much attention has been focussed in the other House and outside on section 3 of the Bill which secures, in the case of taxpayers whose net income for income tax purposes exceeds £2,500 a year, the recoupment of the budget income in social welfare children's allowances.  Marginal relief from this recoupment is provided where net income slightly exceeds that figure&mdash;the recoupment does not, of course, apply for sur-tax purposes.  The Government considered that a line must be drawn at a certain income level so as to direct Exchequer family assistance to the most needy.  To do otherwise would clearly be wasteful of scarce resources. The Bill's proposal will, however, only affect a rather small proportion of tapayers, some 5 per cent or about 40,000 in all, as far as can be estimated at this stage.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill is designed to remove a legal doubt as to the validity of tax assessments on the personal representative of a deceased member of a partnership in respect of that member's share of the partnership profits arising prior to his death and section 18 authorises the administrator of a statutory superannuation scheme to deduct the appropriate tax from refunded contributions.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of tax reform and the remaining sections of Part I of the Bill.  As the Minister for Finance indicated in his Budget statement and in reply to debates in the other House, considerable progress has been made towards the simplification of personal taxation and I am hopeful that it will be possible to introduce the necessary legislation in the present <Col N="928" /> year.  It will then be possible to divert the necessary staff and resources to an in-depth examination of more fundamental aspects of personal taxation. Progressing concurrently with work towards the simplification of personal taxation is the examination of the detailed comments of interested parties on the question of changes in company taxation on the lines set out in last year's White Paper on the subject.  We are not at this stage in a position to put forward concrete proposals in this regard but, subject to EEC and other developments in this field, we hope to be able to do so at an early date.</P>
    <P>Tax avoidance, which is socially and economically undesirable, must also be curtatiled and scare resources channelled into the most worthy avenues.  Conscientious taxpayers must not be put at a disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> defaulters and I am certain that Senaors will support the Government's efforts to create the climate which will ensure that obligations in this matter will be duly fulfilled.</P>
    <P>It is in this light that the remaining sections of Part I of the Bill, namely, sections 1, 5, 22, 23, and the First Schedule, sections 24, 25 to 30, 35, 39 and the Fifth Schedule and sections 40 to 46 have been drafted.</P>
    <P>Section 43 is designed to impose the same penalty&mdash;of £20 plus £20 per day with a separate penalty on the secretary where a body of persons is involved&mdash;for failure to remit PAYE as applies in the case of failure toremit VAT.  Section 1 imposes the same minimum interest charge of £5 in respect of overdue tav collected under PAYE by employers as applies in the case of overdue VAT.  Section 35 ensures that interest on unpaid PAYE tax, VAT and stamp duty will not be allowed as a deduction for income tax or corporation profits tax purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is designed to facilitate penalty proceedings for the payment of PAYE tax estimated to be due by specifying that a certificate signed by an officer of the Revenue Commissioners that the tax so estimated is payable will constitute <i>prima facie</i> evidence to that effect.</P>
    <P>Section 46 aligns the income tax <Col N="929" /> penalty for fraudulently made incorrect returns or statements by a body of persons to the VAT penalty of £1,000 and section 45 raises from £50 to £100 the penalty for failure to produce records in connection with claims for exports tax relief.  In short, these provision are designed to align the penalty provisions for the various taxes and thus provide greater ease of administration.</P>
    <P>Anti-avoidance measures are contained in section 5 which deals with tax on income accumulated under a trust, section 23 and the First Schedule to the Bill which restrict tax relief in respect of life insurance premiums to policies of at least ten years: this applies only to policies made on the lives of persons under 56 years of age.  Section 24 restricts tax relief in respect of business entertainment expenditure to expenditure wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred for the purpose of the trade or profession with the similar restriction on capital allowances for plant and machinery used in this connection. Sections 25 to 30 which are designed to restrict capital allowances in the case of expensive cars to what these allowances would have been if the cars had cost only £2,500.  Section 40 which withdraws the right to certain allowances in respect of industrial buildings where contrived transactions between companies of a group can result in the cost of such buildings being written off for tax purposes at a greatly accelerated rate and section 44 which is intended to prevent tax avoidance through the medium of friendly societies.</P>
    <P>Section 39 and the Fifth Schedule to the Bill aim at disallowing the tax saving to purchasing companies of companies which are dormant or near dormant and have accumulated substantial tax losses.  It is not intended that ailing companies with sizeable employment will be affected by these provisions and the section will be liberally interpreted so as not to discourage worthwhile mergers in <i>bona fide</i> cases where tax saving is not the primary motive in the purchase of the ailing company.  Sections 41 and 42 deal with benefits in kind.  The purpose <Col N="930" /> of section 41 is to stop a tax avoidance device which enables some benefits in kind to escape tax because they are provided, not by the employing company, but by an associated company. Benefits in kind provided by non-trading bodies will, by virtue of section 42, be charged to tax in the hands of the directors or employees in the same way as similar benefits provided by trading bodies.</P>
    <P>I now come to Part II of the Bill which is largely concerned with the increases in customs and excise duties imposed in the budget.  Sections 47, 48 and 49 are concerned with the beer, spirits and tobacco increases respectively.  While any Government approaches tax increases with some reluctance, we felt justified in imposing these moderate increases in view of the remarkable buoyancy of revenue from the &ldquo;old reliables&rdquo;.  We are also confident that consumers appreciated that these increases were essential to enable the undertaking of this year's unprecedented improvement in the lot of the poor and disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Section 50 deals with the imposition of a special excise duty on tobacco stocks held by manufacturers at 5 p.m. on budget day.  This is in line with the practice in recent years when the tobacco duty was increased and is designed to divert to the Exchequer the enhanced value of stocks held by manufacturers on budget day.  The Minister for Finance introduced an amendment to this section at the Committee Stage in the Dáil to give full relief from this special excise duty to the small manufacturers, who specialise in plug and twist tobaccos and whose clientele&mdash;which consists largely of elderly rural people&mdash;presents little scope for passing on the rise in the duty on stocks.  I am satisfied that this concession was warranted in order to avoid the risk of a loss of employment that might result from a contraction in sales by these small manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Section 51 provides for the use, under certain circumstances, of materials other than tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes for export, while section 52 confirms a number of orders made by the Government <Col N="931" /> under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is concerned with death duties and contains the interim reliefs in the field of estate duty which are designed to alleviate the greatest hardships of the system pending its replacement by a new system of capital taxation.  Senators will appreciate that the abolition of estate duty, to which the Government are totally committed, could not be done without making provision for an alternative form of capital taxation. Quite apart from the revenue involved, which is substantial, a balanced system of taxation requires that large holdings of wealth should be taxed, in addition to whatever other forms of taxation apply to income and expenditure.</P>
    <P>The exemption limits for estate duty and for legacy and succession duty are raised from £7,500 to £10,000 by sections 53 and 54 of the Bill.  Section 55 increases the rates of legacy duty and succession duty, which are payable only in respect of property passing outside the lineal family. The very valuable abatements of estate duty in favour of widows and dependent children are increased to twice their present levels by section 56.  The limit for the application of artificial valuation to agricultural land, by virtue of which the great majority of farms escape estate duty, is raised from £2,000 to £3,000 by section 57.</P>
    <P>Sections 58 and 59 provide that the first £7,500 of superannuation death benefits and insurance policy benefits, respectively, will be excluded from the estate for estate duty purposes.</P>
    <P>Some securities&mdash;for example certain Government, semi-State and local authority stocks&mdash;are exempt from estate duty where the owner is neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.  Section 60 of the Bill provides that a similar exemption will apply to units of a unit trust scheme all of whose underlying securities are of this type.</P>
    <P>At present when a person who jointly holds a bank deposit account <Col N="932" /> dies, the bank may not pay out a balance exceeding £1,000 to the surviving joint-depositor unless a certificate or consent from the Revenue Commissioners is produced.  This provision is designed to prevent death duty evasion through non-disclosure.  Section 61 proposes to extend this restriction to all institutions accepting deposits from the public.</P>
    <P>In Part IV of the Bill there are two Chapters, the first dealing with the stamp duties changes announced in the budget and the second providing for the implementation of an EEC directive relating to stamp duty on capital companies.</P>
    <P>In Chapter 1, section 62 is a commencement provision and section 63 is consequential on the exemption from duty of mortgages up to £10,000 which is provided in section 64, together with a reduction in the rates of duty charged on sales of houses and lands up to £10,000 in value. These reliefs are of substantial benefit to persons buying moderately-priced houses.  As announced in the budget, we decided to recoup part of the cost of these reliefs by increasing, from 10 per cent to 15 per cent, the rate of stamp duty on certain contracts for the construction, alteration and enlargement of offices, and the necessary provision is contained in section 65.  As we were anxious that the stamp duty reliefs should operate from the earliest practicable date, the Government made an order under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, bringing the changes into effect from 1st June last.  The provisions of this Chapter of the Bill will replace the provisions of the order which is, accordingly, revoked in section 66.</P>
    <P>Chapter II of Part IV of the Bill implements an EEC Directive, issued in 1969, concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital by companies and firms.  One of the purposes of the Treaty which established the European Economic Community was the creation of an economic union whose characteristics are similar to those of a domestic market.  One of the essential conditions for achieving this union is the promotion of the free movement of capital.  The differing indirect <Col N="933" /> taxes in force in the member states on the raising of capital give rise to discrimination, double taxation and disparities which interfere with the free movement of capital.  To prevent these interferences, the tax on the raising of capital within the EEC by a company or firm should be charged once only and the level of the tax should be the same in all member states.  In short, the theme of the directive is that harmonisation of the duties on the raising of capital is essential, both as regards the structure and the rates of duty.  The directive sets out the lines which that harmonisation should follow and this Chapter of the Bill provides accordingly. The present company capital duty and loan capital duty require to be abolished and a new stamp duty imposed in their stead.</P>
    <P>Section 67 contains the necessary definitions appertaining to this Chapter, including provision that the Chapter will become operative from 1st August, 1973, or the date of the passing of the Bill, whichever is the later. In this connection I should mention that any company that paid stamp duty under the present system in respect of a transaction which took place after 1st January, 1973, will have the option of having the duty reassessed under the new system.</P>
    <P>Section 68 sets out the transactions which will give rise to a charge of stamp duty.  This section also prescribes the effective centre of management of a company as the criterion for determining the location of a company for the purpose of the new duty whereas, under the present system, the relevant factor is the registered office, which, of course, would not always be in the same place as the effective centre of management.</P>
    <P>Section 69 provides that the rate of stamp duty to be charged in respect of capital contributions will be 1 per cent, which is the lowest rate permissible under the directive and which is the common rate which all member states will be required to charge as from 1st January, 1976.  This compares with a rate of 0.25 per cent in the case of the present company capital duty and 0.125 per cent in the case of the present loan capital duty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> The base on which the new stamp duty will be charged will, as provided in section 70, be the amount of the actual value of the assets contributed to the company or firm instead of, as under the present system, the nominal value of the shares issued.  Section 71 abolishes the present company capital duty and loan capital duty and gives taxpayers the option, to which I have already referred, of having these duties reassessed in the case of transactions since 1st January, 1973.</P>
    <P>Section 72 provides an exemption from the new duty in the case of certain merger and take-over transactions and section 73 exempts certain public bodies and cultural, charitable and educational organisations.  Section 74 provides for appeals on the question of the value of the assets on which duty may be charged while section 75 provides for the recovery of duty and the furnishing of information in relation to liable transactions.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with value-added tax.  It implements the major changes in VAT announced in the budget.  These changes involve the removal of the tax from food and the necessary increases on other items.  In addition, Part V provides for some matters of detail, designed to facilitate administration or prevent avoidance. The opportunity is being taken to effect also some necessary modifications of penalty provisions and to incorporate in the statute some minor matters which are at present provided for in ministerial orders made under the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972.</P>
    <P>Anything which affects the price of essential foodstuffs is a matter of basic importance for the poorer sections of our community since they spend a large proportion of their incomes on food.  By contrast, the food expenditure of well-off people represents a much smaller proportion of their incomes.  A tax on food, therefore, bears relatively heavily on poorer people.  The removal of such tax through a zero rating for VAT purposes is a practical step to give relief to people on limited means.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> The exact definition of the commodities to be zero rated was settled after discussions with trading interests. The results are indicated in the Bill&mdash;sections 78 and 88 refer.  They have also been published in a Press notice for the information of traders generally.  As well as essential foods the zero rating covers oral medicines. On the other hand, the concession will not extend to certain luxury items which affect family outlay only marginally. Neither will it extend to catering but I might mention here that it is being provided in section 87 that an exemption for catering services will be provided for patients in hospitals and pupils in schools.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, essential that when VAT is removed from food, there will be a corresponding reduction of 5 per cent in retail prices.  My colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is attending to this aspect.  We have, of course, been anxious to give the relief as quickly as possible.  However, it was found that it would not be practicable for traders to make the necessary preparations to operate the proposed VAT changes before September and the date set is Monday, 3rd September.  Making the change on a Monday will give traders the advantage of a week-end to complete preparations and should help to ensure a full and general reduction of prices of the goods to be zero rated.</P>
    <P>The transfer of food and oral medicines to the zero rate of VAT necessitates increases in other rates of VAT. These increases are provided for in section 80 of the Bill.  In addition to meeting the cost of the reliefs given in respect of food, <i>et cetera</i>, the increases are designed to provide a relatively modest contribution of some £2.6 million this year towards general budgetary needs.  When account is taken of the food concession, I think that the increases in VAT on other items will not be a financial burden on anyone.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the effective rate of VAT on building work, which is about 3 per cent, is not being increased; in fact, as a result of the adjustments, there will be a slight <Col N="936" /> marginal reduction in the rate for building work.</P>
    <P>The changes in VAT to which I have referred&mdash;that is the zero rating of food, <i>et cetera</i>, and the offsetting increases on other items&mdash;are calculated to have a net downward effect equivalent to 0.5 per cent on the consumer price index.  Among the various items which enter into the base of the index food has a high weighting, as would be expected in view of the importance of food costs in the household budget.</P>
    <P>Having now outlined the salient features of the proposed VAT changes, I will move on to some matters of detail.</P>
    <P>Section 79 relates to what are called &ldquo;self-services&rdquo;, that is, services rendered by a trader for his own business or in connection with it.  It replaces an existing statutory provision and ensures that VAT will be neutral as between services provided within a firm and similar services by an outside contractor. Chiefly in mind here is the position of commercial firms supplying catering services for businesses.  Section 80 provides that a commercial caterer will be accountable for tax on the value of food used by him in rendering his services, whether or not he himself purchased the food.  This is essentially an anti-avoidance provision.</P>
    <P>Section 80 also enables the Revenue Commissioners to settle doubts by making formal statutory determinations of the rates of VAT appropriate in particular cases.  Such determinations by the Revenue Commissioners will, of course, be subject to appeal to the appeal commissioners&mdash;and from them to the courts.</P>
    <P>Under sections 81 and 85, small traders who have not been registered for VAT, but who want to get tax credit for the VAT element which they have borne on stocks held on 3rd September, will be able to do so by becoming registered for VAT.</P>
    <P>Normally, traders have 19 days of grace for payment of VAT after the end of a taxable period.  Section 82 is necessitated by the provision&mdash;made in the Tenth Schedule&mdash;for extension of the normal July-August taxable period <Col N="937" /> to end on 2nd September this year.  Tax in respect of this taxable period will be payable on or before 19th September.</P>
    <P>In sections 83 and 84 penalties for certain offences under the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, are being increased.  The change brings them into line with similar penalties under the income tax code.</P>
    <P>Section 86 provides that, in the absence of agreement between the parties concerned, prices quoted in existing contracts will be adjusted where this is necessitated by the changes in respect of VAT.</P>
    <P>Section 87 provides for the exemption of horses and greyhounds from VAT.  It has been found that, due to the frequency of importations, the operation of VAT was affecting the functioning of these industries.  The exemption now provided is considered to be the best solution.</P>
    <P>Section 87 also provides an exemption from VAT in respect of the natural or artificial insemination of cattle, sheep and pigs.  This will remove an anomaly arising out of the VAT arrangements for agriculture.</P>
    <P>Section 88, which deals with zero ratings, includes provisions of importance for agriculture.  It extends the zero rate, which at present applies to manufactured fertilisers and feeding stuffs and also to cover oral medicines for animals as well as seeds and plants for the production of food.  It is calculated that these reliefs for farmers will suffice to offset the extra input tax which will arise for them from the increased VAT rates on other items.</P>
    <P>Under VAT, farmers are not required to register for the tax but are compensated for the tax on their inputs by a 1 per cent tax addition to the prices of their outputs.  This addition by unregistered farmers does not affect food prices, since the traders who buy from farmers are usually registered for VAT: these traders, therefore, get a refund from the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the 1 per cent tax addition which they have paid to farmers.</P>
    <P>Section 88 also incorporates certain zero ratings already provided by ministerial orders made under the 1972 Act.  An example is the zero <Col N="938" /> rate for the life saving services of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.</P>
    <P>Section 89 makes some necessary changes consequential on the zero ratings and exemptions which I have just mentioned.  It also provides for the consolidation in the legislation of certain ministerial orders, apart from those referred to in connection with zero rating.</P>
    <P>Section 90 and the Tenth Schedule provide for various amendments of the 1972 VAT Act.  These are mainly of a consequential or supplementary nature. Only one of the amendments merits specific mention.  It extends the definition of manufacturer to include a person who supplies materials to another for the purposes of having motor cars, television sets, or any of the other goods which are at present liable to the 30.26 per cent rate of VAT, manufactured or assembled on his behalf.  The 30.26 per cent will, of course, be increased to 36.75 per cent under section 80 from 3rd September. Of the full 36.75 per cent, 30 percentage points will effectively apply at the manufacturer level only.  The amendment, which is to take effect immediately on the enactment of the Bill, is designed to ensure that linked companies cannot make arrangements to reduce the element of value of such goods to which the tax levied at manufacturer level only will apply.</P>
    <P>Apart from some routine and consequential matters the main content of Part VI of the Bill relates to the vehicle excise duties increases, imposed in the budget, which are contained in sections 93 to 95 inclusive.  Section 93 increases the rates of road tax on motor cars, motor cycles, agricultural tractors and other tractors.  In the case of commercial goods vehicles there are increases on vehicles up to about 8 tons unladen weight and reductions on heavier vehicles.  There is no change in the road tax on small public service vehicles, taxis and hearses.</P>
    <P>A new charge to be levied when a vehicle is registered for the first time is imposed in section 94.  This charge will go some way towards covering the costs incurred by licensing authorities on the first registration of a vehicle. The increase in driving licence fees is contained in section 95.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> A tax exemption is provided in section 92 for securities issued in this country by certain European bodies. The section will put such securities in the same tax position as securities issued by certain semi-State bodies. Section 91 contains the usual annual provisions relating to the annuity charged on the Central Fund and paid into the capital services redemption account.</P>
    <P>Section 96 repeals a number of enactments to the extent necessary to comply with the EEC directive on stamp duty to which I referred earlier. Section 97 is a routine provision regarding the care and management of the taxes and duties imposed in the Bill.  Section 98 contains the necessary citation, construction and commencement provisions.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will I believe contribute in no small measure to the development of this country as a progressive society based on social justice and accordingly, I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of measures in this Bill which will commend themselves to the Seanad, particularly those matters related to improving the tax avoidance situation as far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned.  This is a hardy annual battle in which every year the Revenue Commissioners seek to tighten evasions and to ensure the maximum amount of justice in regard to collection of taxes.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach rightly stated in his opening speech, the Finance Bill must be taken in the context of the overall economic background of our economy and in particular of the budget which is the annual instrument of the Government in implementing their economic policy.  The Finance Bill implements budget provisions which one would hope would improve the economy not only in the year ahead but in the years ahead.  This is the continuing process of the economic management of modern Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refrain at the present juncture from any consideration of details in regard to specific sections.  My <Col N="940" /> party propose to engage section by section in a detailed debate on Committee Stage.  At this stage it is important to bring this debate back to a sense of reality and, with all due respect to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Finance in regard to their contributions on both the Finance Bill and the budget in the Dáil, a sense of reality was noticeably absent.</P>
    <P>The first reality is that the Government were elected by the people last March fundamentally on the basis of doing something about prices.  A false hope was engendered in the course of their 14-point programme that they could do something about prices.  A highly dishonest impression was conveyed to the public that by some magic notion of a change of Government the prices situation and the cost of living could be remedied.  The Government, faced with this situation, and having to live up to promises made, embarked on a policy of price control in regard to which they are already rowing back fast.  Recently, the Minister for Industry and Commerce raised more than ten of the maximum retail prices which he had set at a fixed level one month prior to that.</P>
    <P>CIE rates and fares have been raised by Government decision to a level above that recommended by the National Prices Commission.  We are faced with the position where already between February and May of this year in the consumer price index food group alone, prices have risen nearly three times more than in the corresponding period last year.  On a basis of 100 based on mid-November, 1968, the consumer price index in regard to the food group which rose this time last year from February to May from 131.6 to 134.6, this year rose from 153.4 to 161.4; a rise last year of three points, a rise this year of eight points, practically three times the rise during the equivalent period last year.</P>
    <P>This is a serious problem and there is no point in the Government seeking to assuage the public by price control measures which are totally defective and ineffective.  There is no point in the Government, at enormous cost to the Exchequer, indeed, on their own admission in the budget statement, at a <Col N="941" /> cost of £16.75 million, removing VAT from food and giving notice to the various people involved in the food business that the food VAT provisions will be removed on 3rd September while, at the same time, allowing the price of food to gallop ahead.</P>
    <P>The Government are hamstrung by their own unwise election promises.  We have seen a situation recently in the North of Ireland which is a discredit to democracy.  In this part of Ireland we have operated democracy in a reasonable way since 1922.  The only thing which can discredit democracy here is either galloping inflation or a Government declaring an ability to deal with the problem and very rapidly being shown to have a total inability to do so.  It is important that we come clean with the public on the notion of purporting to halt food price increases by removing VAT on food in early September, allowing inflation to proceed in regard to food prices to the extent I have mentioned, depriving the Exchequer of £16.75 million in a full year, £8.35 million for the remainder of this year, and all to no effect.</P>
    <P>If we could be guaranteed that the removal of 5.26 per cent VAT on food would automatically deliver, as the Minister for Finance has stated, a 5 per cent reduction in foodstuffs, this would be all right, but this is something the Government cannot deliver. On the performance to date, inflation in regard to foodstuffs is proceeding, due notice having been given to everybody in the trade that action will be taken within the food trade between now and early September, despite any price control measures which are being threatened by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The whole exercise will have been proved nugatory at a cost of over £16 million to the Exchequer in a full year.  Foodstuffs will not be reduced by the 5 per cent claimed.</P>
    <P>It will, in effect, have cost the Exchequer £16.75 million&mdash;all in the interests of a very stupid election promise.  I do not deny that they might have been elected without making such promises, but those promises were made by the groups that formed themselves into the National Coalition.  As a result of those promises, one of which <Col N="942" /> is the one I am mentioning, certain votes were gained to achieve power. This, in my view, is a corrupting influence in democracy.</P>
    <P>The budget and the Finance Bill, which we are now debating, are the culmination of a thought process introduced last February and now coming to fruition and which, as I will elaborate on later, will result in very real Nemesis, depending on the Budget introduced by the present Government next spring.  The fundamental error in the thinking behind the new VAT provisions is that automatically reducing to zero the VAT on food, in order to reduce the price of foodstuffs by 5 per cent, has been shown palpably, by reason of the rise in the consumer price index on food, to have already failed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has allowed increases above what he fixed within a month of fixing them, as has been shown in regard to CIE fares and rates.  The Government know they cannot observe the National Prices Commission recommendations but must give increases in fares and rates even above what is recommended by that Commission.  All of this adds up to a total admission that price control cannot do this.  The whole exercise amounts to an enormous mirage, an enormous bluff, on the part of the two parties forming the National Coalition to persuade the Irish people that they in some way had a panacea for this problem.</P>
    <P>As if the loss of £16.75 million to the Exchequer in one year is not bad enough the Government then proceed, in the Budget and in the Finance Bill before us, to transfer this loss of £16.75 million to other commodities in the mistaken notion that those commodities do not represent any factor in the cost of living.  We are no longer living in a primitive society that depends entirely on foodstuffs.  All this was debated&mdash; and the Taoiseach is well aware of it &mdash;in the Oireachtas in the 1940s and the 1950s in a debate concerning food subsidies.  We thought that debate was finally settled in 1957 when food subsidies were dispensed with.  Now we have this debate brought back here again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" /> The notion that we are a primitive economy and that food is the only item in the expenditure of people is a crude, political, primitive notion that can be got over in a facile way by political propagandists but it does not represent reality.  The reality is that equally as important as food, and indeed a very high factor in food prices as well, are items such as petrol, fuel, electricity, the factors associated with transportation, the factors associated with the various services involved in producing food, the factors involved in producing the packaging and advertising of food, the factors involved in erecting and constructing the premises necessary for presenting food.  It is a facile assumption to think that food alone, of itself, is a factor in the ordinary person's cost of living.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the categories which include clothing, footwear, fuel, electricity, petrol, tobacco, liquor&mdash;the rate for which has been increased from 5.26 per cent to 6.75 per cent, an increase of 1½ per cent&mdash; are now basic factors in the ordinary person's cost of living.  There is no point in living in cloud-cuckoo land. There is no point in telling people, when they come along seeking the next increase in the national wage agreement, even if food can be reduced&mdash;although I have already demonstrated that cannot be done and it is not being reduced&mdash;that VAT on food has been reduced by 5 per cent when by deliberate Government action the price of other commodities equally used and enjoyed, commodities which are a factor in everybody's way of life, have gone up by 1½ per cent. It is a reality now that the price of bus fares, train fares, petrol, clothing, footwear, drink and so on are essential factors in people's way of life today. There is no point in putting those various categories into compartments and pretending that one is important in the cost of living and the other is not.</P>
    <P>On the higher rate of VAT, which has been increased substantially&mdash;by more than 3 per cent, from 16.37 per cent to 19.5 per cent&mdash;we have the whole area of furniture, furnishings, <Col N="944" /> hardware, electrical goods.  This is an area that is basic to the establishment of any home, and the people who are establishing homes are surely the people who should be basic to our thoughts on the expansion of the community and on the proper social development we all envisage.  Those categories of goods have been increased, by a deliberate provision in this Finance Bill, from 16.37 per cent to 19.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Again, on the higher rate, a jump of over 6 per cent&mdash;from 30.26 per cent to 36.75 per cent&mdash;has taken place in the price of motor cars, television sets and radios.  These are commodities which due to the improved standard of living of our people, are becoming a factor in many people's way of life.  The thinking behind this is the crudest and the most primitive possible.  It is thinking that goes back to the 1950s.  Twenty years ago we went through this kind of debate on the food subsidies at that time.  Today we are still immersed in the same backward thinking that seeks to say that foodstuffs, and foodstuffs alone, are a factor in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Many of our people due to proper economic expansion and social development over the years&mdash;initiated and worked on by various Governments&mdash; have become more prosperous and more conscious of a wide range of consumer items which they can afford to acquire.  They are not included in food but are included in a wide range of activities, both goods and services, outside food.  A fact of life today is that as the standard of living improves, which is the basic object of all governmental activity and economic encouragement, this area of consumption in non-food items widens regularly year by year.  It is something all of us here have seen developing over the last 20 years.</P>
    <P>There is no point in coming in here and telling us that if the price of food can be reduced by 5 per cent all will be well as far as the cost of living is concerned while at the same time ignoring the basic prices in regard to services, to clothing, to footwear, to petrol and to any one of the numerous items I have mentioned which have been increased by positive Government action and decision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> The previous rates which were introduced after very careful consideration and which have now been departed from will be a direct incentive to inflation. The original rates were devised by the previous Minister for Finance, and by the Department of Finance, considered by the Government and adopted on one very clear basis that there was little or no departure from the rates proposed under VAT and the rates which existed under the previous tax situation.</P>
    <P>That is a fundamental matter.  It was carefully worked out and the various rates devised.  The 5.26 per cent rate, the 6.75 per cent rate, the 16.37 per cent rate and the 30.26 per cent rate were the exact rates that already existed under the existing tax situation. There was little or no departure from that and, therefore, no inflationary element built in.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that even though every effort was made to avoid an inflationary experience under decimalisation it did arise.  That was the practical experience of all of us when decimalisation was introduced.  Now, we are departing from the tax rates that existed prior to the introduction of VAT, those rates which were carefully worked out by the Department of Finance in conjunction with the trade and itemised down so that there would be little or no change, and we are increasing the tax rates apart from zero rate in the next category by 1½ per cent, in the following category by 3 per cent and in the final category by 6½ per cent.</P>
    <P>There straight away is an in-built inflationary trend because you are going to have X percentage of that over and above increase going into the pockets of people along the commercial highway.  It is as plain as night follows day that unless the increases under VAT were tied to the previous indirect tax situation that existed, unless that was done meticulously, the way was being opened to the flood gates of price increases that can be done at various levels of commercial activity.</P>
    <P>It is happening already and will happen to a greater degree and all in <Col N="946" /> the interests of pursuing an election promise which could never have been achieved, an election promise designed to ensure the elimination of a Government&mdash;I have nothing against that, it is part of a democratic process&mdash;and which was so ill-thought out and ill-conceived that it will result not in a reduction in food prices but in a substantial increase in food prices which we are already witnessing, it will result in the transfer of £16,750,000 from the VAT on food to these other items I have mentioned without any benefit in regard to food prices. The £16.75 million saved in regard to the removal of VAT on food will not reflect itself at all in a 5 per cent reduction of food prices.  We already see evidence of that trend.</P>
    <P>All that will happen is that food prices will go up.  There will be no reduction of 5 per cent or any other percentage in food prices after early September because the price control measures will be totally ineffective.  The food consumer loses, the Exchequer loses and, furthermore, the Exchequer loss in that area is being translated by the policy of the new Government into the area I have mentioned where there is massive in-built inflation by reason of the increased rates over and above the rates carefully constructed by the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance under the original VAT scheme.</P>
    <P>If that was not enough to add further to the inflation, we have this pretended effort to remove VAT from the inelastic area&mdash;food&mdash;and transfer it to the elastic area, where there is going to be a massive increase in consumption by reason of the improved standard of living.  People cannot consume any more than an X amount of food but they can buy any number of these other items&mdash;the elastic items. They will not eat more by reason of the next pay agreement.  They are going to buy more and more of the items whose prices have been substantially increased in the various categories I have mentioned over the zero category because the appetite is limitless in regard to consumption under the non-food categories.</P>
    <P>This is a situation where a highly-elastic <Col N="947" /> area has been opened up, where more money is going to be pumped in, where people are going to buy more of these goods and services at greater cost and are going to demand more money in the way of salary and reward to pay for the increased amounts.  It is a classical case not just of inflation induced by itself or by natural processes or induced by international trade or the vagaries of international commerce but inflation deliberately encouraged and fostered by Government policy.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that a uniform tax such as VAT has the lowest possible effect on the cost of living it must be spread across the board at the lowest possible rate.  This will result in the minimum amount of dislocation as far as the consumer is concerned.  The situation now is that that basic principle has been departed from and instead we have a situation within the VAT structure in which the cost of living will be increased in very definite areas adding considerably to the inflationary spiral.</P>
    <P>Our economy will not improve in the year ahead unless inflation is tackled vigorously.  The Government show no sign of tackling it seriously. Along with the total failure which I submit is involved in regard to this particular tax measure, we have a situation in which in a number of other areas the Government are not facing up to responsibility.</P>
    <P>I will mention another very practical matter which again, concerns the Exchequer and which is again adding to the inflationary spiral.  I refer to the removal of the health charges from the rates.  Here at a cost of £12.7 million, just like waving a wand again, health charges are removed from the rates to the Exchequer.  That is excellent for one year and over a four-year period health charges are to be removed altogether from the rates.  It will not be £12.7 million but £20 million next year or something more.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer is being circumscribed and hemmed in because of a specific Government commitment.  Because of the anchor to specific election promises nothing can be done to help <Col N="948" /> the people who are really affected by inflation.  I am referring to the earned income allowance and the personal allowance situation in regard to income tax payers.</P>
    <P>The question of income tax is not a matter for what used to be referred to as the middle class.  Income tax now affects every worker.  Our society depends fundamentally as any society does, on the people who work and invest in the community.  This Finance Bill is a disincentive to any firm who wants to work or invest.  The one area of encouragement in that direction has been totally ignored.  In the interests of pursuing election mirages, in the field of transferring health charges from rates to the Central Fund, in the jiggering around with the value-added tax we find the Government circumscribed to the extent that they can do nothing for the taxpayers.  There is no point in telling me that the increase from £74 to £104, under section 2 in the earned income allowance of a wife's earnings is anything marvellous.  That figure was set out in section 141 of the Act of 1967.  After six years of a fall in the value of money the earned income allowance concerned with a wife's earnings has been raised from £74 to £104.  There is no use talking about that.  That is merely rectifying, and not even rectifying, a situation that has arisen by reason of the erosion in the value of money.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the dependent relative allowance under section 4 of the Bill which was raised from £295 to £347.  These are mere matters of rectification in regard to allowances by reason of the fall in the value of money.  What has been done in any real sense in regard to the earned income allowances?  They should be increased.  Personal allowances should be increased for the people who are making this economy of ours work.  They are the people who are asking the questions at the present time: the people in jobs, the people who invest, people who are carrying our country.  They are asking very serious questions about the budget and the Finance Bill which was geared, first of all, to the promises made in the general election and, secondly, tailored <Col N="949" /> for a Presidential election which was to come two weeks afterwards following the budget.  It worked the first time but it did not work the second time.</P>
    <P>Similarly, you see the lack of thinking in regard to the people who work, invest and contribute to the community in section 3 on what has been called the plough-back provision in regard to children's allowances over the level of £2,500 a year.  If there is a new pay agreement, there will be many people in this category.  We will have a situation in which people over that level with big families who are doing things in our community, buying houses with furnishings up by 6½ per cent, paying as they will be&mdash;unless the Government step in again with something or other&mdash;increased mortgage rates.</P>
    <P>As far as children's allowances are concerned, I appreciate that it is £2,500 net and that there are allowances in income tax to bring it down to that figure, but, at the same time, there is a massive injustice in this situation.  On one side of the barrier a person with a small family is included.  On the other side of the barrier a person with a large family is excluded.  Surely some brains might have been devoted to the question of grading children's allowances in some way on a scaled basis in regard to the members of one's family.  That would have been a very logical way to approach it if the Government were concerned about saving £1 million in this income tax provision.  Some thought could have been given to providing for a figure way ahead of £2,500 related to the numbers of the particular individual's family.  No thought was given to that.  Again, we have the people who have secured nothing in the way of a personal allowance and nothing in the way of an earned income allowance.  People in these categories go well below £2,500 a year.</P>
    <P>People in the £2,500 and upwards bracket who have got nothing under either of these two headings are being further penalised under tax provisions that heretofore existed whereby they could get the full benefit of their children's allowance.  The ridiculous situation now is that the man with a large family who is over that particular level is in the situation where his wife <Col N="950" /> collects the children's allowances and he gets no tax remission for them and is, in effect, paying income tax equivalent to what his wife receives by way of children's allowances.</P>
    <P>The budget shows a total lack of imagination in regard to the whole question of family incomes.  I appreciate that there are substantial increases in children's allowances and increases in the various social welfare allowances. The two parties who fought vigorously to secure our entry into the EEC made it quite plain in May, 1972, that the moneys we would save, in the region of £30 million in agricultural subsidies by reason of our pending membership of the EEC, would be devoted to the less well-off categories of our community, particularly people in receipt of social welfare and other allowances. The allowances in the budget are by and large the sort of allowances that would have been brought in by any Government.</P>
    <P>There was a total commitment by the two parties who fought for our entry into Europe to the less well-off sections of our community, that this compensation would be made available to them.  There is no point in using honeyed phrases of social development and the achievement of social justice. This is a practical matter of legitimate increases to which these people were entitled by reason of specific guarantees given to them by the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fine Gael Party in fighting to secure the support of the people for the referendum in May, 1972.  That particular aspect was regarded as a hallucination on our part by the Labour Party.  However, a 14-point programme can bring strange bedfellows together.</P>
    <P>Even though I agree that the increases in the children's allowances may appear to be big, I would say they should be even bigger and that the area of social welfare to which the Government should now apply their brains is the whole question of family income. If, as is apparent, the Government cannot do anything about the rising cost of foodstuffs, instead of setting up a whole apparatus of inspectors in the Department of Industry and Commerce &mdash;and we have to get this costed out sometime&mdash;to control prices, which <Col N="951" /> they cannot control, they should apply their brains to finding a way to rectify it.  The way to rectify this is quite evidently by increasing substantially family incomes.  Who is the person worst affected by the increasing rise in foodstuffs?  It is the woman with a large family.  By increasing family income and children's allowances it would enable them to pay for these increased foodstuffs.  They should be substantially increased.</P>
    <P>I may be talking to wooden ears in this respect, but it is far better to compensate for the increase in the cost of living in that manner and be open and straightforward about it than to pursue some vague objective of price control and hire a whole lot of administrative mercenaries to seek to administer it for you and try to battle against a tide which is inevitable.  The public will find out very quickly&mdash;and there is certain evidence that they have already found out&mdash;that any Government who make promises they are unable to keep are pursuing a very idle, fruitless and hopeless objective.  It is the old Lincoln adage of fooling some of the people some of the time.  It can happen some of the time but it cannot happen all the time.</P>
    <P>It would have been a far more honest exercise for the Government to face up to price increases and to say: &ldquo;Right, we will compensate the people who are hit most by the price increases in regard to food,&rdquo; and to decide on substantially increased social welfare allowances.  I mention only the area of family allowances where obviously the impact is greater, particularly with large families.  All social welfare recipients are affected, for example, the old age pensioners, the handicapped, <i>et cetera.</i>  An assessment of substantially increased social welfare allowances, well ahead of what was included in this budget and Finance Bill, would be a far better approach to the problem than the futile transferring of value-added tax, the establishment of price control machinery, installation of inspectors and the whole panoply of bluff in regard to the ordinary people of this country.  I feel strongly that there has been a grave omission in <Col N="952" /> this area by the present Government. The chickens will come home to roost very quickly in that direction.</P>
    <P>The other area on which I should like to comment is this.  The farming community have been misguided by election promises included in the 14-point programme.  I do not see any reason why Opposition parties seeking power should not make guarantees to any group in the community provided they are reasonably achievable.  But there is no point telling farmers that death duties can be eliminated at the drop of a hat.  That is the type of commitment involved in the nomenclature, which I will read, of the 14-point plan.  In this particular area the commitment was so fantastically specific as to defy description.  However, there is no harm in quoting it again from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 8th February, 1973:</P>
    <P>With a view to relieving the heavy and unjust burden on ordinary house purchasers and farmers, the National Coalition Government will abolish estate duties on property passing on death to widows and their children and replace them with taxation confined to the really wealthy and to property passing on death outside the immediate family.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of language used: &ldquo;will abolish estate duties&rdquo;.  As a Government, they now realise the realities involved.  They bring up something which would have been done by any Government in power.  They have raised the minimum limit from £7,500 to £10,000.  But that does not even keep pace with the minimum inflation in land values since the former limit.  That is something any Minister for Finance in any year would have done automatically. Even a Minister for Finance from a Communist party, who never referred to the matter in his life, would bring in a Finance Bill to raise the limit from £7,500 to £10,000.  That was just elementary recognition of land values increasing to that sum.  This is what we have instead of a specific commitment to abolish death duties. The same thing applies to legacy, succession and estate duties&mdash;the three forms of death duty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> Here again disillusionment has set in.  It comes back to the point I made earlier about the disillusionment of the ordinary people who are concerned about inflation and price rises.  In this case you have the disillusionment of a very important section of the community, a section who carry the main burden in the export field.  I do not want to elaborate on what the President of the National Farmers' Association has said about the integrity and word of the Minister for Finance.  He speaks for himself.  I should like merely to endorse what he has said, and his opinion is in accord not just with our experience but with that of the general public of the Government since announcing this 14-point plan.  It is impossible to trust people who rush into print.  I sympathise with the Taoiseach in this respect because he himself is a careful and cautious man.  I sympathise with him in regard to some of the people with whom he has to deal.  He had to deal with them last December.  He still has them on his hands.  They are giddygoat people who, verbally and in writing, tend to over-stress matters.</P>
    <P>I do not think this 14-point plan was necessary.  The change of Government resulted from an ordinary natural move of the people.  Fianna Fáil had been there for 16 years and it was time for a change.  There was no need to corrupt the people.  The people are incorruptible, thanks be to God.  There was no need to try to corrupt the people by announcing a 14-point plan and specifying promises which have only got the Government into trouble. If the Government were straight with the people and went to them as a coalition and said: &ldquo;We want to get these fellows out.&rdquo;  I am certain the people might have obliged them.  I am being totally honest.  Why should they hang these 14 points around their neck and put themselves into a situation in which they have shown themselves incapable of dealing with prices, inflation, handling Exchequer finances&mdash;all because they have circumscribed themselves, in the Exchequer sense, by commitments into which they need not have entered and which are now crucifying them.  This is leading them on as a Government to a situation where <Col N="954" /> they will be in an appalling mess by the next budget, because the £40 million deficit is an unprecedented gamble by the present Government.</P>
    <P>The previous Government introduced for the first time a substantial deficit in last year's budget.  That deficit was introduced deliberately and explained in the Dáil by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley.  Last April and May 12 months it was explained by him in the Dáil to be a deficit in anticipation of our entry into the European Economic Community and in being in a position to make use of the funds which would accrue&mdash;and they have accrued to the Government since then.  That was a legitimate deficit for a specific purpose.  This deficit of £40 million in the present year is one which amounts to a leap into the dark and a gamble with the future of the economy of this country.  This is a deficit which will lead to enormous trouble when the pay agreement has been negotiated&mdash;and I firmly hope it will be negotiated&mdash;and also because of the Coalition Government's 14-point plan.  It does not deserve the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo;, but that is what it is called.</P>
    <P>As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we have given constructive opposition in this Seanad since it was established.  We will continue to do that; but we must point out the areas of fundamental importance to the economy of our country and warn that we are heading for very serious trouble if the problems of these areas are not tackled.  I will not use any more emotive language than that. I do not like using disaster language. But we are heading for very serious trouble if the prices and inflation issues are not tackled.</P>
    <P>Inflation&mdash;the basic issue&mdash;can be tackled by a Government which faces the problem.  I have pointed out one area in which it can be tackled, that is, by providing substantial allowances to the working and investing people under the income tax code.  Unless it is tackled in a positive way like this we are heading for serious trouble.  It can be tackled in an elementary way in regard to estate duty by the simple expedient of raising the artificial value of land.  I <Col N="955" /> give that as a hint to the Department of Finance.  This would be a much better way of doing it than talking about messing around with the estate duty system.  This cannot be done because of specific arrangements we have with the British Government, as the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance well know.</P>
    <P>The important area to tackle is inflation and we cannot get down to tackling that until something is done about our income tax code.  It is in that area fundamentally that we wish to encourage the workers and the investors in our community.  Unless we do something better than the negative, niggardly thinking incorporated in this Bill and unless the energies of the Government are devoted to a very substantial remission and improvement in the income tax code by way of earned income allowance and personal allowances so as to ensure that the workers and the investors in the community are given a far freer rein than they have now, then the country will be in serious trouble.  Fundamentally we are all dependent on the people who work and create wealth and these are the people who must be encouraged and these are the people who are crucified in this Budget, crucified at the altar of political expediency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share much of the pessimism of the previous speaker, but inflation is a real problem for any Government.  The arrangements made in the Finance Bill, as I hope to show, go some measure towards tackling this.  The economic policy of the present Government may be taken from one sentence from the Taoiseach's address, in which he stated:</P>
      <P>Every encouragement must therefore be given to the exploitation of new ideas and improved methods which will help to secure and indeed widen employment opportunity here for all our people.</P>
      <P>The accent is being placed quite rightly on new ideas and improved methods with the ultimate aim of more secure and wider employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the right aim and for many years we have been led on much too <Col N="956" /> much by the ideal of gross national product.  Has anyone ever died for such a concept as a gross national product?  People can understand and appreciate that the job of a modern State is to provide reasonably secure employment for its citizens.  That is a task we are committed to and in the present circumstances, with the approach being used and with the opportunities provided by the Common Market, we should achieve this aim.</P>
    <P>I welcome in section 21 the tax reliefs granted to contributions given to universities for the purpose of furthering research in approved subjects.  This is following the aim I have quoted to get new ideas and improved methods. I am somewhat disturbed by the narrow range of those mentioned, such as industrial relations and marketing. We know both of those are highly important and also there is an escape clause which states:</P>
    <P>Any other subject which is approved for the purpose of this section by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The lesson we can learn from the past is that investment in research is largely unpredictable.  One never knows the area of investment that will give the greatest dividend; and although it is obvious that the two areas mentioned should produce results, any other area of research, provided there is a research leader in charge who has imagination and ability, is worth comparable treatment and is likely to prove of great value to the community.</P>
    <P>I will instance one area.  We are all concerned to see computerisation and investment at all levels, whether in educational institutions, research institutions or in industry, into computers. The cost at present must be approximately £20 million to £30 million.  It is growing so fast it will probably pass the £100 million within three to four years.  It is a type of industry where at present we are paying out for the machinery, and both the hardware and the software have to come largely from outside, from IBM centres, <i>et cetera.</i>  Our only hope of getting a national counter-production to this is to be able to develop either hardware or software in the computer field within <Col N="957" /> the country.  Hardware is out&mdash;that is the job of the giants, the job of those building new computers, <i>et cetera.</i>  We have many computers and we have some firms who are doing interesting work in them but the amount they can take is very small.</P>
    <P>The software part of this industry, which is the provision of codes and programmes that tell the computer what to do to achieve a certain objective, is largely a brain power job. We can do it just as well as any group anywhere else.  Like the Swiss with their watch and other precision industries, this is the type of industry which depends on the ability of the individual, and it is this we should try to cultivate.  Research money diverted into this will produce comparable gains to industrial relations and marketing. There is enormous potential there.  I appeal to the Government to interpret this very literally and look at the man, not at the project.  If you are satisfied that the man who will head the project has the ability to do that job, that he has some brain power and some creativity, that is the essential.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of restricting this to the universities.  I might appear to be talking against my own group in saying that but, frankly, I do not see any reason for this restriction. I do not see any reason why money given to the Agricultural Institute, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the Social and Economic Research Institute or to any other institute for specific work along those lines, especially for work in marketing problems, industrial relations and so on, would not pay equal dividends.  I commend what has been done.  It is, I believe, only a first instalment and I hope the next Finance Bill will widen the scope of this.</P>
    <P>We have had incentives offered to writers and other artists in the past. Now we have incentives offered to inventors.  I think that is well worth while but I think we could move along a little further in this field.  There is a project that appeals to me and which was mooted by the late Reverend Father Coyne, who was a very distinguished President of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society.  He had a <Col N="958" /> vision of developing in Ireland, particularly in regions such as the South coast, colonies for retired people which would include the building and creation of services for them.  He envisaged giving certain tax concessions to them to encourage them to settle in those areas.  Perhaps the developers could interest themselves in that type of project.</P>
    <P>I am not very enamoured by developers nor am I enamoured by the provision of office blocks&mdash;perhaps they are a necessary evil in our society&mdash; but the development of colonies or settlements where essential services would be provided to make retirement more enjoyable for people to settle in those places, that type of development, which would be aimed at attracting people from America, England and elsewhere, would be a real, integrated one and would be well worth while.</P>
    <P>The same type of development is worth exploring in the educational field where we could provide residential schools.  People in England and America are looking for places such as those.  It is a type of permanent tourism on which we could well set our sights. We have the manpower and teaching personnel to undertake such a development. We have also got the philosophy and the approach that would make those people want to send their children to our educational institutions. Far from closing residential schools, which unfortunately happened in some places in the last few years, we should be seeking to get students from abroad to fill them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to come back to the land again now.  I do not see anything wrong with the tax we have placed on the old reliables. It is something we have learned to expect and, in any event, it is only just to ensure that the tax percentage on those items will remain the same as it was a few years ago, taking inflation into account.  It would probably make things easier for those paying tax on drink, tobacco and so on if the Minister for Finance showed that <Col N="959" /> the tax collected on those items was used to confer some special benefit on, say, the old age pensioners or some other needy group.  If that was done the pint drinker would know that the increase of 2p on his pint was going to somebody in the social welfare classes.  It is the type of balancing the Minister for Finance could well use.</P>
      <P>I want to touch, very briefly, on the death duties question.  I do not join in the criticisms of Senator Lenihan and the farming organisations on this question because it is something that will take time to work out.  Probably the frustration of the farming organisation, expressed by their leader, Mr. Maher, is due to a lack of understanding of the complexity of the problem.  I do not think there is any doubt about the Government's willingness and ability to fulfil that promise within the next year when the promised review of taxation is being carried out.  On the other hand, I sympathise with the farming organisation when they see some of their members becoming victims of this tax.  In honouring the promise the Government have given, I think the adjustment, when it comes in 12 months' time, could well be retrospective to the date on which the Government took office or some date reasonably close to that.</P>
      <P>If a Fianna Fáil Government were still in power they would have to make like adjustments because the whole kernel of the death duties situation, so far as land is concerned, is that the greatly inflated values of land due to our accession to the Common Market &mdash;land has doubled in price over the last one and a half years&mdash;has meant that totally unsustainable and unrealistic figures are charged at present on land.  They are figures that would make it impossible for a unit to continue functioning economically.  Any of us do not wish to see such a situation continuing because our primary objective should be to ensure that all our land is raised to its fullest possible level of production.  Only in doing that can we ensure the full development of the country.  It would be wrong and shortsighted to have a tax system that militated against farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> The Government have in the present Finance Bill taken many measures that will bring considerable relief in the field of death duties.  The reliefs for widows, which we are familiar with and for which we have been fighting over the last 12 years, have been doubled in the present Bill.  That is a very valuable concession.  It means that in the case of a widow with four children the total estate would have to be almost £50,000 before any death duties are claimed.</P>
    <P>For people outside agriculture such a concession goes a long way to meeting most of their worries.  The only question I would raise is that in this age of equality, where we have been debating about women's rights, what about the rights of men?  Because the present concession&mdash;and this has been a defect over the past six to eight years&mdash;makes no provision whatsoever for the widower who is left with a family.  We know the modern approach &mdash;and one to be commended&mdash;where husband and wife are joint partners in their estate.  If the husband dies the reliefs here can be claimed; but if the wife dies&mdash;and I say this subject to correction&mdash;as the Act stands at present there is absolutely no relief for the husband or the dependent children. That should be put right as soon as possible.  It is obviously wrong and against the whole thinking of our times.</P>
    <P>The Government made an effort in this to try to bring some relief to the owners of small and medium farms that would be involved in the death duties by increasing from £2,000 to £3,000 the notional valuation that would be acceptable.  Valuation is taken as 40 times the poor law valuation. Taking reasonable land at £1 valuation per acre it will mean that a farm of 70 acres would be valued at £2,800 and would qualify to be classed on a notional basis.  If that were valued at market value it probably would be valued at £20,000, with of course the consequent unreal boost to the estate.  That is where the estate is being passed on to a member of the family.</P>
    <P>While that helps a little it does not cater for the farms of 70 acres or <Col N="961" /> more.  These are still completely open to the unreal values that the market forces on them today.  Consequently, I would ask the Taoiseach to tell us, when replying, if it is at all possible to give some promise that the new scheme to be introduced will be made retrospective in the case of land and so that those dying this year will not be placed at a disadvantage compared to those dying next year.</P>
    <P>Now I should like to touch on the thorny question of income tax on farmers.  The main consideration here is the tremendous need for capital in Irish agriculture if it is to reach its potential.  The average farm in Ireland today is capable of carrying twice or three times as much stock than at present and we would hope over the next eight or ten years to achieve that doubling of the cattle population.  We have made a good start already.  It is very heartening to see that last year the increase in stock retained was 11 per cent.  If we keep that up we will double our stock numbers in seven to eight years.  However, the bill last year for doing that was £15 million; that was the estimate of the value of retained stock.  That is only a first instalment because more housing, more silage facilities, more planned layout on the farm is all needed.  We are moving into high cost industry because agriculture, from being the low cost industry of the past, is now one of the highest cost industries we have.  It probably costs anything from £40,000 to £50,000 to place a worker in employment in agriculture.  Yet it is worthwhile and valuable.</P>
    <P>The whole force of the tax code and everything else we have should be aimed at getting as quick a development in agriculture as we can.  That means encouraging by every means possible the farmers to plough back as much as they can into their farms so as to bring them up as soon as possible.  It is obviously much more desirable that the farmers should stint themselves in their spending and plough back that addition rather than spend more and merely be paying the interest to loan companies based on the stock involved.  A recent survey spoke of £500 million as the cost of <Col N="962" /> this development.  We just cannot borrow unless we want to put ourselves and the country into pawn to the bankers of Europe and elsewhere. The main bulk of it will have to come from the savings of the farmers themselves. Therefore a tax code will and can in the next five to ten years be of great assistance in gently forcing our people to plough back money into the development of their land. In ten years time, when it is capitalised and producing more, there will not be so much need for continuing the very high rate of plough back. There will be more contribution to general taxation.  In designing a tax code that can be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>I have no sympathy whatsoever with the man with large acreage who is just working that at one-third efficiency and making good money which he spends.  By all means tax him and take whatever is right and proper from him.  But in the case of the man who is prepared to plough back money, then, just as we do in industry, we should allow that against any tax we put on the farmer.</P>
    <P>It is just applying the system that has proved useful in getting industries developed.  In this Bill we have the continuation for a further two years of this accelerated programme for investment in industry, where up to 100 per cent of the capital investment can be written off in the one year.  Those methods can be transferred over to farming, because by and large today farming is an industry just the same as any other industry, and unfortunately it is a very capital intensive industry. On the other hand, the opportunities and the openings provided for the young men on the land are, I believe, superior to those provided in industry. I know the Government will keep in mind that what is needed is expansion. We do not want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.  We want to hatch out the eggs before we kill the goose.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to the question of VAT on food.  I could not follow Senator Lenihan's logic on that point.  If on 3rd September there is a 5 per cent increase in food prices that has not to be paid, obviously the price has to be reduced by that amount. <Col N="963" /> Whatever increases are going on at present and have gone on over the last couple of months are inevitable whether or not VAT is there.  They are part of having to absorb the general wage round increases that we have had.  This is part of the whole process of inflation.  A 5 per cent reduction at a specific point is absolutely real and I cannot see any legitimate grounds for doubting why it should be effective.</P>
    <P>We may consider that people are spending too much money on certain luxuries.  We may also feel that they could spend more on food to preserve the health of their children.  Any action which reduces the cost of food enables the people to buy more food.  We have not reached saturation point in the consumption of food by our people. The reduction of 5 per cent should result in some increase in the consumption of food.</P>
    <P>This of course will mean with the balancing up of VAT, that there will have to be a certain curtailment in some of the other spending.  That is all to the good.  Our bill for the consumption of alcohol of £110 million a year could do with a slice.  Anything which brings the food consumption up to what is regarded as a proper level is to be encouraged and is worthwhile. There is very little we can do under EEC regulations because we have to phase out the subsidies on our dairy products.  Therefore, the only thing we can do is in this control of VAT.  Anything we can do that will reduce the price of food is a move in the right direction in the present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment briefly on estate duties as they stand at present. We have on the Schedule a highly complicated table.  For instance, an estate valued at between £40,000 and £45,000 is taxed at 24 per cent.  Once it goes over the £45,000 it gets into the bracket of 27 per cent to 30 per cent. I would ask the Government to depart from this archaic system of jump assessment of tax and let it be a continuous one.  As things stand, a person whose estate is £1 under £20,000 has to pay 12 per cent tax, which is £2,400. If he is £1 over £20,000 he has to pay at the rate of 14 per cent, which <Col N="964" /> is £2,800.  These anomalies have come up again and again.  They have been criticised in the Seanad and elsewhere and still they persist.  Why cannot these percentages be based on incremental bases?  The first £5,000 carries tax of so much, the next £5,000 carries tax of so much again, and the next £5,000 carries tax of so much again. That gives a continuous scale of taxation and gets away from those jumps, which are totally wrong.  It means that by having £2 over a certain figure you lose £400 in taxation.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to another matter.  I was doing a few sums and I was amazed to find that, if an estate goes up from £40,000 to £45,000, of the additional £5,000 the tax claims 2.4 per cent of that.  If the estate is between £45,000 and £50,000, of the additional £5,000 the tax claims 2.7 per cent of it.  It is progressive.  When we reach £50,000 to £55,000, the tax claims 3.0 per cent.  From £55,000 to £60,000 the tax claims 3.3 per cent out of the £5,000.  After £60,000, for some reason I cannot account for, the tax drops down.  The highest tax level is between estates of £50,000 and £60,000. They are taxed at a rate of £6,300 out of the £10,000.  Whereas at £150,000 for an extra £10,000 the change is only 5.3 per cent.  It seems to be one of those oddities which has crept into the table.  Knowing that the Government are committed in the next year to getting rid of all those oddities, it would be no harm to put at least this one more oddity&mdash;or shall we give it the modern name of &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo;?  &mdash;on record and hope that it will go the way of all the others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is very necessary to make a long speech on the Finance Bill.  The Finance Bill, 1973, incorporates many proposals.  The opening speech by Senator Lenihan creates a certain degree of confusion.  One gets the impression from the people on the other side of the House that if they happened to have been in Government, if they happened to have been introducing a budget, or if they happened to have been introducing a Finance Bill in either of these Houses, they would <Col N="965" /> redistribute income and create a new society in Ireland.</P>
      <P>If Senator Lenihan or his colleagues propose to redistribute and equalise income, then let them have the honesty and clarity to put that into the record of this House.  Let us be clear what we are about.  Whatever criticisms may be made of the present Government one thing that cannot be denied is that they inherited an appalling situation.  They inherited a society in which, for example, one-fifth of the children were condemned to live in conditions of distress and poverty.  Séamus Ó Cinnéide of the Institute of Public Administration, in his attempt to define a poverty line in Ireland, ended up with a figure of nearly 24 per cent of the people living in conditions of poverty; one child in five of the nation condemned to living in conditions of poverty; the majority of the widows of the country live in conditions of poverty.</P>
      <P>I consider that this budget, which Senator Lenihan has commented upon, as being above all else a social distress budget.  The provisions are an attempt to lift the worst hit sections of the population to a certain degree out of the distress into which they have fallen. We have heard talk of victims of inflation and victims of all sorts of impersonal forces.  We are dealing here with the lives of people, people who are victims of an inhuman and unjust society, victims of a government in which Senator Lenihan took part.  Let us be clear in allocating blame.  If Senator Lenihan wants to say he would have introduced a more radical measure, would have redistributed income and equalised incomes, then I will welcome receiving that information from his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The term &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; was used in the Taoiseach's speech.  It has been used a number of times since the budget was introduced and was commented upon. There are two kinds of poverty.  There is the poverty which arises from basic inequalities in society towards which you must restructure your economy to redistribute resources equally for all the citizens.  Then there is social distress.  I believe the budget went a long way towards reducing social distress.  That fact should be very simply recorded. <Col N="966" /> Eliminating inequality is a different thing.</P>
    <P>What then is Senator Lenihan talking about?  He is not committed to any radical changes in economics.  He is not committed to any radical changes of a social welfare kind.  He does not criticise the Finance Bill on these grounds.  What he is trying to tell us is that he would be more efficient at relieving distress.  With the greatest respect, I suggest that Senator Lenihan had a very long time to relieve distress. The only thing we can see as a result of it is that this society is one of the most degraded, inhuman and unjust societies in Europe at the time at which his party left office.  I hope that, when the present Government leaves office, at least the number of widows, children and those people who have benefited to some degree from this budget will not be in the same abject condition.</P>
    <P>Remember what we are discussing. It would be very easy for me in my position to avoid comment.  I believe in radical financial changes, restructuring our economy, changing our society. Am I then to criticise a measure which improves the position, for example, of children?  One child in five has been committed to living in conditions of poverty with all its related effects on education, marked down for life and with no possibilities of improvement. It was a social distress budget, and must be discussed in terms of those limited aims and in terms of its efficiency.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk concerning some minor aspects.  I would commend, for such people in this and the other Chamber who wish to indulge in that, that they get housekeeping diplomas.  There could be one awarded in Seanad and the Dáil for the people who, for example, go through the Bill and say: &ldquo;This does not include petrol of such and such a grade, and should include petrol of another grade.&rdquo;  Fine, those people's talents are very necessary, but I shudder to think of their predominating in the decision-making processes of this country.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan has made a valid point, which I wish to take up, concerning section 21 of the Bill, relating <Col N="967" /> to payments to universities.  He said that, under section 21, there is specification of the purposes for which payments can be made to universities under conditions of tax exemption. These are listed, in (2) (a), (b) and (c), as industrial relations, marketing and any other subjects which is approved for the purposes of this section by the Minister for Finance.  I think that (c) needs to be specified and broadened.  Industrial relations and marketing are specific terms, but (c) is rather vague, so one could get the impression that the sums paid would be primarily for applied rather than for fundamental research.</P>
    <P>In this regard I share the concern of Professor Quinlan.  It is my own belief that the type of research which is necessary and for which we need a great amount of assistance is fundamental rather than applied research. The relationship between industrialised and industrialising countries&mdash; indeed between industrialised nations and the Third World generally&mdash;is one of exploitation in science policy. If they tend to invest overwhelmingly in applied rather than fundamental research, they are inextricably linked to a certain type of exploitative relationship.</P>
    <P>I do not think that industrial relations and marketing are the areas which need the greatest amount of research at the present time.  I mentioned earlier the statistics of shame, of poverty&mdash;about which Senator Lenihan is so proud&mdash;that Seamus Ó Cinnéide of the Institute of Public Administration produced when he gave us a rough approximation, in his own terms, and in his own document, of the extent of poverty in our society. These, I feel, are statistics of shame. They are a reflection on all of us.  Many of us were not militant enough in putting an end to that type of poverty and distress.</P>
    <P>There is a great necessity for research on charting the extent and implications of poverty and distress in our society.  Future Finance Bills&mdash;I have said that this Finance Bill is a social distress document&mdash;should be much broader and more radical.  I hope <Col N="968" /> that, if at some time Senator Lenihan introduces a Finance Bill, it will be as radical as I would wish, that it will put an end to exploitation once and for all and to talk about the economy being reorganised.  At present, I see the Finance Bill as a measure that has gone some way towards relieving distress. This is not to be confused with reducing inequality in our society and of using the available resources in the interests of all our people.</P>
    <P>In that respect, I am very glad that the Taoiseach made the following reference in his speech, in relation to section 14:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is at present reviewing the fiscal policy in relation to mining in the light of the report of the interdepartmental committee.</P>
    <P>I hope that other speakers on all sides of the House will welcome such legislation as is necessary to use the resources of this country, particularly in relation to mining, and the fantastic resources which are on the Atlantic Shelf in the interest of all of the community.  Then we can speak with a joint voice and social commitment.</P>
    <P>It is not with any great pleasure that I have rebuked Senator Lenihan for the tone of his address.  It is less than honest to try to suggest that you could have a sensitive deficit budget one year and you could have a bankrupt deficit budget another year.  Indeed, when you examine the figures in the so-called sensitive deficit budget of last year, and with more rigorous accounting procedures than are used generally in the public Press, it is extremely doubtful whether it was a deficit budget at all.  The present budget has gone some way towards relieving the tremendous degradation into which our society has fallen.  It is of course no excuse for the creation of the political will to seek out the root causes of poverty.  That will not take place until we have made a firm commitment to reducing the existing inequality in our society, the monopoly of ownership of resources and ensuring that when future resources have developed that they will be brought into use in the interests of all of the community.</P>

      <P>Tribute should be paid to the Minister for Finance and the Government for the very far-reaching social welfare benefits which this Finance Bill provides.  Not only are there substantial increases in existing benefits, but there are some radical changes in our social welfare structure yielding still further benefits.  I refer to the granting, as a first step towards the 65 age target of old age pensions at 69, the abolition of the means test as it applies to the non-contributory old age pensioners, which provides for an income of £4 per week or £208 per year in addition to the full old-age pension; and the extension of children's allowances from 16 to 18 in certain cases. These are three very necessary and desirable social welfare benefits.  In relation to children between 16 and 18, it must be accepted that at this age they are most costly on parents' incomes.</P>
      <P>With regard to health services and the removal of health charges from local to central funds, I was amazed to hear Senator Lenihan plead that this was an adverse decision.  In any country a national service such as health should be directly financed from central funds, as is education. As a member of a local authority I found that our position was becoming intolerable and that we were being submerged by the growing impact year after year of the health services on the local authority rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This had the negative result of forcing us to accept that there was a limit to the amount the taxpayers could meet at local authority level. The health estimate was a mandatory one which had to be met even if it resulted in a reduction in spending on the other essentials of local authority development such as housing, water, sewerage and public amenities. This decision on the part of the Government to remove over four years the ever-growing charges of the health services from local authorities is a very desirable and welcome development and it will give local authorities and their elected representatives the opportunity of concentrating their taxation on the issues which really matter to local ratepayers.  We have <Col N="970" /> reached the point where many ratepayers on fixed incomes or small incomes find it beyond their capacity to meet their commitments and, were it not for this relief, there would be a serious arrears situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan criticised the Government for removing VAT from food. We should advise Senator Lenihan that when turnover tax was first imposed on food it was opposed by both the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  In our opinion, it should never have been imposed, having regard to our levels of incomes and our standard of living. The previous speaker referred rightly to an independent serious statistical investigation made into the living standards of a wide cross-section of our society less than two years ago.  It revealed the alarming situation that 24 per cent, approximately, of our people were living below the poverty line.  This announcement was not only a serious indictment of the Government but of all who had condoned and accepted that situation.  We look on this Finance Bill as a first major step towards removing that gross injustice on such a very high proportion of our society.  It does not at this stage go as far as would be desirable but the pumping in of £38 million, in one stroke, is of unprecedented significance and will make a valuable contribution towards giving a reasonable livelihood to a vast number of our social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>It is fitting that in any discussion on finance and taxation reference should be made to our income tax code.  From the working class and trade union centres it must be clearly stated that real disquiet and grave disappointment exist at the manner in which the personal allowances and the earned income allowances have remained stagnant for so many years, considering the rate of inflation.  It is one of the bugbears of the wage and salary earners to see that the wage or salary adjustments from which so much was expected at the negotiating table resulted in so little due to the impact of income tax.  With the promises, the dedication and the honesty demonstrated by the Government to the less privileged and less well-off, I <Col N="971" /> hope that when the opportunity arises at an early date, we will get an equitable taxation system which will bring into the taxation net all who have incomes and all those who are capable of making contribution and that we will get a well-deserved relief in earned income and personal allowances.</P>
    <P>It was amusing to hear Senator Lenihan advancing this suggestion. Surely he must recall that for 16 uninterrupted years in the Government he met representatives of the trade unions and of the Congress seeking to have the income tax code, as it is at present constituted, drastically changed to provide for increases in both personal allowances and other allowances.  Those representations must have fallen on deaf ears because there was no beneficial result.  Senator Lenihan in Opposition is a welcome convert to the cause for a complete review of the personal allowances and the income tax allowances as they reflect on the wage and salary earners.  We must applaud this finance Bill as a first major step towards a proper social welfare structure and, we hope, towards an equitable taxation system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The present inflationary spiral is causing grave anxiety to all.  We are all anxious to know where this spiral will end.  It has gone up alarmingly in recent months.  The nation places on the Government the obligation of arranging the affairs of State and also of budgeting for the nation's housekeeping. If the cost of living goes beyond the capacity of large segments of the people to meet, then the Government are failing in their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particular attention must always be paid to alleviating hardships to social welfare beneficiaries.  Any moneys obtained by those people are well-deserved, irrespective of what Government are in power.  We must always be scrupulously fair in helping the poor, the aged, the sick and the widows.  It is accepted by many economists that this Finance Bill is inflationary.  Many hold the view that <Col N="972" /> this is a rich man's budget.  If this is true, there is a grave failure on the part of the Government.  If the desired balance between giving increased incentives to the deprived and struggling sections of the community and, at the same time, sustaining and increasing economic growth, is not clearly to be seen in the budgeting by the Government, this lack of balance cannot directly or even indirectly be blamed on world economic depression, world-wide inflation, decreases in production, and so on, but on those entrusted with the governing of the country.</P>
    <P>The present Coalition Government came into office to inherit a buoyant economy.  We even heard the Minister for Finance and others in his party, and, indeed, members of the Labour Party, telling us in pre-election days how they would dispense the bonanza accrued by the diligence of the Fianna Fáil Party over many years.  A very rosy economic picture was painted by those two parties if they came into power but I suggest that when the Minister set about trying to insert into this Bill ways and means of fulfilling the many over-exuberant promises they made he ran into difficulties.</P>
    <P>We should look at those promises and see how many of them cannot be fulfilled.  The Minister went on record as saying that the promises that Fine Gael and Labour were to implement could be put through if a Coalition Government were elected.  Eventually, when he was introducing the budget and Finance Bill in the Dáil he tried to make us believe that there was no bonanza there at all, that Fianna Fáil in the previous few months had spent this money that came about as a benefit from our entry into the EEC.  This, of course, was not true.  Yet this Government tell us that they are fulfilling all of their election promises.  They tell us that the EEC bonanza was not there but still they do not reveal where this money is coming from.  They tell us that they really have no jam at all and yet they are giving us jam.  It is hard to understand their attitude on this point.</P>
    <P>When one reads through this Bill one fails to find any meaningful effort in it <Col N="973" /> to curb inflation.  Inflation in food prices is the type of inflation that hits hardest and hits everybody.  The Minister claimed that the increases in prices arising from the higher VAT rate would be offset by the reduction in prices of foodstuffs as a result of removing VAT from them.  This has not been found to be true and it will still not be found to be true even when VAT is removed from foodstuffs in September.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out to the Minister by the Opposition that he cannot at the same time collect more money and reduce prices by merely manipulating the VAT rates.  There is to be a distinction between what are essential and what are non-essentials.  I consider there are many household goods, basically essential to the ordinary man in the street, on which VAT is to be increased significantly.  When you take this into account, I cannot see how the removal of VAT from food will, in any way, affect the cost of living.  As I have already said, household goods are basic comforts nowadays and the poorer and middle-class sections of our society are now being asked to pay more for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that he is to collect more money but that, nevertheless, prices will go down.  One does not need to be an economist to know that this is impossible.  When one is fighting inflation, the basic consideration should be to build into financial legislation not an incentive to overspend but an incentive to save.  There are approximately 30,000 people in this country whose net income is in the region of £2,500 to £3,000 per year.  Those people are not the recipients of any form of assistance from any State agency.  They have heavy commitments in the matters of housing, education and the maintenance of a certain standard of living.  Legislation should not, in any way, deter those people from pursuing their efforts to pay their way as best they can.  To urge people to help themselves to better their standard of living should be the aim of all financial and industrial legislation.  This type of betterment should be the products of good Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> Children's allowances will not apply to the people in that particular income bracket.  There is encouragement for this type of person to invest in property by going to the bank to raise a loan to meet such an investment and as a consequence pay £400 a year interest on it.  That person, when filling in his income tax return form, can have the £400 weighed and he will then qualify for children's allowances.  This kind of thing makes this individual merely a speculator.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The person who invests money or raises a loan, say, in the region of £400, will find that the interest on this is deducted from his income tax and he then qualifies for childrens' allowance.  To me this makes this type of person a speculator in his own right.  All of this encourages needless overspending and going into debt.  It is a most unsatisfactory and unhealthy economic situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young workers, many of whom are earning good wages, should be given an incentive to save, to invest, rather than to spend or to borrow.  Nowhere can I see any such incentive in this <Col N="976" /> Bill.  Every effort should be made to impress on people the importance of saving both in the interest of the individual and of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>Regarding the matter of encouraging young people to save it would be well to look into the matter of saving for house purchase.  Where are the real incentives to this end?  In this context it might well be asked whether our building societies are now performing the work they were instituted for.  All building societies at their foundation had the characteristics of a co-operative effort.  There was idealism in them and they set about in a practical way to make funds available, through the saving efforts of the participants, to young homemakers.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that these societies, in growing, become more like financial concerns.  They seem to be more interested in dividends to shareholders than in providing tolerable financial facilities and incentives for the young home builder.  Any effort to set up&mdash;even in the smallest way&mdash; co-operatives for house building should be encouraged in every way by the State.  Experts should be asked to apply themselves to the problem of rejuvenating societies which have grown into mere banking companies or, saving this, financial experts should apply themselves to seek out ways and means of setting up funds which would endeavour to do in the 1970s what the building societies did in the earlier decades of this century.</P>
    <P>The Government have said they will provide something in the region of 25,000 houses in this year.  I would strongly recommend to the Minister that he take careful note of the suggestion to remove the tax from office blocks provided the owner guarantees to allow 25 per cent of the area to be used as living accommodation for those in need of homes.  This would be a much better social and financial investment than imposing a 15 per cent stamp duty on those buildings.</P>
    <P>Another alternative to making enough houses available annually is the rising cost of building components. The VAT applies to all building components and the Government should <Col N="977" /> seriously examine the possibility of exempting building components from this tax.  Houses for people are such dire social necessities that everything which would possibly make the building of them in sufficient numbers a reality should be done.  Would not the removal of VAT from building components help towards the proposed 25,000 houses this year?  I sincerely think it would.</P>
    <P>I would seriously ask the Minister to try to get the building societies functioning more efficiently.  I said I believe there is this tendency for them to become more of a banking concern than a building society.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister promised to look into money matters. Often when the one financial knotty problem which counts is highlighted he merely puts the solution on the long finger by saying that further study should be made or a White Paper should be issued.  Too many promises cost more and more money but the knotty problem is: where will the finance come from?  The job for any Minister for Finance is to see where growth is needed, where social aids are required, to apply the remedy to cure the situation and, at the same time, tell the people where he is getting the money from and show them that this money is really available.</P>
    <P>On reading the Finance Bill, my feeling is that on the matter of financing, only a fraction of the pre-election promises of the Coalition Government seem to be put into effect. There have been too many promises about how this money is going to be raised.  The Minister mentioned that he hoped to introduce soon a new unified structure of personal income tax with graduated rates which will take the place of the present dual structure of income tax and surtax. Also we had the pre-election commitment to abolish estate duty in its entirety.  This has not been done.  We have now been given more promises. There is the promise of a White Paper.  The overall feeling of many people who look at the record of the present Government and this finance policy, in particular, is that there were too many pre- and post-election <Col N="978" /> promises, pre-election promises about what they were going to do and post-election promises to bring in studies and White Papers which would show us how they propose to regulate spending and taxes.  I believe that we now suffer from a pie-in-the-sky Government.</P>
    <P>All these promises were made and we have had very little in this particular Finance Bill or, indeed, in the budget.  It cannot be denied that there is positive proof that this Finance Bill and the budget are incapable of doing anything.  I see nothing in the Finance Bill to regulate inflation.  It deflates the buying power of the few pounds in the purses of the sick and the aged, the orphan and the widow. I see no evidence in the Finance Bill of the Just Society or of the truly social conscience.</P>
    <P>There are bound to be financial implications in the coming years resulting from our entry into the EEC. Most people labour under the illusion that entry into the EEC has put money into the Irish worker's pocket.  This is not the case.  This cannot be done without more hard work.  The incentives are there since we joined the EEC but we must work towards this end of increasing our incomes irrespective of what we work at.  I believe that many adjustments will have to be made in our financing methods on our entry into the EEC. The present Bill should have done something about this.  It should have recognised the evolving situation resulting from EEC membership.  It has failed to do this.  I should imagine that from now on amalgamations, take-overs and mergers will become part of our structure to gear ourselves towards the level of efficiency demanded in EEC membership.  The Minister should explain fully the implications of the provisions made in section 38 of the Bill for carrying forward losses for tax purposes.  I should like his assurance that these provisions will not interfere with the developments and changes and, indeed, interactions in industries consequent on entry into the EEC which are necessary if we are to succeed in the EEC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> There could be abuses in this section as carrying forward of losses for taxation could lead to what is known as loss-buying transactions.  When the Minister legislates to stop this particular practice, we would like to be properly assured that the Minister does not also hinder desirable developments such as workers in a loss-operated firm taking over with a stake in the company, going ahead with the successful rejuvenating and running of that little company.  We must always be careful in legislation concerned with ridding abuses that we do not also legislate to dampen much needed ingenuity and enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say I have directed my thoughts on the Bill towards this gigantic problem of inflation. I feel the Minister and the Government are failing miserably in curbing it.  No meaningful effort has been made to remedy the situation.  It seems to be getting out of control, particularly in recent months.  The Government's economic policy is geared towards further inflation.  Considering that it will take another 12 months, unless in the meantime we have another budget imposed on us in the autumn, I shudder to think of what the position will then be.  The Government have failed completely to curb inflation. That is the gigantic problem that confronts the country at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make some observations on this Finance Bill.  The measure is designed to implement the various provisions of the budget.  Children's allowances are a great benefit and social amenity.  This very necessary piece of legislation was introduced some years ago.  Now when we are able to avail of increased savings due to the removal of the subsidies on agricultural exports, it is grossly unfair of the Government to define what category parents would be in in relation to the payment of children's allowances.  For various reasons many people do not marry. Perhaps, they enter the religious life. They may take care of the aged where there are no schemes to take care of them, obeying in doing so the fourth <Col N="980" /> commandment.  The family is the mainstay of the nation and the Government should recognise that fact especially when there are so many pressures to limit the size of families. People with families should be paid decent allowances.  There should be no quibble in regard to the income bracket within which these people fall. There are other ways of recouping the money if the Government feel they are too wealthy.</P>
      <P>A married couple have to find the money to provide a home.  They have to buy washing machines, a fridge, furniture and all the other household effects.  They help to keep the ESB going.  They support the shopkeepers, the supermarkets and clothing manufacturers. In short, the family are the lifeblood of the nation.  In future legislation we should ensure a more liberal approach to help the family.</P>
      <P>The Coalition Government promised to abolish death duties.  It was one of their 14 points issued before the general election.  Very often at election time far-reaching promises are made but when a document such as the 14 points is issued it is only natural that the people expect it to be honoured in full.  Perhaps, it is easier to make these promises in Opposition than in Government.  I will admit that.  The old adage: &ldquo;When the devil is sick a saint is he; when the devil is well the devil a saint is he&rdquo; could apply to those in Government as well.  I do not think the Coalition Government will be able to escape implementing the clear-cut promises they gave of removing death duty on farms.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to payments to universities.  I am not too clear what this means since we have little experience of universities in our part of the country.  I wish that somebody in the near future will take note of the fact that we in the north-west have no university facilities.  Some years ago the people of Limerick succeeded in getting the equivalent of an university.  There are universities in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  I do not begrudge these cities their universities but Cavan, Sligo and Donegal should not be left without university facilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  University facilities should be made available to the north-west and thus obviate the necessity for the people there to travel in order to secure higher education. We pay for this through taxation.</P>
      <P>A Senator suggested that one-fifth of the community lived in poverty. The impression he gave was that we were a nation of paupers.  His statement is grossly exaggerated.  I do not think that there are any Irish people living below subsistence level.  If there are, the public representatives in the areas concerned have neglected their responsibilities.  Our county council&mdash;and I am sure others&mdash;have introduced measures to give reliefs of various kinds, including rates.  There will always be a difference in the rates of income.  Nobody can expect to be equal so far as income is concerned. Even if incomes were equal, the situation would not last a day or a week at most.  Some people would spend what they had.  We must encourage people to be thrifty and provide for the rainy day.  We on this side of the House increased social welfare services as the economy improved.</P>
      <P>It is a historical fact that we introduced the various social service Acts which have given increases to old age pensioners, widows and orphans.  We introduced the children's allowances scheme and various other schemes which all must agree are designed to help the less fortunate sections of our community.  That has been the motto of the last Government and should also be the motto of the present Government&mdash;to ensure that those who are reasonably well off will make a contribution through taxation or otherwise to help those who are below subsistence standard, or on the fringe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our policy has also been to encourage those people to get off their knees and try to provide employment for them and provide colleges where <Col N="982" /> they can learn the skills and techniques necessary to equip them to take their place in society and not be a burden on the State.</P>
    <P>Despite that, there will always be among us those who are ill no matter how much we increase the health services and no matter how efficient our medical profession is.  It is our duty as a Government and a nation to lean backwards to help people who are sick, disabled, mentally handicapped and in any way afflicted.  That should be the basis of our social philosophy and we on this side of the House have lived up to it to the best of our ability and it will eventually be the desire of the present Government to do likewise.  I should like to see more evidence of that intention in the budget and for that reason I have made that short observation regarding children's allowances.</P>
    <P>I should like to dwell for a short time on the question of prices.  People may have been misled during election period and for some time before by the parties forming the present Government. In their efforts to secure office one can hardly blame them for trying to entice the votes of the electorate, but once they are elected they have a duty to redeem the promises they made.  Many people have been led to believe there is an easy solution to this matter of prices, and the campaign was championed from the other side before the dissolution of the Dáil during the past six months.  We were in Government then and we knew it is not easy to control prices.</P>
    <P>I admit the present Government have a difficult assignment to live up to their promises in this respect.  We are all aware that many of the items used now in modern homes, such as oil, coal, tea and rubber, are not produced in this country and it is necessary in modern society to import these products in order to maintain a reasonable standard of living in comparison with other countries.  Youth are demanding these facilities and it is up to us to see they get them.  If you go abroad to purchase oil, rubber, tea, cocoa, or fruit you will not come back empty-handed because you have a certain standard to maintain.  Many homes are fuelled by oil now, it is a <Col N="983" /> necessary evil and I concede that over situations such as that no Government have ultimate control.  Our prices will be determined by what we will be charged in the country where the goods are produced, we have no option but to buy and that will add a certain amount of inflation to the various commodities used in the modern home.  Therefore, before an election the people should not have been led into the belief that there is some magic way whereby a Government could reduce prices by a stroke of the pen.</P>
    <P>The removal of VAT from food is a gimmicky type of operation.  Perhaps it was done in haste, or in the belief that because it pertained to food those who are rearing large families and those living in poor conditions would look upon it as a big concession.  It is a bad decision and long before the date set for its implementation, 3rd September, food prices will have rocketed.  As a previous speaker has stated, prices have increased three times since 1972. What benefit is it to the ordinary family to remove VAT, while prices have been increasing in such a manner? There are difficulties involved and extra work for the small shopkeeper and this operation will have an affect on the prices of other commodities which are essential to modern living.</P>
    <P>One would think we were in the Stone Age and that the only thing needed in modern Ireland was plenty of food.  A person can only eat one dinner per day and having two dinners per day does not contribute to longevity or help in any way.  This operation will inflate the prices of other essential commodities.  Television and radio, fridges, washing machines and other modern amenities which are to be seen in most homes&mdash;on instalment systems, perhaps&mdash;are taken for granted.  These are all increasing in price and this will eat up any small saving that might be made under VAT.  Most homes are heated by some type of oil burning system or by coal.  These commodities have also increased in price so where will the saving come in for the family who have been told that by removing VAT they will be in a much better <Col N="984" /> position?  I respectfully suggest there has been no saving to the individual, there will be a great loss to the Exchequer and the whole operation will end up useless.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the matter of income tax, a problem that did not exist, to a great extent, ten, 15 or 20 years ago in this country because there were not so many people then within the income tax bracket.  At that time emigration was rampant and the housing situation was chaotic.  Therefore, there was no great clamour among the working classes&mdash; because there were not many of them &mdash;to pay income tax.  In recent years the situation has changed completely. We are proud of the fact that in many areas we have factories providing good employment, many of them based on agricultural produce and byproducts and they have been a great asset to the economy.</P>
    <P>Under the income tax code those who are earning above a certain amount in those factories have to pay income tax.  I do not blame any Government for collecting income tax.  Few citizens object to paying provided they know it is a fair and equitable tax and that every citizen is paying his fair share.  It is about the evasion of income tax that our people complain.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made in 1973 for reducing the tax on motor cars and petrol because, less than 20 years ago, a great effort was made by many people in this country to introduce a tax on bicycles.  This pressure was put on the Fianna Fáil Government and, I believe, they wisely resisted it because at that time the bicycle was a mode of conveyance to work.  The motor car today is in the same position. In most homes today a motor car is no luxury but an essential part of present day living.  They may be used by young people to take them to dances or the seaside but these are recreations to which people are entitled when their week's work has ended.  When a car is essential for taking people to their places of employment there should be some concession by way of income tax.</P>
    <P>It is not the workers' fault that most <Col N="985" /> of our industries were placed in Dublin city.  We in Cavan, Sligo or Donegal should not be blamed because industries were placed where they are.  Often the industrialist is rather &ldquo;choosey&rdquo; about the location of his industry and he likes to be near the ports.  We know there is a greater concentration of industries of all kinds on the eastern side of our country than there is on the western side, not because any Government has a grudge against the West but because the industrialist likes to select a location suitable for the export of his finished products.</P>
    <P>The result is that the workers have been attracted to the eastern side of the country because they follow the job opportunities.  Many of them were single people who later got married and settled down on that side of the country with the result that Dublin city is bursting at the seams.  It is expanding so rapidly that tremendous activity and building programmes are being carried out on the best land in Ireland whereas in the western areas, where the land is poor, no such activity exists.</P>
    <P>If a concession such as the abolition of tax on motor cars were given it would eventually encourage people to settle in houses in the country.  This would be a very desirable thing.  In many places down the country there are plenty of national schools and secondary schools where all children can be given equal opportunities under our new secondary school scheme and where bus services are provided for them.  If the Government could grant this concession&mdash;I admit it would mean a loss in revenue&mdash;it would help to curb the unnatural growth that is taking place around Dublin city where one-third of our present population live.  I am not begrudging industries to the people of Dublin city.  They are in a better geographical position and have a good port and all major roads from the country lead to it.  However, anything that would help to encourage young married people to go to live in the fresh air of the country would be a benefit to the country and would compensate the Exchequer for any little income tax concessions that might be granted to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> I should like to mention the question of providing grants and, in particular, extra grants for roads down the country.  This is something that is essential to attracting industries to those areas.  I cannot see how an industrialist would be prepared to set out for one of our remote western regions if he was not reasonably assured that there would be a decent highway provided for him to transport his finished products to the ports on the eastern side of the country.</P>

      <P>I accept that but I was wondering if the Minister intends doing anything to improve the grants available for making roads.  If the grants are not improved there will be less employment on our roads than we had last year because of the increased costs of road materials and, eventually, people will move to other areas where they can obtain employment. When people have devoted many years of their lives to road work it is unfair that they should be laid off at such short notice.  Any trade unionist on the other side of the House&mdash;I am a trade unionist myself &mdash;would not like to see a worker deprived&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was making the point that it might be too late by the time the Appropriation Bill comes before us to make this application.  The Taoiseach will understand that it would be right and proper to make it seeing that it would be a cross-Border effort and the drainage of the River Erne in that North-Western region would facilitate Donegal, Leitrim, Fermanagh, Cavan, Longford and Westmeath.</P>

      <P>Is there any provision in the Finance Bill to assist Gorta in their very laudable work?  None of our citizens would object to such assistance, be they as poor as Senator O'Higgins would lead us to believe, or in the upper income bracket.  This organisation gives underdeveloped countries financial assistance and provide experts to ensure that the people in those countries understand how to use modern machines, techniques and facilities to produce food for themselves rather than having to depend on, if you like, a type of a hand out that once eaten is forgotten.</P>
      <P>The method whereby this is given is a very laudable one and one which should be continued.  That is the reason why I am interested to know if, in this Finance Bill, there is any provision to provide money for Gorta.</P>

      <P>I should like to warn the Government that the increase in prices imposed by them, while it may not directly affect the price of timber, will lead to an increase in the price of houses.  People will find ways and means of adding on VAT to commodities which will result in the price of homes going up.  This will be a calamity.</P>
      <P>The most desirable thing for any person intending to enter the holy state of matrimony is to build a home himself because self-ownership is what is important. It is much better to encourage people to buy the site themselves, to give them loans and grants and make them owners of their own home.  That is a very laudable policy.  It is one which should be followed.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I may have been inclined to stray a little outside the rails so far as this debate is concerned, but I was unable to hear the intervention of the Leas-Chathaoirleach on one occasion.  I did not know whether the Leas-Chathaoirleach was telling me thus far and no further or to continue on.  I felt it was necessary that some of these things should be said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything in a budget that encourages the youth of this country to save money is something which should be encouraged.  I commend, very highly, the efforts being made by the National Savings Committee who visit national schools in an effort to encourage the youth to save.  I should <Col N="989" /> like to see that practice continued, and possibly extended to young people working in factories.</P>
    <P>I do not think that our youth will turn to drink because they are getting extra wages, <i>et cetera.</i>  Certainly this Government have made a fair effort to ensure that they will not do that because they have increased the traditional commodities out of the reach of most of them.  At the same time it is true to say that people should be encouraged to save money.  Young <Col N="990" /> people working in industry will benefit by saving and it will also be of immense benefit to the nation.  Saving will cultivate in them a very important rule of life.  It should be impressed on them early in life how important it is for people to be financially independent.</P>
