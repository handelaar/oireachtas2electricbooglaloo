      <P>Dear Mr. Smyth,</P>
      <P>Owing to my membership, as from today, of the Parliament of the European Communities, I am afraid that I must ask you to notify Seanad Éireann of my resignation from the office of Cathaoirleach.  I take this step with great regret, but it would be impossible for me under these new circumstances to give to the office the time and application that it requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> During the three years during which I have had the honour of presiding over the deliberations of the Seanad, I was fortunate in receiving the greatest courtesy and consideration from Senators.  I am grateful to them for all their kindness.</P>
    <P>In addition, I cannot speak too highly of the ever ready and always reliable advice and help that I received from you yourself as Clerk of the Seanad, from the Clerk-Assistant and from the other members of the staff of Oireachtas Éireann.</P>

      <P>Is the letter from the former Cathaoirleach open to comment at this stage?  We did not get the opportunity at the last meeting of <Col N="3" /> the Seanad to record our appreciation of the work of Senator Yeats while he occupied the position of Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  On behalf of my party and on my own behalf I should like to record sincerely that we considered that Senator Yeats, as Chairman of this assembly during the three years in which he held the office, acted impartially and with fairness and firmness towards all parties in this House. In the letter which the Clerk has read out, Senator Yeats was good enough to express his appreciation of the consideration shown to him by Members of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>All of us could say that, whether we transgressed the rules of order or not, we received the utmost consideration at the hands of Senator Yeats as Cathaoirleach.  On behalf of the Fine Gael Party and myself I should like to record our appreciation of the manner in which he performed his duty while he held the post of Cathaoirleach of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Before taking the Order of Business I should like to raise a matter of great national importance. It is in relation to Motion No. 22 on the Order Paper which reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to introduce legislation to make malicious injury claims arising out of bomb outrages in Border counties and elsewhere a national charge and to establish a fund to compensate persons injured and the dependants of those killed in such outrages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately in Border counties we have had a number of these bomb outrages and I made inquiries as to the number of malicious injury claims lodged against various county councils. The latest information in regard to Donegal County Council is that the total of malicious injury claims lodged against them to date amounts to £438,362.  That would be a huge sum to impose on the ratepayers of that county.  In County Monaghan, without <Col N="5" /> taking into account the recent bombing in Clones, malicious injury claims to date amount to £23,538.  The secretary of the county council stated that this does not include claims arising out of the recent bomb blast in Clones which could be up to £250,000.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, another such outrage happened in Belturbet in County Cavan where the damage was as serious as that caused in Clones and that would probably mean claims against Cavan County Council for £250,000.  In a county&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not intend to go into the subject matter.  I just wanted to give a few figures to indicate to the House how serious malicious injury claim damages could be for people in Border counties if the Government did not take action.  This motion asks the Government to provide a fund to compensate those injured and the dependants of those killed.  It causes great concern to those who are hospitalised that there is no compensation fund.  The Government should act without delay in providing help for those people.  An early announcement as to what measures they intend to take in this direction would help to alleviate anxiety. Attacks against people and towns in the Border counties are not attacks on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, could I again ask the Leader of the House if he would use his good offices to have No. 11 on the Order Paper pushed forward? This motion asks the House to take note of the personnel and terms of reference of the RTE Review Body.  I am sure Senator Ó Maoláin and those on his side of the House will agree this is given an added urgency by the statement published in this morning's newspapers and signed by no fewer than seven out of nine of the outgoing broadcasting authority.  This motion has been on the Order Paper for more than a year.  Only a few days ago a joke was published in the newspapers about the fantastic arrears into which this Order Paper has got.  Matters which were relevant then and are much less relevant now are still on it. I know the Leader of the House has a particular interest in broadcasting as he has often demonstrated this in debates here, and I urge him very seriously to do his best to ensure that this motion will be cleared from the Order Paper because of the importance <Col N="7" /> of the issues it raises to which we should all like to contribute our views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I had intended to table an amendment but on the day the Seanad adjourned before Christmas I thought we were not to meet until this day week and did not put down the amendment.  The Minister should look into the case of agricultural workers.  On the earlier Stage of this Bill I made the case that under the Bill these people will be graded as fourth and fifth class citizens. People employed in industry, <i>et cetera</i> will qualify for pay-related benefits but agricultural workers will not qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> The Minister stated this was a new Bill and must get a trial, but it is most unfair to give it a trial at the expense of this section of the community. Before agreeing to this section I should like the Minister to consider the rights of agricultural workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make two points on this section. The first supports the point which Senator Reynolds has made.  It is clear that categories of employment in respect of which contributions are to be payable are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 1 of the Second Schedule to the 1952 Act and excludes those mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 3 which include agricultural workers and females in domestic employment.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to go into more detail than he has so far in this House, or in another place, with regard to the problem of including farm workers in this legislation.  Farm workers come under PAYE, and tax in respect of their remuneration is deductible and accountable to the Collector General by their employers, as would be any contributions by the farm workers in respect of the pay-related benefits under this Bill are accountable to the same person who is at present responsible for collecting from farmers the pay as you earn tax liability which, with an extraordinary irony, farm employees are subject to but not their employers.  I should like to know what the practical difficulties are which lead the Government to propose to rate them as persons who, having an income in excess of £14 per week, are thereby excluded from the benefits of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to raise a further point which is appropriate to this section. May I ask the Minister when we may hope to have a codification of social welfare legislation?  The Acts mean the Social Welfare Acts of 1952 to 1972.  They are legion.  It is an almost impossible task for even a trained person to trace from one section to another and to ascertain what is the applicable law with regard to social welfare.  One is dependent on the assistance which is undoubtedly forthcoming from the <Col N="9" /> Department of Social Welfare, but that is not adequate.  I am informed that there is no up-to-date practice of recording and circulating the appropriate decisions as to the true meaning of the various sections.</P>
    <P>There is a report contained in the current issue of <i>Social Studies, the Irish Journal of Sociology.</i>  I should like to quote a paragraph so that Senators may be aware of the views of that committee on social welfare set up by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy:</P>
    <P>The present legislation on social services is too diffuse.  Not only is it divided between too many Acts of the Oireachtas (and of the West-minister Parliament) but the legislation itself is almost impossible to read.  The Social Welfare Act, 1971, is an example.  Firstly, there is the unsatisfactory wording of some sections of the principal Acts, e.g. Social Welfare Act, 1952...</P>
    <P>An excerpt is then given from section 5 (1).</P>
    <P>Section 20 (inserted by the Act of 1952) of the Act of 1935 is hereby amended by (a) the substitution for subsection (1) (b) (inserted by the Act of 1970) of the following: &ldquo;(b) (i) where the yearly means of the widow...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is far too difficult to understand. The income Tax Act of 1967, a most helpful volume, has been produced. Amendments to that income tax code are circulated which can be slipped into the appropriate pages of the book.  Unfortunately, we have not had a codification of the estate duty code but we have had a fine green volume bringing together the very many different Acts of Parliament which could be found otherwise in 150 books.  This has been done also with regard to stamp duty.</P>
    <P>There must be a master document which, being appropriately and correctly annotated, at a ready glance of the appropriate officer provides the solution to any problem which may arise.  Could a like volume not be produced and circulated with the assistance of the countless people, many of whom unlike those who have to concern themselves with income <Col N="10" /> tax, estate duty and stamp duty, are without legal professional training but have the desire to get the knowledge quickly as to the right of the particular person?  Such a volume would be useful.  I have made use myself of a very helpful volume produced annually.  It is a summary of the effect of provisions.  It does not give one all these provisions brought together with suitable amendments.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter so that this jungle could be cleared up and drained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the points raised by Senators Reynolds and Alexis FitzGerald in relation to the agricultural worker.  I am baffled as to why the agricultural worker is not included in this scheme. References were made on Second Reading to people in the higher income bracket and it was stated that they were at a greater loss as a result of illness or injury.  The position of the agricultural worker must be faced, and why the Agricultural Wages Board lay down a minimum rate of wages to be paid.</P>
      <P>Every Senator is aware that many farmers have to pay much higher wages to agricultural workers to retain them in their employment.  There are other sources of employment open to them, such as building or factory work, if the farmer pays them an inadequate wage.  Many of these employees are highly skilled workers dealing with sophisticated machinery. They must be paid adequate wages. They, too, will suffer as a result of illness or injury.  This fact must be taken into consideration in relation to the Bill.  I should like to hear the Minister's reasoning as to why these agricultural workers have been excluded. They pay their social welfare contributions.  In many cases they have to pay income tax.  Their exclusion from the scheme cannot be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Alexis FitzGerald's plea for some form of rationalisation of all the measures on our Statute Book in relation to social welfare.  He mentioned the difficulties the possible <Col N="11" /> beneficiaries may face in trying to find what relates to them.  Various members of my profession and the ancillary professions find themselves in a similar difficulty.  Doctors do not know the benefits their patients may be entitled to.  The social workers in the hospitals do not know either and find it very difficult to find out.  Last but not least, people teaching medical students do not know what to tell them on this subject, very often leaving them in a complete fog as to where we stand.  A student goes away with the impression that there is no proper provision at all.  The sooner this job is undertaken the better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to refer to the point raised by Senator Reynolds in regard to agricultural workers.  I dealt as comprehensively as possible with this on Second Stage. However, I have no objection to refreshing the minds of Senators on the points I then made.  I am not defending the exclusion of agricultural workers on the ground that they are not entitled to the benefits.  They are just as much entitled as any other worker and, perhaps, more so.  I could not find it possible to get arrangements made to collect the agricultural contributions by the Revenue Commissioners who have made provision to collect the contributions in respect of what is in the Bill.  It would have delayed getting this legislation off the ground.  It would have required my waiting and doing further work, which I am continuing to do, regarding the agricultural workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agricultural workers are a category which are not adequately indexed with any institution of the State.  While they are subject to income tax, it is no secret that they are not all contributing.  I find the problem of collecting contributions and getting the reckonable earnings in order to pay benefits difficult to surmount at the present time.  While we do not intend to collect contributions until April, 1974, I hope to put the legislation into effect well in advance <Col N="12" /> of that date.  In the meantime, as I promised the House during Second Reading, I shall continue to see what can be done about the agricultural workers.  I made the same statement regarding this matter in the other House also.</P>
    <P>The agricultural workers have their wages fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board for so many months. Employers are quite free to pay more if they wish.  There are other factors to be considered, such as, payment in kind, lodgings, housing accommodation, supply of produce from the farm and so forth, but they alone would not make the problem of collecting the benefits insurmountable.  I did not succeed in getting the people who have kindly consented to undertake the gigantic task of collecting contributions in relation to the workers covered in the Bill, to agree to extend the operation to the other workers at this time.</P>
    <P>There are 38,000 agricultural workers and 15,000 female agricultural domestic employees.  With regard to female agricultural domestic employees, there is an anomaly in relation to the payment of benefits. I have given an undertaking that this anomaly will be abolished so that they will be brought into line with other workers as soon as possible. These are the genuine reasons for not collecting the contributions.  The Minister could have no ulterior motive because the Bill is designed so as not to cost the Exchequer anything. I would prefer to have the benefits conferred on employees extended to everybody including the agricultural workers as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>While the legislation will not be put into effect until a date to be fixed by me, we will continue to seek a way of including the agricultural workers in the scheme.  Coupled with this intention is my decision to abolish the insurability limit of £1,600 which could bring in a lot more money to the social welfare code than at the present time.  This is my case with regard to agricultural workers.  Section 10 gives the Minister power to bring in any section of workers which it is possible <Col N="13" /> to bring in at any time he desires. Section 10 is there for that specific purpose.  Therefore we will not require further legislation to include the agricultural workers when the time comes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the codification of legislation, on which we had made some progress during my first term in the Department of Social Welfare, and in respect of which as late as 1960 we had preparations made, one of the problems which I should like the House to appreciate is that Social Welfare above all other Departments is one which is continuously progressing in relation to legislation.  Every year sees a new Social Welfare Bill and changes in scope and rates with regard to the general scheme of social welfare.  No sooner has one codified existing legislation than it is out of date.  While I appreciate that from the legal point of view it would be very necessary to have legislation codified so as to simplify the matter for people who should know the legal position, in so far as the beneficiaries are concerned our guide to the social welfare services gives them adequate information on the benefits to which they are entitled and how to get them.  It can also be useful to lawyers and others in so far as it points to the Acts under which these benefits may be paid.  In this way it is useful, in the absence of codified law, even to those who must deal in a legal manner with the different benefits.  We appreciate the need for some codification of the law even up to a particular time but no sooner has it been brought up-to-date than it goes off at a tangent with the next miscellaneous Social Welfare Bill, which upsets the whole applecart. The people who so frequently criticise the Department of Social Welfare about their way of operating never seem to appreciate that we are dealing with very large numbers of people with the smallest possible Department.</P>
    <P>The amount of the Departmental Vote which is used in administration is relatively small in relation to other Departments.  We try to ensure that as much of the voted moneys as possible go to the payment of benefits rather than for administrative purposes. Every year we deal with some 2,000,000 <Col N="14" /> people&mdash;practically every household comes within the ambit of the Department&mdash;and when the whole code is changed, requiring complete new sets of books, stamps, issues and, forms constitutes a large volume of work which is not always appreciated by those who are ready to criticise the Department.  We have a small section set aside for research who are doing very good work in the preparation of the future requirements of the social welfare code and its extension to other fields.  In the same way, the number of people who are available for codification of the law must necessarily be fairly small.  They have completed a good part of the work which was due to come before both Houses in 1960 but which had to be postponed owing to the annual Bill of that year which required that most of the work be started a second time.  I say nothing further on the question of codification other than that I should be very happy to come to the House with a Bill which would consolidate the law regarding social welfare.  I hope that even a limited Bill will be accepted by the House as soon as it is possible to draft it.  I do not wish to draft such a Bill until after this year because it is well known that this year we will be making some further changes in the code.  They fill be fairly far-reaching changes and it would be as well to have the most important parts of social welfare legislation incorporated in any consolidation that will be undertaken.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the way in which he met the point with regard to the provision, in a single volume, of relevant legislation.  I appreciate the difficulties involved in doing so but it will be worth it.  A similar situation to that of social welfare exists with regard to income tax and estate duty.  The income tax people undertook this task in 1967 in the Income Tax Act and there are amendments every year to the income tax code.  The existence of the 1967 Act gives a very helpful starting point.  I appreciate also that there are substantial changes imminent. The timing must take account of those changes and the appropriate time to <Col N="15" /> do so is, obviously, when they are are made.</P>
      <P>With regard to agricultural employees, I agree that section 10 would seem to give the Minister all the powers he needs to add to the persons in respect of whom this Act provides benefit.  However, I would like to ask whether it might not expedite and accelerate the process of bringing agricultural employees within the network if they were included at as early a date as possible even if some people hoped to avoid their liability.  Would not the very existence of the benefit be a morsel which would attract into the whole network of collection the people who lie outside it, notwithstanding their liability?  If the Minister is proposing to take the power to do this, at a time when he can decide, I suggest this might be a factor worth considering in determining what that time should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which deals with the widows of insured persons.  Those people do not qualify for benefit despite the fact that their husbands may have been paying stamp contributions, perhaps voluntarily, for years.  When the husband dies his widow will not qualify for pay-related benefit but will qualify for the ordinary benefit.  In the case of agricultural workers the Minister has given us the reason that there is no machinery to deal with them.  He said there is no means of calculating the numbers and, to use his own words, &ldquo;They are not tabbed as yet&rdquo;.  Their unfortunate widows are tabbed.  In my opinion, they are entitled to benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Reynolds in his remarks and to ask the Minister to give some additional benefit to this section of our community.  They are quite a substantial section.  A widow with a family <Col N="16" /> cannot qualify by getting employment due to the fact that she has a family to look after.  She cannot qualify for benefit under the social welfare code unless she is available for employment. She is, therefore, automatically excluded from the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I should also like to draw the Minister's attention to another category of people who are, according to the terms of this Bill, entitled to benefit because they have paid the necessary number of qualifying contributions but, for other reasons, cannot be paid their entitlement.  I refer to persons who have been disqualified for one reason or another and whose payments are in suspension for, say, six weeks or until such time as an investigation by an officer of the Minister's Department takes place.  I refer also to a further category who would be qualified under the Social Welfare Acts because they have paid the necessary number of contributions but because they have committed an offence, either under the Social Welfare Acts or under some other legal code and as a result have received a prison sentence, they cannot be paid their due benefit while they are in prison.  What is even worse, their wives and dependants cannot receive payment either.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister should have considerable sympathy with those people.  Anybody who is in public life or a member of a local authority or public body will know that there are men who have fallen foul of the law for one reason or another but as long as they are serving their sentence in prison neither they nor, more importantly, their wives or families can draw the existing benefits nor will they now be in a position to draw the better benefits proposed in this Bill.  In fact the ratepayers of the local authority or the charitable organisations have to take over the responsibility of such dependants until such time as the breadwinner is discharged from prison.  I do not believe it was ever the intention of the Minister, or indeed of any Minister, that the ratepayers should be called upon to bear a proportion of the social welfare code but they are doing so under the present legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" /> I do not propose to put down an amendment on this on Committee Stage because I know the Minister is doing his best to cater for all cases. He has pointed out already, and we have to give him credit for it, that he has endeavoured each year to improve the social welfare code.  However, I think there remains a glaring gap in the code in regard to the cases I have mentioned and I would ask him if, in the provisions of this Bill or by bringing in a consequential Bill, he could make some provision for the wives and dependants of men who are not available for employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to widows, I would point out that the Bill only extends to unemployed and disability benefit cases presently qualified for unemployment benefit, disability benefit and maternity allowances. In certain circumstances persons drawing occupational injury benefit would also be qualified.  It does not extend to pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already said, like every other piece of social welfare legislation that has been introduced, there will be immediate demand to have it extended.  No doubt, it must be extended as soon as it is possible to do so not merely to those but to other contributory pensions as well.  Pensions are in an entirely different category from what is being covered here.  The likelihood of having it extended to pensioners in the near future are pretty bright but I would not say we should amend this Bill for the sake of bringing in one type of pensioner, i.e. the widows.  That does not say that, in the meantime, we cannot help widows in the ordinary way.  Naturally, widows now in receipt of contributory pensions, whose husbands or they themselves, or both, may have long records of insurance, may not have benefit inherent in their payments to cover the payments that are being provided for in this Bill.  It is not proposed in the Bill to qualify for future payments those who may be widowed in the future.  Those who are drawing now cannot claim that they have contributed towards it because the contributions that will be payable in <Col N="18" /> respect of this Bill will be collected later on.  Those persons paying it will be qualified by the fact that they qualify for unemployment benefit or for disability benefit or maternity allowances.</P>
    <P>People misunderstood when I said in the other House that no improvement would be effected in the rates of widows' pensions until such time as these pay-related benefits would be applied to pensions.  That is not true. There is nothing to prevent the improvement of widows' pensions scheme at any time basically, as has been done time and again in the past.  However, it will require separate legislation to apply this to pensioners later on.  The demand will be that pay-related pensions should be payable.  As Senators know, all contributory pensions, irrespective of what the recipients have been earning prior to their becoming pensioners, will all have the same rate. It would be only equitable to have a contribution collected in respect of pensions and of pensions made pay-related as well, similar to the provisions being made here.  In the meantime pensions are not included.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another point regarding persons in jail.  This would require separate legislation.  In order to qualify for unemployment benefit, one must be capable of, available for and generally seeking work and a person who is confined or who is in custody could not claim.  Therefore, they would not qualify under&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The problem frequently arises, however, in regard to their wives and dependants at home because they are qualified only for home assistance.

It may be possible to make better provision for cases of this kind rather than do it through the Unemployment Assistance Acts.</P>

Eventually, I hope that the Minister will agree that some provision should be made for these classes from central funds.</P>

      <P>The Senator may not be aware that the principal provision proposed in the new home assistance scheme which is under examination now, and which is at a fairly advanced stage but has not yet come up for Government decision, is that the scheme be nationalised.  It is proposed that payments be made as a national assistance.  It will include a number of categories that heretofore would have drawn unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. Many of these categories are actually drawing these benefits and, as we are all well aware, if we strictly apply the terms of the legislation, they would not be qualified.  It is conceivable that under that scheme one can do something worth while for the dependants of persons in custody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not so aware. Would that mean that the home assistance being paid when this legislation goes through would be related to the former earning power of, say, an imprisoned person?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question.  Up to £14, one does not come within the ambit of this Bill.  In the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill there is a scale of benefits.  I notice that under reckonable weekly earnings the pay-related benefit is nil.  The single person is just on the total benefit&mdash;the present benefit&mdash;of £5.55. Then there is a gap from £14 to £20 where the pay-related benefit is £2.40. In the case of the person on £15, £16 or £17 does he get the 40p per £, which appears to be the norm in this, if he is above £14 and between £14 and £20?  In other words, would a person on £17 gain by £1.20?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is calculated at 40 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the section in which on the Second Reading, our colleague, Senator Willie O'Brien, raised the question regarding the situation of someone who in the previous year has, for example, worked abroad.  Is the reckonable weekly earnings in his case the income which arises in Ireland only?  If it be so, is it not very unjust?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of people in receipt of less than £14 a week who may be limited.  I have in mind apprentices and people like that.  They will not qualify for benefit under a pay-related scheme.  I think the Minister should have a look at such cases.  There are a very limited number of them but people who serve apprenticeships may get a nominal wage of £8, £10 or £12 per week.  They must also pay for insurance stamps and, probably, income tax and it would be unfair to deprive them of pay-related benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator points out, this section very largely deals with the rates payable.  It is the most interesting section in the Bill in that it actually measures out what we are going to do under it.  In common <Col N="21" /> with everyone else, we would like to do better, but we have cut our cloth in accordance with the resources available to us.  We take from employers and employees in order to give them related benefit.</P>
      <P>It is calculated that the first £14 does not come within the reckoning. The reason is that the amount of flat rate at present is approximately 40 per cent of £14.  To reduce that amount and adhere to the 40 per cent of the pay-related element in the Bill would mean that persons under £14 could be getting less than they are getting in flat rate at present.  They are already getting 40 per cent up to £14 and from that up to a ceiling which will be fixed. We propose giving them 40 per cent. The ten pence allowance will also be payable in the case of married people. In some cases people get up to 95 per cent of their earnings.</P>
      <P>If we changed this scale by increasing the 40 per cent to 60 per cent we would increase the amount of contribution and the whole costings of the Bill are based on what is set down here.  There was another interesting point raised in connection with a person's earnings abroad because as of now the Bill only covers reckonable earnings as computed by the Revenue Commissioners and the last year available to us for income tax purposes. We have entered into a new situation, which must be dealt with as we meet it, regarding membership of the EEC when there will be all round reciprocity with regard to payments or where payments under any social welfare code will be payable as from one country to another.  That is a different day's work which would have to be met in relation to this or any other piece of social welfare legislation we have.  Our people will be permitted to draw their benefits in any country they may go to, if it is a member state.  In the same way as it provides a rearrangement under all other parts of the social welfare code, we will have to adjust to this scheme accordingly.  One can easily visualise how this will benefit the recipient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With <Col N="22" /> respect, I wonder is that the point. With regard to this matter is the EEC not such as would give some German worker coming here the right to get the benefits under our social welfare code but not necessarily determined by the German scale but by the Irish scale?  In this case whether he be German or Irish he is not going to get a pay-related benefit unless he has got an income assessable for taxes in Ireland.</P>

      <P>This section contains an important amendment of section 49 of the 1952 Act.  We should be aware of the importance of this amendment, whether we agree with it or not.  Under section 49 of the 1952 Act an offence, if proven, gives rise to a fine not exceeding £10.  There is a saver to the effect that no one should be required under the section to answer any questions or to give any evidence tending to incriminate himself.</P>
      <P>This section provides that any offence under section 49, not merely an offence related to the pay-related contributions, shall be liable in lieu of the penalty specified of £10 to a fine not exceeding £100 or at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain if this amendment goes further than merely protecting the position of pay-related contributions but relates to any type of offence which is proven to be committed in relation to section 49. I should also like to know if the requirement in subsection (4) &ldquo;not to answer any questions or to give any evidence tending to incriminate himself&rdquo; is still preserved.</P>

      <P>I was referring to section 49 of the 1952 Act.  It is important to realise that we are not dealing merely with the pay-related contribution but with the fundamental amendment of the 1952 Act, which in certain Acts is referred to as the Principal Act.</P>

      <P>The Minister may, for the purposes of pay-related contributions and pay-related benefits, by regulations require employers to keep such records as may be specified in the regulations of the earnings of persons employed by them and to retain the records for such periods as may be prescribed and any records so specified shall be deemed to be documents for the purposes of section 49 of the Act of 1952.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a question with regard to subsection (4) of this section.  This relates to section 39 (9) (b) of the Act of 1952, which is the provision with regard to the social insurance fund and which states:</P>
      <P>(a)  The amount by which the income of the Fund for any financial year is less than its expenditure shall be paid into the fund out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  The income and expenditure of the Fund for the financial year should be determined for the purposes of this subsection by the Minister <Col N="29" /> on such basis as may be agreed upon between him and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed to add to (b)</P>
    <P>but for such purposes any expenditure arising from the provisions of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1972, and such income from pay-related contributions under that Act as is used to meet that expenditure shall be disregarded.</P>
    <P>What will happen in regard to pay-related expenditure which is found to be in excess of pay-related income in any given year?  Is this covered by the borrowings made by the Minister for Finance which, under subsection (1), he can only make during a period of five years?  Let us go further than five years.  What happens in the seventh year if your pay-related expenditure is in excess of your pay-related income?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>You would extend the provision in that case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>By power taken under this Bill as Minister.  This section deals with the interim.  If the Bill comes into force before benefits have been collected it makes provision for an Exchequer repayable loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that very well.  Subsection (4) of this section is a permanent provision of this code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect, that does not help me in the slightest.  I should still like to know what happens when there is a shortfall of income during the period when, in relation to this particular pay-related code, you no longer have provision for making repayable borrowings from the Minister for Finance.  You cannot avail of subsection (9) of section 39 of the Act of 1952 because it provided that the shortfall is to be excluded <Col N="30" /> in determining what is to be the provision out of the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>The income and expenditure of the Fund for a financial year shall be determined for the purposes of this subsection by the Minister on such basis as may be agreed upon between him and the Minister for Finance but for such purposes any expenditure arising from the provisions of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit Act), 1972, and such income from pay-related contributions under that Act as is used to meet that expenditure shall be disregarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was able to do that exercise myself.  Does it simply mean that the fruit of the fund is used to make good the shortfall in the pay-related scheme and that you cannot go to the Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally the amount of the contributions is conjectural to a great extent, since one has not the practical experience to know what will be necessary to meet the requirements without any cost to the Exchequer.  If we find the contributions are too much or too little we can adjust them accordingly as in every other contribution scheme in social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I be giving a short and simple answer to myself if I said that you will be able to adjust the contributions if they are inadequate to cover the benefit by an order under the earlier section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like everybody to look at this one. What are the limitations on the power of the Minister?  What is the nature of the difficulty?  The phrase &ldquo;any difficulty&rdquo; is not defined.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>If in any respect any difficulty arises in bringing into operation this Act, the Minister may, subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance, by order do anything which appears to be necessary or expedient for bringing this Act into operation, and any such order may modify the provisions of this Act so far as may appear necessary or expedient for carrying the order into effect.</P>
      <P>Does that mean the Minister appears to have the power to set aside and vary any other section of this Act including the £14 per week, the 40 per cent in excess of the £14 per week, the category of employee to be affected; his own ability to extend the category of employee; the section which entitles him to borrow from the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Finance to advance to him.  What sort of precedent have we for giving an all-wise Minister with an all-wise colleague such power?  What have we been doing for the last two hours? Should we not have debated this one first?  Is this not the section which says: &ldquo;It is all over to you&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to expedite the bringing in of the Act. There is a precedent.  Other Acts in the past, indeed the 1952 Act, made the same provision for the expeditious bringing in of the Act.  In the transition stages one can meet with unforeseen difficulties.</P>

      <P>Is mian liomsa cuidiú leis an dtairiscint atá molta ag an Seanadóir Ó Maoláin, sé sin Mícheál Cranitch a bheith ina chathaoirleach ar an Seanad.  Mar chomharba an Seanadóir Mícheál Yeats, is fear oiriúnach é mar is dóigh liomsa, leis, mar adúirt an Seanadóir Ó Maoláin, nach bhfuil aon tréith ionmholta a bhí agus atá ag Mícheál Yeats nach bhfuil ag Mícheál Cranitch chomh mhaith.  Tá sé uasal, éirimiúil, Gaelach agus foighneach agus, mar adúirt an Seanadóir Ó Maoláin leis, tá cion beirte déanta aige ar son tíre agus teanga. Bhí sé go gnóthach i gcúrsaí polaitíochta, i gcúrsaí ceoil agus i gcúrsaí léinn agus go mórmhór i gcúrsaí na Gaeilge.  Fear é gur féidir le gach duine againn&mdash;is cuma cad é an dearcadh polaitíochta atá aige&mdash;a bheith mórálach as.  Táim cinnte go stiúróidh sé obair an Tí seo go cóir agus go macánta agus go dtabharfaidh sé cothram na Féinne do chách.  Gura fada buan é mar Chathaoirleach nuair a toghfar é.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not find myself in disagreement with the views expressed by Senator Ó Maoláin or the other speaker with regard to the qualities of Senator Cranitch who has been proposed by them&mdash;indeed, I have a high respect and regard for Senator Cranitch&mdash;in proposing another name I do not do so out of any sense of antagonism to or criticism of Senator Cranitch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose Senator Dooge, the Leas-Chathaoirleach. I do so because of my conviction that Senator Dooge is a man who is not only worthy of the office of Cathaoirleach of this Assembly but a man who, in the particular circumstances in which the vacancy falls to be filled, is deserving of it and the person who should be appointed.  Senator Dooge has been Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad since 1965.  He is an experienced <Col N="36" /> Chairman of this Assembly and, in addition, he has experience in other fields.  He has served as chairman on local authorities.  He is a person who has a distinguished academic career. In his own profession he has attained an international reputation.  I think it is not unknown to the Members of this House that Senator Dooge, in his own profession, is a man who is widely sought after abroad for delivering lectures and so on in his own field.</P>
    <P>To my mind he has all the qualities which would normally be associated with a man of his stature.  He is obviously and eminently fair-minded. He has demonstrated, by more than five years' service as Leas-Chathaoirleach, that he will rule this assembly with complete impartiality.  He is a man of great dignity and, perhaps more than all else, he is&mdash;and has demonstrated this time and time again in this House&mdash;a man who is good-humoured.</P>
    <P>We are asked to fill a vacancy for the post of Cathaoirleach while approaching the end of the life of this Parliament.  It is a very unusual situation and is probably without precedent. I do not recall this situation occurring either in this House or in the other House in the last 25 or 30 years, which would be within my own memory.  I think I am correct in saying that the situation is completely without precedent.</P>
    <P>When the Seanad met for the first time after the general election, we, on this side of the House, did not contest the right of the majority party to have the Chair.  The precedent has been established in this House for a long time in the past that the majority party should have the Chair.  I do not feel that we are in any way breaching that precedent in urging the House on this occasion to elect the Leas-Cathaoirleach as Cathaoirleach.  In the circumstances where a man has served for more than five years in the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach, and when the vacancy has occurred in the autumn, if not the winter, of this Parliament, it would only be right that the person who has occupied the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach, with distinction and without complaint from any side of the House, should now be allowed to <Col N="37" /> serve out the remaining months of this Parliament as Cathaoirleach.</P>
    <P>At the moment, of course, he is acting Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, and I think I can say with great conviction that no Member of the Seanad on the benches opposite will find themselves in disagreement with anything I have said regarding Senator Dooge.  He is a distinguished parliamentarian; he is a distinguished man in his own field; he is a man with long experience of both Parliament and public work generally; he is a man who is fully qualified and competent to deal with the business of this House in both the first and second official languages of the State.  He is a man held in the highest esteem by all of us.  I would strongly urge that the majority party on this occasion should feel, as I feel, and as I imagine a great many other people will feel, that for the few months that are left of this Parliament, it would only be right that the Leas-Chathaoirleach should be allowed to fill the post of Cathaoirleach.</P>

      <P>I wish to second the proposal made by Senator O'Higgins that Senator Dooge should be elected Chathaoirleach of this Assembly.  In doing so, I re-echo the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Senator O'Higgins.  Senator Dooge was first elected in 1961 and has been re-elected at each general election since.  As Senator O'Higgins has told the House, he has certainly carried out his duty in an exemplary manner.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to recall that when Deputy Hogan from County Clare&mdash; go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam&mdash; died three years ago, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann, Cormac Breslin, was elected Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann.  Perhaps this is a precedent and a course of action that at least some of us thought would be followed in the other House of the Oireachtas.</P>

Everybody in the Seanad agrees that during the last three years a very high standard has been set by the outgoing Cathaoirleach, Senator Yeats, and indeed by the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Dooge.  It is important for the easy transaction of business to ensure that this happy situation continues. The best way to ensure this is to elect as Cathaoirleach a man with experience, a man who since 1965 has enjoyed the confidence of all sides of the House.  I, therefore, formally second Senator O'Higgins's proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>As an independent Senator, I should like to comment on the choice of candidates put forward for election as Cathaoirleach.  First of all, I should like to preface my remarks by remembering my first day in this House&mdash;as it was the first day for a number of us&mdash;when we chose the previous Cathaoirleach.  My colleague, Owen Sheehy Skeffington, made a very forceful statement about the manner of choosing a Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  He said it was a regrettable fact that inevitably he was chosen from the Government Party. On that occasion there was not a choice in the matter.  The first point I want to make is to appreciate the fact that we are given a choice and a choice between two good candidates. I would agree with many of the statements expressed by Members on both sides of the House, but perhaps I am in a better position than some others to go further and say: &ldquo;Very well, there are two good candidates.  On a question of choice, which should the Seanad choose as Cathaoirleach?&rdquo;  I am speaking in an independent frame of mind, with no axe to grind and with a liking and respect for both candidates. I would have no hesitation in choosing the man whom I know to have very worthwhile experience.  I am speaking of the present Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Dooge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Member of the House has had experience of him as a Chairman; we <Col N="39" /> have had experience of his contributions and he is the acknowledged expert on procedure in the House.  On many occasions I have approached him for advice on a particular procedural point, and I know that this is true of many other Senators.  Not only is he an expert but, unlike some experts, he is generous with his knowledge and generous with his time, and this is something which I have appreciated. It would be good for this House as a House of a Parliament which has not always, in my view, acquitted itself with honour, if we would choose the candidate on the basis of what would be the best Cathaoirleach for the Seanad for the remainder of this session.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Higgins that the circumstances are peculiar and allow the Seanad more freedom to choose than has been the case on other occasions.  This should be less a matter of party monopoly than of choice on the merits as to who ought to be the new Cathaoirleach and therefore I express my own choice that the person of whom we have had experience be Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I note that although Senator Cranitch has been a regular and constructive contributor to the Seanad debates, to my recollection he has not acted as Cathaoirleach on any occasion.  I may be wrong about that, but I do not remember him taking the Chair so that there are other more senior Senators on that side of the House who have had this experience but have not put themselves forward.</P>
    <P>For these reasons and because I am speaking as an independent Senator I hope the House will choose on the side of experience and on the side of somebody who would be an excellent Cathaoirleach of the House, namely Senator Dooge.</P>

      <P>I should like to comment on the proposals that have been made.  Senator Robinson comments favourably on Senator Dooge but&mdash;and this is no reflection on the Senator&mdash;I would not like to see this House of Parliament being dominated by people who class themselves as being superior to the people of Ireland. This is a rut in which we could very <Col N="40" /> easily find ourselves.  This is the attitude which I sense here.  I have enough experience of public life to know that some of these people, with due respect to their education and ability, can get carried away in theory and become far removed from the basic needs of people.  It is a great day when we have a man from rural Ireland proposed as Cathaoirleach and on that basis alone it is a privilege for me to support him. It gives me great pleasure to do that.</P>

Thug sé cothram na Féinne do gach ball.  Ní h-ionann sin is a rá go bhfuilim den bharúil nach fear maith é an Seanadóir Cranitch ach ba cheart dúinn ár mbuíochas á chur in iúl don Leas-Chathaoirleach agus é a thoghadh mar Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach who has served this House well and who has been impartial and courageous in everything he did during his time as Leas-Chathaoirleach should be conferred with this honour as a mark of our appreciation of the work he did during his term as Leas-Chathaoirleach. I do not say that in a spirit of opposition to Senator Cranitch.  He is a man who has made some worthwhile contributions in this House and he has done considerable work on behalf of Irish culture in the south of Ireland. He is a man whom I respect.  I say that without any qualification.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Senator who said that it is a good thing to see a national teacher from rural Ireland being elevated to such a high office.  At the same time, Senator Dooge has at all times displayed remarkable impartiality, competence to deal with the position, fairness and courtesy to every Member of this House, and as a mark of the appreciation of Senators of the work he has done for so long and done so eminently well, we should promote him to the position of Cathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would be a good example to this country.  I do not believe that it is <Col N="41" /> right in any walk of life that the winner should take all.  When a minority party turn up a man of exceptional merit the majority party should recognise that. Senator Dooge would do credit to this House and to the office held by Cathaoirligh who have gone before him.</P>

The debates never fell flat and whenever there was a suggestion of sharpness he was very quick to act.  The tone was always good and the performances even in the wind section were never long-winded.  The harmony we have enjoyed for the past three and a half years is, indeed, a tribute to an Seanadóir Yeats and the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Deputy Chairmen also.

      <P>Section 1 is concerned with definitions for the purpose of this Bill.  I should like to raise one point with regard to the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo;.  Looking at this definition and comparing it with the definition in the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, to which this Bill is very closely tied, I notice there is a slight discrepancy between the two.  I should like to ask the Minister if there is any particular significance in the amendment which is made here.</P>

      <P>Regarding the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; as it relates <Col N="44" /> to the scheme or to local authorities as employers, how does this affect, for example, the roadworker who may have five years' continuous employment with a particular local authority? The engineering section then finds that money is drying up and a number of notices are given for dismissal at the end of a particular period.  These people do not get a week or a fortnight's notice.  They are usually told on a Tuesday or Wednesday that they will cease to be employed on the following weekend as there is no money in the funds.  This happens particularly at this time of the year.  I should like to receive an assurance from the Minister that this type of employee will be brought within this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot accept that because very often a man is dismissed after perhaps three, four or five years.  There is no cheque the following week or fortnight except what he receives from the labour exchange. An employer can get the same benefits and still get his pay.  There is no point in quibbling as to whether a man is dismissed or laid off.  When he is disemployed he is dismissed.  Three months may elapse before he can be re-employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This Bill is dealing with minimum notice of dismissal. There is a vast difference between a lay-off and a dismissal.  The rights a man has accumulated in continuous employment give him certain rights for continuity in this Bill.  The duration of notice given to him, whether two, three, four or eight weeks, depends on the period of his employment. It also applies to his redundancy, whether he has been in continuous employment.  Lay-off does not break continuity but dismissal does.  If he is dismissed he has to be given the notice laid down in this Bill.  If he is laid off it is a different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I cannot accept the Minister's explanation. <Col N="45" /> We are referring to the interval between men being laid off and being dismissed.  The fact remains that they are both unemployed.  If we are to carry this to its logical conclusion an employer in an industry may quite easily say these men are not dismissed they are being temporarily laid off. Then they do not come within the terms of this Bill.  Is that correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If the Senator looks at paragraph 3 of the First Schedule to the Act it states:</P>

      <P>Still on section 1, if I might return to the original point I made about the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo;, the Minister indicated that there was no particular significance in the change of the definition here.  My problem was that section 2 of the 1967 Act defines &ldquo;employee&rdquo; and says that &ldquo;employer&rdquo; which is a defined term in that section and &ldquo;employment&rdquo; are to be construed accordingly.  When we come to section 1 of this Act we find <Col N="46" /> it says &ldquo;and cognate expressions can be construed accordingly&rdquo;.  I should like to know if there are any &ldquo;cognate expressions&rdquo;, that is expressions cognate to the word &ldquo;employee&rdquo;, other than &ldquo;employer&rdquo; and &ldquo;employment&rdquo;? This is why I am puzzled about the differences here.  Perhaps it is that the word &ldquo;employer&rdquo; is not defined in this particular section.  I am puzzled at two sections which are 95 per cent, perhaps more, the same having this slight difference.  A change was made and one becomes curious as to the reason for the change.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has underlined what I have said. When I look at subsection (2) of section 5 I find the words &ldquo;employee&rdquo;, &ldquo;employment&rdquo; and &ldquo;employer&rdquo;.  If these are the only cognate expressions to the word &ldquo;employee&rdquo;, why were these not cited, as was done in the 1967 Act?  Are there some words other than in this section where we have some cognate expressions?  Within a definition everything which is used in it should be clear.  The words &ldquo;cognate expressions&rdquo; are not clear in this particular case.  We are dealing here with legislation in regard to people's rights to entitlement.  This may appear a niggling minor point but we must be absolutely clear about what we mean in this particular regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 (1) (b) deals with what we might call the forbidden degrees of kindred in respect of this Bill.  Here we have a number of points which I should like to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have gone out from relatively simple relationships to several degrees of kindred.  We seem inclined to bring the complete deirbh-fhine of our ancestors into this legislation.  We do not merely deal with the question of parents and children, we go beyond that to grandparents and grandchildren. Having taken in this very wide scope, I then find that there is no mention of the relationship of son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law or mother-in-law.  When we were making out this very large list of people under this particular paragraph, which refers to employment of a particular type in which families and relations are largely concerned, these particular relationships were excluded <Col N="48" /> and I should like to know the reason.  If we can think in terms of an employment of a son or daughter on a farm or in a dwelling house, we could equally think of the employment of a son-in-law or daughter-in-law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the same relationships which are provided for in other legislation under the social welfare code.  There is no difference here.  If you bring in in-laws, very often the boss's daughter marries an employee and it would be very wrong to deprive the employee of the benefits he is already entitled to just because he married the boss's daughter. I do not think one could argue in favour of including in-laws.  There are many cases where one would think that the immediate relatives should be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but we are concerned in subsection (1) with particular conditions of employment. The Minister indicated that this is the same as in other legislation.  It is the same as subsection (3) (b) of section 4 of the 1967 Redundancy Act. On the other hand it is far wider in scope than the corresponding section of the British 1963 Act on which this legislation appears to be based.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, in regard to this particular problem of this type of employment, if the reference here is only to domestic work in a private dwellinghouse or on a farm. Does it apply to work on a farm and, in that case, are there any limits to the type of work?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>

      <P>All such cases are, of course, subject to test on their merits but, broadly speaking, he would be excluded.  He could possibly seek to establish that he has some specific skill that could not be found elsewhere and, even though relative, he has to be employed there.  He could have a contract of service with his father and, on his establishing that he could not find somebody else for the job, he might be able to establish that he was insurable. The same thing arises with regard to insurance.</P>

    <Col N="50" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>So far we have been concerned here with particular persons and conditions of employment. I would now like to take up the scope of the exclusion.  We are concerned in this Bill with the giving of notice of the termination of employment and also with the provision of their terms of employment to employees.  I should like to ask the Minister to comment on whether it is desirable to make a blanket exclusion in this regard.  I know there is an escape clause which the Minister can vary afterwards, but we should be clear in the legislation on the right thing to be done at the moment.</P>
      <P>Uncertainty in regard to their terms of employment on the part of children in rural Ireland working for their parents has been not only a cause of anxiety to many of those children but has also been the basis of much dramatic output on the stage of our national theatre.  Irish dramatists have dealt repeatedly with the theme of the son and daughter working at home within the family.  One can accept that such persons would not be entitled to a long term of notice if it is decided they should no longer be employed. We are talking here about employment, not just about working.  We are talking about a contract&mdash;it may not be a written contract&mdash;and I wonder if we would not be doing something for the social health of such families and groups if, in fact, they were not excluded from the necessity to make the terms of employment known on request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator asked me to comment on this matter.  I would not be in favour at all of bringing in the conditions of employment that pertain as between an employer and his non-relative employees into family affairs.  This is something for which I would not like to legislate.  I do not think the son should have the right to demand from his father the conditions of his employment.  I do not believe we should go that far and I do not think it would help traditional good family relations.  We should, however, try to give members of a family certain rights which they could invoke in certain eventualities.  The same principle <Col N="51" /> applies to the case of insurability. Senators know that relatives are not insurable when they are employed by their fathers or certain other relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says this could be invoked in certain cases. My point is that it would be invoked only in those cases in which there was something wrong and in which the good tradition, of which the Minister has spoken, was notably absent.  If the Minister takes this attitude, should he not approach it by saying that such a situation of family relationship should be excluded from the definition of employment?  If we are going to say that this is employment&mdash;this is what we say in the section&mdash;then it should follow the rules of employment which we are now laying down.  If we wish to exclude them then it might be better to exclude them from the definition of &ldquo;employment&rdquo; rather than make a special case of them, as is done in subsection (1) (b).</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a point on which I would not disagree with the Minister.  Still on section 3 and still on subsection (1), but moving to paragraph (c), I would like the Minister to comment on the reasons why he included local authority employees but excluded civil servants.  The Minister commented briefly on this in his reply on the Second Stage, but he had not got much time available to him on <Col N="52" /> that occasion.  Nowadays the public service is essentially one employment. The direction in our legislation has been towards the promotion of mobility between all parts of the public sector yet here we are, in legislation, making a very distinct difference. This point was adverted to by Senator Owens on the last occasion on which we debated this Bill and I would be glad if the Minister could give us the reasons for reaching not just the decision to include one or exclude the other but, at the same time, to exclude the unestablished civil servants and to include local authority employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be chancing my arm on this, but the obvious reason possibly is that civil servants are already covered from the point of view of dismissal by their terms of employment and they have always enjoyed benefits that other employees did not have.  Local authorities employ people at all levels, such as labourers, storekeepers and manual workers.  It was for that reason it was decided not to exclude employees of local authorities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to press the Minister a little further on this.  He said that the exclusion of the Civil Service is justified on the grounds that civil servants already have the rights given under the Bill.  It is about 26 years since I was last a member of the Civil Service so I may be out of date on this particular <Col N="53" /> point but does this mean that, in fact, all unestablished civil servants have the right of notice given under section 4 of this Bill?  Is an unestablished civil servant, who has been employed for more than five years, entitled as of right to four weeks' notice?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the position is fairly clearly outlined in the Bill. Under clause (c) of subsection (1) it says: &ldquo;(other than in an unestablished position).&rdquo;  It is generally recognised that established civil servants already enjoy better conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions of employment of civil servants give them at least what is given here in section 4 of the Bill.  Is the Minister quite satisfied on this point?</P>

      <P>Under section 3 (2) the Minister has got very wide powers in regard to either the exclusion or inclusion of classes.  With regard to many of these powers, orders are subject to positive confirmation by this House.  On the other hand, we are enacting in this measure enabling legislation of quite wide scope.  I would like to ask the Minister if he has any immediate intentions in regard to inclusion or exclusion, or could he give us examples of the type of class he might, within the next few years, consider either excluding, under one of the subsections, or including under a later one?</P>

      <P>On subsection (4) of section 3, there is another omnibus provision, not quite as wide as the one referred to by Senator Alexis FitzGerald on the last Bill.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> ... may include such transitional and supplemental or other provisions...</P>
    <P>This is an interesting phrase.  We might well be inclined to say &ldquo;transitional and supplemental provisions necessary or expedient,&rdquo; in order to bring the Bill into effect.  However, here we have &ldquo;transitional and suplemental or other&rdquo;.  Though the laws governing construction might say that &ldquo;other&rdquo; is not completely open here, I wonder why it is necessary at all?  In addition, it says:</P>
    <P>... appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient.</P>
    <P>We consider a thing to be necessary or expedient for some particular purpose, the purpose is not specified here. If it said it was necessary for bringing the Bill smoothly into operation or for the better operation of the Bill that would be one thing: but &ldquo;as appear necessary or expedient to the Minister for any purpose&rdquo; verges towards an absolute discretion in regard to necessity or expediency.  Has the Minister any comment on that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <P>This seems to me a very wide power.  The Minister states that it is meant to deal with minor and transitional matters, but the section does not say so.  It says this and then goes on to widen it so much that it would not have mattered because the limitations already made are completely obliterated by the wider provisions of the remaining parts of the subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing on which I would agree with the Minister is the safeguard that it would have to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Senator Dooge remains suspicious of the word &ldquo;other&rdquo;.  He says this might be tied by certain rules. My experience is that interpretation can have pitfalls because there was one instance in which the Attorney General ruled that a motor-car was an animal under &ldquo;or other&rdquo;; it could be deemed to be included.  There was no reference to inanimate objects but the Attorney General took it that it included inanimate objects.  I would be suspicious of &ldquo;other&rdquo;, I must confess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the argument made by Senator Dooge.  This is a very wide discretion for a Minister under an omnibus clause.  I do not like the way in which it could be construed.  I do not think it is an adequate safeguard to provide that orders will be laid before both Houses.  I anticipate that during the next few years a very large number of orders will have to be laid before both Houses simply because we are creating this type of derogated legislation in practically every statute we pass. Therefore, the review may be a much less careful one than it might be and Parliament ought not allow this sort of omnibus discretion to be given to a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to put in the safeguard in the legislation itself that Orders cannot be made with such general discretions. Like Senator Dooge, and on top of this argument which I make both as a lawyer, looking at the very <Col N="56" /> wide wording, and as a member of the Committee on Statutory Instruments, I agree with Senator Sheldon that these words are open to very wide interpretations once they are on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) does not lose anything by being without the words &ldquo;or other&rdquo;.  What the Minister has said he is looking for is flexibility in relation to transitional and supplemental provisions. That he has got.  He has also got under section 5 the power to amend or revoke an Order.  He has got a great deal of flexibility in this section and the particular wording goes further than we ought to allow because of the possibility of its giving an unfettered discretion not only for what is necessary but for what is in the opinion of the Minister, expedient.  We do not accept the fact that the order must be scrutinised by the House as a sufficient safeguard because the experience has been that very often such orders are not looked at with the special care and attention they should get.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of subsequent review by the House, I welcome the fact that many of the provisions under the important sections of this Bill are subject to positive resolution here.  This is an improvement on what is happening in regard to certain other legislation.</P>

    <P>Nevertheless, there are severe limitations to this apart from the question of the House's own ability to pay attention to all the matters that come before it in this regard.  As I understand it, it is not possible to amend such an order so that, if the Minister comes forward with a provision for 20 things he wants to do, 19 of which are properly supplemental and incidental, the only alternative the House has is to vote against all 20 or accept all 20, because it agrees with 19, which are purely expedient and necessary for the purposes of the legislation agreed to by the House, but does not like the 20th, does not think it necessary and does not think it properly supplemental and incidental.  The Minister should think carefully about this. The easy thing to do is to enact it the <Col N="57" /> way it is here, but that is not a good thing to do.  The standard of our legislation suffers very much by this. If the Minister used the words &ldquo;transitional, supplemental and incidental&rdquo; instead of the words &ldquo;transitional and supplemental or other&rdquo;, I would be far happier about this section.  Would the Minister think about this between now and Report Stage?  I hope to put down an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to have to look at this.  The House should consider this type of subsection, and the power it proposes giving to the Minister, in the wider context of the whole Bill.  The Bill is calculated to give certain privileges to workers that have not heretofore been established legally.  Anything one may do in this direction is an improvement.  This is new legislation and undoubtedly it will uncover some flaws or anomalies.  I will be happy to come along to bring in new legislation for the sake of small modifications that may be required.  It is only wise and sensible to have a simple provision of this kind.</P>

Those three categories should be sufficient for what the Minister says he wants to do.  Perhaps the Minister would think over it and we could debate it on a subsequent Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The amendment seeks to ensure that any order made by the Minister under subsection (4) can only have the effect of increasing the notice to which an employee is entitled.  By the full process of legislation we are passing this Bill into law.  There are two main principles in the Bill one of which is enshrined in Section 4.  An employee is entitled to notice and as of this date we consider the amount of notice to which an employee is in general entitled if he falls within the included classes is what is given under subsection (2) of section 4.  The Minister provides in subsection (4) for a variation of this.  It would be inappropriate that he should vary this notice downwards, or reduce the entitlement of any employee by order even though that order has to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval by positive resolution.  We should provide that that subsection cannot be used to reduce the entitlement of an employee by making the amendment as suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The words proposed by the Senator in the amendment are unnecessary unless we overlook the whole spirit of the Bill. The word &ldquo;various&rdquo; means in this case invariably an upward adjustment. The whole spirit of the Bill is to ensure that the minimum is observed and that any adjustment should be upwards.  It <Col N="61" /> is written into the Bill that the terms of a contract which would make for lesser period of notice would be invalid. The terms of the Bill must prevail in spite of any contract which may be entered into.  This is something the Senator argued about in relation to my three words in the previous section. Nobody would cause this section to be changed in the belief that there would be a reduction in the minimum as laid down in the Bill.  This is taking a sledge hammer to kill a fly.</P>

      <P>No one is taking a sledge hammer to kill a fly: it is just the addition of half-a-dozen words proposed in the amendment to make the intention clear, which is in accordance with the spirit of those who have proposed this Bill to us.  I strongly support this amendment.  It is wrong for any Minister to have power to reduce the minimum period provided for in this section.  The Minister states that he does not wish it, so let him not take it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am merely stating we should have legislation which is in accordance with what is desired to be the law which the Minister tells us is his wish.  It should take appropriate form which would seem to be that which is suggested in the amendment before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference of opinion here about the spirit of this legislation.  The whole purpose of the Committee Stage of a Bill is to convert spirit as agreed on the Second Stage into letter as determined on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned with the letter of the law of subsection (4) of section 4. I intended to put down a very simple amendment which was to change the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; to &ldquo;increase&rdquo;.  If the Minister would accept that I would be happy.  My only worry is that the Minister might wish to amend subsection <Col N="62" /> (2) not by increasing the amount of notice but by reducing the service required in order to attain a given amount of notice.</P>
    <P>That is why what I have put down in this amendment may appear unduly long.  The intention behind the wording of the amendment is to allow the Minister to increase entitlement either by increasing the degree of notice to which a person is entitled or by reducing the period for which he would have to be employed in order to be entitled to a given degree of notice.  If the Minister wishes to bring into the Bill the intention of only using this in order to improve matters I suggest we should either, on this Stage by agreement or on Report Stage, strike out the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; and insert the word &ldquo;increase&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  We are not quibbling about words; it is a matter of substance.  I appreciate the Minister's view of the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; in this context may be an inevitable varying upwards but the word is not confined to that interpretation and would not be viewed in that way.</P>
      <P>During the Second Reading debate in the Seanad on 19th December, 1972, as reported in the Official Report at column 1377, the Minister explained some of the bargaining which took place to fix the minimum terms.  This did not seem to be as untouchable as it might.  I quote:</P>
      <P>Any criticisms Senators may have of the Bill and any amendments they may contemplate putting forward may be based on the fact that they may think the week's notice is too short on the lower end of the scale.  Employers may think the eight weeks is too long at the top of the scale.  We tried to get an optimum that would be reasonable.</P>
      <P>For that reason there is some substance in the fact that the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; might well mean that some future Minister might give in to pressure from employers that at the top of the scale the notice was too long and &ldquo;vary&rdquo; might well mean a change in the terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support this amendment as I would <Col N="63" /> not like to see the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; on the statute book in this context even though I accept the Minister's assurance that as he sees it &ldquo;vary&rdquo; will inevitably mean a varying upwards.  This is a minimal and intelligent amendment on Committee Stage to achieve the purpose about which we all agree&mdash; that any amendment ought to be an amendment upwards but that the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; has that possibility of not being an upward change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an open mind on the matter but I think it is ridiculous in view of the provisions already in the Bill for bringing orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas. An employer is also entitled to get notice.  This refers to employees only. If Senators insist I am prepared to change the wording but it would show a lack of faith in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

If there is clear agreement that this subsection would not be invoked except to increase the entitlement of the worker then the subsection should say so.  I would be grateful if the Minister would yield to our scruples in this regard. If I withdraw the amendment the Minister can perhaps consider the best way to amend it between now and the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Just a question here: section 6 is concerned with the right of the employer to notice.  I should like to ask the Minister in this particular regard what is the sanction of the employer.  If the employee does not give the requisite notice of one week, I take it that in every case wages would be owing to the employee from the employer.  I take it that what is likely to happen in such a case is that the employer would withhold wages in lieu of the one week's notice which had not been given.  I should like to ask if this section entitles him to do so and if this section has the effect of making it impossible for an employee to recover as a debt wages due; if we are creating a right on the part of the employer to be given at least the sanction of withholding wages up to an amount equivalent to the notice which has not been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeggyFarrell" hpid="Mrs. Farrell Mrs. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like clarification on this matter from the point of view of an employer.  We are concerned very much here with the notice which must be given to employees. There is another side to the story for which there is no legislation. Many employers may train people for long periods.  They spend time, money and effort on this.  Then one day they find their employees have gone.  Wages are not held over for a week.  If employees are paid by the week there is a custom in some firms that a person's wages are not paid and then he is paid the second week's wages.  Employees are now paid by the week to a greater extent. The employer has no redress whatever in law or elsewhere to come back at an employee for any loss he may suffer as a result of the employee walking out without notice. While we must ensure that all workers are safeguarded, employers are not all ogres.  They need a certain amount of protection also.  If they are not covered under this Bill I should like to see an Employers' Rights Bill coming in.  It is long overdue.</P>

      <P>Under this Bill the employee has to get notice of his conditions of employment.  He is aware that he is obliged to give a week's notice to his employer on leaving.  In regard to Senator Farrell's point regarding an employee who has been undergoing training to improve his skill and then walks off, this is a very common thing.  The employer would be stupid not to have a contract providing that when the trainee has reached the full pitch of his or her skill he or she will serve for a certain term of employment.  It is a loosely knit arrangement if there is no contract to ensure that there is a reciprocity on both sides.</P>

      <P>This Bill is intended to provide for minimum notices not to arrange contracts for people who will not make them themselves or who cannot enforce them. <Col N="66" /> We cannot expect to tie up the employees in every conceivable situation. We are simply providing the legislation that they at least get a week's notice and in certain cases as much as eight weeks' notice.  We do not propose writing into the Bill all sorts of terms of employment that may be enforceable.

      <P>We might as well pass to section 7 because the point overflows from section 6 to this section. The Minister has not raised any objection to this question of the withholding of payment.  Would the Minister object if section 7 were amended to allow the employer to withhold?  Section 7 subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Act shall operate to prevent an employee or an employer from waiving his right to notice on any occasion or from accepting payment in lieu of notice.</P>
      <P>This allows either of them to waive the right to notice.  It allows the employee to accept payment.  A simple amendment here would allow the employer to withhold payment.  Would the Minister have any objection if this section read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing in this Act shall operate to prevent an employee or an employer <Col N="67" /> from waiving his right to notice on any occasion or from accepting or withholding payment in lieu of notice.</P>
    <P>This would give a statutory right to the employer to withhold payment.  It would, miraculously, allow the Minister's Department to give a definite answer to a question.</P>

      <P>No, I think the question with regard to withholding the payment does not make sense, whatever about the legal phraseology. If somebody walks off and there is pay owing to him, he will not be paid for the time he did not work.  Payments are made weekly in 99 per cent of the cases.  In no case would there be a week's pay owing, unless the employee walked off before his pay-packet was handed to him on Friday. Most likely the employee goes to other employment after he is paid on the Friday.  There are no wages owing to him.</P>

      <P>Section 7, subsection (1), the right to waive notices, is a very necessary and convenient subsection.

      <P>Apparently it is necessary, if the position is not clear under section 6.  We may have an employer who is anxious to do the right thing.  He will be anxious to save himself money in respect of a person who has left him without the proper notice.  The conscientious employer might only wish to do this if it was his entitlement.  We are leaving the employer in the position that he does not know what he is entitled to <Col N="68" /> do.

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 is something which we should all like to see here.  One of the difficulties which would occur to anyone reading the section is the question of what is misconduct. Chapters of the history of industrial relations are devoted to the determination of what is misconduct on either side.  If we look back to section 1 we have no definition of misconduct. Is the question of misconduct now a matter which would be determined by reference to the Redundancy <Col N="69" /> Payment Appeals Tribunal under section 10?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly could not be argued that a definition of misconduct should be written into the Bill because it would be impossible to define.  One cannot argue that an employer must be left with no redress if he finds an employee with his hand in the till, or doing something which is gravely prejudicial to his employment or his employer.  This is contained in every Act in relation to employment. Misconduct does not carry with it any special privileges.  If an employer finds an employee is guilty of serious misconduct he has this redress or if an employee finds that an employer is guilty of some offence he also has the right to walk off the job.  We must have this provision in the Bill.  It can always be argued that it will be abused, that some employer will pretend that an employee is guilty of misconduct, but those who are familiar with the appeals tribunal will agree that they give a fair hearing in all cases.  If the people concerned are not satisfied they have the right of appeal to the High Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the type of point which I was going to develop.  I should like to refer the Minister back <Col N="70" /> to the equivalent section in the 1967 Redundancy Payments Act, that is section 14.  The Minister has indicated that the Redundancy Payments Tribunal is an appropriate body to determine whether or not there is misconduct. They would already determine this matter under the Redundancy Payments Act.  But this Act, in section 14, goes into much more detail in regard to the definition of misconduct than does section 8 of the Bill before us.  It says:</P>
      <P>...if his employer, being entitled to terminate that employee's contract of employment without notice by reason of the employee's conduct, terminates the contract because of the employee's conduct....</P>
      <P>It then gives three conditions.  It goes on in subsection (2) to refer to the effects of this particular condition when strikes occur.</P>
      <P>There is no dispute about a person being found with his hand in the till being guilty of misconduct but some employers consider going on strike as misconduct.  It should be necessary to give protection in regard to this.</P>
      <P>If it was thought necessary in the 1967 Act to spell out the question of misconduct in the detail which takes up a half-page of the Act, then we need something more than a single word or phrase in section 8.  One is struck by the difference between the very short reference to misconduct in section 8 of this Bill and the rather long reference to misconduct in section 14 of the Redundancy Payments Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <P>I could imagine somebody arguing this matter and drawing attention to the fact that <Col N="71" /> the Act of 1967 could be looked to. The fact that the language in the 1967 Act is not in this Bill would mean that the kind of misconduct to be examined might be of a different nature from that which would entitle the determination of the contract.

      <P>I should like to follow up Senator FitzGerald's point. If, in fact, we use the simple definition in this Act and the more complex definition in the 1967 Act, would not this tribunal, which spends most of its time dealing with questions under the 1967 Act, be very concerned with the fact that the Oireachtas has used the word &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; unadorned in this Bill before us?  It will see before it a reference to misconduct which is very different from the reference to misconduct in section 14 of the 1967 Act, take notice of this difference, interpret accordingly, and say that something which might not be misconduct under the 1967 Act, because of the limitations put into it, could well be taken as misconduct under this Bill when enacted.</P>

      <P>Contrary to what the Senator is saying, the fact that the absence of a more clearly set out definition of misconduct here would give rise to the feeling that a lower standard is required, I take the opposite view. The other Act will be likely to be cited as the one which lays down &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; if&mdash;and I do not believe for one moment that it does&mdash;it in any way defines &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; any clearer than it is defined in this Bill.  The only thing it does is to point out about strikes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It refers to strikes in subsections (2) and (3) but in subsection (1) it refers to the termination of a contract because of the employee's misconduct under the condition that the employer is entitled to terminate without notice by reason of misconduct. This is either defined in a contract or is in some way a right which an employer has under general conditions of employment.  I think there is a real difference in subsection (1).  If we look only at subsections (2) and (3) we can <Col N="73" /> say this is a question of strikes&mdash;this in itself is significant&mdash;but I think we must look at all three subsections of section 14 of the 1967 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  A person having two years continuous employment would not come under the Redundancy Act and he would still be entitled to his week's notice under this Act.  I still think that the section is adequate.  One could argue for a week over this but we must have the section. Senators will agree that one cannot define misconduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not agreed. We could say that we cannot define completely, categorically and comprehensively for all purposes what misconduct is, but the 1967 Act has given, perhaps not a definition, but a description which is a limiting description in contrast to the simple description in section 8 of this Bill.  These must be taken into account by the tribunal in dealing with these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>But the appeal to the tribunal is an appeal to it to deal with this matter on the basis of law. It deals with the words which we enact here.  It deals with appeals under the 1967 Act in accordance with the words we enacted in the 1967 Act. There is, throughout this Bill, a concordance with the provisions of the 1967 Act.  They are written to go together and are designed to interlock with one another.  The very fact that an appeal goes to the same tribunal is an indication of this.  We are allowing it to go with two different descriptions, definitions, or call them what you may. It is a serious point and perhaps we should leave it here.  The Minister said that we could discuss it for a very long time and perhaps we should all think about it between now and the next Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (4) to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) If after the date to which a statement furnished under subsection (3) of this section relates there is a change in the terms specified in subsection (1) of this section, the employer shall within one month after the change furnish to his employee a written statement specifying the particulars of such change.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Section 9 is concerned with written statements of terms of employment.  Subsection (1) provides that an employee may look at any time for a written statement in regard to certain important fundamental conditions of employment. Since he is entitled to do so at any time if there is a change in the conditions of his employment, he can ask for his new conditions and can receive, or can have his attention directed to, an acceptable statement of those conditions.  There is also, under subsection (3) of section 9, a provision that an employer shall, within one month after the taking up of employment, furnish to his employee a written statement giving the fundamental conditions of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the amendment seeks to do is to provide that, where there is a change in the fundamental conditions of employment only, in the matters which every employer must provide in a statement to his employee, and not in the supplementary matters which the Minister may require in subsection (2), that change should be notifiable to the employee.  If he is entitled to information on taking up employment I submit that he is equally entitled to information concerning a fundamental change in the terms of his employment and the matters specified are fundamental matters.  It might be argued that this would be an unreasonable imposition on the employer and, <Col N="75" /> accordingly, I put down amendment No. 3 which amends subsection (4), so that the employer in respect of this supplementary information can, in lieu of providing a statement for the employee, direct his attention towards a notice set out in an accessible place, which will indicate these particular changes.  This is something reasonable which we should ask to be done.  It is reasonable that these fundamental changes should be equally notifiable with the terms of employment on the date of first employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is unnecessary, with due respect to the good intentions of the Senator.  In the first place, conditions and terms are two different things.  An employer cannot change the terms of employment without doing so in consultation and in agreement with the employee.  The conditions are tangible and physical and, if he changes them, the employee must notice it immediately and must say: &ldquo;That was not in the conditions of my employment when I started work.&rdquo;  It is absolutely unnecessary to have the requirement about a change written in.  Apart from its being an imposition on an employer&mdash;we must not put too many burdens on an employer&mdash;and however easy it would be to direct his attention to a notice that would be conspicuously displayed, that is already provided for in the Bill with regard to terms and conditions.  If terms of employment are changed, this cannot be done unilaterally.  It must be done in agreement with the other party to the contract.  If the conditions are changed, the physical conditions are perfectly obvious to the employee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the Minister's argument, and I appreciate the force of it, as far as terms of employment are concerned these are terms to which an employee is entitled as a <Col N="77" /> matter of contractual right.  Consequently, they cannot be changed unilaterally by the employer.  However, the Minister seemed to indicate that the same position does not obtain as regards conditions of employment.  If the Minister concedes that, he is right to concede it.  Conditions of employment can obviously change for a variety of factors, some of which the employer himself, for one reason or another, may not be able to control.</P>
      <P>For example, in paragraph (d) of subsection (1) there is provision for the employee to obtain particulars of confirmation in respect of any terms or conditions relating to the hours of work or overtime.  For example, it could happen that if there was a disruption in the electricity services&mdash;as we had in this city not so very long ago&mdash;it would be necessary for, say, the management of a factory to rearrange times of work, in order to keep up production.  There the hours of work would be related to the conditions of employment that might be changed by reason of a factor which is broadly outside the control of the management.  If it were found that, having made the change in the first instance, because it was outside the control of management, it proved to be a very successful change, it might well be that the management would then decide that they would prefer to keep that change in hours.  Surely what is in question is conditions of employment rather than a term of employment.  If Senator Dooge's amendment also took into account the question of conditions, then I would see very strong force behind the idea of inserting this amendment into the Bill.</P>

      <P>If changes would take place unknown to the employee, I would be seriously perturbed that the Bill was remiss in this.  However, I have not the slightest doubt that it could not conceivably happen.  In the first place, paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) cover the main terms and conditions which must be communicated.  A change in these would be a fundamental change in the original notice to the employee: the date and commencement of his employment; the rate or <Col N="78" /> method of calculation of his remuneration; the length of the intervals between the times at which remuneration is paid, whether weekly, monthly or any other period; any terms or conditions relating to hours of work or overtime; any terms or conditions relating to holidays and holiday pay, incapacity for work due to sickness or injury and sick pay, and pensions and pension schemes; the period of notice which the employee is obliged to get and entitled to receive to determine his contract of employment or, if the contract of employment is for a fixed term, the date on which the contract expires.</P>
      <P>I think that covers it fairly adequately, without making it necessary for changes to be notified, which could not conceivably be done unknown to him anyhow, and which he has a right to ask for.</P>

      <P>In most cases these things would be known to the employee.  If the Minister commissioned the officials in the manpower office in his own Department to conduct a survey in any Irish industry and they went around and asked the workers on the shop floor what their conditions were under (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) I do not think they would get an accurate answer under all particulars.  One of the malaises of industry, not confined to this country, is the lack of the flow of information throughout the industrial working environment.  It is likely that most of these things will be known. It may well be that there are cases in which one group of employees have sought some particular improvement in their conditions.  They will be well aware that this is granted, but equally the other employees, to whom it would also be granted at the same time, are entitled to be informed of this.  I wonder if we are not leaving ourselves in the position, if we leave the section this way, that an employer can fulfil his obligations under this section by posting a notice, and that there is no obligation on him to keep that posted notice up-to-date, unless there is a demand from the employees.  We should not let it get to the stage where employees come along demanding <Col N="79" /> their rights.  We are already starting on the road towards industrial difficulty, and perhaps strife, when we get to that position.</P>
      <P>Substantial changes should be notified. If these things are to be posted under subsection (4) of this particular section, then this should be a posting not of out-of-date information but of up-to-date information.  It may well be that we could meet what we are trying to do here by amending subsection (4) to provide that a statement which is displayed in this way shall be kept up to date from time to time.  I feel there is a need for something in this regard.</P>

      <P>The important thing about this amendment is that what most likely will not be conveyed to the employee is the good news.  The bad news would not be relevant because he is only held by the terms of employment which were communicated to him in the first instance.  If he is not informed of the change it does not apply.  He is only bound by the terms he got but, as the Senator already pointed out, if something good is done, if he is given an extra fortnight's holidays and he is not told about it, then he is missing out on something.  This is most unlikely, and the amendment is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I should like to speak on subsection (4) of section 9, <Col N="80" /> which relates to the question of the posting of a statement to which the employee may be referred.  On the Second Stage I raised the question that many notices which must be posted according to statute in regard to safety and other matters are perhaps clearly legible, properly displayed, accessible to everyone on the first day on which they are posted, but they become grimed with the passage of time; there tends to be a re-arrangement of the equipment and furniture of the work place; and what was once a clearly legible, visible and accessible notice, becomes something in the corner which is illegible and inaccessible.</P>
      <P>I wonder if, in fact, what is here is sufficient because we say that the employee may be referred to a document which he has a reasonable opportunity of reading and which is reasonably accessible.  Is the Minister satisfied with this or does he feel that he should, perhaps in some regulations under this Bill lay down some conditions in regard to these particular notices? There are some conditions in regard to the display of safety notices that might be adapted here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask an ignorant question, if I may, on the section.  Am I correct in understanding the position to be that, under subsection (5), the employer is obliged within one month of the commencement of employment to furnish the particulars specified in the section but that, in addition to that obligation, he is under a further obligation, under subsection (1), to comply with the request for the particulars?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how much thought has been given to this but I can see this legislation not being enforced to a considerable extent in areas of employment. There will be employers who will not be readily able to formulate it, unless they get the assistance of some form, which the Minister may prescribe by order, which would indicate clearly how they were to comply with the requirements of this section from time to time.  If it is to be made a living reality, and it is desirable to do so &mdash;but I see great difficulties about <Col N="81" /> the whole thing in large areas of employment&mdash;assistance will have to be given to people and a form prescribed to be filled in by the employer who will know what he is doing.  What is done in a situation where a person is employed on probation and what is the length of employment?  Does he say that a person is employed for a period of three months subject to probation and then what happens if the employer formally confirms the employment and certain terms follow? People will need assistance in establishing exactly what their relationship with their employee is or ought to be.</P>
    <P>This is important also with regard to section 10 which contains this rather important matter of criminal offence.  I should like to make a glancing reference to section 10 in relation to section 9.  If a person asked me what date I took Mr. A, B, into employment I would be astonished to discover it was twice as long ago as I thought it was.  Some employers will have difficulty in actually giving a correct set of particulars. If that is to be a criminal offence, we will have to have favours put in to protect people in relation to that.</P>
    <P>Unlike Senator Dooge, who has obviously studied this very well, I had not thought of subsection (4) as being a document which could be published, because if you are employing a lot of people in a certain kind of employment one of the great difficulties is that you do not want one half to know what the other half are getting.</P>
    <P>I was not thinking of a notice which would be available for inspection by all.  It would be impossible for a busy businessman to summarise a pension scheme for an employee.  I was thinking in terms of subsection (4), being able to comply with the requirements in relation to a pension scheme by saying: &ldquo;The pension scheme in subsection (1) (e) (iii) is available for inspection at a certain place&rdquo;.  If that were so it should be stated in subsection (4) &ldquo;specifying the particulars, or any of them, requested by an employee <Col N="82" /> under this section&rdquo;.  These remarks are intended to be helpful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Senator, with regard to notice not being given, I agree that notices put up in garages and factories are not legible after a year or so.  Once the employee gets a notice referring to them that is a direction telling him where to go.  I should like to point out to Senator FitzGerald that it is not necessary to draw the attention of employees in that way to the terms of employment.  It can be given separately to each employee in writing without having any notice posted.  The section states the employer may refer them to the notice.  We must think of the person who has one man employed, such as a lorry driver, who would not have a big notice displayed.</P>
      <P>The point was raised about employers not knowing their obligations or how these would be communicated to them.  There are six fundamental paragraphs, (a) to (f) in section 9 which must be communicated.  The contacts we have through the insurance contributions system could be availed of to see that this notice is in the hands of every employer.  That is not a statutory requirement but we will undertake by every conceivable means to get the requirements of this legislation through to employers.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister deal with another point made by Senator FitzGerald in relation to subsection (4) which provides that a statement furnished by an employer under subsection (3) may in lieu of specifying particulars requested by the employee refer the employee to a document which contains those particulars?  If a case arises where an employee seeks the entire particulars set out in paragraphs (a) to (f) of section 9 and some of those particulars are contained in a document and the employer opts under subsection (4) to refer the employee to that document, is that sufficient compliance? The wording of subsection (4) is somewhat ambiguous.  If the reference is to a document which contains some only of the particulars required there is still an obligation on the employer to furnish the statement under <Col N="83" /> subsection (3) in respect of the remaining particulars.</P>

      <P>I should like to follow up that point.  It is clear from subsection (4) as it stands that this refers to a single document.  In regard to pension schemes, for example, it is clear that this single document which is the subject of subsection (4) would state that the pension entitlements are set out in another document.  This would meet the requirements of subsection (4).  Would it then be necessary to ensure that this document referred to for the purpose of finding out the details should itself be accessible?  This is part of the general problem of all of the particulars being accessible, and the question of the reference to a single document in relation to all the particulars. It might be necessary to look at the various subsections from that point of view.</P>

Has he purged himself completely of the offence?  A more reasonable case might be if on demand he fails to provide it and is fined for this offence and still does not provide it.

      <P>This section worries me from two points of view.  The first is the point referred to by Senator Dooge.  On first reading of the section it would seem that if an employer refuses to furnish the particulars there is a once and for all penalty of £25 on summary conviction.  Possibly the way to deal with that would be to provide for continuing daily penalty in the event of the employer failing to furnish the information notwithstanding the decision of the court and the fine imposed.</P>
      <P>The second point which worries me is that this appears to be the creation of a statutory offence.  The mere failure to comply with the provisions of section 9 to furnish a statement is in itself an offence punishable by means of a fine on summary conviction. I want to put to the Minister the case where there is a <i>bona fide</i> mistake made, where the employer is not culpable, am I right in supposing that even though he is not culpable, even though he has failed to comply with the provisions of section 9 on account of a genuine mistake, he is still committing an offence under section 10 for which he is liable to be fined £25?  I would prefer if this section had been worded to meet the case of an employer who knowingly fails or fails without just cause.  It worries me a bit as it stands.</P>

The query I am putting to the Minister is that, if a statutory offence is created, am I correct in thinking that once a summons is brought and it is proved in court that a statement of particulars was not given that is sufficient?  The court must then convict or is this a case where <i>mens rea</i> is involved and where it would be necessary for the prosecution <Col N="85" /> to prove guilty intent on the part of the defendant?</P>

One could think of a situation where he deputed this job to a particular employee who failed to do it; or he thought he had made arrangements and found he had not; or the employee managed to avoid receiving what they desired to furnish him with.

      <P>We discussed briefly on an earlier section this question of lay-off.  Paragraph 3 of the First Schedule is the relevant one.</P>
      <P>A lay-off shall not amount to the termination by an employer of his employee's service.</P>
      <P>It becomes very important to determine exactly what a lay-off is.  If we go back to section 1, we say that a a &ldquo;lay-off&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by the Act of 1967.  When we look at the Act of 1967 we find that a &ldquo;lay-off&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 11 (1).  When we eventually get to section 11 (1) we find the definition, and the key part of this particular definition is:</P>
      <P>that it is reasonable in the circumstances for that employer to believe that the cessation of employment will not be permanent.</P>
      <P>We have not too many misgivings about the question of a <i>bona fide</i> lay-off. That is one in which the employer, not only reasonably in the sight of the law but honestly in the light of his conscience, believes that the lay-off will not be permanent.  I presume that the question of whether it is reasonable will be a matter to be determined by the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal so that that matter would be determined by them.</P>
      <P>What is the position if an employer mistakingly believes that a cessation of employment will be permanent? The actual lay-off itself was a genuine one at the time at which the employment ceases&mdash;the employer at that time honestly believed that he would be able to re-employ.  If this does not turn out to be the case, what is the position?  Does it cease to be a lay-off?  Does the employee then become entitled to payment in lieu of notice because what appeared to be a genuinely temporary lay-off was actually a dismissal?  I see some difficulty in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this point on section 1 when I referred particularly to local authorities.  I am not satisfied that men who are employed by a local authority continuously for a period of three to five <Col N="91" /> years and paying superannuation, because the amount of grants coming from the Department were able to keep them in employment, are suddenly laid off by the engineering section due to increases in wages, materials and machinery costs.  I consider this action a dismissal, though the Minister has a better term for it in &ldquo;lay-off&rdquo;.  In many cases these people are disemployed around 1st January.  As this is nearing the end of the financial year, they are still unemployed by the local authority until the beginning of the next financial year, after the 1st April.</P>
      <P>These people are entitled to be regarded as employees.  They have been in service up to five years.  They are paying superannuation.  It is most unfair that the local authority should get away with this as a lay-off.  It is only a temporary lay-off, therefore they do not come within the ambit of this Bill.  Can we expect those people to wait around for three months and then find, perhaps due to mechanisation or some other reason, that they may not be re-employed? Then the position referred to by Senator Dooge arises.  Are those people then entitled to their notice with pay in the same way as other employees under this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we are wandering into a discussion of the Redundancy Act rather than a discussion on this Bill which deals mainly with minimum notice of employment and termination of employment. If a man is laid off work or ceases to be available for work for seasonal or other reasons he may have got notice and he may not be entitled to anything.  He may only be entitled to notice that as of next week he will not be in employment until certain things happen.  One has to thread very warily on this matter because we are inclined to think mainly of fixed industrial employment but there are many kinds of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can visualise the fishing industry where men are employed on three shifts a day processing fish in processing <Col N="92" /> factories, but the following month there may not be an hour's work available there because of a shortage of fish.  This can be intermittent and irregular employment through no fault of anybody but governed by weather conditions and the availability of the relevant commodity.  This also happens in harvesting operations in relation to crops and so on.  We must be very careful not to put people into straitjackets in relation to all types of employment. The provision contained here is the best we could do in the circumstances and the least we could do in order not to be unduly severe on people who find themselves in a seasonal trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister has said in connection with employments of that kind, but I am referring to people who have been employed for two years.  Under section 4 of this Bill employees with two years or more but less than five years' employment are entitled to two weeks' notice.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If they do not get the two weeks' notice they are entitled to two weeks' payment.  This does not happen so far as local authorities are concerned.  Why are those employees excluded from this Bill?  They very rarely get the two weeks' notice.  They are usually told on Tuesday or Wednesday that there is no more money in the fund and they cannot be retained beyond the end of the week.  Consequently, they can be unemployed for three months.  The Minister has referred to that situation as a &ldquo;lay-off&rdquo;. Those people are entitled to either two weeks' notice or two weeks' payment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>You could not possibly legislate for unforeseen situations <Col N="93" /> of lay-offs which could result in being permanent and actually turn out to be termination of employment.  One can visualise many cases where workers would be laid-off and not be re-employed for months.  In those cases the workers would be entitled to claim redundancy under the Redundancy Act.  At the same time the employer could not predict whether he would want them the following week. This happens in many types of employment and we must make allowance for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>My trouble is that we may have two cases, quite parallel.  In one case the employer can estimate the future accurately.  He says to his worker: &ldquo;I am sorry, I have no work for you.  Things are bad and they are not going to become any better.&rdquo; This worker is entitled to notice or payment in lieu.  The other man, in exactly the same position, works for Mr. Micawber.  Mr. Micawber says to him: &ldquo;I am sorry, I have no work for you for the next month but I am quite sure business is going to pick up and I will be able to re-employ you.&rdquo;  As I read it, that is a lay-off under the definition which was imported from the 1967 Act into this Bill.  For this condition, Mr. Micawber says: &ldquo;I have reasonable grounds for thinking that something will turn up in a month's time and I will be able to re-employ you&rdquo; and that man is not entitled to his notice nor entitled to payment in lieu.  This man is suffering a loss of right compared to the other man just because he works for Mr. Micawber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trouble here is that the definition of &ldquo;lay-off&rdquo; is defined completely in terms of what happens when the man stops working for the employer. It should be possible to get over this difficulty by saying in the Schedule &ldquo;A lay-off shall not amount to the termination by an employer of his employee's service unless the employee who has been laid-off is not re-employed within two years, three years or five years.&rdquo;  We should make some provision for his case; otherwise an inequity will arise because of the fact that there is reasonable ground to say at the time &ldquo;I am sure business <Col N="94" /> is going to pick up and I will be able to re-employ you&rdquo; and this person would not get a payment in lieu of notice to which he is otherwise entitled. I do not know whether the appeals tribunal would find Mr. Micawber to be unreasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing there are reasonable grounds and it is, in every sense, a genuine lay-off but something intervenes and the employer's hopes are proved to be false, what is the position in that case if you do not amend the Schedule as suggested by Senator Dooge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very genuine case.  This is why I do not want to tighten up this section and make it imperative or mandatory on persons to clearly state to the employee whether he is being laid-off or whether he is being given notice of termination of employment.  If I did so it could very easily react to the disadvantage of the employee under present circumstances. If &ldquo;lay-off&rdquo; and &ldquo;termination of employment&rdquo; are clearly defined in the Bill we will put the employer in the position where he will take no risk and when there is a lay-off he will just say: &ldquo;You are getting a week's notice now.&rdquo;  This man would prefer a lay-off because the lay-off carries with it continuity of employment.  When he claims, at some stage in his life, redundancy payments he must prove continuity of employment.  Termination of employment is a serious matter for him.  His employment has been terminated, he has been re-employed but he has not got the continuity necessary to give him the advantage of the Redundancy Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The case I am trying to make is that if you are going to more clearly define &ldquo;lay-off&rdquo; and &ldquo;termination of employment&rdquo; here, the employer will opt for the easier course.  Even though he may expect to <Col N="95" /> be taking back the worker in a fortnight or three weeks' time he will take the easier course by giving him a week's notice which then can be regarded as termination of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another difficulty.  If a man is laid off he may be told by his employer: &ldquo;I have no employment for you for the next month or six weeks.&rdquo;  That man signs up at the employment exchange on the following Monday.  Perhaps he signs for five weeks and there is no sign of a job turning up.  He is told at the employment exchange that there was a man looking for workers for a building site and he is asked: &ldquo;Are you prepared to go there?&rdquo;  If that man goes there, what is the position of his employer who laid him off?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided he did not get the week's notice, of course. The point the Senator is missing is that with lay-offs it is quite easy to give a week's notice; even there a man can protect himself both ways.  An employee can be told: &ldquo;You will be laid off next Monday week.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would not like to write into the Bill that he must be compelled, because it says now that it is of great importance to the employee to preserve his continued employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect the Minister to do that but the point I am making is that an individual employer, such as a farmer or a small business contractor, will usually give a man a week's or a fortnight's notice. I am speaking about the big employer, <Col N="96" /> like a local authority.  The ganger comes from the engineer's office and says to the men: &ldquo;I am sorry, but your employment will be terminated on Friday next.&rdquo;  There is no week's notice there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>While listening to Senator Fitzgerald's contribution with regard to the local authorities a point occurred to me.  He referred to a superannuation worker who would be informed by the ganger that he was being laid off, and Senator Fitzgerald says that he should get notice or get payment in lieu of notice.  If he accepts payment in lieu of notice, instead of being laid off work, at his own request, he forfeits all his superannuation rights. If you are sacked from a job, your superannuation goes with you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if you are sacked for an offence.  If you are sacked because your employer has no money, it is a different story.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill, if a worker goes to the county council and says: &ldquo;I want either a fortnight's notice or money in lieu of it&rdquo; and if the county council say: &ldquo;Very well, we will give you a fortnight's pay in lieu of the notice&rdquo;, in my opinion he has converted himself from the lay-off to a dismissed worker, and his superannuation goes with him.  It is well known to anybody connected with county council operations that if a person is sacked or dismissed he forfeits his superannuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot follow Senator Honan's argument at all.  The point I am making is that a man has <Col N="97" /> been working for two, three or five years, and then, due to circumstances over which he has no control, finds that he is laid off.  &ldquo;Laid off&rdquo; is a nice term&mdash;in other words, he is not dismissed, but he is unemployed for three months, perhaps, before he can be re-employed by the local authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The continuous service of an employee in his employment shall <Col N="98" /> not be broken by the dismissal of the employee by his employer followed by the immediate re-employment of the employee.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister how can one interpret &ldquo;immediate re-employment&rdquo; here?  If one goes as usual to the 1967 Act, with which this Bill is linked, one finds in section 9 some concern with the question of dismissal and re-employment, but cannot find a single clear meaning of &ldquo;immediate&rdquo;.  In section 9 of the 1967 Act there are references to employment on a Monday, where dismissal has taken place on the previous Friday, Saturday or Sunday. There are also references to re-employment within four weeks. Which can be taken as the definition of continuity in the case of this Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular paragraph strengthens what I have already been trying to say and is based on the sanctity of this whole question of continuity.  It is put in for the purpose of a situation where termination takes place.  Next day the employer may find that he can take this man back.  Perhaps somebody else says: &ldquo;I want to go off, I am finishing&rdquo;.  In that case the employer might take back the man he had paid off the previous day.  This is to ensure that he gets this continuity.</P>

      <P>Is it the next day, or is it within the period of notice, or within four weeks, which is mentioned?  What does &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; mean?  I agree entirely with the Minister that it is most important. However, it is most important that we should be clear that the tribunal which may have to arbitrate in a dispute should be clear as to the meaning of &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; in this particular paragraph.</P>

      <P>On that paragraph I thought of two situations which might not be covered.  The word &ldquo;transferred&rdquo; contemplates a definite life time passing of a trade or business from one person to another.  It does not take into account the case of transmission where a trade or business might be left by a father to his son, or any other transmission by operation of law which might not be a transfer.  I presume the continuity of service is intended to be preserved if a man is employed for a few years by a father who then leaves his business to his son and continues to be employed by the son.  Presumably although he had two employers it is intended that there should be continuity of service between the two.  The wording in this Bill does not take care of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a person who is not <Col N="100" /> employed in a trade or business but who is employed domestically or privately and who is employed at one stage by one member of the family and at another stage by another and whose employment may never have been terminated, I presume that the continuity of the service of that employee is intended to be preserved for the purposes of determining what that employee's rights should be with respect to the notice to be given under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Is there a claim under this Bill against the estate of a deceased employer?  Would a claim arise against the estate of a deceased employer?  I take a different view from that of Senator FitzGerald on this.  In the second type of case to which he refers&mdash;personal service to an individual&mdash;if the employer dies and the employee remains on in the same or a similar capacity with another member of the family, I imagine it would be regarded as a new contract of service with the new person.  I am not clear on whether that is intended or not.</P>

      <P>Section 7 does that. If there is a transfer of the business an employee can continue to work there. For instance in the case of a public-house, it might be sold to somebody or transferred or it might change hands and if the same staff remain on they have continuity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">

      <P>...where a change occurs (whether by virtue of a sale or other disposition or operation of law)....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here there is a definite attempt to cover the categories which Senator FitzGerald is trying to ensure are <Col N="101" /> covered in paragraph 7.  It might be worth looking at.</P>

      <P>In relation to this paragraph, if a trade or business is transferred from one person to another are there any conditions laid down that if a firm intend closing down a section, are they expected to notify the Department of Labour or the Department of Industry and Commerce?  If in the event of any company or firm intending to take over, or setting about taking over another company, are they required to lay down any conditions of continuity of employment?  I have a particular paper-making firm in mind which has closed down in south County Dublin.  The conditions under which it was taken over were most unsatisfactory and the manner in which it was closed down later on was most unsatisfactory also.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister what is intended here?  Looking at it from the point of view of a purchaser of a business <i>vis-a-vis</i> the vendor, if we are to have a situation in our legislation where a purchaser purchasing a business is given to understand that he is also taking on all the employees of the vendor, whether he likes it or not, that would have a depressing effect on sales of businesses.  That is probably not intended. If by reason of the sale of a business the vendor is required to dispense with the services of any of the employees before handing over to the purchaser, the employee will have his rights under the Redundancy Act, 1967, but is there a danger that paragraph 7 of this Schedule will impose on the purchaser, while purchasing the business, the obligation to take over all the employees of that business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I remember the position under the Redundancy Act is that he has an option.  If the place is changing hands and he wishes to have continuity of employment he could continue with the rights he had but if he is going to have it regarded as a termination, his previous employer must pay him the lump sum which is due under redundancy and from there on his rights <Col N="102" /> are dated from the day he started with the new employer.</P>
      <P>He is actually gaining something but he has to build up his future rights again.  The same would apply to the notice under this Bill.  If he is six years employed and entitled to have X number of weeks notice and if he is given the necessary number of weeks notice or pay in lieu of them and if at the end of that time he starts work again with the new employer he is starting as he originally commenced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <P>What safeguards have a section of workers if they are employed by a firm about to be taken over and possibly taken over from the point of view of being closed down?  Have they any rights or powers to negotiate in an instance like that?  In relation to the case I have mentioned there were a number of workers employed for 30 and 40 years there who were still young people.  The whole parish is unemployed as a result of the action taken by this firm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has nothing to do with that situation.  We are discussing minimum notice.  If a firm took over another firm with the intention of closing it down we would be obliged to give them the requisite notice of termination of employment. They would have no redress after that. They would have certain rights on redundancy but we are not discussing that here.</P>
      <P>The last time I was in Brussels the Council of Ministers were discussing the bringing in of future regulations dealing with what they call &ldquo;collective dismissals&rdquo; in order to ensure that no firm would close down unexpectedly. Long notice would be given and time taken to examine whether it should close at all.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 8 is concerned with the question of the <Col N="103" /> definition of full-time working.  The Minister has given himself a great deal of flexibility in the Bill but this question of 21 hours appears rather firm. In the British Act of 1963 the period of 21 hours is one of the specific things in this much shorter Act which the appropriate Minister is enabled to amend simply by regulation.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister power to amend this in the Schedule to this Bill?  As working hours became shorter in the future the relationship of the 21 hours to the full working week would become distorted and some amendment would be necessary.  Is this amendment possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty here is that the Minister has specifically taken power in subsection (4) of section 4 to vary in the sense of increase, as we are agreed, the notice which must be given.  He can alter the general entitlement.</P>
      <P>He also has power elsewhere to bring certain classes of persons within the Bill.  I do not know whether he could bring in the class of persons who work between 18 and 21 hours, with the Schedule still standing as it does.  How does the Minister amend the Schedule? Having specifically taken the power under section 4 (4) to vary the Schedule it might be as well in section 4 (4) to say that the Minister may vary the minimum period of notice specified in subsection (2) or vary the number of hours referred to in paragraph blank of the Schedule.  Having mentioned one it might be desirable to mention the other.</P>

      <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that Senator Alexis FitzGerald and Senator Dooge are right in this.  Earlier I had a look at section 3 (4) and thought it was in <Col N="105" /> terms so general that it would give the Minister power to make an order amending the Schedule.  On looking at it again I am not sure that that is the correct interpretation.  Section 3 (4) states: &ldquo;an order made by the Minister under this section may include such transitional and supplemental...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As Senator Dooge pointed out, any order up to this point must be either transitional or supplemental.  It then goes on: &ldquo;or other provisions as may appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient&rdquo;.  Nowhere does it refer to an amendment of the Schedule or anything else.  He may make an order dealing with a matter which is transitional or supplemental to a provision in the Bill or supplemental to an order already made.  An order may include other provisions as appear to the Minister to be necessary and expedient.</P>
      <P>That clearly means that &ldquo;other&rdquo; is being used in the sense of additional provisions not in the sense of amending a provision already there.  The Minister should have another look at this.</P>

      <P>I undertook to look at some matters on which questions arose to see if any changes in the wording should be considered.  I will do so. In this legislation we must visualise the worst type of employer and employee.  The good employer and employee will have no problem.  In drafting legislation one has to keep the other type in mind.  The Bill is legalising what is already the actual position.  Good firms give better notice than what is being prescribed in the Bill.  At least it sets out the minimum.</P>
