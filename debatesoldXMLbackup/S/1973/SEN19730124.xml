      <P>The only point I wish to make is one of clarification on a matter raised by Senator Alexis FitzGerald on Committee Stage.  The point raised related to section 5 of the Bill in relation to the Companies Act, 1963, and the priority of payment of contributions under the Social Welfare Acts in the winding-up of companies has been examined.  The parliamentary draftsman has been consulted in the matter and has confirmed that the provisions of section 285 of the Companies Act, 1963, would apply to pay-related contributions under section 5 of this Bill as drafted and that no amendment is necessary.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald expressed some concern as to whether this summarily superseded those provisions but I am assured, after asking for an examination of the <Col N="282" /> matter, that that is not the case.  The same provisions apply in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the procedure is in relation to this matter.  I said that this should not take more than two minutes on the next sitting and I do not propose to exceed that time.  I raised this point on section 5, which purported to amend section 58, subsections (1) and (2), of the 1952 Act and expressed the view that the effect of section 285 (3) (c) of the Companies Act was to repeal, by implication, subsections (1) and (2) of that section and the amendment of section 58 by section 5 would be to purport to amend something which had already disappeared.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister has taken advice on the point and is satisfied that the full priority which is given to other contributions will adhere to the contribution in relation to the pay-related benefit.</P>

      <P>Before we take up consideration of the Report Stage of this Bill, I should like to indicate that I have ruled amendment No. 7, in the names of Senator Alexis FitzGerald and Senator Dooge, out of order.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 27 and 28, to insert &ldquo;&lsquo;misconduct&rsquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 14 of the Act of 1957&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment stands in the names of Senator Dooge and myself.  I do not think it is possible to make a case for the amendment of section 1, which is proposed by this amendment, without inviting the attention of the House to section 8 of the Bill, the language therein used and the language used in section 14 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, which is the Act of 1967 referred to in the Bill and in the amendment.  Section 8 of the Bill contains the very proper, acceptable and understandable provision that nothing in this Act relative to provision for minimum notice should affect the right of any employer or employee to terminate the contract of employment without notice because of misconduct by the other party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not proposed by the terms of this amendment to decide what, in fact, is for the law courts to decide in any given case&mdash;what would be tantamount to misconduct&mdash;but to collect and appropriate to section 8, through an interposed definition in section 1, the language of section 14 of the Redundancy Payments Act of 1967, which makes clear, for the purposes of my argument, two points: (1) that the misconduct which here is envisaged, and which is to remain as a justification of a right on the part of the employer or on the part of the employee, be such misconduct as would entitle the one or the other to terminate contract of employment without notice. It could be argued with regard to any construction of this section that this was the only kind of misconduct which the section had in mind&mdash;misconduct which gave rise to a right.  If we could look at one Act only we would be <Col N="284" /> concerned to make the point which is being made in this amendment, were it not for the fact that we can look&mdash; and it would be advisable for the court to look&mdash;at another Act in relation to the interpretation of this Act.</P>
    <P>Some lawyer could argue that here there is another type of misconduct being envisaged, something more extensive than the type of misconduct which would under section 14 be in mind when they talk about such misconduct as would entitle the employer to terminate the contract of the employee; (2) there is a distinct, deliberate and clear saver with regard to redundancy rights in section 14 for such misconduct as might be seen by one party to a contract as being the proper legal description of the conduct of the other party when that other party goes on strike.  Under section 14, there is a clear saver so as to preserve the right to redundancy payment where there is a strike, which, were it not for the provisions of section 14, could in law constitute legal misconduct entitling the other party to terminate the employment.</P>
    <P>We have a situation under which the redundancy payment rights are preserved by the language of section 14 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, if the employee is on strike, whereas the right to minimum notice and the right to other payments in lieu, or all other rights under the Minimum Employment Act are not saved by express terms in the language of section 8 or in an appropriate definition such as is sought to be offered for acceptance to the House in this amendment.  Therefore, we can have the position that a statute is proposing to confer two different types of rights on the employees.  In the one case the right stand preserved if he is on strike; in the other case the right may not stand preserved.  Logically, it does not appear to make sense or does not appear to be a proper type of argument.</P>
    <P>I hope I do not sound legalistic on this, but if you happen to be a lawyer it is very hard to avoid sounding legalistic.  If there is a second right, the fact that that second right may be in most, if not all, material circumstances <Col N="285" /> of less value than the other, does not mean that it ought not to be preserved in the same circumstances in which the other right, the right that is more valuable materially, is preserved. I do not think that the Minister or anyone in the House is really in a position to assess all the different types of circumstances, where we have, for example, as is contemplated, in an employment situation where there is continuous service for 15 years or longer, an eight-week right to notice.  We cannot in all circumstances&mdash;perhaps the Minister may be able to contradict me flatly on this&mdash;and covering every case, say that anybody entitled to eight weeks' notice under section 4 will have by virtue of that right to eight weeks' notice a lesser right than he would have to the redundancy payment provision under the Redundancy Payment Act, 1967, as amended by the 1971 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment, for the reasons given.  It is necessary that we insert the more precise definition of the use of the word &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; in section 8.  A very good way of doing this is the amendment suggested, that we do so by reference to the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967.  This is necessary because, under the actual wording of section 8, it provides that nothing in this Act shall affect the right of any employer or employee to terminate a contract of employment without notice, because of misconduct by the other party.  As Senator FitzGerald has pointed out, there is no criteria by which we can determine what is meant by &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; here. In view of the fact that we do not have any provision for unfair dismissal in our legislation, it is important that we define, very carefully, the meaning of &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; here.  I am informed&mdash;and here I picked the brains of the lecturer in labour law in Trinity College&mdash;that we are the only country in the European Community that does not have provision for unfair dismissal.  Therefore, it is even more important that we have precision in the meaning of words such as &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; when they are <Col N="286" /> inserted into legislation.  I should like to support this amendment for that reason and also for the reasons given by Senator FitzGerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes that &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; should be defined in the same terms as defined in section 14 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967.  I should like to point out that section 14 of the 1967 Act does not, in fact, define &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo;.  Subsection (1) speaks of an employee who has been dismissed by an employer who is entitled to terminate that employee's contract of employment without notice by reason of the employee's conduct.  There is no definition of what is the kind of conduct that would justify an employer taking that course of action.</P>
      <P>Subsections (2) and (3) exempt from this provision strikes which take place in certain circumstances.  The only inference as regards misconduct that could be drawn from these exceptions is that going on strike is probably the kind of conduct that would justify an employer summarily terminating the contract of employment. If this were not so, there would be no need to make special provision for any kind of strike. Strikes are a refusal to operate the contract, usually coupled with a demand to change it.  Most people consider that a refusal to operate the contract would strike at its roots, naturally.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 4 of the First Schedule provides that for the purpose of the Bill, a strike will not, of itself, terminate the contract.</P>
      <P>In view of this, I must reject the proposed amendment.  The tribunal would have no difficulty at any time in deciding this issue if there was any doubt.  As I have already stated on Committee Stage, to define misconduct would be a difficult undertaking in the context of the Bill.  The position must remain as it is in all Bills.  There must be exception taken to cases where misconduct occurs, otherwise there could be anomalous situations where it would be impossible for an employer to carry on.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that we are the only country in the European Community which has no provision for unfair dismissal, which would be important in relation to the free movement of workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no specific Act dealing with the matter as such but it is frequently dealt with in our courts of common law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there is a gap in the common law in that you cannot get compensation for unfair dismissal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am entitled to observe by way of reply to the Minister that, while there is no express definition, nor did the draftsmen of this amendment think there was such an express definition of misconduct, by the adoption of the language of section 14, when identified the type of misconduct is misconduct entitling the party to terminate.  By adopting the language of section 14 it preserved the position that the right to notice under section 4 of this Bill is not lost through going on strike just as the redundancy right is not lost by going on strike under section 14.  If the language stands, as the Minister proposes it should, it would be correct to assume &mdash;and the tribunal must accept this&mdash; that if an employee goes on strike it will be considered as misconduct and result in the employer being justified in terminating employment and not giving the notice provided for under section 4 even though the tribunal will be obliged to see that the employee's redundancy rights are preserved by virtue of the language of section 14.  I regret the Minister's decision on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already pointed out, paragraph 4 of the First Schedule states clearly that a strike will not of itself terminate a contract.  That should be a sufficient safeguard as far as the Senator's anxieties may be concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the definitions in this Bill are in the main designed to correspond with the definitions in the 1967 Redundancy Act, we must keep in mind <Col N="288" /> when discussing this Bill that from a purely academic or technical point of view the two Acts seek to do different things.  This Bill of Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment is one where an employee will seek to get his statutory period of notice laid down in the legislation which we are endeavouring to pass, whereas in the Redundancy Act of 1967, in many cases, it would suit his purpose to have his employment terminated so that he may pursue his right to redundancy. We should not try to seek analogies between the purposes of the two Acts which are diametrically opposed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 28, to delete &ldquo;supplemental or other&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;other supplemental and incidental&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case for this amendment was well made by Senator Dooge, in whose name, with my own, the amendment stands, on Committee Stage, when he pointed out that the words &ldquo;or other&rdquo; may mean that the order the Minister may make under subsection (iv) might be orderly under the section even though they were neither transitional nor supplemental; that it would be open to the Minister, in the view expressed by him on Committee, to include provisions which he regarded as necessary and expedient even if they were not transitional or supplemental. I do not propose to say much on this matter except to remind the Minister that he said he would have a look at the point.  The amendment which is before the House may recommend itself to him.  It should, with regard to the extensive provisions for variation of this Bill which are contained throughout it by ministerial order and the undesirability&mdash;a view shared by Members of this House&mdash; of an excessive delegation of power to legislate by ministerial order, particularly in regard to the practical point that when we have an order <Col N="289" /> before us for consideration under this Bill that if it contains a number of different items&mdash;and we like four out of five&mdash;there is no provision whereby we can amend that order.  So, we may effectively have given over to the Minister the power to do this, even if the House does not like what he is proposing to do with regard to a particular matter or if it happens to like what he is proposing to do with regard to a number of other matters.  In any case, as we know from practice, no ministerial order ever gets that kind of useful debate about its contents which hopefully a Bill should get.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section says:</P>
      <P>An order made by the Minister under this section may include such transitional and supplemental or other provisions as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient.</P>
      <P>I thought that this was necessary in the original drafting of the Bill and that it was a necessary provision to insert in a Bill which inevitably will require certain improvements and amendments as time goes on.  The Senator seeks to restrict what the Minister may do in the amendment.  The amendment proposes to substitute the phrase &ldquo;other supplemental and incidental&rdquo;.  The draftsman advised that his wording is better and that it is not a matter of any great consequence.</P>
      <P>I would again remind the House that any order under this Bill or this subsection must go before both Houses of the Oireachtas by way of resolution. It is not sufficient to lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The resolution must be proposed and may be debated in the ordinary way.  A provision which allows for a little bit of manoeuvring that might obviate the necessity for an amending Bill is a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Senator wishes to press for this change, I would raise no objection. Candidly, the wording was calculated to give a little more manoeuvrability in matters which might arise with the passage of time regarding certain regulations which could be called on for the improvement or amendment of the legislation in regard to the conditions <Col N="290" /> with which the Bill deals.  If the Seanad is convinced that this amendment is an improvement, that it would be better to circumscribe what the Minister may do to this extent, I will not oppose it. However, I am advised that the original wording is more suitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Senator Dooge when he spoke on Committee Stage of this Bill, I think he made a very strong case for giving the Minister all the power which he legitimately needs.  I agree with the Minister that there is a desirable need for flexibility here and he should not be required to come back to the House with a new Bill for very minor changes in this area.  However, that is provided for in the wording of the amendment and we still have the safeguard that the matters are supplemental and incidental.  As the Bill stands, the wording in the section does appear to give the Minister power to make an order relating to other provisions.  It is not clear that these are supplemental to the provisions of the section and I should prefer to see this amendment pressed. The arguments have been very thoroughly gone into on Committee Stage and I was persuaded by them.</P>

      <P>I should like to commend the Minister on his generous attitude.  I am grateful to him but I share Senator Robinson's views with regard to this amendment. I was convinced by the case which was made for it.  I agreed to support this amendment when it was proposed that it should be put forward on Report Stage.  If the Minister does not think I am treating him unkindly, I would accept his offer and press the amendment.</P>

      <P>As I have already said, I am not worried about accepting this amendment other than that I could see at some stage that it would be a most essential and important <Col N="291" /> subsection.  Frequently in the Dáil when I am pressed to do something, I have to point out in reply to a Parliamentary question this would require legislation.  Sometimes Members are quick to point out that it can be done by regulation.  It would be more expedient and more likely to be dealt with immediately when the question of time has made it obvious that a change is necessary.  I thought this section would be particularly useful in that respect.  At whatever time it might be considered necessary to amend the Bill it might put the Minister for Labour in a position to bring in amending legislation.  That is the only difference.  I should prefer not to accept this amendment, but I do not wish to appear to be stonewalling it. On final consideration I would ask the Seanad to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 1, to delete &ldquo;vary&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;increase&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to take up the time of the House on this.  The House is agreed that the provisions of the Bill are welcome and that the minimum periods are regarded as permanently minimum and that the only variation with regard to these should be an upward one.  It is proposed in this amendment to change the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; to &ldquo;increase&rdquo;.  The Minister indicated that he might be prepared to change this word in subsection (4) of section 4 to make the legislation accord with his and the common intention of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I pointed out that although I <Col N="292" /> would agree with the Minister that what this section is laying down are minimum periods of notice&mdash;this is the whole direction of this legislation; it is implied that any variation will be an increase&mdash;nevertheless, the word is &ldquo;vary&rdquo;.  I quoted from the Minister's speech on Second Reading where he showed that there had to be a good deal of bargaining in order to get acceptance from both sides of this minimum period of notice.  I do not think there is a sufficient safeguard in that orders under this section have to be laid in draft form before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am glad that it has to be in draft form and that both Houses of the Oireachtas will consider such orders.  However, in effect the consideration of an order is a very limited supervising role of the Oireachtas since if a number of amendments were made, the majority of them increasing the requirement for minimum periods of notice and one of them shortening the period in relation to one particular category of employee, the House cannot amend an order in draft. It can only reject it.  In order to ensure that the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; will always mean vary upwards I suggest that it is both a reasonable and important amendment to change the word to &ldquo;increase&rdquo; so that this is made clear on the face of it and that any judges of tribunals interpreting this will be clear that not only was it the intention of the Seanad, and that this was put on record, but that it is implicit in the word that we use.  For those reasons I strongly support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage it was pointed out by a Senator that the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; was more flexible than &ldquo;increase&rdquo;.  It would enable the Minister to exercise an option of either increasing the period of notice or reducing the amount of service needed to qualify for any particular amount of notice.  We are quibbling here about the scope which the word may give to the Minister to change the period of notice upwards or downwards.  I could visualise many situations arising where the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; would be much more useful in the legislation than &ldquo;increase&rdquo;.  In view of the fact that it is not a very <Col N="293" /> significant change I would ask that the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; be retained.  I do not think anybody could think that the Minister would wish to reduce the period of notice.  Nobody can conceive of a Minister wanting to reduce periods of notice.  The word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; could have the effect of allowing the Minister greater flexibility.  I would prefer that the Senators proposing this amendment would not press it.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that in order to change this a draft regulation would have to be passed by both Houses it is more unlikely that any changes will be made unless a very good case is put up.  In the circumstances, I agree that &ldquo;vary&rdquo; is a more useful and flexible word than &ldquo;increase&rdquo;.  The amendment should not be pressed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 32, before &ldquo;payment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or withholding&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 7 (1) provides that the employee and employer may come together and agree to a waiver of the right to notice that the one may have against the other.  It also provides that nothing in the Bill will preclude acceptance of payment <i>in lieu</i> of notice. &ldquo;Acceptance of payment&rdquo; is language which seems to govern both employer and employee and contemplates payment by either to the other. This might arise if the employee did not give the requisite notice to the employer.  The notice referred to here is presumably the minimum notice provided for by statute.  What is sought to be preserved by this amendment is the right of an employer who has paid wages for work done and then finds that the employee is not giving him statutory notice to which he is entitled.  The employer has the right to withhold out of the wages due the sum which is due to him <i>in lieu</i> of the notice he should get from the employee.  It makes a better balanced piece of legislation and is a good amendment.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with the Senator on this point.  This section is provided to facilitate the type of situation where it would suit both employer and employee, or one of them, by agreement to waive the requirement with regard to the period of notice.  There could be the occasion when an employee is offered a better job and would like to be relieved from the requirement to give notice and, by agreement with his employer, this could be done.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes to allow an employer to exercise his right to withold payment <i>in lieu</i> of notice. The discussion on Committee Stage centered on the situation where an employee leaves his employment without giving notice.  In that situation there is no obligation to pay money <i>in lieu</i> of notice and the question of the right to withhold payment would not arise.  With regard to withholding any other money such as wages due, the law does not recognise any general rights on the part of the employer to do this.  It is a matter of contract law which can be decided only by a court of law in any particular case.  The employee involved would have to sue the employer.</P>
      <P>If an employee leaves his employment without giving notice, there is no money due to him and the question of withholding payment does not arise. This amendment is superfluous, and I strongly urge that it be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 25, before &ldquo;within&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;within one month of the coming into operation of this Act furnish to his existing employees and thereafter&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a most desirable amendment. As I understand the position, at any time an employee may look for a written statement containing the specified particulars of the contract of employment. In addition to this right which <Col N="295" /> the employee may or may not exercise, there is an obligation on the employer to furnish the employee with the particulars specified in the section within one month of commencement of work.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes in respect of employments existing before the date of coming into operation of the Act, to put the obligation on the employer to furnish the particulars specified within one month.  I should like the Minister to describe how he envisages the Act will take effect when it comes into operation.  As I understand the terms of the section, the Minister at a certain point of time will make an order bringing the Act into force and effect.  Thereafter, in respect of all employments existing before the date of the coming into operation of the Act the employee at any time will be entitled to look for and obtain this information.  In relation to all new employments starting after the date of coming into operation of the Act, the employer must furnish the information.</P>
    <P>I want to understand the policy of the Minister on this and to be sensible about it, because it could affect my attitude to the proposed amendment.  Does the Minister contemplate that a considerable number of contracts of employment will be in existence when the Bill comes into operation?  Terms of employment will not be required to be specified unless the employee asks that they should be and the employer will only have obligation to specify these terms in relation to employments and contracts commencing after the date of the coming into operation of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies to that question, I should like to support this amendment. Although I welcome this Bill, it is a minimal Bill about minimum notices and terms of employment.  It is necessary to look at the reality of the situation and to realise that a great deal of the value of this section about giving notice of minimum terms of employment is lost if the particular employees have to ask individually for the terms of employment, If we do not insert a duty on the employer <Col N="296" /> to supply the written statement to this effect.  This is particularly so in this country because we do not have a provision for unfair dismissal.  It might well be that, if a particular employee was making a nuisance of himself or thought he would make a nuisance of himself by requiring the terms and conditions, he could be given the proper notice and just dismissed. In England, under the Industrial Relations Act, an employee could bring an action for compensation for unfair dismissal but an employee would have no such remedy here.  We should be careful not to put on employees the burden of individually asking for a statement as to the terms and conditions of employment.  It is not sufficient to provide that this be given to new employees who are taken on after this Act comes into operation.  We were slow in coming around to providing this legislation by comparison with the 1965 Act in Northern Ireland, the 1963 Act in England and an amending Act in 1972.  We should accept this amendment and insert the provision which will mean that the employer, as at the date of operation of the Bill, will be issuing a statement to all employees of the terms of employment.</P>
      <P>This would make the Bill a reality, not inoperable as it will be if it is left to the individual request of employees who might not be prepared to risk making nuisances of themselves.</P>

      <P>The subsection provides that all new employees must get the terms of their employment within a month of their entering employment. The amendment proposes that all existing employees must get the notice within a month of the Bill coming into operation.  Since the Committee Stage discussion on this section I have given much consideration to this amendment.  I had the necessary inquiries made with regard to the experience in England under their 1963 Act and I am assured that this involves a mass of paperwork that would inflict tremendous difficulties and burdens on the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must regard the employer as an important party to the whole question <Col N="297" /> of employment and, in the interest of good relations, now and again we should think of his difficulties. Nowadays the employer has a lot of documentation and regulations with which he has to conform.  We should not add to this, particularly since it is laid down that any employee must get notice of his terms of employment when he asks for it.</P>
    <P>We had tentatively decided to furnish three months' notice to the FUE and such other organised bodies and to have advertisements inserted in the national Press, in the same way giving notice to all concerned that this was now law and pointing to the main provisions, of which this is the main one.  That would enable the load to fall more easily on the employer, to enable him to give to all his employees within a month a notice of their terms of employment.  There are penalties for failing to comply, but we must have some regard for the employer. There is nothing sacrosanct about the decision that we have taken but at the moment our intention is to give three months' notice, to have Press notices inserted, to promulgate in any way necessary or possible the terms of the Bill that is coming into force and particularly by giving notice to the organised employer side as to their duties and requirements under this Bill.  The Senator should not press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 30, before &ldquo;fails&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The general description of this amendment and the two that follow, particularly the one that has been ruled out of order, is that they were designed to deal at once with the innocent but mistaken employer, to save him from harm through innocent mistakes and also to deal properly with the stubborn employer who is not innocent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> This amendment is concerned to save the employer who could be found, under the section as it stands, to have committed an offence for failing to comply with a notice or, in a case of a commencement of work after the coming into operation of the Act, failing to give the prescribed particulars, a failure which might be due to inadvertence, absence on holidays or due to sickness, or the neglect of somebody to whom he delegated the duty, but no one of which circumstances would be, under the language of the section as I understand it, a defence which would avoid a conviction.  This might be very bad for the reputation of the employer as an employer and in relation to his general credibility.</P>
    <P>The possibilities of &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; or &ldquo;without reasonable excuse&rdquo; or in &ldquo;relation to the type of failure that it was a fault in a material particular,&rdquo; were considered by me as alternative amendments.  I decided that I would recommend to the House the word &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would provide that only an employer who had wilfully failed to comply with the requirement under section 9 to furnish a statement of employment terms would be guilty of an offence under this section.  The amendment would place the onus on the Minister to prove that the failure to comply was wilful and this would certainly not be acceptable to any Minister.  I would much prefer to leave the wording as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Committee Stage debate a question was raised about the £25 penalty&mdash;it is not to exceed £25 and need not be £25&mdash;which might be imposed.  If an employer innocently failed to comply with this regulation I could not see any Minister prosecuting him.  We have many examples of this in legislation.  On the other hand, if a prosecution did take place it is open to the district justice to impose a nominal fine or to apply the Probation Act, as is usual.  The one objection I would have is that it would put the Minister in the position of proving what was <Col N="299" /> wilful and what was not.  I think the present wording should stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Although we are not in Committee, the Minister is a very agreeable man and I imagine it may be possible for him, with the consent of the House, to offer an alternative to the amendment which is suggested on Report which will not involve a shifting of the onus of proof of the wilfulness of the matter but would leave a ground of defence to the defendant if he could prove&mdash;and there is no provision for him to prove&mdash;that his failure was with reasonable excuse. Perhaps the Cathaoirleach could guide me, seeing that the Minister was of a mind to accept an amendment to which the objection he has voiced regarding shifting the onus of proof would not apply, as to whether, if he were prepared to accept the interpretation of the words &ldquo;without reasonable excuse&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo;, the House would be able to agree to accept that substitution?</P>
      <P>If I may emphasise the importance of this point, it would mean that men who like to behave themselves under the law would be able to persuade the court without being convicted of guilt. It would not require the Minister or the prosecutor to prove anything.  It would be for the defendant to prove that he has reasonable excuse in the circumstances of his case.  It would not depend upon the goodwill of the Minister administering the legislation at the time&mdash;he could be having the devil of a row with the employer on anything&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It might reflect to his credit and to his ability to look after his employees generally.  I do not know if the House would accept the substitution of the words &ldquo;without reasonable excuse&rdquo; for &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo; and I place myself in the hands of the Chair.</P>

If you are going to insist that &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo; has to be in front of every one of them it is introducing a very dangerous principle.  If the court or the Minister, in the circumstances of the case, realises that it was not wilful the prosecution either will not go on or the court will not find that an offence was committed.  To introduce the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; is, in my opinion, a dangerous principle and it should be resisted unless a very strong case is argued for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that Senator FitzGerald's second intervention was regarded as putting a point to the Minister and not as replying to the Report Stage amendment.  Presumably, it was on that basis that Senator Ryan spoke and I wish to be allowed to speak to the amendment now.  I appreciate the difficulty posed by the Minister and by Senator Ryan in looking on an amendment of this kind as applying generally to offences created under statute, but it largely depends on how you look at it. Obviously, from the point of view of the administration, the Minister and his Department, the neat and tidy thing is to have a clear-cut offence on failure to comply with provisions of an Act.  It is so clear-cut that there is virtually no defence and it then rests entirely with the Minister and his Department to decide whether or not a prosecution should be brought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senator Ryan pauses and looks at that situation for a moment he will see how terribly undesirable it may be because there the sole arbiter as to whether or not a prosecution is to be brought in any given case is the political head of the Department.  I want <Col N="301" /> to make it absolutely clear&mdash;I am presenting this case as an argument for the amendment and in no way on a personal basis&mdash;that I am not suggesting that the present Minister or any Minister I can contemplate would deliberately abuse and misuse those powers, but so long as the matter is left on that basis it is open to abuse and it is open to abuse by the political head of a Department exercising his powers on a political basis.  It is open to him to decide that in this particular case, because the accused person is a supporter of his political party, he will not bring a prosecution.  It is open to him to decide in another case, because the accused person is a supporter of a party opposed to the Minister, that even though the facts of the case may be very much less serious, he will bring a prosecution.  That is a consequence that can come from the situation if it is left as it is and if we think only in terms of the danger which Senator Eoin Ryan has warned us against.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I appreciate the argument that it may be putting a burden on the Minister and his Department that it would be extremely difficult for the prosecution to discharge if, when a prosecution is brought under this section, the court should decide that there must be positive proof from the prosecution that the offence was wilfully committed.  I could see the possibility that there would be different views as to what would amount, even in the same case, to wilfulness on the part of the defendant.  That is the difficulty we are in: there are two sides to this.  If we were to leave this section unchanged, I do not believe that the ordinary members of the public would be protected indefinitely against possible abuse of these powers.  It was a very worthwhile action of Senator Alexis FitzGerald to put down this amendment and to have this discussion, because this kind of thing appears very often in legislation.</P>
    <P>The way out may very well be what Senator Alexis FitzGerald has suggested. If the Minister is reluctant to find himself and his Department in the position where they have to show that the defendant wilfully or knowingly <Col N="302" /> committed an offence by failing to comply with the provisions of section 9 of this Bill, and feels that is too onerous, the solution may be to import somewhere into this section machinery which will say to the court: &ldquo;Although <i>prima facie</i> an offence is committed by a person who fails to comply with the requirements of section 9, nevertheless if that person satisfies you that the failure on his part was not a wilful failure, that it was not done knowingly, that it was entirely accidental or due to inadvertence, in those circumstances, it is open to you to decide that no offence has in fact been committed and you will be entitled to dismiss the complaint.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would be satisfied if a provision such as that were written into this section.  It could be done in the manner which is suggested by Senator Alexis FitzGerald and if instead of using the word suggested in his amendment, &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;fails&rdquo; in subsection (1) of section 10, we should write in &ldquo;who without reasonable excuse&rdquo;, or words to that effect, &ldquo;fails to comply with the provisions of section 9, <i>et cetera</i>&rdquo;, there would then be a protection.  It would not be right for us to assume that it is not possible for a defendant to commit an offence innocently under the section as it is worded at the moment.</P>
    <P>This section relates back to section 9 of the Act.  All that is necessary is to have a quick look down the provisions of section 9 in order to see the number of cases in which it is not only possible but probable that offences could unwittingly be committed in failing to comply with the provisions of section 9.  I agree very strongly with Senator FitzGerald in pleading with the Minister to reconsider this matter and to see if he could meet the point of view expressed by Senator FitzGerald, and which I believe to be a very valid point of view.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that we may be getting into the woods here.  We are still on amendment No. 6.  Section 10 relates to failure to comply.  However, if I might refer <Col N="303" /> back to subsection (1) of section 9, it does not specify what is meant by &ldquo;requiring an employer to furnish&rdquo;. If the arguments being raised by Senator FitzGerald and Senator O'Higgins have validity, the employer ought to have the safeguard of having some means of notifying him.  As an employer, I can easily see a situation developing in which somebody is supposed to have told somebody else that he wanted the data under section 9, and that the position would keep on getting tangled up to the point where the Department would be notified that an employer had failed to fulfil the requirements.</P>
      <P>I should like to know the Minister's views on that.  Where measures of this kind are intended at least to retain the goodwill and support of both the employer and employee&mdash;and therefore one is not looking for pinpricking &mdash;nevertheless if there is anything in it, it would appear that the amendment would not cover what I am talking about.  For instance, &ldquo;if an employer who fails, having been requested in writing, to comply with ...&rdquo; might cover the question that has been raised.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the force of the argument made by the proposer of the amendment and those who support it but we must all agree that this is the fundamental section which ensures that the aims of this legislation will be realised.  I am all in favour of not making things too difficult for employers but this is a case in which we cannot modify the phraseology in the Bill in order to provide a defence which can be offered by the defendant in any case. It is open to the defendant to plead that the act was not wilful or that he has a reasonable excuse.  I do not think I should write it into the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us see what the practical working of this will be. Suppose it is brought to the notice of the Minister that some person did not give notice to his employee of the terms of his employment.  This would probably be a case in which the employer has refused to give notice.  It is open to the employee to require the employer to give these particulars. The employee knows he has the right to require his employer to furnish him with these particulars.  If the employer persists in his refusal then it is rather serious.  If it comes to the notice of the Minister that this notice has not been given, as a result of somebody calling to inspect the enforcement of the terms of the Act, and he has a reasonable excuse, he&mdash;the Minister &mdash;would expect that the employer should give it there and then.  This will satisfy any Minister in a case <Col N="305" /> where there is not wilful neglect.  If the employer persists in the refusal and finds himself in court he will naturally plead that he has reasonable excuse and it should not be made easier for him by writing it into the Act.  Everybody would plead that section if it was made easy by writing it into the Act.  In the last analysis the court is the final arbiter.  The fine, at the court's discretion, may be nominal or there may be no fine; the fine may not exceed £25 or the Probation Act may be applied.</P>
      <P>I should not like to have any watering down of the direct meaning of the section or make it easier for a defence to be prepared for those people who would find themselves in court.  Very few people would find themselves in court and those who would would be those who would have refused to comply with the terms since the employee has the right to require the terms to be supplied to him.  Much as I do not want to be difficult for employers with this new piece of legislation, this is the crucial point in the whole Bill, the enforceability of the terms.  They are not unduly harsh and we should let them stand.  I would resist this amendment very strongly.</P>

I wonder, even in his description of it, whether it is sufficient that it is the Minister who may prosecute; whether it is realistic to expect that legitimate cases where the employer has failed to provide the terms of notice would come to the notice of the Minister or whether trade unions or other bodies ought not to be empowered to prosecute.</P>

It is right to record my view, that the amendment proposed, or the alternative mentioned, is reasonable in regard to the interests of the innocent persons whom the amendment is concerned to save.  I am not in any way affected by the view that the Minister would never do such a thing. When I hear that argument I must abstract myself completely from the personality of the Minister in question <Col N="306" /> or from those of the individual advisers to the Minister also.  Here we must look at legislation which is capable of being used in a particular way.  We have a particular section which can lead to damaging conviction without, as there ought to be, a provision for proper defence against it in the case of innocent mistake or inadvertence. Finally, the structure of the Bill is based on that of similar legislation originating in the UK and the type of amendment proposed is accepted in British legislation.</P>

If there is any question of an offence being committed under section 10 the prosecution and defence should light at a decision with the authorities to seek to define them as being the Minister, the Attorney General or somebody authorised by either of them.  That is the purpose of it.  It is to cut out the operations of the mischief maker who, if he has a particular grudge in his particular situation or who knows of a situation which could be exploited for purposes of demonstrating a grudge, may be able to worsen relations generally between a whole group of employees and their employer.</P>

Surely as the section stands this will enable some common informer, if he thinks the Minister is abusing his position, to come along and ensure that justice is done?

      <P>May I put this point to Senator Ryan?  I was glad to note that I succeeded in converting him to my point of view in relation to the second last amendment, unfortunately too late.  If his intervention had come during the discussion on amendment No. 6 it might have assisted Senator Alexis FitzGerald and myself in convincing the Minister that our arguments were correct.  Senator Ryan champions the position of the common informer. He wishes to see it preserved under this Bill and he would not for the life of him allow Senator Alexis FitzGerald's amendment to operate because it would remove the possible hand of the common informer out of this Bill.  I hope I am not wronging him in my summary of his attitude in relation to it, but he justifies that attitude on the basis that if the Minister endeavours to misuse or misdirect his discretion under section 10 in a particular way by failing to take action when he should, then it would be valuable to have the finger of the common informer in the pie and the common informer could then take action which the Minister failed to do.  How does the position of the common informer help any one?</P>
      <P>In the other case I mentioned, where you have an imaginary Minister operating the powers conferred on him under section 10, and operating them against an innocent person for political reasons, the fact that you preserve the position of the common informer is not going to protect the innocent person from the action of the Minister in such circumstances.  It could have the effect, as Senator Ryan has pointed out, that if you have a Minister who simply refuses to do his duty, who refuses, whether for political or any other reasons, to bring a prosecution when one should be brought, then the intervention of a common informer might produce results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald's amendment goes further than Senator Ryan appreciates because it has at least the double protection that if the Minister <Col N="310" /> should fall down on the job the Attorney General can still bring a prosecution if the terms of Senator Alexis FitzGerald's amendment are accepted.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald has said that this is the kind of discussion which could be contentious. It is not the kind of discussion which should be contentious or controversial in a party political sense; it is a question of what we want in legislation.  Do we think it desirable that in a Bill like this there should be room for the common informer?  I can conceive quite a number of cases where it could be a valuable protection to the public that the rights of the common informer should be preserved but is it right to preserve them in a Bill of this sort? Would it not invite mischief-making of a sort which could do a great deal of damage in terms of industrial relations? That is the net point which has been posed by Senator FitzGerald in relation to this amendment.  It is certainly one which deserves serious consideration.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> In page 7, line 4, to add &ldquo;except in the case where the employee gives to his employer a notice of intention to claim under section 12 of the 1967 Act&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to deal with the logical problem posed by adopting in this Bill the meaning of &ldquo;lay-off&rdquo; contained in the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967.  &ldquo;Lay-off&rdquo; is defined in the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967 as essentially involving the cessation of employment and then provides that, notwithstanding this, certain consequences will follow unless the employee adopts the provisions of section 12 and gives a counter notice.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 of the First Schedule, which sets out circumstances determining whether there is continuity of service, states that &ldquo;lay-off&rdquo;&mdash;which is to have the meaning assigned to it by the Redundancy Payments Act&mdash;shall have a meaning which involves cessation of employment and shall not amount to the termination of the employees service.  To make the matter clearer, it is proposed to add the words of this amendment to the end of paragraph 3&mdash;that a lay-off shall not amount to the termination by an employer of a worker's service and that where there is lay-off, there is continuity of service, notwithstanding the lay-off, except in the case where the employee gives the employer notice of his intention to claim under section 12 of the 1967 Act.  It would seem that with the two pieces of legislation working together there ought not then to be anything other than a termination of the employee's services if he has adopted the provisions of section 12.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>However well intentioned this amendment is, it does not confer any benefit on anyone.  The decision as to whether an employee will accept the lay-off rests entirely with him.  I may not have made it clear on Committee Stage.  It may suit the employee to have his employment terminated.  On the other hand, it may suit him better to have it continued.  As of now under the Redundancy Payments Act the employee has a right to this.  If after a month he considers the <Col N="312" /> lay-off unduly long he may terminate his employment and apply for redundancy payment.  This is provided for under the Redundancy Act.</P>
      <P>The employee may not qualify for redundancy and may wish to preserve the continuity of his employment which will be necessary at some later stage to qualify him for redundancy. I object to being unduly harsh to employers in regard to lay-off.  Lay-offs may turn out to be termination of employment and this may not be due to any fault on the part of the employer. I mentioned the fishing industry in this connection.  There are many factories and processing stations at fishing harbours and the duration of employment is regulated by the supply of raw material.  There may be three shifts and next month there will be lay-offs and the employer cannot say when they will be re-employed.  The lay-off may turn out to be termination and the employees have the right to make it so for the purpose of claiming redundancy.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 14, before &ldquo;whether&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;whether by virtue of a sale or other disposition or by operation of law and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will press this one.  It is clear that the Minister desires that this legislation should preserve continuity of service when the same employee works for different employers, one continuing on the other in the same trade or business. I suggest that the language used in paragraph 7 of the First Schedule will not achieve what the Minister has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; means an act by a person living and is an <i>inter vivos</i> operation.  It takes effect according to his timing and does not include the passing of a business from him to other persons through a transmission which would arise in the case of his death through the operation of his will taking effect or under the laws of the distribution of the estates of intestates. <Col N="313" /> To achieve the preservation of the rights of continuity in that business of that employee, employed by the series of employers, one receiving the business from the other, it is necessary to include words which take in dispositions which include the type of activity which is greater than a transfer and operation of law.  The proposed amendment is to include, before the bracketed words &ldquo;whether or not such transfer took place before or after the commencement of this Act&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;whether by virtue of a sale or other disposition or by operation of law&rdquo;. The Minister can be given strength to overcome any fear he may have in accepting this amendment if he looks at that very language he will find in subsection (1), section 20 of the 1967 Act.  I hope the Minister will be as reasonable about this as he has been in argument about all but in decision about a number of them and will decide to accept this as an improvement to the legislation designed to prevent injustice being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the best legal advice available to me that acceptance of this amendment would have restrictive effect rather than what is intended.  The draftsman cannot see any other way by which a transfer of a business can be effected other than by a sale or other disposition of the operation of law.  For that reason the amendment seems unnecessary.  It would only have a restrictive effect because transfers which have not been effected by virtue of a sale or other disposition or by operation of law will not come within the scope of the paragraph.</P>

I am advised that this would be restrictive and that transfers which have not been effected by virtue of a sale or other disposition or by operation of law, would not come within the scope of this paragraph. In other words, it is less restrictive to leave it as it is.  I must accept what I am told by the draftsman and legal advisers on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am genuinely trying to get the viewpoint of the Minister on this.  Paragraph (7) of the First Schedule refers to a situation which arises if a trade or business is transferred from one person to another.  The amendment seeks to make sure that there is captured in the phrase &ldquo;is transferred&rdquo; transfers which arise by virtue of a sale; by virtue of any other disposition; or by virtue of the operation of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What is essential here is to find out if a transfer can take place by means of a disposition other than a sale or if not by a disposition other than a sale then by operation of law which, at the same time, would be outside the phrase &ldquo;is transferred&rdquo; as used in paragraph (7).</P>
      <P>It is open to the Minister to argue that the phrase &ldquo;is transferred&rdquo; is comprehensive and covers everything that paragraph (7) means that once the transfer has taken place, however it has come about, the trade or business is transferred in the sense that it has been transferred.  Senator FitzGerald is putting a point of view which to my mind requires examination that the phrase &ldquo;is transferred&rdquo; would, to most lawyers, indicate that something active has taken place by means of a deed of transfer, that it has been signed, sealed and delivered and transferred in that sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that changes in the ownership of a trade or business can take place otherwise than by a transfer in the restricted sense of a deed of sale or transfer having taken place.  We know that a change of ownership can <Col N="315" /> take place, for example, on the death of an owner where others succeed to his interest in the trade or business. We know that a change of ownership can take place on death whether the owner has died intestate or whether the disposition is as a result of his will. That is a way in which a change of ownership or transfer by operation of law can take place which would not be covered in the generally accepted meaning of the phrase &ldquo;is transferred&rdquo;. This would arise in a different category and the result would be the same.  The change of ownership would have taken place.  A change of ownership can take place by a sale or by another disposition such as a will. Senator FitzGerald is trying to ensure that that will be captured.  The amendment would not weaken paragraph (7) of the First Schedule, all it would do would be to strengthen it.  This point requires some thought by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There are other ways, by virtue of operation of law, by which a transfer could take place which is outside the scope of the normal ones which would occur to any of us such as a transfer on a voluntary basis from a father to a son, or a transfer by sale from one owner to another, or a transfer following a person's death whether by will or intestacy&mdash;I have not thought this through, perhaps Senator FitzGerald has&mdash;the putting in of a receiver by trade creditors could operate an effective transfer of a business, certainly from one management to another, during the period of the liquidation.  These are open to doubt if the Minister allows paragraph 7 to remain as it is.  I do not think it would be open to doubt under Senator FitzGerald's amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether he would agree that this is a minimal Bill in that it does not contain the provision for compensation for unfair dismissal which already prevails, in one form or another, in the other eight countries of the EEC.  When we have to allow for free movement of workers and when people are coming from other countries of the Community to work here, will they not be entitled to compensation for unfair dismissal in the same terms as they would have in their own countries? I am thinking of the provisions in the Industrial Relations Act in England where there can be compensation up to £4,000 for unfair dismissal. Does the Minister contemplate bringing in legislation to provide for compensation for unfair dismissal?</P>

      <P>What may be necessary, in relation to harmonisation of our laws, I cannot say now.  This Bill does the minimum.  It is very obvious that we are conscious of that because all through the Bill the Minister takes powers to make by order the necessary adjustments without having to introduce amending legislation. This will enable us, in many ways, to conform to what may be necessary under EEC legislation, but I am not going to say that the question of unfair dismissals legislation is something that would be required to be introduced in order to have harmonisation of legislation with EEC countries.</P>
      <P>Unfair dismissal is covered, I understand, by common law here.  Indeed it has been prosecuted in courts many times.  Whether it should be specifically related to particular legislation I do not know.  I am not so sure that Senator Robinson's reference to British legislation is one which we should rush in to imitate at the moment.  Any legislation which impinges on the sensitive area of industrial relations requires a good deal of thought and study.  It is a matter of having the opinion of three sides; consultation with the social partners and, of course, the Government as a third party would have to precede the bringing in of legislation of that kind. This is very important particularly in the context of harmonisation of the legislation of the EEC.  I certainly would not try to expound on that, nor would I claim to be competent to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has received very fair treatment in the House.  Many technical points have been contested.  Some of them have been rather academic but resulted in very useful discussions.  I think both sides of the House have accepted that the spirit of the legislation is to improve, rather than to disimprove, the conditions of workers generally.  We must have recourse to the importance of the employer in all legislation too.  He has a very important part to play and sometimes we are inclined to think entirely of what we are doing for the worker without having regard to the person who employs him and who creates the employment and, I would hope, ensures the <Col N="318" /> necessary good relations from which only good employment can spring.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) (No. 3) Scheme, 1972, prepared by the Minister for Defence with the consent of the Minister for Finance under Sections 2, 3 and 5 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932 and Section 4 of the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Act, 1938, and laid before the House on the 12th day of December, 1972 be confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin) Gerry Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a scheme made pursuant to the Defence Forces (Pensions) Acts, 1932 to 1968.  These Acts provide that before a scheme such as this comes into operation it must be confirmed by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  Its purpose is to improve still further the retirement benefits payable under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes, which have already been considerably improved by the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) (No. 3) Scheme, 1970, and to amend the schemes in other respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Articles 5 and 6 provide that where an office or soldier dies in service with five or more years' service a gratuity of one year's pay, including additional pay if any, will be payable. This follows a precedent which applies throughout the public service generally and will result in a big improvement in the death benefit payable under the existing schemes.  The qualifying period for death in service for the grant of a pension to the widow of an officer is also being reduced <Col N="319" /> from 12 to five years.  This provision appears in Article 7.</P>
    <P>Article 8 deals with the case of certain long-service soldiers of the Survey Corps of Engineers who were transferred to the reserve in 1940 to take up civilian posts in the Ordnance Survey.  These soldiers could not qualify for Army pensions as their service fell short of 21 years.  Provision was later made for the grant of modified pensions to them which would become payable when they retired from the civilian posts.  The soldiers concerned were recalled to the Army during the Emergency and this service may be counted for civilian pension.  Article 8 allows any portion of this period not reckonable for civil pension to count towards Army pension.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Article 9 is to cover the case of certain officers who are not covered by Article 5 of the 1970 Scheme which provides for increases in the retired pay of senior officers who retire while holding posts of responsibility. The officers who are not covered did not hold the posts when they retired but held them previously for the requisite period.  They will now be eligible for the increased retired pay.</P>
    <P>Article 10 provides that the additional pay payable to professional officers will now be reckonable in the calculation of the improved pay-related gratuities provided by the 1970 Scheme for married officers who retire on age grounds or who retire voluntarily within five years of reaching the age limit for retirement.</P>
    <P>Article 11 covers the case of soldier pensioners who fail to qualify for contributory old age pensions under the Social Welfare Acts on reaching the age of 70.  It provides that the increased pension increment for service between 21 and 31 years which was introduced by the 1970 Scheme will continue to be payable if the failure to qualify for the contributory old age pension is not due to the pensioner's own fault or neglect.</P>
    <P>Article 12 is a provision similar to Article 10.  It provides that the additional pay payable to soldiers of the technician class, which is not at present <Col N="320" /> reckonable, will now be reckonable in the calculation of the gratuities payable to long-service married soldiers discharged on pension which were introduced by the 1970 Scheme.</P>
    <P>Article 13 is merely a drafting amendment designed to rectify an inadvertent omission in Article 11 of the 1970 Scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anyone will oppose this motion, especially at a time when the need is to attract recruits to Army life and, in particular, recruits who are prepared to make the Army their vocation in life. In such circumstances any measure brought in by the Government to improve the pension position of Army personnel should be supported by all parties.</P>
      <P>The Minister sets out very clearly the effect of the amending scheme of 1972.  He says that the purpose is to improve the retirement benefit payable under the 1970 Scheme.  I should like to ask him a few questions in relation to his remarks regarding Articles 5 and 6.  The Minister points out that these articles provide that, where an officer or a soldier dies in service with five or more years of service, the gratuity to be payable will be one year's pay.  He then adds &ldquo;...including additional pay if any...&rdquo;  I should like to be clear as to what is in mind there.  Is the Minister referring to, for example, service overseas where additional pay operates over and above that to which the soldier or officer would be normally entitled if he were serving in Ireland?  Is that the kind of additional pay the Minister is referring to in relation to Article 5 and 6?  I am not objecting to it.  I simply want to be clear in my own mind with regard to the position.</P>
      <P>The Minister also mentions that the qualifying period for death in service for a grant of pension to the widow of an officer is being reduced from 12 to five years.  That should also command unanimous support here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to query the position under Article 8, purely to clarify my own mind.  As the Minister points out, this deals with the case of long service <Col N="321" /> soldiers in the Survey Company, Corps of Engineers, who were transferred to do civilian work in the Ordnance Survey as far back as 1940 when they were transferred to the Reserve.  The Minister says that these people could not qualify for Army pensions because they would not have the required 21 years service.  He points out as follows:</P>
    <P>Provision was later made for the grant of modified pensions to them which would become payable when they retired from the civilian posts. The soldiers concerned were recalled to the Army during the Emergency and this service may be counted for civilian pension.</P>
    <P>The Minister then says:</P>
    <P>Article 8 allows any portion of this period not reckonable for civil pension to count towards Army pension.</P>
    <P>I do not dispute that that is the position, but I should like to ask if there are any men who could benefit from that provision.  Are there any who could bring their actual Army service up to 21 years by virtue of the provisions in Article 8?</P>
    <P>I wish to raise only one other query with the Minister.  That is in relation to his remarks regarding Article 11, which refers to the case of soldier pensioners who fail to qualify for contributory old age pensions under the Social Welfare Acts.  In the course of his introductory remarks, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It provides that the increased pension increment for service between 21 and 31 years which was introduced by the 1970 Scheme will continue to be payable if the failure to qualify for the contributory old age pension is not due to the pensioner's own fault or neglect.</P>
    <P>In what circumstances could the failure to qualify for the contributory old age pension be due to the pensioner's own fault or neglect?  I presume there are a number of ways in which it could be done but I should like to get some examples from the Minister.  As I said, I welcome the provision.</P>

      <P>Like Senator O'Higgins I, too, welcome the provisions in this scheme.  There are some <Col N="322" /> notable ones and the Minister must be complimented for introducing them. Senator O'Higgins has raised all the questions to which I should like an answer so I will not delay the Minister further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to Senators for their observations.  This should be a very welcome scheme by virtue of its generous character.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins referred to Articles 5 and 6 relating to additional pay.  This refers to professional pay such as is paid to technical officers, engineers, medical officers and so on. It also includes technicians' pay but it does not include allowances which are paid for overseas service.  I want to emphasise that point.  This explains the query in relation to Articles 5 and 6.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins, in relation to Article 8, inquired as to the number of personnel who would be concerned under this head.  The number is eight. They are compensated, one way or the other, by virtue of their renewed service in the Forces.</P>
      <P>An inquiry was also made as to the circumstances in which a soldier pensioner would not qualify for a contributory old age pension.  There are a few ways in which this could happen but I would not like to go into the details.  If he were debarred from a contributory old age pension through no fault of his own, then he would benefit under the scheme.  I am sorry I cannot be more specific than that.</P>
      <P>These were the only points raised. I am obliged to the Senators for their observations.  It is good news for the Defence Forces.  It will have the effect of giving an even greater impetus to the recruitment campaign we are at present conducting.  As the House will appreciate, we have adopted measures which should induce young men to become members of the Defence Forces.  I will not go beyond the terms of reference in this debate, but as Senator O'Higgins referred to recruitment and the importance of providing attractive terms for young men in joining the Army, I think we are doing our part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 1, I have a very short observation to make.  The object of this Bill is to amend the law relating to charities by extending the powers of the Commissioners and amending the Charities Act, 1961.  It is appropriate on this section to make an observation with regard to a restriction which was imposed on charities by the provisions of section 32 of the Charities Act, 1961 relative to the investment of charity funds and it is appropriate to suggest, apart from making reference to that section, that the powers of the Commissioners should be extended so that their investment powers may be greater than they are at present.  It would, therefore be appropriate for this Bill to amend that section of the Charities Act, 1961.  I have no more to say on the matter at this point.</P>

      <P>I think the matters which Senator FitzGerald raises in relation to section 32 of the 1961 Act are primarily matters for the Minister for Finance. It is a question of financial policy. As the Senator has not gone into them in detail on this occasion, it is not necessary for me to discuss them in depth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What this legislation is endeavouring to achieve with regard to the incorporation of charity trustees I would welcome as a desirable and modernising provision but I wonder whether the section has gone far enough in providing for the sort of matters which arise with regard to the establishment of incorporated bodies.  Quite diffidently, I mention them in general at this stage in the desire to be helpful and with a view to having the Minister consider them between now and the next Stage.  This is, after all, designed to have a new parent for a new type of corporate bodies.  These corporate bodies will not be subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Industrial and Provident Societies code, or the Friendly Societies code, all of which have their own particular manner of regulating these bodies.  The regulations will, presumably, be made by the board elaborating each particular scheme.</P>
      <P>There are a number of features which are common to the three codes which I have mentioned.  One is the provision with regard to the establishment of bodies under these codes. The certificate of the registrar in each case is conclusive as to the establishment of the body.  I do not find anything here equivalent to that.  There have been experiences under the three codes whereby reliance on that section was found extremely helpful in the matter of the proof of the valid existence of the body corporate itself. I should like if the Minister would consider whether there should not be some manner of issuing a certificate in common form as to the establishment of the particular body corporate which is the charitable trust here to be incorporated.  It would cut out the right of anybody to inquire, for example, whether the section had been properly complied with by the charity commissioners in establishing the trust.  The validity of the corporation could not in any way be attacked if there was a provision that the certificates of the charity commissioners was to be final and conclusive on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody would have the power to look behind, to question whether there <Col N="325" /> had been an application by trustees, whether they were, in fact, trustees at the time of their application or whether the board had acted in accordance with the requirements of this section.  The question of <i>ultra vires</i> does not arise here.  These will be statutory bodies.  If the persons go beyond their powers they can be brought to book.  Their contracts will be obligations on them and enforceable against them.  I mention the point for consideration because, as the Minister is aware, the old <i>ultra vires</i> rule has been modified under the Companies Act in so far as companies are affected and it is to be further modified by virtue of the EEC regulation with regard to companies.</P>
    <P>It is a very general provision with regard to the contracts of bodies incorporated under other statutes in that their documents can be authenticated without having anything very solemn required to be done to prove that the document in question was the document of the company or society by the certification of the document by the officers of the body corporate in question.  This might be considered.</P>
    <P>I mention also the question of the service of these bodies corporate.  If proceedings are to be brought against an incorporated charitable body how do you serve them?  What provision is there for their having an address?  If you are having dealings with them how do you find out what that address is? How can you satisfy a court that you have effectively and satisfactorily enforced them?</P>
    <P>Another situation arises.  That is the question of someone wanting to do a deal before its incorporation.  Is advantage to be taken analogous to the new provision in the Companies Act with regard to pre-incorporation contracts? Is that thought to be in any way relevant?  I do not think it is.  It is worth reminding the House that charitable bodies do engage in trade sometimes. As trading entities they may want to do some commercial exercise before they become incorporated.  Perhaps they know a sum of money is to become available.  Perhaps the framing of the scheme will take time.  Perhaps the capture of the land before the scheme is framed is desirable.  It would <Col N="326" /> be desirable to make a provision that somebody could bind that body before it is subsequently incorporated by the charity commissioners' seal.  I do not know whether we have provision for charitable companies under the Companies Act.  What is the thinking with regard to these?  Will these charitable companies continue side by side with the charitable bodies corporate established under this Bill?  In the one case they are subject to the requirements of the Companies Act.  In the other case they are not.</P>
    <P>There are all sorts of EEC requirements with regard to publication of stuff about yourself, on papers, invoices, notes, <i>et cetera.</i>  Will these requirements apply?  If so, should we not anticipate their requirement if we are enacting a piece of legislation now? We know what they are.  I do not know, although I should, if they extend to bodies corporate like these.  These are just some general observations on the question of the body corporate to be established by virtue of the scheme under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a few questions in connection with this matter.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald has covered very largely the kind of query I had intended putting to the Minister.  I am not sure if the Minister is in a position to answer this query.  I should like to hear from the Minister, even if only in broad outline, the type of scheme which is envisaged under section 2 in terms of the structure as regards management, <i>et cetera.</i>  I could understand this very easily if it were provided in section 2 that a body corporate established in accordance with this section would be registered in the companies office and would act in accordance with memorandum and articles of association settled by the Commissioners.  Most of us would then know what kind of structure was in question.  We would know that those appointed to operate and manage the scheme would have to conform with the requirements of the memorandum and articles of association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Alexis FitzGerald has pointed out, this does not seem to come anywhere within that category. <Col N="327" /> That being so, I should like the Minister to let us know, if he is in a position to say so, how will the ordinary member of the public know what are the functions on the one hand and the limitations of the functions on the other of the various people who may be appointed to the body corporate. Is there for example, to be a secretary?  Is the secretary the person on whom legal proceedings are to be served if it is necessary to take legal proceedings?  Is there to be some method by which either an appointed person or an appointed office will be fixed at which proceedings might be served?</P>
    <P>The Minister may not find it convenient to answer these questions in detail.  I do not wish detailed information but a broad picture in outline of the kind of structure that is envisaged in these bodies.  Like Senator FitzGerald I would not in any way be disposed to oppose the general concept which is expressed in this Bill and in particular in section 2 and 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be helpful to put this in perspective if I were to give the general background to the necessity for the section.  The Commissioners have drawn my attention to the inconvenience and expense caused by the necessity of vesting property belonging to a charity in new trustees on the death or retirement of existing trustees.  They represented to me that these difficulties would be mitigated if charity trustees could be incorporated. They recommended that provision be made so that the trustees of a charity may on application being made to the Commissioners, be incorporated by means of a scheme vesting the trust property in the body corporate.</P>
      <P>At present, on the death or retirement of charity trustees the property of the charity must be vested by a separate instrument in the new trustees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald may have extended a bit far the concept of what is proposed in the incorporation of trustees when he talked about them being a new from of company.  In a very restricted sense they are a new form of company inasmuch as they will <Col N="328" /> be an incorporated body.  They are not in any sense a new company analogous to a company under the Companies Act, 1963.  A company is established by a group of people coming together for the purpose of forming a company.</P>
    <P>What is in question here is an existing charity with existing trustees who wish to incorporate themselves for the purpose of avoiding all these difficulties about succession on the deaths and retirement of the various trustees. I do not envisage in the foreseeable future a great many new incorporated bodies of trustees growing up <i>de novo.</i> I would envisage this section when it is enacted being used by existing trustees or groups of trustees for the purpose of avoiding the difficulties and expense they encounter.</P>
    <P>There would be no analogy between what is proposed in section 2 and what Senator FitzGerald refers to as &ldquo;charitable companies in the existing sense.&rdquo;  I take it he means companies which are incorporated as limited liability companies without the use of the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; by licence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The two concepts are quite different.</P>
    <P>So far as control over these incorporated trustees is concerned, the control which will be exercised in relation to them will be exercised by the Commissioners.  It will be a much more stringent control than would be the control exercised over the ordinary company, whether trading or non-trading by, for example, the registrar of companies.  The scheme will have to be framed by the Commissioners and they will be very careful to ensure that the scheme is complied with by the incorporated trustees.  The obligation on the Commissioners to ensure this would be as great in relation to incorporated trustees as it would in relation to ordinary trustees existing at present.</P>
    <P>The original scheme will be deposited in the Commissioners' office and will be open to inspection.  The Commissioners' secretary will perform in relation to these incorporated trustees much the same functions as the registrar of companies would in relation to an ordinary limited liability company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> So far as evidence of incorporation is concerned, this would be obtained from the Commissioners' office and would have to be available there as the actual incorporation would be carried out by the Commissioners framing under their seal a scheme establishing the trustees as a body corporate. Proof of the incorporation of charity trustees under the section in a court would consist of the production of a certified copy of the Commissioners' original scheme under their seal.  It would be possible, if it was not already known to a potential litigant, to find the registered office of the corporate body from the secretary to the Commissioners at the Commissioners' office.</P>
    <P>I am advised that while this and the following section are silent in relation to particular aspects of the administration of these incorporated bodies the scheme will set out a good deal of the regulations in a way somewhat analogous to a memorandum and part of it will deal with the activities of the trustees.  The ordinary law relating to companies would relate in default of a specific provision being made elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The type of incorporation proposed in sections 2 and 3 is similar to the provision for incorporation of trustees in the Charities Act, 1964, in Northern Ireland.  We do not apologise for having copied this Act as their 1964 Act is copied fairly heavily from our 1961 Act.  This has been one of the more fruitful sources of co-operation between the North and ourselves in the past.</P>
    <P>In case Senators might regard this as a novel idea to incorporate charity trustees, there has been provision for such incorporation in England under the Charitable Trustees Incorporation Act, 1872.  That did not apply to this country but it is clearly to the benefit of charities that it should apply now because charities are unnecessarily put to the expense of appointing new trustees on the death or retirement of existing ones.  This is obviously an expense which should be avoided where possible in the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was referring to the fact that the Commissioners <Col N="330" /> would obviously be more particular as regards the administration of the trust when drafting the scheme than if there was no scheme there.  Notwithstanding subsection (2) of section 2 which sets out the various provisions which a scheme may contain, am I not right in thinking that because of subsection (3) that it is not going to be within the competence of the Commissioners in settling the scheme to do anything which could in any way restrict the corporate trustee in anything in connection with the administration of the scheme because subsection (3) as drafted is, to my mind, an extraordinarily wide subsection? Subsection (3) is giving powers direct to the corporate trustee once established. It is not giving powers to the Commissioners but directly to the body corporate which is the corporate trustee of which we are talking.  It provides that:</P>
      <P>A body corporate established by a scheme under this section shall have a common seal ....</P>
      <P>Obviously, there is no objection to that. It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>and power to do any act or thing (including holding land) necessary for the administration of the trusts...</P>
      <P>By virtue of this subsection the Commissioners may find themselves a bit hamstrung in endeavouring to have a scheme carried out in a way in which they think it should be carried out because once the body corporate is established they will, by virtue of this measure, have all powers which are necessary for the administration of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should bear in mind that all that is intended is the incorporation of existing charity trustees and that at the moment the Commissioners have a wide power of control over existing unincorporated trustees.  No greater powers will be given to trustees on their incorporation and the control of the Commissioners will not be lessened by the incorporation of the charity trustees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment if the Commissioners could stop unincorporated trustees doing X or Y, after the passage of this <Col N="331" /> Bill the Commissioners will be able equally to stop incorporated trustees doing X or Y if they see fit.  The Commissioners have overall control of all charities and they have power to inquire into a scheme and if they feel that while a certain thing was done <i>intra vires</i> but that it was inappropriate or not in the best interest of the charity they have power to take steps to rectify it.</P>
    <P>My main point in reply to Senator O'Higgins is that the control of the Commissioners will not be lessened by the incorporation of the trustees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to hold up the House on this except to say that I should like the Minister to consider a debate on this section.  While I am in favour of what is proposed to be done here, we should not be content with the fact that it is being done in a particular way in Northern Ireland or Britain or anywhere else if we can better it here.  I could see difficulties arising from some of the matters which I mentioned before and I do not see any point in repeating myself because they are on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was replying he spoke about the secretary being the registrar and deeds being available for inspection but there is no provision for the appointment of a registrar nor is there any provision for these being available for inspection.  In particular cases there may be objections to that. The Minister tells me, in which matter he would seem to be entirely correct as a matter of law, that if the act of a scheme were silent in particular matters then the general law with regard to companies will fill the gap.  We should try to find out the effect of the general law of companies filling the gap, if there are gaps, and whether we should fill the gaps ourselves to exclude the general application in a particular direction for this particular type of body corporate of that general law in particular cases.  I should like to give more consideration to this section.</P>

      <P>These are drafting amendments the purpose of which is to achieve consistency between the terms of section 3 (3) (a) and section 10 (f).  Both these provisions have similar objects, namely, the transfer of charity property standing or registered in the books of any bank, corporation or company or entered in any statutory register into the name of the body corporate in the case of section 3 (3) (a), and into the names of the new trustees in the other case, section 10 (f).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got very much to say about this section, but I have a couple of points which should be considered and dealt with by the Minister.  The first and most important point arises on subsection (3), paragraph (d) which provides that:</P>
      <P>in every action, prosecution or other legal proceeding in respect of the property of such charity or arising on or in connection with the administration of the trusts aforesaid which is pending immediately before the operative date and to which the trustees aforesaid are a party, the body corporate established by the scheme shall be substituted as a party in place of such trustees and the proceedings shall continue accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What if the proceedings are against the trustees for damages, breach of trust or are of a criminal nature for their embezzlement of the funds?  If a scheme is framed the Charity Commissioners are not, although a most excellent body of men, all-knowing, <Col N="334" /> and around about the time of the establishment of the scheme a proceedings started against the trustees for damages or some other legal proceeding is taken against them.  This would seem to be mandatory to substitute the body corporate for the trustees as defendants in these proceedings.  I cannot think that this is intended and I do not think it is going to be an answer to say to me that, of course, if there is any kind of situation like that existing there never will be a scheme framed.  We have to think of the situation where the proceeding is started unknown to the Charity Commissioners at a point of time, in fact, immediately preceding the framing of the scheme and the incorporation of the body corporate, and where the charity trustees who are in breach of trust, responsible and liable, being brought to book by the proceedings, are getting discharged by this statute and in substitute for them the body corporate is being established.</P>
    <P>The second point is really ancillary to that and arises on the same subsection (b), that is, where the debts and liabilities are by this statute transferred from the trustees to the body corporate. I would have thought that I might have seen in this some release of liability of the trustees if the liabilities are being transferred.  This provides&mdash; at least as I read it, and I would be glad of any other view on it&mdash;for the release of the trustees, such as they would be entitled to get if they are parting with property which is their protection against that liability which is being transferred by virtue of the scheme established under the statute. My first point is the more important one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, under section 3 (d), if an action was in progress against the trustees the action would be continued against the incorporated trustees.  If an action was being taken against an individual trustee or trustees in his or their personal capacity, presumably that action would continue against the individual trustee or trustees.  If there was a prosecution in train&mdash;which is probably remote enough so far as charity trustees in this country are concerned&mdash;against a <Col N="335" /> trustee, presumably that prosecution would continue against the trustee.  If there was a prosecution against the trustees as a body, the corporate body of trustees would be substituted as defendant.  The reality of the matter is that if there were any such disputed or litigious points pending in regard to any particular set of trustees, the House could be quite sure that the Commissioners would not frame a scheme under section 2 in relation to them until that problem was cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I really got the answer that I told the Minister would not satisfy me.  It is not satisfactory to be told that there would not be a scheme framed if, in fact, there were any proceedings pending because if there is a prosecution for a crime&mdash; I have been in situations where I have clutched at straws and have done things with an awareness of my rights&mdash;or if there is a claim for damages, out go the people responsible and in come the body corporate, if they can take advantage of this section.  There is no provision that I can see whereby the Charity Commissioners can preserve the rights of the objects of the charity against people who have, by virtue of the adoption of the scheme, been retired from the trust.  If the Minister can tell me that there is some preservation of right against them and show me where it is, that is the end of that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will appreciate that if, for example, there is a prosecution&mdash;we all agree that it is a very remote contingency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The possibility is assumed in the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  If there was a prosecution, the trustees as a body would not be prosecuted because it would be inappropriate to bring such a prosecution anyway, even if there was no question of incorporation.  Each individual trustee would be separately prosecuted for whatever offence was alleged against him and, therefore, the incorporation of the trustees as a body would not affect any such prosecution. It would not be sufficient in criminal <Col N="336" /> law to try to prosecute trustees C and D because trustees A and B had done something which they should not have done.  You would have to prove our old friend, <i>mens rea</i>, against A, B, C and D and, therefore, the incorporation of the trustees would not have any bearing on the actual prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it could arise.  Suppose it was a prosecution for conspiracy against the trustees.  That might be slightly different from the position the Minister is envisaging.  I want to clarify two other small points in connection with this section.  The first relates to the beginning of subsection (1) which provides, in effect, that on the making of a scheme any property shall automatically be vested in the body corporate without the necessity of any further transfer or deed of assurance.  What is intended by the provision in section 2 (2) (b) &ldquo;requiring or entitling any person to produce, execute or hand over any document or to do any other act or thing necessary to secure the vesting of the property belonging to the charity in accordance with the scheme&rdquo; is quite unnecessary having regard to the terms of section 3 (1) because under section 3 there is an automatic vesting&mdash;it is not necessary for anyone to do anything&mdash;going to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point goes back to a point that Senator Alexis FitzGerald made earlier.  There should be some type of certificate of title or other document issued by the Commissioners as evidence which could be put with the title documents in order to show that the body corporate is now the legal owner under this Act.  Suppose, in the course of exercising the administration of the trust, freehold or leasehold property of the trust was being sold, the solicitor investigating title for the purchaser will require to be able to put his finger on something definite which will show that the vesting, under subsection (3), has taken place.  I believe that there is no question of stamp duty arising here because there will not be any deed or any house, so that there will not be anything to attract stamp duty.  Even if there was a question of stamp duty presumably it would be purely <Col N="337" /> nominal as from one trustee to another.</P>
    <P>The last point I would like the Minister to clarify is in connection with subsection (2) which deals with registered lands.  Briefly, the provision here is in respect of registered land, and the Land Registry, when a scheme is being made, will register the body corporate in the appropriate register contained under the Act as owner of the land within the meaning of the Act.  I should like to clarify that what is intended here is that in whatever ownership the registered land was vested, say, the outgoing trustees, that ownership, and no more or no less, will be the ownership for which the body corporate is registered.  For example, there would not be any question that, where there is limited ownership automatically becoming absolute ownership by virtue of this, anything in the nature of burdens, equities or anything of that kind affecting the previous ownership would still continue to affect the ownership under this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be correct as, I am advised, ownership within the meaning of that Act, which are the words used in subsection (2) of section 3, would be the type of ownership vested before the framing of the scheme incorporating the trustees. In other words, if the charity trustees before their incorporation were registered as limited owners or, alternatively, they were registered as the absolute owners, the incorporated trustees would be correspondingly registered. For example, if the original trustees before incorporation were subject to equities, then clearly their incorporated trustees could not acquire an absolute title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as stamp duty is concerned, I do not think it would arise because there would not be a deed, but even if the certified copy of the sealed scheme was asked to be stamped the maximum could be 50p, which is the stamp duty on the appointment of new trustees; Land Registry fees would be payable, and I think that was the point of the reference to the payment of the appropriate fee in subsection (2) in so far as evidence is concerned of the establishment <Col N="338" /> of the incorporated trustees or of their incorporation.  The evidence which the subsection envisages to be produced to the Registrar of Titles is a copy of the scheme, under the seal of the board.  Once the registration is completed by the Registrar of Titles, the necessity for the document would no longer arise because the register would be conclusive as far as the ownership as registered on it is concerned. Assuming it was unregistered land, the appropriate document to be produced would be that referred to here, that is, a copy of the scheme under the seal of the board.</P>
    <P>So far as section 2 (2) (b) is concerned &ldquo;the other act&rdquo; referred to there would envisage, for example, the payment of Land Registry fees and the making of a formal application to the Registrar of Titles on what used to be called Form 15, but is probably under another number now, asking him to register under the documents provided. I think I have covered all the points that were raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Except the point about prosecution for conspiracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a prosecution for conspiracy that prosecution is against each of the persons indicted separately.  It is not a question of indicting two or more jointly: each of them is indicted separately; each is separately a defendant.  For example, it does not necessarily follow that if one such defendant were convicted of conspiracy that all the others must be convicted.  It would be possible to have one alone convicted.  Therefore, my view would be that any pre-existing prosecution, whether it was for conspiracy or otherwise, would survive against the defendant after the making of an incorporation scheme under section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that if there is some doubt about the prosecution and about the survival of the rights against trustees who are in breach, should there not be an expressed saver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly&mdash;and I am sure the Minister would consider what we have said on this&mdash;I would have liked to see a provision which I do not find here. <Col N="339" /> In the normal way, when a person withdraws from a trust he secures a release from the people coming in, so that he is clear of all liability.  Here the trustees' property is taken from them, but I do not find anything which releases the previous trustees from liability, even if a new target is open to the creditors of the trust, being the new body corporate.</P>
    <P>The third point&mdash;which is genuinely and frankly an ignorant question&mdash; arises on subsection (2).  I was brought up on the general theory that you spent your life in regard to title trying to keep trusts off the title.  If you had trusts of any kind, you did everything you could to make sure that possible purchasers would not get notice of the existence of trusts, and therefore they would not be involved in asking questions about whether you did all you should have done under the trust.</P>
    <P>If I looked at a register in the Land Register and I saw three people who are trustees, I imagine I should not get any notice from the three names appearing on the registration that there was a trust, charitable or otherwise, affecting these lands.  Is it possible that by virtue of the operation of subsection (2) any purchaser now will get notice that there is a charitable trust by virtue of the fact that this sealed copy has been noticed by the registrar and that a new charitable body corporate is the owner of the property, that a purchaser must ask all sorts of questions about the establishment of the body corporate and the power of the body corporate to do this, that and the other thing?  I had a fourth point but unfortunately it has escaped me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a probability that there would be an inhibition registered either now or under this Act in relation to a trust?  I am not an expert on land registry but I think the ordinary procedure where the registry would be aware of a trust would be that an inhibition would be registered on the folio prohibiting acts without notice to the beneficial owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally these sort of trusts are such that a purchaser knows perfectly well he is buying from <Col N="340" /> trustees.  However, as I understand the Registration of Title Act, he is not obliged to inquire into whether or not the trustees have dealt properly with the trust as long as he is satisfied that in selling to him they are not <i>ultra vires</i> their own power.  I think that that suffices.</P>
      <P>I accept Senator FitzGerald's point that he is put on more specific notice now that it is a trust, but I do not think he is under any obligation to make inquiries if he is a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value without actual&mdash; the opposite to constructive&mdash;notice. As far as I know, that is sufficient, and he will not be taken to have constructive notice of whatever difficulties exist in relation to the trust.  The normal sort of trust that one meets with fairly frequently is a sort of diocesan trust where the three trustees would be, say, the bishop and two parish priests of the diocese.  When you buy from the bishop and two parish priests you know that it is a trust of some kind, but you are not obliged to go behind the register.  I do not think your position would be improved by this: you are put on more express notice that it is a trust, but your obligation to inquire into the workings of it, as far as I understand it, is not increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will be aware of the train of thought which we are pursuing in this matter, with a view to removing any possible impediments to dispositions of property within these charities which might unwittingly be created by the desirable scheme proposed to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A final point.  There is provision for a copy under seal of the board binding on the Land Registry.  Does this not strongly suggest that there is need for an expressed provision in at least one case?  If there is need for an expressed provision as to how he is to be convinced of the existence and validity of the appropriateness of this scheme, there may be others in a like position &mdash;purchasers, courts and so on.  Referring to what I said on the section, this question of conclusiveness of a sealed scheme is a matter which could profitably be introduced for the protection of trustees in their suits and <Col N="341" /> dealings with property.  Any thing which will stop people going beyond that point will be found worthwhile for the administration of the trust.  That is all I have to say on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald has expressed very well the point I was trying to make to the Minister on this question.  In subsection (2) of section 3 we are dealing with satisfying a Government official.  It is provided that, in order to satisfy a State official, a particular procedure is laid down that the scheme under the seal must be produced.  It is equally important for the convenience of the administration of the trust that some simple method such as that should be furnished as conclusive evidence when dealing with people who will not be mere civil servants but may have had a hand in drafting the legislation and should know all there is to know.  When we are dealing with a solicitor for a purchaser to whom trust property is being sold in accordance with the administration of the trust, in that situation also some simple method of giving conclusive evidence should be written into the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I might be able to assist the Senators to some extent in regard to this particular problem by referring them to subsection (9) of section 43 of the 1961 Act, where there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is precisely a similar provision; where potentially, at least, all the difficulties which the Senators have referred to could have arisen but have not done so.  It is a very frequent occurrence that, where trustees are registered in these circumstances on a Land Registry folio, there is an inhibition precluding dealings without notice to the Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister but he is limiting his remarks to registered land.  The trust property need not necessarily consist of registered land.  I dealt recently, for example, with a purchase from the Representative Church Body of <Col N="342" /> property in Galway.  There I was furnished with a certified copy of the vesting order which had been made.  I was quite happy to accept that form. Take, for example, a purchase of property from the Adelaide Hospital or some other chartered body, any solicitor investigating the title for the purchaser will require a certified copy of the charter.  That will show&mdash;in one case it may actually show the title to the property&mdash;requirements as regards sealing and so on.</P>
      <P>It would not do any harm to the Bill if the Minister looked at this matter again.  It is entirely in ease of the scheme which might be drafted under the powers given by this Bill.  It is in ease of the Commissioners and the trustees that something of this kind should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the subsection to which the Minister refers only provides for the appointment of a new trustee.  It does not affect the transfer of the property in the same sense in which this section does.  It is a different situation.  Perhaps the same point deserves to be made on that subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subsection (8) of section 43 of the 1961 Act the appointment of a body corporate as sole trustee is envisaged and to that extent it is a similar sort of situation as the one we are discussing at the moment.  I am told that the number of cases dealt with under subsection (9) of section 43 of the 1961 Act during the past 11 years exceeds 300 and no problem has arisen.  Furthermore, I should like to make it clear to Senator O'Higgins that a copy of the scheme under these two sections will be available to any member of the public, apart from a solicitor for the purchaser who would be wise to read it anyway, from the Commissioners' office.</P>

I have no objection to a provision on those lines if it makes it any clearer.

      <P>I agree it would be and I would anticipate that the normal requirement of a purchaser would be that such a copy of the scheme would be produced.  In the normal way it would be a requisition of the solicitor for the purchaser that he would get such a certified copy of the scheme under the seal of the board.  It would be essential as evidence of what is in the scheme.  I have no objection, in principle, to providing specifically for it but I wonder is it necessary to do so when one bears in mind that the original conveyance to the charity trustees would be requisitioned before a solicitor for a purchaser from those trustees, whether incorporated or not, would close the sale.  It is self-evident that the solicitor for the trustees, after incorporation, on a sale, would provide a certified copy.  The solicitor for the purchaser could reasonably refuse to close the sale if he did not have it.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister says and it makes sense to me as a practising solicitor.  I agree that solicitors acting for purchasers would make this a requirement and act in that way.  It is possible that once their requisition in connection with the matter is complied with they would be satisfied.  In all professions and at all <Col N="344" /> times we come across the occasional person who may be difficult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The unwilling purchaser is an example.  You may also come across the situation where the purchaser is dependent on a loan from some financiers in order to complete. While the purchaser's solicitor may be satisfied additional requirements might be put up by the solicitors for the financing body.  They control the purse strings.  The purchasing solicitor has to get their requirements complied with.</P>
      <P>I may be wrong but it does seem that the probability is that if a scheme is made the Commissioners are going to spell out in that scheme, by schedule or some other way, the property that is involved.  They are going to spell out that on the sealing of this scheme the property schedule will automatically vest, by virtue of this scheme, in the body corporate.</P>
      <P>There does not seem to be an obligation on the Commissioners to act in that way.  If they make a scheme without listing the property that is to be affected it is open to them to do that. I do not think they would do it.  Or someone might make a slip.  Nevertheless, under section 3 once the scheme is made the property vests in the body corporate automatically.  If the Minister goes the inch further and provides that the production of the scheme, whether or not it contains the list of the property, must be accepted as conclusive evidence it would iron out difficulties which might, but probably will not arise.</P>

      <P>It takes place by the Commissioners making a scheme.  The <Col N="345" /> Commissioners might be induced improperly to make a scheme.  The type of scheme in use in Northern Ireland includes a schedule which sets out all the property.  That is the most satisfactory way.  In so far as the Senator refers to the difficulty which an unwilling purchaser or a purchaser's solicitor might have in relation to one of these documents, I would point out that he is in a much better position in purchasing from incorporated trustees than he would be in purchasing from a private individual because he can go to the Commissioner's office and for the appropriate fee get a certified copy of the scheme which will be to a great extent his root of title.  He can get the main document of title without any reference to the vendor's solicitor if that type of difficulty is being encountered. I have no objection to an amendment something on the lines suggested by the Senator but I am not satisfied that it is necessary.  If you provide specifically for such conclusiveness you could defeat your own purpose and let a defaulting or fraudulent trustee away with something which would not happen otherwise.  Trustees, whether incorporated under section 2 or unincorporated, are not in the same position as ordinary vendors.  They are subject at all times to very close supervision by the Commissioners.  That is the real protection for the beneficiaries and purchasers.</P>

      <P>The Minister has put some thoughts in my mind which make me urge him to have another look at this whole thing.  The Minister is quite right in adverting to the danger of the possibility, for example, that the Commissioners might be induced by fraud to make a scheme. The Minister asks what would be the situation if that arises.  Once the scheme is made the vesting takes place under section 3.  That is crystal clear. If a situation arises where the Commissioners have been induced to make a scheme by the fraud of the trustees I should imagine that as soon as that is discovered the reaction of the Commissioners will be to exercise their powers under subsection (2) (ii) (b) to amend by a subsequent scheme, <i>et cetera.</i>  If in the meanwhile the sale has <Col N="346" /> taken place what is the position (a) of the trustees, and (b) of the purchaser?</P>
      <P>I should imagine that so far as the purchaser is concerned once the establishment of the scheme has been proved his title will be good.  In that set of circumstances the Commissioners are helpless even if the original scheme was made on false premises or induced by fraud.  If a sale has taken place no amendment of the scheme by them should in any event impair the title of the <i>bona fide</i> purchaser who purchased in good faith on the basis of the original scheme having been made. Once the Minister adverts to the danger of anything like that happening he should also consider whether or not it is necessary to write into this Bill somewhere the fact that in circumstances such as that the title of a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value will not be affected.</P>

      <P>What the Minister and Senator O'Higgins have said&mdash;and I do not know whether I agree with either, both or neither of them&mdash;emphasises for me the extreme importance of having a provision to the effect of the one I argued for on section 2, that there will be a single piece of paper which will not disclose to outsiders anything more than the simple fact that this body corporate exists and which is signed by somebody authorised under the statute to do so.  Then it will not be possible for anyone affected subsequently by actions authorised under the performance and administration of that body corporate to raise questions as to whether it was fraudulently procured or otherwise.  This is the reason why this section can be found in all the general Acts dealing with the regulation of bodies corporate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of an ordinary trading company a point arose in regard to the signature by a minor of one of the two subscribers to the memorandum and articles of association where it was successfully attacked.  Then the Bill was introduced which made that kind of attack ever afterwards impossible because the section of the statute stated &ldquo;that is it&rdquo;.  This particular point about the validity of the existence <Col N="347" /> of the body corporate cannot be raised.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about the rights of anybody to pay his 1s. to the Charity Commissioners and get inspection. This is an important point.  I do not see anything here giving the right to anybody to obtain these copies. Secondly, I am not sure it is desirable they should get them.  Is a charitable trust to be put in a worse position than a private company under the law as it exists at present with regard to the publication of its affairs?  Is a charitable trust which seeks to get the benefit of body corporate status under these sections to be in the position that anybody can discover what property or liabilities they have and all the internal affairs of that body corporate?</P>
    <P>It is legitimate that an outsider should find out whether this body corporate is properly incorporated but no more than that unless it is deliberate policy to make public the affairs.  If it is the general position that a charity is obviously of a public nature and the affairs of which can be made public, there is nothing retrograde in that continuing for a body corporate.  If a private charity for a public purpose is entitled to have its affairs kept free or if a man decides to give half of his estate for a public purpose he may not want it to be known; and if there is not some proposition or law about which I do not know, why then should this be made public through body corporate status?</P>

      <P>This is provision which enables trustees to effect an agreement for the trustees of other charities whereby the charities must come under common control and apply their use for the benefit of a common charitable purpose.  There is a restriction on that providing that property which is vested in trustees for the benefit of a charity for the furtherance of education cannot be used for the benefit of a charitable purpose which is not for the furtherance of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statute should entitle a donor or a creator of a charity to provide to the contrary and expressly exclude that his charity should be amalgamated with another.  Some years ago I discussed this matter with someone who was establishing a charity and who asked me the question which is before the House.  &ldquo;Is it possible that anybody can bring together this with any other like charity?&rdquo;  I investigated the law relative to the matter and so provided in the instrument creating that charity <Col N="349" /> that that could not, according to then existing law, be effected.</P>
    <P>There ought to be a saver for the person who does not wish to have any other purpose allied to the one he had in mind to achieve.  There is a question of principle in the amalgamation of charities.  If an extremely bigoted Protestant or Catholic leaves his property for bigoted purposes it is a monstrous reversal of all his intentions if, notwithstanding his explicit desire with regard to his accumulations or properties, the Commissioners can approve the application of that property to purposes different from those he had in mind.</P>
    <P>There may be a lot of knowledge on the matter with regard to particular religious denominations.  Does this mean that, if you leave your money to further Christian purposes, it can be married to Mahommedan purposes? What is a religious denomination in this sense?  Despite what we have done recently in the constitutional referendum there should be some clear-minded view as to what we mean when we talk about a religious denomination.  I imagine that lying behind this is a burst of ecumenical enthusiasm&mdash;a tremendous feeling that if the Methodists want to get together with the Presbyterians, the Presbyterians with the Anglicans, and the Anglicans with the Roman Catholics, nothing should stand in their way.  I should like to know the background thinking with regard to this section.</P>
    <P>In his Second Reading speech the Minister told us a good deal about the Bill.  It was much too helpful for a Second Reading speech because it helped me to understand the Bill, and if I had not understood the Bill it might be more comfortable for the Minister.  The Minister did not say too much about the background thinking on this Bill.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (d) states&mdash;</P>
    <P>with the approval of the Board, to make and carry into effect an agreement with the trustees of one or more other charities...</P>
    <P>Why could the trustees of one charity not agree with the trustees of another <Col N="350" /> charity to bring their two charities together?  What does the word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; mean?  Is there any power to do this?  Is it not a mere tentative proposal which may possibly have legal effect if a scheme emerges from it?  Is &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; the appropriate word here?</P>
    <P>With regard to these amendments, I am not entirely satisfied that notices of the proposed amendments should not be given in accordance with subsections (5) or (6).  Perhaps I will withdraw that point.  Having made that observation I realise that the amendments in mind are of a formal or minor nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator raised the point that a testator or a donor may not wish to see the charity which he has established merged with another charity and that he should have the right not to have it so merged.  There is something to be said for that, but I want to make it clear that this Bill does not change the law on that point.  I would refer the Senator to section 47 of the 1961 Act which sets out the occasions for applying property <i>cy-pres.</i>  It states that&mdash;</P>
      <P>where the original purposes, in whole or in part&mdash;(ii) cannot be carried out, or cannot be carried out according to the directions given and to the spirit of the gift;</P>
      <P>Subject to subsection (2) the original purposes of the gift may be altered to allow the property given or part of it to be applied <i>cy-pres.</i>  We have that situation frequently in this country, particularly in relation to gifts to some of the more obscure Protestant denominations where the numbers of beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries have so diminished that the objects of the charity have in effect failed in their original form or in accordance with the original expressed wishes and spirit of the gift of the testator.  It was recognised in the 1961 Act that it would be wrong to allow charitable funds to be lost to potential charities where there were similar sorts of charities which would welcome those funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 is an extension of a concept of <i>cy-pres</i> in section 47 of the 1961 <Col N="351" /> Act.  I do not understand Senator Alexis FitzGerald's difficulty in relation to subsection (2) (d) of this section where the trustees agree.  Of course, the trustees can agree and the Commissioners would not undertake any scheme or tentative scheme under section 4 unless all the trustees of both charities were in agreement.  The only limitation proposed on the board's powers is that educational trusts would have to be kept separate from other charitable non-educational trusts.  That is because one can draw a clear distinction between them and other types of trusts and the benefit of education is a separate and very particular type of charity.  It might be felt that one would not be applying things <i>cy-pres</i> if an educational trust were given away to some non-educational purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, as I understand it, has nothing to do with <i>cy-pres.</i>  There is a section in this Bill which deals with <i>cy-pres.</i>  This does not deal with the situation of <i>cypres</i> which the Minister said is dealt with by section 47 of the 1961 Act which defines the circumstances in which the original purposes of a charity may be altered and spells out that, as one of these circumstances, where the original purposes have not been fulfilled or cannot be carried out, or cannot be carried out according to the directions given in the spirit of the gift, section 47 would take care of it. This is a situation where it is not <i>cypres</i>, where the original purposes can be carried out in accordance with the directions given and the spirit of the gift achieved, and yet notwithstanding the fact that a <i>cy-pres</i> situation does not arise that this section is going to allow an amalgamation of charities.  I am concerned to have the principle of this situation discussed and light thrown on it and satisfaction expressed with regard to it.</P>
      <P>Somebody enlightened enough to think up his own situation well in advance should be entitled to provide that this section shall not apply to his charity.  That is the particular point I am concerned to make.  We should think a bit more about the whole principle of this.</P>

      <P>If the Senator reads what I said, he will find that I did not say that these dealt with matters <i>cypres.</i> I said that they were similar to it and in many ways were an extension of that underlying doctrine.  I agree that, strictly speaking, it is not <i>cy-pres.</i>  Often the easiest way of explaining some of these problems is to give a concrete example&mdash;I do not want to cause any difficulty to any particular charity, several of which make no secret of the fact that they are under difficulties at the moment in relation to the sort of matters that are dealt with in this section. The principal trusts involved are the King's Hospital in Dublin, the Waterford and Bishop Foy Endowed Schools, Wilson's Hospital, Multyfarnham, and the Iveagh Trust.</P>
      <P>The case which is particularly provided for in subparagraphs (d) and (e) is the Waterford and Bishop Foy Endowed Schools, who wish to amalgamate with the Newtown School, Waterford.  There is an obligation on the governors of the Waterford and Bishop Foy Endowed Schools, under the Waterford and Bishop Foy Endowed Schools Act, 1902, that they should be Protestant.  There is an obligation on the governors of Newtown School, Waterford, that they should be Quakers.  Apparently Quakers are not regarded as Protestants.  Both these schools are very keen that they should amalgamate.  In these two subsections we are endeavouring to give them legal power to do that.  I need not go into the difficulties encountered by the King's Hospital, which are well known to all solicitors.  The Iveagh Trust have some difficult problems too.  I just cannot say that I am familiar offhand with the problems of Wilson's Hospital, but I understand they are somewhat analogous.</P>

      <P>That is right.  Under section 15 of the Charitable Donations Bequests (Ireland) Act, 1844, a number of Catholic churches were vested in the Commissioners at that time. The section was repealed by the Charities Act, 1961, and the churches were left vested in the Commissioners. The Commissioners now want to transfer these back to the appropriate dioceses but they have no power to do it.  A request has come to them from the Bishop of Elphin&mdash;I take it that is the Roman Catholic Bishop of Elphin&mdash;to have a church in Elphin, County Roscommon, re-transferred to the diocese of Elphin.  There are three other churches affected by it, at Gallen, County Offaly, Doon, County Limerick, and Abbeyside, County Waterford.  It will enable the appropriate transfers to be made.  It is presumably accepted that the beneficial ownership existed in the proposed transferees in any event.</P>

Unless the explanation which the Minister has given was available to a person reading section 5, I do not think the person reading it would have the slightest notion what this was about.  One would get the impression from section 5 that it would be open to anyone to apply to the Commissioners to have vested in him or her any land which is vested in the board under section 15 of the 1844 Act.

    <P>(1)  Where on an application made by a person having an interest in relation to land comprised either in a lease made pursuant to the Leases for Schools (Ireland) Act, 1881, or in any other lease made for a charitable purpose, the Board is satisfied that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the person entitled to the lessor's interest in such lease is unknown or cannot be found, and</P>

    <P>(b)  in any other case, in trust for such charitable purposes as may be so specified,</P>
    <P>together with, or freed and discharged from, such rights or liabilities connected with the land as may be so specified.</P>
    <P>(3)  An order under this section shall not be made until the expiration of two months after public notice of the proposal to make it has been given in such manner as the Board consider most effectual for <Col N="355" /> ensuring publicity thereof and for bringing the proposal to the attention of persons interested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago the Commissioners brought to my notice a problem in relation to disused national schools and teachers' residences held under leases, at nominal rents, granted under the Leases for Schools (Ireland) Act, 1881.  Under section 5 of that Act, certain covenants are implied as if expressly inserted in the lease.  These included covenants to the effect that the premises should not be used for any purposes other than those expressed in the lease, and that if the premises continuously ceased for a period of three years to be used for these purposes the lessor or his successors in title may re-enter.  In a number of instances, leases contain an additional covenant that the lease shall determine if the premises cease to be used for the purpose for which the land was granted.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners estimate that there are now some 500 national schools and some 200 teachers' residences held under leases granted under the 1881 Act which are no longer required for the purposes for which the leases were granted.  Over 100 applications have been made to the Commissioners with a view to the sale of the property in question.  However, in a large number of cases it has proved impossible to ascertain the successors in title to the original grantors.  In other cases, where the identity of the successors in title has been ascertained it has not been possible to trace their whereabouts.  In all such cases the board have ruled that they have no power to sanction the sale of the property until a waiver of the covenants has been executed by the person entitled to the freehold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power, who dealt with this matter for me on the Second Stage, mentioned that it was proposed to deal with this problem by introducing an amendment on this Stage, in agreement with the Minister for Education.  In the meantime the Commissioners have requested that the proposed amendment <Col N="356" /> should be expanded somewhat to cover other leases for charitable purposes.</P>
    <P>A case in point is that of a plot of ground at Ballinacurra in the city of Limerick which was leased to the Society of Friends, otherwise known as the Quakers, for use as a cemetery. The lease contained a covenant to the effect that if the plot should cease to be so used, or be used for any other purposes, it would be held upon trust for the benefit of the heirs, executors and assigns of the lessor.  The Society now wish to use part of the plot to build a meeting house, but they feel that this covenant in the lease prevents them from doing it.</P>
    <P>To go through the subsections of the proposed section, subsection (1) enables the Commissioners, where the successor in title <i>et cetera</i> to the grantor of a lease under the Leases for Schools (Ireland) Act, 1881, or of any other lease for charitable purposes is unknown or cannot be found, to make an order appointing trustees of the land comprised in the lease and vesting the land in the trustees.  The remaining subsections are self-explanatory.  The Minister for Education has indicated that he is in agreement with the terms of this amendment and supports it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, one does not desire to obstruct the proper utilisation of any estate in Ireland or any property here for the benefit of people, but is it not important that when making an amendment we make it in such a fashion that it cannot, in any circumstances, be challenged? Take a phrase which appears in subsection (2):</P>
      <P>...an order under this section shall vest in the person or persons specified in the order the land</P>
      <P>and again,</P>
      <P>...freed and discharged from, such rights or liabilities...</P>
      <P>Is not that, in fact, to confiscate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Must there not be some provision analogous to the provision in the Mineral Developments Act, 1940? Under that Act exactly the same problem exists in regard to persons <Col N="357" /> who cannot be traced and yet who may have an interest in the minerals on a property.  That matter is being considered at the moment.  At least that Act did design a scheme which has worked for 32 years whereby the minerals could be utilised without getting title from the people who owned them because they could not be found, the procedures under the 1931 Act not being found adequate to deal with the situation.  There is in that Act a provision for compensation for persons who come along and can prove that they were entitled afterwards to the mineral rights involved. There could be mineral rights in the Quaker cemetery.  There could be mineral rights in any of the properties referred to here, but they are in their own special position.</P>
    <P>There could be valuable property involved here.  Should there not be some theoretical structure under which compensation could be got by affected persons, if this is to stand up to the constitutional test with regard to private property?  Is this a delimitation, or a regulation under the Constitution?  I am not sure that it is without some provision for some compensation in this situation.  After all, the lessor here did give a title which provided that it would come back to him and he could do nothing about bringing it back to him until there was a degree of non-user specified, if I understand the Minister correctly, in the lease itself.  It cannot be argued against him that he has failed to act.  He can only claim his right when there is a non-user specified in the lease.  Only then can he start his re-entry process.  His rights are alive and if they are to be taken from him there should be some fund constituted against which he can claim compensation if the Minister wants this section to stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole point of the section is to deal with people who are not available and cannot be found. The short answer to what Senator Alexis FitzGerald has raised is that there is nobody to compensate.  Subsection (3) states that the order may not be made until the expiration of at <Col N="358" /> least two months after public notice is given, which indicates that the Commissioners and, presumably, the charity involved will make every effort to try to find somebody to whom this notice can be given.  Another important thing to remember is that what, in effect, is being taken away is an implied benefit for the lessor under an implied covenant under section 5 of the 1881 Act. It is not even an expressed covenant; it is implied by that section, and it is a covenant of continuous user as a school.</P>
      <P>The Act envisages long leases being given at nominal rents and since this is only an implied covenant no lessor, or successor in title of a lessor, would, under these circumstances, regard himself as having a compensatory interest in the property.  The fact is that there are 500 such premises and there are orders pending in regard to 100 of them and neither the Commissioners nor the beneficiaries have been able to find anyone.</P>
      <P>It is also worth bearing in mind that the only rights which are barred by this proposed new section are the rights of re-entry.  Under the 1881 Act, I am advised, the average quantity of land demised was one rood, statute measure.</P>

      <P>On the last point the Minister made, the Minister said that all that was being given to the applicant was the interest freed from the particular requirement under the 1881 Act.  Am I right in that?  It seems to me that he is getting the lessor's interest and that that is the purpose of this section.  I see the argument very clearly in favour of this.  Any practising solicitor, particularly since the Ground Rents Act, 1967, came into being, knows the difficulties which one frequently experiences in tracing back title under leasehold interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can certainly appreciate the problem when the Minister refers to 500 schools where the present owner of the lessor's interest is unknown.  It seems that the section is endeavouring to treat the position fairly by the provision <Col N="359" /> in subsection (3) regarding the giving of notice in such a way that will ensure the maximum publicity.  But am I not right in thinking that, assuming everything is complied with, that what is being done here is that the lessor's interest, that is, the interest of the person who cannot be traced, will be vested in the applicant?</P>
    <P>Does the section refer not merely to cases where covenants are implied under the Act of 1881?  Again I am putting this in the nature of a query to the Minister.  Am I not right in thinking that the section will apply regardless of how the lease arose, once it is a lease which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The final point to which I want to draw the Minister's attention is that this proposed section starts in the way I would have recommended to the Minister that the last section should have started.  The last section was: &ldquo;where on the application of any person.&rdquo; This starts in the way I should have recommended that one should have started: &ldquo;Where on an application made by a person having an interest.&rdquo; It is better that it should read this way.</P>

      <P>So far as the 1881 leases are concerned, the order under subsection (2) (a), as it would be made, must be in trust for such educational purposes as may be so specified.  In other words, it must be for some further educational purpose; in any other case, in trust for such charitable purposes as may be so specified.  &ldquo;Together with or freed and discharged from, such rights and liabilities connected with the land as may be so specified.&rdquo;  That does not mean that the whole freehold would be vested in the lessee or in his successors in title.  There is no confiscation of the freehold.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Commissioners advise me&mdash;and I know it is the wrong thing to say in the House, because it does not bind the Commissioners if the terms used in the section are wider than that&mdash;that the only thing which they would specify that the land should be freed and discharged from would be the right of re-entry.  It would possibly be unfair to ask Senators to accept that unless it is spelled out.  I can only pass it on for what it is worth.  However, I have no doubt that the Commissioners, who are a long-serving body of men, not subject to change like the tide, are absolutely certain to honour their intentions in this regard.  They tend to be succeeded by men who are equally conservative and equally honourable.  I have no doubt that we can rest fairly assured for the future in that respect.</P>

      <P>I do not want to prolong this and I am not arguing with the Minister.  Is this not for the purpose of enabling the schools, or teachers' residences, as the case may be, to be sold?  I got the picture&mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;that in various places throughout the country there are disused schools and disused teachers' residences which would be found desirable to sell, and where the intention may be to sell to private individuals, possibly for use as holiday homes.  If I am right in that&mdash;possibly I am not&mdash;I cannot understand why they are to be sold subject to requirements which will require the buildings to be used either for educational purposes or for charitable purposes.</P>

      <P>I do not usually look for ministerial orders in this House, but I should like to raise the question again, as I did on Second Reading, as to whether one might not in these gravely inflationary times have some provision whereby there could be a ministerial order here for increasing the <i>cy-prés</i> jurisdiction even beyond the £25,000 which is specified in this.  I raise this particularly in the context of the fact that there is no limit in Great Britain, and that it was recommended there should be no limit in Northern Ireland, although there is a limit of, I think, £5,000.  I wonder if the Minister would see merit in that? I do not see any point in coming back here in five or six years time to look for an extension of that figure from £25,000 to £50,000.  The power of jurisdiction is admirable and, personally, I would argue for an unlimited jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>This section, which amends section 52 of the Charities Act, 1961, reverses the present rule requiring personal representatives to publish advertisements of charitable devises and bequests contained in wills of deceased persons unless exemption is granted by the board under the powers conferred on them by section 20 of that Act.  It turns the thing around.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We have raised many questions.  Next week.</P>

      <P>There were no amendments put down on the Committee <Col N="368" /> Stage.  I know that does not absolutely preclude it but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not fair of the Senator to press me on that.  I am not an obstructionist but Senator O'Higgins and I have made some points which should be considered.</P>

      <P>In fairness to the Minister I believe he was agreeing on the assumption that we would be sitting next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I took it for granted that the House would sit next week but I now gather that that is not so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is doubtful if the House will sit next week.  There is no other business available for us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no matter of controversy involved in the Bill.  I had hoped to get it through as it has been before the House for some time. Unfortunately, some of the powers contained in the Bill are very urgently needed.</P>
