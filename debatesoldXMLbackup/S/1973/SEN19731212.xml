      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a voluntary contribution of £3,100,070 towards the fourth replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association (IDA), one of the World Bank group of organisations.  This replenishment is necessary to permit the association to continue to approve credits for projects in underdeveloped countries after June, 1974, when the resources at present available to it are expected to be fully committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the formation of the association in 1960, Ireland became a member and subscribed £1,147,022 to the capital. This country also made a voluntary contribution equivalent to more than £2 million, at present exchange rates, towards the previous replenishment. This contribution was expressed in 1960 dollars and was authorised by the International Development Association (Amendment) Act, 1971.  We are required to adjust the amount to take account of changes in exchange rates.  The initial capital subscribed and £250,000 of the voluntary contribution have been released at the <Col N="274" /> association's request for financing of expenditure in eligible member countries. The remainder will be drawn down over a number of years proportionately with drawings of money provided by other contributing countries.</P>
    <P>The association was established to provide credits on easy terms to the poorest and least developed member countries, in practice those with an annual <i>per capita</i> income of less than $300.  These credits are repayable over 50 years and are subject to an interest charge of only ¾ per cent per annum to cover administration expenses.</P>
    <P>IDA is the oldest and most experienced international institution providing aid for developing countries on concessionary terms and assistance in institution building.  For the most part funds are provided for specific projects and great care is taken to ensure that the money is used to the best advantage. It is the policy of the association to give the largest measure of support to efforts towards economic and social structural adjustment aimed at a more equitable distribution of income and opportunities.  If it is to continue this vital role, it requires an assured and increasing volume of financial resources.</P>
    <P>IDA membership is divided into two groups.  The original part I members were those industrialised countries which subscribed in gold or freely convertible currencies more than three-quarters of the initial capital of $1,000 million. Part II countries subscribed the balance but only 10 per cent of their subscriptions was payable in gold or freely convertible currencies, the remainder being payable in non-convertible national currencies.  A small number of the original part II countries, including Ireland, later agreed to the release of their 90 per cent portions in freely convertible form.  There are now 21 part I and 92 part II members.  In general, part I countries provide the resources of IDA aid and the poorest of the part II members are the recipients of the aid.</P>
    <P>In view of the substantial economic progress of this country since 1960 and the fact that EEC countries, except Ireland, are in part I the Government decided recently that the time had <Col N="275" /> come to apply for part I membership. Having made available our full initial capital subscription in freely convertible currency some years ago and having contributed on a voluntary basis to the previous replenishment of the resources of the association this country had in fact, though not formally, assumed the obligations of part I membership.  Our application for the formal change in status, which has been approved, represents a clear indication of the Government's intention to play its part in providing aid for the more needy peoples of the world. It involves a moral commitment to contribute towards the financing, through the association, of the social and economic development of the more impoverished countries.  The commitment is of a voluntary nature and contributions are negotiable with the association, in the light of the prevailing overall economic situation.</P>
    <P>The lending operations of the association have been financed mainly by the initial capital subscriptions and by special replenishments of its funds on three occasions.  The first and second replenishments covering the period to 1971 were provided by part I members and by a long-term loan from Switzerland, a non-member.  Contributions towards the third replenishment, covering the period 1972 to 1974, were made by part I members and three part II members&mdash;Ireland, Spain and Yugoslavia.  There was also a Swiss loan and a voluntary contribution from New Zealand, a non-member, which has recently applied for part I membership.</P>
    <P>Following consultations between the association and the contributing countries, including Ireland, agreement has been reached on a fourth replenishment of $1,500 million a year for three years, subject to the necessary legislative authority being given in the participating countries.  There was general support for the view that an annual amount of about $1,140 million in 1975 would represent the same constant effort as the annual contribution of $800 million, in 1960 dollars, to the third replenishment&mdash; that is, if part I countries made contributions <Col N="276" /> at that level, they would contribute exactly the same percentage (0.035 per cent) of their GNP in 1975 as in 1972 and that an increase above this level was justified by the growing needs of the poorest countries for these resources.  Our proposed contribution to the fourth replenishment, equivalent to $7.5 million, represents about the same proportion of the total as on the previous occasion,</P>
    <P>The executive directors of the association have recommended the governors, representing all member countries, to vote by 31st January, 1974, on a resolution to give effect to the proposals.  As governor of the association for Ireland, I propose to vote in favour of the resolution.  This will not become effective and the obligation to contribute new resources will not become binding on any member, unless and until members, including at least 12 part I members, whose contributions aggregate not less than $3,500 million, give the association formal notification that they will make the contribution authorised for each of them.</P>
    <P>The Bill, if enacted, will enable this country to continue to assist in the valuable work of IDA in fostering the improvement of the economic and social welfare of the very poorest countries.  The Bill was supported wholeheartedly and without reservations in the Dáil and I feel sure that the support of this House will be no less enthusiastic.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The aims of the International Development Association are aims which all the Members of this House would agree with.  We are in the position in this case of being on the side of those who are giving help to less developed and poorer countries.  Much of the time, certainly in EEC, we are looking for help from bigger countries, so when this occasion presents itself to us for helping those who are less well-off than we are it is certainly an occasion which we should rise to and welcome.  I have no hesitation in welcoming this Bill and supporting it.</P>

      <P>I also welcome this Bill, and particularly our intention of increasing our contribution towards the International Development Association's Fund.  I am particularly pleased that this country recognises the part it has to play in assisting underdeveloped countries to improve their economic position.  I know that this has been the policy of successive Irish Governments, but it is pleasing to see it being put into concrete effect.  I particularly welcome in the Bill the figure of £3 million which we are contributing to the fund.  It is very much in line with the Government's decision, carried out by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to establish an agency to encourage and administer personal service overseas by Irish people.</P>
      <P>In the past we have sometimes provided our help and our contributions to underdeveloped countries in rather roundabout ways.  The establishment of our own personal service agency is a very important step.  The movement described by the Minister for Finance from a part II country into part I is pleasing.  This House will fully support efforts by Ireland to become more fully involved in the problems of the developing countries in the Third World.</P>
      <P>We might just reflect that we have always contributed much in terms of personnel to developments in the Third World, particularly through our missionary societies.  It is hard to measure a contribution of this nature, but its value is very well recognised by the countries who have benefited.  I am particularly pleased that as well as sending our people to work overseas we are in a position to make reasonable financial contribution to the development of Third World countries.  It underlines our commitment&mdash;the commitment which has been fulfilled by missionaries, by teachers, by doctors, for hundreds of years to the underdeveloped countries.  I am delighted that we are playing our full part in this effort.</P>

      <P>I should like to express my thanks to the House for the manner in which they received the Bill.  As I mentioned at the beginning.  I anticipated that it <Col N="278" /> would get such a reception because there is the general desire in this country to give something more than lip service by way of assistance to poorer countries.</P>
      <P>We are, in fact, contributing most generously through the private sector. We do not know the precise extent of private assistance which is given, but it is not improbable that the amount of private assistance per head coming from Ireland is much greater that it is from more developed countries.  However, that is not a sufficient answer. We have accepted a commitment to give a substantial increase in official development aid.  This year compared with last year we have doubled the amount of development aid which this country is rendering, and we hope it will be possible and we shall make every endeavour to achieve a continuing growth in this aid.  We have a long way to go before development aid from Ireland will be commensurate with what we believe it ought to be.</P>
      <P>With our growing prosperity we will ensure that a proper percentage of our increasing wealth will be given to the poorer countries.  Ireland gives most of its assistance in this field to multilateral organisations.  We do not attach conditions. We are not a colonial power or a power which is endeavouring to maintain or build up in return for development aid commercial contacts for our own profit.  The aid which we have given in the past was given out of a sense of moral obligation, and this is the best way in which a country can give such aid.  We do not rule out the possibility that we would encourage a certain amount of bilateral aid, as this gives more direct control over such aid.  The aid which we are giving through the International Development Association has no strings attached and it will go to the developing countries and be expended there in a way which will give them the very best return. That would be in keeping with the desire of all the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I attended the annual meeting of the World Bank in Nairobi this year I felt privileged to be able to announce there the Government's declaration in this regard, which I said was subject to getting the <Col N="279" /> approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas who have been ready and generous in giving that approval.  This augurs well for the future.</P>
    <P>It was the first time there was a meeting of the World Bank and the International Development Association in a developing country, the first time that any developing country had sufficient accommodation in which to house the annual meeting of the World Bank Group and the IMF.  The entourage was not inconsiderable.  The fact that this can now take place in a developing country is in itself an indication that some of the benefit is beginning to percolate into these areas.  Even Kenya has a long way to go before it can be regarded as providing adequate living standards for the millions of human beings who live there.</P>
    <P>This is a small faltering step we are taking today but a good one in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for its assistance.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable effect to be given in Irish domestic law to the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, drawn up at Tokyo in September, 1963, and the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft drawn up at The Hague in December, 1970. Some of the provisions in the Conventions can be applied administratively while others require legislation. The enactment of this Bill will clear the way for this country to formally adhere to the Conventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> The Tokyo Convention came into force internationally on 4th December, 1969, after the twelfth ratification was made and The Hague Convention came into force on 14th October, 1971, after the tenth ratification was made.  The Tokyo Convention is now in operation between 67 states and The Hague Convention between 57 states.</P>
    <P>The principal states with which we have regular air services, the US, the UK, France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, have already ratified either or both of the Conventions.  The Tokyo Convention was intended to establish international co-operation with a view to ensuring that persons who committed crimes on board aircraft in flight would not escape apprehension merely for lack of jurisdiction.  It made it clear that the state of registration of an aircraft had the authority to apply its laws to events occurring on board its aircraft while in flight in any place whatsoever.  It provided the aircraft commander with the necessary authority to deal with offenders.  It delineated the duties and responsibilities of the contracting state in which the aircraft landed, including its authority over and responsibility to any offender.  It also dealt with hijacking of aircraft but in this regard it confined itself to requiring a contracting state to restore control of the aircraft to the lawful commander and to permit passengers and crew arriving in its territory to continue their journey.  It did not provide for the establishment of hijacking as an international offence and it did not call specifically for punishment of hijackers.</P>
    <P>The Hague Convention of 1970 expands and strengthens the Tokyo Convention provisions in regard to hijacking by providing at international level for the definition of the offence of hijacking, the establishment of jurisdiction over it and its punishment by heavy penalties or extradition of the offender, where appropriate.  The Convention makes hijacking an international offence in that, with some exceptions, it requires states to establish jurisdiction over the offence <Col N="281" /> irrespective of where it is committed, the nationality of the offender or the state of registration of the aircraft.</P>
    <P>The purposes of the Bill can be grouped under three main headings. Firstly, it clarifies the legal position in regard to crimes of a general nature committed on board Irish aircraft.  Secondly, it empowers the commander of Irish aircraft and of aircraft of any other state party to the Tokyo Convention to restrain, disembark or deliver up to the competent authorities in the state where the aircraft lands, any persons on board who have committed, or are about to commit any general offence on board or who jeopardise the safety of the aircraft or persons on board. Thirdly, it establishes hijacking as an international offence irrespective of the nationality of the aircraft, the nationality of the offender or the place where the offence is committed.  These are the main features of the Bill and I will explain each of them in detail.</P>
    <P>In regard to the application of Irish law to Irish aircraft in flight outside the State the present position is that, except for certain internationally recognised offences such as murder, an offence committed on an Irish aircraft while outside the State is not amenable to the Irish courts in the same way as an offence on an Irish registered ship.  This represents a serious gap in jurisdiction particularly in regard to offences committed when the aircraft is flying over international waters not within the jurisdiction of any other estate.  In such cases there is a danger that an alleged offender may escape apprehension merely for want of jurisdiction.  The Tokyo Convention accords international recognition to the exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction under the circumstances contemplated in the Convention. The Bill reflects this by providing that any act or omission which would constitute an offence if committed within the State shall equally constitute an offence if committed on an Irish aircraft in flight outside the State.</P>
    <P>As a logical extension of the provisions about jurisdiction, the Bill furnishes the aircraft commander with <Col N="282" /> powers to deal with persons who commit offences on board or who by their actions jeopardise the safety of the flight.  In such cases the commander of an Irish aircraft, or of an aircraft of any other state party to the Tokyo Convention, is empowered to take such measures as he reasonably considers to be necessary to protect the safety of the aircraft or its passengers or to maintain good order or discipline on board the aircraft.  These measures may include putting the person involved under restraint, disembarking or delivering him to the competent authorities of the state of landing.  Provision is made to safeguard the rights of individuals and to ensure that they are not kept under restraint any longer than is necessary. The Bill specifies limits beyond which restraint shall not be exercised and imposes on the commander the obligation of reporting to the appropriate authorities on any persons under restraint, disembarked or delivered.  It lays down penalties for failure by the commander to observe this.</P>
    <P>The establishment of hijacking as an international offence is covered by section 11 of the Bill.  The effect of this section is that any person who interferes with the control of an aircraft by force, threat or intimidation will be guilty of an offence under Irish law irrespective of the offender's own nationality, the state of registration of the aircraft or the place where the offence is committed.  Attempted hijacking and other acts of violence connected with hijacking are similarly covered.  The offender will thus be amenable to Irish courts and subject to prosecution or extradition, as appropriate.  In this way hijacking, including attempted hijacking or other acts of violence connected with hijacking, is established as an international offence.  These provisions, taken in conjunction with the corresponding provisions in the legislation of other contracting states, are designed to ensure as far as possible that a hijacker will find no place of refuge.</P>
    <P>The Hague Convention applies only if the place of take-off or the place of actual landing of the aircraft involved is outside the State of <Col N="283" /> registration.  The effect of this is that a hijacking of an aircraft on a domestic flight within its own country is not covered by the Convention.</P>
    <P>A further limitation on the scope of the Convention is that it does not apply to aircraft used in the military, customs or police services.  In the interests of affording the greatest possible protection to all forms of aviation, the Bill goes beyond the Hague provisions by extending the offence of hijacking to all cases of unlawful seizure of an aircraft, including a state aircraft, where:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the act is committed by a citizen of Ireland or a person habitually resident in the State;</P>
    <P>(b)  the act is committed in or over the State, or</P>
    <P>(c)  the aircraft is an Irish controlled aircraft.</P>
    <P>For example, a hijacking of an Aer Lingus aircraft flying between Dublin and Cork will be covered by the Bill although it is outside the scope of the Convention.  This will make for consistency in the application of Irish law and provide more effective and all-embracing legislative provisions to deal with hijacking.</P>
    <P>The Convention requires that the offence of hijacking shall be punishable by severe penalties.  The Bill reflects this requirement and the enormous gravity of the offence by providing that an offender, on conviction on indictment, shall be liable for a term of imprisonment up to life imprisonment. It also provides that if a state does not extradite an alleged hijacker it shall without exception whatsoever submit the case for the purpose of prosecution. Contracting states are accordingly afforded the choice between extradition and prosecution and no substantive change in our existing extradition law is called for.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Extradition Act, 1965, provides that extradition shall not be granted where the offence in question is regarded as having been committed in the State.  In the case of offences committed within the territorial area of the State, therefore, we <Col N="284" /> would discharge our obligation under the Convention by way of prosecution. However, section 11 of the Bill by creating hijacking an international offence automatically brings it within the jurisdiction, no matter where it is committed, and section 2 says that offences may for all incidental purposes be treated as having been committed in the State.  Some might seek to establish that as a consequence hijacking is not an extraditable offence in any circumstances.  To safeguard against this it is necessary to provide that section 15 of the Extradition Act shall not apply in such cases.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Extradition Act provides that extradition shall not be granted for an offence which is a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence and a hijacker may escape extradition if the offence is in that category.  It will be a matter for the courts to determine whether or not the offence is a political offence.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should perhaps say a few general words on why we are taking the Tokyo and Hague Conventions together in this Bill.  The previous Government had a Bill prepared in 1970 to enable effect to be given to the Tokyo Convention which came into force in 1969.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, however, as history has shown, that Convention did little to halt the spate of hijacking and it became clear that it would be necessary to expand and strengthen the Toyko Convention provisions on hijacking.  The Hague Convention of 1970 did this by declaring hijacking an international offence.  Since then other forms of interference with aviation, not covered by either the Tokyo or Hague Conventions, have been devised and it became necessary to draw up a third Convention at Montreal in September, 1971 to cover these unlawful acts&mdash;they relate mainly to armed attacks, sabotage and similar acts of violence, other than hijacking, against aviation and its installations and facilities.  It is proposed to ratify the Montreal Convention as quickly as possible but I have decided that the introduction of the Bill to enable effect to be given to the Tokyo and Hague Conventions <Col N="285" /> should not be deferred any longer. Consequently I am having a separate Bill prepared to give effect to the Montreal Convention and I would hope to introduce it in the near future.</P>
    <P>It is clear that legislation alone is no panacea for the crime of interference with aviation.  Hijacking of aircraft and other attacks against the safety of aircraft continue.  The threat is as great as ever.  Our efforts as an individual member of the international community to improve the situation involve action on two levels: on the one hand we have developed practical preventive security measures at our airports and on our air services and on the other we are assisting through this Bill in the creation of a new structure of international law designed to outlaw the hijacker. However, until all countries are committed to ridding aviation of the scourge of interference, hijackers will not be entirely discouraged.  Committed states may therefore be forced to think in terms of multilateral measures against defaulting states.  A recent international conference on air law held in Rome considered proposals to this end but failed to reach agreement.  These efforts are continuing and I will not hesitate to bring in any further legislation necessary to give effect to any further instrument in this field.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is not a contentious one.  We are seeking to give the force of law to the provisions of two international instruments designed to promote the safety of aviation and which have been signed or adhered to by all the major countries of the world.  The airline industry and the airline pilots associations have called for adherence to the Conventions.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to you in the assurance that all Senators will support it and in so doing make Ireland's contribution to a peaceful and safe development of civil aviation throughout the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very much pleasure in supporting this Bill.  It is a very necessary Bill to deal with a hazard which appears to be becoming increasingly frequent.  Each hijacking <Col N="286" /> that takes place seems to lead very shortly afterwards to another one. Much of the reason for these hijacking efforts seems to be not only to achieve a particular purpose but also to achieve a certain amount of publicity.  It can be said that the majority of hijacking efforts are not successful in achieving the primary purpose which those who hijacked the plane said was their purpose.  But they certainly are successful in getting a great deal of publicity whatever their purpose is alleged to be.</P>
      <P>The Bill, even though very carefully drafted and based on a Convention which in turn is a very good one, will not, I am afraid, be entirely successful. In saying that I am not suggesting that either the Convention or the Bill are in any way inadequate or inefficient.  By the very nature of the offence which we are dealing with, it will be very difficult indeed to eliminate it.  Consequently, whereas one can welcome this Bill and hope that it will be to some extent successful, one must be rather pessimistic about the effect it will have.</P>
      <P>One of the features about it which I have already mentioned is the extent to which publicity plays a part. Although it would be impossible to legislate in such a way as to prevent publicity, every effort should be made so far as this can be done, to give as little publicity both to the object of the hijack and the extent of the particular incident.  I know this is very hard to achieve because these hijackings are very often rather spectacular. They are rather dramatic and consequently the media find it very difficult indeed not to use the incidents and give them the headlines.  It would require a great deal of self-discipline on their part to play down these incidents and give them as little publicity as possible.  If that were done it would contribute very largely to the solution or diminution of this problem.  However, it is not something that can be effectively dealt with by way of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important in this Bill that the question of extradition has been provided for.  In a very large number of cases, these hijackings are carried <Col N="287" /> out by people who have some particular cause, usually political, who either wish to achieve an objective, or at least wish to achieve publicity for what they are doing.  Consequently, any proceedings that take place are more than likely to end up dealing with the question of whether or not it is a political offence done with a political motive.  It is therefore essential that this question of extradition should be provided for in so far as it is possible to provide for it.</P>
    <P>It is a Bill which we must all welcome. I regret that I cannot be more optimistic about how effective it will be.  Certainly, in so far as the Minister is concerned and those who drafted the Bill, it is a step in the right direction.  I cannot suggest any improvement and, in spite of my pessimism, I hope it will play some part in eradicating this very serious hazard which all people who fly have to undergo at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House very long.  I should like to raise one question.  In his introductory speech, the Minister referred to the necessity of providing that section 15 of the Extradition Act should not apply.  The Minister also referred to the maintenance of the provision in section 11 of the Extradition Act.  I should like to put myself on record with regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>Until international law is changed to deny the right of asylum, there will not be effective deterrents against hijacking of aircraft.  I should like to think that the Government, the Minister and his advisers are facing up to the very serious implications of that.  The view I take of the matter is that it is an assault of the first order on civilisation, an assault equivalent to piracy.  The pirate has been dealt with effectively by being capable of being prosecuted anywhere by anyone in any place.  There should be no reservation of right.  I know the full, serious consequences of that, but we are reserving a right to claim political asylum under our law in relation to hijacking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us that there <Col N="288" /> is another Bill in preparation and we ought to be thinking very seriously of our setting a headline in this matter. I know there are all sorts of treaties in existence where this right of asylum, even in relation to this offence, is recognised.  In many matters in the past we have taken a progressive lead and we must do it in relation to this matter, too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I have some figures which indicate that since 1950 there have been more than 300 hijackings resulting in over 400 deaths and many millions of dollars' damage to equipment and, of course, injuries to personnel.  This encouraged the International Civil Aviation Organisation to organise three Conventions in Tokyo, The Hague and Montreal, in order to attempt to reach international agreement on dealing with these offences.</P>
      <P>My only criticism of our action is that it is a pity we did not ratify the Tokyo Convention, 1963, earlier.  As a small state, with an international airline, we have nothing to lose and everything to gain by ratifying such an agreement.  It is a pity we did not ratify the Tokyo Agreement earlier. As with such international agreements, their effectiveness and our interest in them depend on their being ratified by as many other states as possible.  They have no effectiveness if the ratification is not wide and across the board.  According to the report which I have, the number of states that have ratified these Conventions is still very low.  Major powers have ratified them, but there are many smaller states who have not done so and their effectiveness is very much lessened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that these agreements have been backed up by the airlines and by the pilots' associations and have got their full support indicates that they are the ones which we should be supporting. I should not be surprised to see strong measures being taken against states who have not ratified these Conventions in whose territory or in whose aeroplanes hijackings take place.  These might involve a <Col N="289" /> boycott or cancellation of air services. They could involve more serious action, such as the cutting off of economic aid, or other sanctions.  This would clearly involve Government decisions.  I can well foresee airlines and pilots' associations boycotting traffic to countries who do not ratify these Conventions and in whose territory offences are committed.</P>
    <P>This would appear to be the first and effective way of getting countries to ratify these agreements.  We have nothing to lose by ratifying them at an early stage.  The extradition problem may have held up ratification here, but I am glad that the Minister has clearly outlined his determination to ratify the Montreal Convention in another Bill as soon as possible.  I would encourage him to do this, because, as Senator Alexis FitzGerald has said, we are a country who have given a lead in these matters.  I should like this country to be in the forefront of nations ratifying such international conventions which are essential if international air traffic is to continue to be safe and not collapse altogether. A spate of hijacking could have a very serious effect on the total air traffic and our whole communications system would be disrupted.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in welcoming this Bill and in encouraging the Minister in his efforts to ratify the Montreal Convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the point put by Senator Alexis FitzGerald. When I read the Bill I noticed that it did not cover the escape clause of the use of political offence as a mechanism for preventing extraditions.  The Minister in his Bill has covered one defect in the law by providing that lack of jurisdiction shall no longer apply.  It may be that international hijackers will not drive a coach and four through a Bill like this, but they may fly jumbo jets through it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We accept that hijackings fall into two categories; those which are for straightforward criminal purposes, such as ransom, and those which are political.  Without having the statistics to hand, I believe a high proportion of hijackings have been of a political <Col N="290" /> nature.  We know of the use to which this particular weapon of terrorism has been put by those involved in the Arab cause.  We know too of the number of sanctuaries which they find&mdash; admittedly growing less in number but still sufficiently large for them to escape punishment.  Like Senator West, I wonder what action can be taken against a state which refuses to proceed with prosecution, or what sort of action can be taken against those who would plead as a defence against extradition proceedings that their offence was of a political nature.</P>
    <P>I would add my voice to the plea of Senator Alexis FitzGerald that our Government would undertake, as a matter of urgency, an examination of this problem, admitting all of the very important implications which would arise in the whole field of international law.  The question of hijacking must be treated the same as that of piracy, which is precisely what it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill and to ask one question on it.  I note in the Minister's opening speech that the Bill empowers the commander of an Irish aircraft:</P>
      <P>to take such measures as he reasonably considers to be necessary to protect the safety of the aircraft or its passengers or to maintain good order or discipline on board the aircraft.</P>
      <P>Is there any possibility of liability attaching to the commander of an aircraft in this sort of situation in which it might be proved that any steps he took could not be regarded as reasonable and from which an innocent third party such as other passengers sustained injury?  Would this problem be covered by the normal conventions governing the payment of damages to passengers who were involved in aircraft accidents as such or would this situation give rise to a separate cause for action against the commander or the owners of the aircraft involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>A few brief points.  I should like to agree with the other Senators in saying that this Bill is very welcome in the House.  It is only <Col N="291" /> proper that this country which has been associated with international air navigation for more than 50 years&mdash; since Messrs Alcock and Brown landed in Galway in 1919&mdash;should have a particular interest in a Bill of this nature.</P>
      <P>One point with which I am concerned and it was mentioned also by Senator E. Ryan, whose pessimism I share, is that this Bill gives authority to the aircraft commander while in flight to deal with offenders.  It does not say how he will do this.  Unfortunately, so far it has been almost impossible to deal with hijackers in the air.  It is a much simpler matter on the high seas.  In the air the commander cannot effectively deal with hijackers armed with submachine guns and other such weapons.  I wonder if there have been any discussions in either the Tokyo or Hague Conventions to provide the commander either with the necessary armaments to deal with hijackers or is there any method by which security guards could be provided to ensure that the aims of these Conventions can be put into practice? They dealt with the situation from the legal point of view, but in practice it is impossible for a commander to do anything if he is held up by hijackers. Perhaps the Minister might have some comments to make on this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I expected, the Bill has been well received by the Seanad.  As Senator West has pointed out, we have all been concerned for many years at the extent of hijacking throughout the world.  Conventions have been drawn up to try and curb this practice but it is now seen that they are defective.  This is the reason why the last Government had arrangements made to bring in legislation to deal with the Hague Convention. Events however had overtaken them and I am bringing in the Bill, although it does not go far enough.  I will bring in legislation to deal with the Montreal Convention as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Referring to the point made by Senator West, these matters were the subject of discussions at the Rome <Col N="292" /> meeting in August.  Many methods of dealing with this were suggested, such as pilots' organisations refusing to land in countries where these Conventions had not been signed or airlines refusing to fly into those countries.  These matters were all discussed but there was a failure to reach agreement.  At the next meeting the situation will again be reviewed in an effort to find a solution.  This is the weakness of these Conventions: that only a limited number of countries sign them with the result that there is asylum for hijackers in other countries.  We must be one of the number of countries who are determined in their efforts and by legislation to try to stamp out this appalling offence.</P>
    <P>Senator E. Ryan is correct in saying that many of the hijackings are for the purpose of gaining publicity for the cause of the hijackers rather than for the actual acquisition of a jumbo jet, which would be of very little use in a man's back garden.</P>
    <P>It is better to cure the offence of hijacking rather than to curb the Press in their reporting of these incidents.  Even if at the next meeting in Rome a new convention is drawn up I am sure it will contain some loopholes and further legislation will be needed.  If publicity were removed from incidents of hijackings it would be desirable.  But it is not the function of any country to tell the Press what they should or should not publish.  It is our function to bring in legislation which will prevent the occurrence of offences of this nature, thereby removing publicity by removing the crime.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan made the point about the liability of the commander of the aircraft.  Section 10 provides the commander with indemnity in such cases.  If passengers were injured during a hijacking they would have recourse in civil law against the air company; but the purpose of this Bill is to protect the commander and give him the necessary powers to apprehend and hand over the hijackers to the competent authorities.</P>
    <P>Senator Halligan and Senator Alexis FitzGerald raised the question of extradition.  The changing of our laws in regard to extradition is a much <Col N="293" /> wider area than could be gone into here under the terms of the Air Navigation Bill.  The Bill, however, provides a choice, when the aircraft has landed in a country.  Supposing a South American hijacked an American aircraft and flew it to Australia and 12 months later was found in Ireland.  He could be prosecuted here under our law and imprisoned here.  This is how international jurisdiction affects the Bill.  In this way we have a choice of extraditing or prosecuting here.  We could prosecute him here and he could be punished here for the crime of hijacking an aircraft which is not ours and which did not land in our country.  For that reason, in most cases we would probably choose to do that rather than extradite.  The object would be to see that a hijacker would not escape punishment.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell raised the point about the means by which an airline commander would apprehend a hijacker.  This is really dealing with the hijacker and his punishment.  But the airline would take action to see that the airline commander would be competent and in a position to apprehend somebody whom he found on board who had the intention of hijacking.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening address, this Bill does not go far enough. Rather than delay and have a Bill drawn up to give effect to the next Convention I would prefer to go part of the road and deal with these Conventions as quickly as possible.  Then, if there is a further Convention later on, to deal with that again.  Senator West referred to the necessity of having some way of dealing with hijackers in countries which do not sign Conventions. Until that is realised and until we can employ some form of moral pressure to ensure that every country in the world signs them, there will be a refuge for hijackers, and it is up to us to see that that refuge is not here.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Seanad for the reception they have given, to this Bill.  I expected it and I hope that I will be back here fairly soon with further legislation to deal with this appalling crime.</P>

      <P>I have been prompted by Senator Alexis FitzGerald who, I think, does not like to see these Bills getting away scot free on Committee Stage. There is a point on the problem of extradition which occurs in section 11 which the Minister mentioned in his opening address.  He said:</P>
      <P>It will be a matter for the Courts to determine whether or not the offence is a political offence.</P>
      <P>Presumably, this would cover the hijacking of a BEA plane in Northern Ireland if it landed in this State.  In case the hijackers should claim that their offence was a political offence, then, in such a situation, which is not beyond the bounds of possibility as we have seen, it would be up to the Courts in the Republic to determine whether the crime of hijacking that had been committed was a political crime or not. If it was determined not to be a political crime the hijackers would then be extradited.  If it was a political crime they would be tried in the State.  Is that the situation that would arise in that case?</P>

      <P>I explained that.  The example I gave was that, if a South American hijacked an American plane and flew it to Australia and if he came here 12 months later, we could prosecute him here.  In that case it would be within our jurisdiction.  We have the choice of either extraditing or prosecuting him here.  The idea is to see that hijackers are prosecuted somewhere in the world for their crime.  The case the Senator instanced there would be covered in this.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company (General Meeting) Order, 1973, proposed to be made by the Minister for Transport and Power and laid in draft before Seanad Éireann on the 23rd day of October, 1973 under Subsection 4 of Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Gas undertakings generally operate under special Acts which authorise them to manufacture and distribute gas in certain specified areas.  Modifications to the special Acts required by the undertakings from time to time are made under section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, which enables me to make by order the required modifications.  Before an order of this kind is made it has to be laid in draft before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Houses of the Oireachtas may, by resolution, approve the draft order in the form submitted or may approve it with <Col N="296" /> modifications and additions.  When such approval is given I may make the order in the form in which it has been approved.</P>
      <P>In 1950 an order entitled Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company (General Meetings) Order, 1950, was made on the application of the company, which provided that the ordinary general meeting would be held annually instead of half yearly, and as soon after 31st December of the preceding year but not later than the month of March as the directors by resolution from time to time determined.</P>
      <P>The company feel that this regulation does not allow adequate time for the preparation, audit and distribution of the annual accounts prior to the annual meeting.  They therefore proposed to me that I should make a special order under section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, which would allow them to hold the ordinary general meeting at a time to be determined by the directors but not later than 15 months after the previous ordinary general meeting.  As the proposed order would not be in conflict with the provisions of the Companies Act, 1963, and, following consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I agreed to the proposal.  The order now laid in draft before the Seanad for approval will give the company the necessary authority to fix the date of the ordinary general meeting with the degree of latitude which they require.</P>
      <P>The statutory requirements in regard to publicity have been complied with.  Copies of the draft order were sent to the public and local authorities concerned.  No objection to the proposed order was received.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied as to the need for the order and that there is nothing in it repugnant to the public interest.  I, therefore, recommend the order for the approval of the Seanad.  The order has already been approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>

I bear in mind what the Minister said&mdash;that there has been no objection from any <Col N="297" /> other quarter and that the proposed order falls within the provisions of the Companies Act&mdash;but I must on principle make plain my disappointment with the regulation which if not necessarily decreasing the amount of information being made available to the public certainly makes the workings of a large enterprise such as the Gas Company a step or half step more remote from the public than they are at present.</P>
      <P>I believe that any well organised enterprise should be able to carry out its business in the form in which the Gas Company were supposed to be carrying it out under the previous state of affairs, and to have to bring in an order like this casts some reflection on the standard of administration in the enterprise concerned.</P>

      <P>That is correct. There seems to be some misunderstanding on Senator Horgan's part. There is no change at all in what they must do.  All they want is extra time. Under the existing order they must produce their audited accounts before 31st March, that is, three months after the end of their year.  Now they are being given permission to extend that, within the calendar year, to 15 months after preview.  They must still comply with all the regulations of the Companies Act.  They are just being given extra time to prepare their books.</P>

I do not envisage a long drawn out debate today because we had a very full and a very good debate on this Bill yesterday and I do not think we should go through all the points again, but as a humble Senator it would suit me much better if I could deal with amendment No. 1 and subsequently deal with amendment No. 2.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="300" /> It is with very mixed feelings that I speak on this group of amendments.  I feel rather like the labourer who came into the vineyard at the eleventh hour, not having had occasion to participate in yesterday's discussion led by Senators Robinson and West and to which the Parliamentary Secretary contributed.</P>
    <P>I have read the reports of yesterday's discussion and I do not propose to add to them.  I think the most useful thing I can do in the circumstances is to compare our amendments with the amendments now being put forward by the Government and to indicate my views on them.  Before doing this I must say that I am grateful to the Government for having taken this matter seriously enough to introduce amendments at comparatively short notice.  It enhances the credibility of the Parliamentary Secretary and it enhances the credibility of this House.</P>
    <P>I find myself in a very difficult position.  Basically I still prefer&mdash;I think it would be unnatural for me not to prefer&mdash;our amendments to those put down by the Government. On the other hand, I do not find those put down by the Government so objectionable as to call for their rejection out of hand.  What action I will take on the vote will depend largely on what the Parliamentary Secretary says during the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>There is one really substantial difference between the two sets of amendments.  Our amendments would make it mandatory on the council to establish a number of advisory committees to deal with certain areas of the arts.  In the discussion yesterday it was pointed out, quite rightly, that even though the original arts Council could have appointed all the committees they wanted to, since 1951 they have not appointed any such advisory committees.  They have operated in a sort of self-sealing vacuum in the distribution of the resources at their disposal.  The main difference between the two amendments is that where our amendment makes it mandatory on the council to appoint committees&mdash;it reads &ldquo;shall appoint&rdquo;&mdash; the Government amendment makes it <Col N="301" /> quite optional for the Arts Council to appoint such committees.  The wording of the Government amendment is &ldquo;the Council may establish&rdquo; any or all of the following.</P>
    <P>This is not quite good enough.  I should like to take it on trust.  We should all like to take it on trust that the council, as soon as possible after their establishment and after the nomination of their members, will establish every single one of these committees, but there is no obligation on them to do so.  We could very easily find ourselves in exactly the same situation as before in which all effective decisions are taken and any effective advice is tendered only within the framework of the council. It may be that writing this into the Bill in this way will jog the elbows of the members of the council.  I certainly hope it will.  I would regret that it has not been made mandatory on the council.</P>
    <P>The second main difference between the two sets of amendments is in relation to the number of committees. We propose that six committees should be established.  This has been reduced in the Government amendment to three.  Furthermore, the number of areas of the arts which are included in these various committees has also to a certain extent been reduced. I tended to agree with some of the criticism that was made on the other side of the House about not having too many committees.  I felt that six was the maximum that one should go to in setting up advisory committees.  On the other hand I feel that reducing it to three is depressing things a little too much, especially when we look at the particular subdivisions suggested in the Government amendment.</P>
    <P>According to the Government, two committees will each advise on three separate branches of the arts&mdash;one on painting, sculpture and architecture, the other on drama, literature and the cinema.  The third committee are to advise on only one branch of the arts, music.  This seems to me to be a strange division of responsibilities.  I wonder whether it is based on any criteria that the Government may <Col N="302" /> have in mind about the relative value of each of these branches of the arts, their relative popular appeal, perhaps even the relative amount of money to be dispensed between all the branches of the arts concerned.  I hope this is not the case.  Whereas many of the criticisms of the last Arts Council were to the effect that one particular section of the plastic arts was favoured more than the others, and that ill-advisedly, my criticism would be that too much money was spent on music by the last Arts Council.  Too much money was spent on a form of music which has a very limited following and certainly not the type of following which would have entitled it to the money which was spent on it.</P>
    <P>The second main difference between our sets of amendments is that our group of six committees has been reduced to three.  I particularly regret the absence of a Finance and General Purposes Committee.  This seems to me to be an essential for any organisation which are carrying on a form of activity with many different facets.  We have a particularly useful example of this in the structure of the National Council for Educational Awards.  This body, although their aims are in many ways different from that of the Arts Council, have to face many of the same administrative problems in that they have to deal simultaneously with many different things and at the same time to co-ordinate their administration at a pilot level.  They have a Finance and General Purposes Committee. I would have thought that such a committee would be of particular advantage in the context of the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>The other committee whose absence will be most keenly felt is the Committee for Art in Education.  It has been stated before, and by people more qualified than I am, that we in the Republic are among the most visually under-educated people in Europe.  The establishment of a Committee for Arts in Education would have been it if were properly done and if the right people were elected to it, absolutely vital in promoting, not just in the schools but in all forms of educational and para-educational activity, the type <Col N="303" /> of consciousness of all the arts which is so lacking in many people in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>On the three committees suggested by the Government there may well be people who are interested in painting in education, in sculpture in education and in music in education.  I feel they will be swamped in these advisory committees and that they could do their work more effectively and more powerfully if they were made part of a self-supporting ginger group, a special advisory committee which would regard themselves as charged with the responsibility of starting almost from scratch in education in the arts and going on from there to build up the widest possible public and educational awareness of the importance of this facet of our lives.</P>
    <P>Those are my two main objections to the list of committees suggested by the Government: first the absence of a General Purposes Committee and second the absence of a Committee for Art in Education.</P>
    <P>There are no other very substantial differences between the two sets of amendments, but I should like to comment briefly on one or two matters which are included in the Government amendment.  In amendment No. 2 A (4) we read:</P>
    <P>In appointing members of an advisory committee the Council shall, so far as practicable, ensure that the committee is representative of the interest throughout the State in the branch or branches of the arts, as the case may be, in relation to which the committee is established.</P>
    <P>I should like to question the words &ldquo;throughout the State&rdquo;.  I can see the goodwill which is built into this subsection.  But the Government are not prepared to go the whole hog and suggest that people be elected to advisory committees by members of associations other than the Arts Council.  In so far as it sticks to the principle of nomination, it is asking that the persons nominated should be <Col N="304" /> as representative as possible.  The words &ldquo;throughout the State&rdquo; might operate to exclude people from Northern Ireland, or even outside the State, whose experience and qualifications might be in every other respect particularly useful.  I should not like to think that a piece of draftsmanship such as this, while well intentioned, might have the unforeseen effect of rendering such person's appointment open to challenge on the grounds stated in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not exclude them: it simply stipulates that this must be done.  It does not exclude others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it does not exclude others, but if Senator O'Higgins is stating that a person who, to take a hypothetical example, might be experienced in a particular branch of the arts in Northern Ireland but might know nothing about what is happening down here, is eligible for appointment to the sub-committee under the subsection, then my objection falls to the ground.</P>
      <P>My other question relates to subsection (6):</P>
      <P>Where a person who is chairman of an advisory committee ceases during his term of office as such chairman to be a member of the Council he shall also cease to be a member of the advisory committee.</P>
      <P>What about the position of a person who has to relinquish membership of the Arts Council because of pressure of commitments of one kind or another?  Does this section disqualify him from being a member of any advisory committee?  There may be circumstances in which persons might not have the time to participate at the higher level as full members of the council but would be invaluable as members of an advisory committee.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to make it mandatory on the council to establish these and perhaps one or two other committees but my final attitude to the question of the vote would be determined by the interpretation placed on the Government amendments during the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this.  Members on both sides of the House will have a feeling of satisfaction that the Government have introduced amendment No. 2A.  Many of us from time to time have felt a sense of frustration in this House when we were battling to get a Government Minister or Parliamentary Secretary to accept a point of view which obviously expressed the wishes of the majority of Senators and we found that we were not able to make any impression.  The Parliamentary Secretary who handled this debate yesterday is to be complimented for taking seriously the arguments which were put forward and reporting the position back to the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach, in turn, is to be complimented and congratulated by the House in meeting so generously the points of view which were expressed in the discussion yesterday.</P>
      <P>I can understand Senator Horgan having an inclination in favour of amendment No. 2 as against amendment No. 2A because it was the amendment which he and other Senators proposed.  It is natural, knowing the reasons why all the various subsections in his amendment were worded as they were and being fully aware of precisely what he and the other Senators who proposed it had intended achieving, that he should feel wedded to that proposal rather than the Government proposal.  Senator Horgan will agree that the point of view argued by Senator Robinson and others yesterday has been, if not entirely met, then met to a generous extent by the Government amendment. The alteration in the structure which was recommended and argued here yesterday has, been accepted, at least in principle, in the Government amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the Government amendment is not intended to be mere verbiage and, even though it is worded on a discretionary rather than on a mandatory basis, that the intention of including this new section in the Bill is that it should be acted upon. Admittedly it does not follow precisely along the lines of amendment No. 2, but when one considers the <Col N="306" /> two amendments it may well be that amendment No. 2 as it stands would in any event be unacceptable.  Possibly if Senators were insisting on the particular structure set out in amendment No. 2 it might be made workable by an amending of the amendment.  As it stands it would not be workable.  In the first place it is clear that amendment No. 2, in so far as it is intended to introduce new members into the committees, envisages a body or bodies comprising in all 54 new persons as against 24, which is effectively provided for in the Government amendment.  I adhere to the view I expressed yesterday that the smaller the body we are dealing with the better and the more work will be done.</P>
    <P>To a large extent, the object of amendment No. 2 could have been initiated by the council filling with their own members all of the six sub-committees proposed.  I do not think it was ever intended that that should be so.  It was at least conceivable that that would happen.  Subsections (5) and (9) of amendment No. 2 are mutually exclusive.  You cannot have both of them.  Subsection (5) provides that</P>
    <P>Every member of a committee appointed under subsection (1) of this section shall, unless he sooner dies or resigns, hold office until the beginning of the day on which the terms of office of the persons next appointed pursuant to the said subsection (1) are to commence.</P>
    <P>There are only two ways.  He is going to hold office unless he dies or resigns. At the same time in subsection (9) it says:</P>
    <P>The Council may remove a member of a committee from office.</P>
    <P>You could have under subsection (9) a member of a committee being removed from office, but under subsection (5) he could claim that he is still a member because he has not either resigned or died.  Finally the original amendment No. 2, subsection (10), states:</P>
    <P>Each committee shall have power to regulate its own procedure and business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> There you have the inherent danger that virtually uncontrolled discretion is given to what are in effect sub-committees of the council.  I know the intention, and it is manifest in the break-up of the sub-committees and the particular purposes for which they are formed, is that they should deal only with matters for which they were established.  At the same time under subsection (10) they would be given very wide and general powers not merely to regulate their own procedure but to regulate their own business.  None of those defects appears in the Government amendment. I agree it does not go the entire way to meet what is contained in amendment No. 2 but it travels a very long part of the road.  It clearly accepts in principle the proposals that were made.  Possibly I am biased because I am talking from this side of the House, but I hope I would have said the same thing&mdash;and I think I did on some occasions&mdash;when I was on the other side of the House.  I feel the Parliamentary Secretary and the Taoiseach are to be complimented on meeting the House as generously as they have done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated yesterday that I intended to support the amendments which were before us.  I did so because I felt that the Bill as originally drafted had certain defects in so far as it had eliminated the power to co-opt people to the sub-committees and I thought it was unfortunate that this power had not been retained.  I also indicated my support of the amendments because I considered that the machinery which existed in the amending Bill, which would entail appointing 16 people for five years with no changes, would be rather too rigid in that it would not permit new blood to be brought on the committee regularly.  Consequently new ideas and new points of view would not be constantly introduced on the committee. On the other hand, I thought that the alternative which they suggested was perhaps too elaborate and too unwieldy and I foresaw that it might give rise to some difficulty if the amendments were passed.  Nevertheless, <Col N="308" /> rather than having the Bill as originally drafted, I indicated that I would support the amendments.</P>
      <P>The Government have now proposed an alternative amendment which meets to a very large extent the objections in the amending Bill.  It meets them in a way which is, if anything, an improvement on the amendments which were before us yesterday and which are still before us.  The committees which the Government have suggested, the way in which they will be constituted and the fact that the chairmen of the committees will be drawn from the existing council is, if anything, an improvement on the amendments which we discussed yesterday. I find myself agreeing with the Government amendment as being a very serious and good effort to meet the objections we discussed yesterday. The amendments now suggested by the Government will give a council which will be able to do the job very effectively.</P>
      <P>Of the two amendments before us, on balance the Government amendment meets the problem better than the one which we discussed yesterday.  In saying that I should like to congratulate the movers of the amendments yesterday who were responsible. by their amendments, by the arguments which they put forward and the debate which resulted from their amendments, for the amendments which are before us today.  I should like to congratulate them on having achieved what has been achieved in the sense that there are now two alternative sets of amendments before us, both of which would achieve a very useful purpose.  In one way or the other we are going to get a very much improved council.</P>
      <P>I should also like to commend the Parliamentary Secretary for reconsidering the position and doing so very quickly, and coming back with the amendments which are before us today. On balance, the Government amendments meet in a better way the objections which we expressed yesterday.  I am inclined to support the Government amendment and I suggest to those who moved the original amendment that this is a very genuine and reasonable effort to meet the points they made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> In regard to the question of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, which has been raised by Senator Horgan, it is a rather ambiguous and difficult word to interpret at times.  In the context in which it is used in this Bill it is as good as &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I should be very surprised if, used as it is in this context, the council did not feel that they were in effect obliged to avail of the power that was given to them, and I should be very surprised if they did not avail of it and act upon it in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express my disappointment at the restrictive nature of the advisory committees.  Subjects such as painting, sculpture, architecture, music, drama and literature form a very narrow basis for a definition of the arts.  The cinema is a welcome addition to the list, but the amendment could have gone much further.  I wish it had included a topic which I have mentioned previously and that is the circus.</P>
      <P>The Arts Council and this Arts Bill are designed to promote the arts which are struggling, which cannot stand on their own two feet but which are highly desirable for cultural progress. At present the most widely practised artistic professional activity in this country&mdash;the circus&mdash;is on the point of extinction.  There is no provision made in this Bill to give it a breath of life.  To whom can these people turn to if the Arts Council do not take them under their wing?  This is a very serious omission and I ask the powers-that-be to make some efforts to remedy it, before it is too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are two family circuses in this country and they are being kept going by the hard work and long hours that these families are putting into their job.  If they were depending solely on paid employees they would have gone out of existence long ago.  I am referring to Fossett's and Duffy's.  For a number of reasons, these people have found the going very tough.  Modern innovations, such as television, have affected their receipts very much.  They have received no concession whatsoever in the tax field, and this is one area in <Col N="310" /> which they could be helped.  They are not looking for handouts.  In many artistic fields, such as sculpture and painting, the artists are receiving financial subventions to keep them going.  The circus people are not looking for handouts.  All they are asking for are concessions in the tax field which these other artists already have, such as those given under Deputy Haughey's very praiseworthy tax remission scheme.  That does not apply to these artists&mdash;and they are supreme artists&mdash;and it should.  On the other hand, they pay VAT of 6.8 per cent on their box office receipts.  This percentage makes the difference between a make or break as far as their finances go.  These taxes should he removed.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago Senator Mary Robinson threw up her arms and said: &ldquo;If only the Arts Council could provide one van to bring around the artists' exhibitions to various points in the country, what a difference it would make.  The whole country would have a chance of seeing the works of art of the painters, sculptors, <i>et cetera</i>.&rdquo;  This is exactly what the circus people have been doing for the past 60 years.  They have been hauling dozens of vans around the country, so that the rural population can see the best artists in the world at a very nominal cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The word in this amendment which worries me so much is not the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; but the verb &ldquo;advise&rdquo;.  I was very sympathetic <Col N="311" /> to the viewpoint expressed by Senator Horgan earlier when he suggested that the effect of the deletion of one of the committees he had proposed might be that the teaching function in the development of the arts generally might be neglected.  It would help if there was an assurance given to Senators that &ldquo;advise&rdquo; does not mean merely a report on the decaying state or the non-existent state, for example, of painting, sculpture or architecture, or a mere report on the fact that the community has not facilities for education in relation to music.  It would help many of us if we were assured that the term &ldquo;advise&rdquo; itself will be interpreted or used in the context of the development of all the arts.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Horgan has said.  Probably as a nation there are many aspects of the arts which we have neglected totally in our educational structure.  For a long time the opportunity available to parents for an education in the arts, including those mentioned in amendment No. 2A, was reserved for an elite.  I am not so sure that the circumstances have totally changed.  However, the specification of painting, sculpture, architecture, music and drama is somewhat of a reflection.  A long time ago somebody said that if we had a humane and decent society all of life would be an art in itself.  But in so far as we have decided to draw a distinction in our activities between what must be regarded as dreary work and occasionally useful recreation, it is probably useful to specify the activities.  I have a great sympathy with the Senator who wants circuses included.  All kinds of activities might be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main reason for speaking is to agree with Senator Horgan that we must speak about the development of the arts.  When the Parliamentary Secretary is replying, he might like to assure us that &ldquo;advise&rdquo; will not be used in the narrow sense of reporting on a neglected and decaying state of the arts, but would be used in the sense of drawing up imaginative proposals <Col N="312" /> for the extension of education in all of the arts for the community in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Senator Eoin Ryan in welcoming the approach which has been taken by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Taoiseach to our efforts of yesterday. We had a very full and worthwhile discussion.  The three Senators who backed the amendments and the Parliamentary Secretary worked hard. The Government have given considerable thought to their amendment. The Parliamentary Secretary has done what he promised.  He has faithfully reported our feelings on the matter.  This encourages people in the belief that the democratic process. which is one of give and take, in which people consider views put forward and take account of them when they are drafting or redrafting legislation, is working well.  It encourages us to take part in debates in the hope that our efforts will be met by changes in the legislation.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons why I believe that the Government's amendment No. 2A is a more workable amendment than those we proposed yesterday.  It has, however, one regrettable feature and that concerns the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  The previous Arts Council had all the powers which are set out in amendment No. 2A, and it never used them.  We discussed this matter at length yesterday and I do not intend to go over all the arguments again.  If we are drafting legislation which will put into effect what seemed to be the wishes of the House yesterday, then the Government amendment is not strong enough as it stands.  We have discussed this matter for long enough, but I do not think in a situation of this type moral pressure is enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator M.J. O'Higgins made this case so many times from the Opposition benches in the last Seanad that I am sure he will agree with me.  I backed him up on many occasions when he argued that what were Government promises were of little value in legislation.  What was needed was something written down in black and <Col N="313" /> white; otherwise it was not legislation. Without wishing to appear mischievous I want to propose an amendment to the Government amendment No. 2A to state this matter clearly.  I believe, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, that two amendments on the Report Stage are proposed verbally.  It is quite a simple amendment.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary and the Taoiseach are to be congratulated on doing what they promised yesterday in a very short time and on really working to set good amendments.  I do not necessarily agree with Senator Horgan in weeping over the demise of the Financial Affairs Committee, because finance will always be decided by the Arts Council.  They will take the crucial decisions in matters of finance. There might be a group who would draw up a budget, but they would not make the final recommendations. There is a lot of merit in the Government's proposals provided they are amended in the way I have suggested.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 is linked in with the other amendments.  The Government amendment meets the substantial case made yesterday which calls for a widening of the participation in the work of the Arts Council to include more people with specific expertise, perhaps a wider regional spread.  The objections put forward yesterday to certain aspects of the amendments proposed by Senator West still hold.</P>
      <P>In regard to making it mandatory on the council to appoint committees such as this, we must be prepared to allow the situation to evolve.  We are setting up a new Arts Council.  We will have new members who must, if we trust them, be given some degree of freedom in determining their method of working.  If we tied them down by the words of a statute in relation to how they should constitute their advisory committees, we would be tying them too much.  We could not foresee all the possible problems which might arise in the actual working of the council.  For us to attempt to tie them down in an absolutely rigid way by the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would inhibit the natural development of the work of the Arts Council, which I think everybody will agree will be a continuing progress. For that reason I feel bound to oppose the amendments proposed by Senators Horgan and West and propose instead amendment No. 2A from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan made a very valid point.  The fact that we had such lengthy discussions yesterday followed <Col N="315" /> by consultations with the Taoiseach resulting in the introduction of a specific amendment here in the Bill will be indication enough to the new Arts Council as to how the Oireachtas see their role.  I am sure that they will meet the spirit of the debate here in the House yesterday and I am sure that Senator West is confident of that, too.</P>
    <P>Senator West dealt with the point about the exclusion of the General Purposes Committee which was put forward by Senator Horgan.  In regard to the Art in Education Committee it is the intention that education should be considered by each one of these committees and also by the Arts Council.  Setting up an Art in Education Committee to deal with the educational aspects of painting, sculpture, architecture, music, drama and literature, would be cutting across the work of these committees in an unacceptable way and would create demarcation difficulties, because one would have to decide whether, in talking about a particular sculpture matter, for instance, the mounting of an exhibition, it was a matter of sculpture in the pure sense and therefore a matter for the advisory committee on paintings, or an educational enterprise in so far as it was an exhibition which members of the community would visit and thereby improve their educational standing. There would obviously be a difficulty in deciding into which category it fell and which committee should deal with it.</P>
    <P>The points made by the Senators about the importance of education have been noted and will be dealt with.  I should also like to refer to Senator Deasy's statement about the circus.  I should like to say that his remarks on this matter will be brought to the notice of the Arts Council, and they will, when appointed, be able to take whatever action, if any, they feel appropriate.  I think it would be wrong for us at this stage to tie their hands.  We are setting up a structure, we are going to appoint competent people and presumably they will be <Col N="316" /> able to make decisions which will be valid.  I should point out that the lists of advisory committees contained here are not exclusively the Arts Council's. They can deal with many other subjects which are not contained in the list here.  I do not think there would be any great difficulty if the advisory committee themselves were to deal with the subjects which did not come strictly within the terms of the committee set up.  This may well be one of the advantages of the discretion which we are giving the council in regard to the setting up of these committees. If we were to make it mandatory for them arguments to set up committees with particular specified functions we might be going the opposite way to the intention of the Seanad in urging that new art forms should be considered in the most detailed way possible by the council or by their subsidiary committees.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Horgan accepted that his reference to &ldquo;throughout the State&rdquo; was not exclusive and that we could appoint people from Northern Ireland should that be deemed desirable.</P>

      <P>I do not think this situation is likely to arise.  I imagine that there would possibly be a way in which the council could re-appoint that man to the committee.  The idea behind the Bill&mdash;and this is written into it&mdash;is that there should be a balance between the arts.  That would mean that on the advisory committee there would be a number of potential appointees to the central council representing particular art forms.  If the Taoiseach, in appointing the central Arts Council, were to chose somebody who was already on the advisory committee, thereby making him chairman of the advisory committee, it would be a very small matter for them to switch around and appoint the man who had been chairman or a member of the council to sit on the advisory committee.  I know that this does not completely meet the case but I feel that it goes a substantial way towards meeting it.  I hope it will be acceptable to the Seanad.  If the Seanad does not <Col N="317" /> mind, I shall read the brief that was prepared for me in case there are some points which were not covered.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on the Committee Stage yesterday, consideration would be given to the amendments which provide for a system of advisory committees for the Arts Council.  I have been in consultation with the Taoiseach on this and I understand that in the framing of this Arts Bill generally some consideration had been given to the various ways in which some such system might be operated.  It had been felt that there was a danger of creating a large and unwieldy system and of foisting it on a new and enlarged Arts Council.  There was criticism here yesterday in relation to the amendment proposed by Senator Robinson and others.  The feeling was expressed by several speakers that the system proposed was somewhat unwieldy and excessive and Senator Robinson accepted that hers was not necessarily the ideal scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, strong arguments have been made for getting some sort of root system radiating out to the people from the Arts Council which would get in a wider range of views and ensure that these were drawn from the country as a whole.  There was also emphasis on the need to give the council some discretionary powers in the matter of appointments.  I think most of these requirements can be met in a compromise system of advisory committees in the amendment now circulated to Senators.  It still leaves with the Taoiseach the power of appointing the 17 members of the council proper.  On that point, I think Members have been unduly anxious in case it would be a body of retired citizens and that it would not have its quota of vigorous practising artists. There was also a fear that the council would become atrophied and stultified during its period of office.  But five years is not an epoch; it is a reasonable period during which the council could appraise and assess the arts situation in Ireland, draw up a programme to meet it and see much of it on the way to fruition.  Ideas expressed by Senators can, I believe, be put into practice by such a new revitalised <Col N="318" /> committee and it can be the positive body which the House and the people require rather than a passive appraisal of applications for financial assistance. There is also the point that, at the end of that five years, when a new council is being appointed, some members can be reappointed sufficient to maintain a necessary continuity and there need not be the stark choice which some Senators have suggested of either a totally new council or a complete reappointment of the outgoing council.</P>
    <P>The committee system which I am now proposing will allow the council to set up three committees in the three broad areas of the arts&mdash;the visual, the literary and the musical&mdash; and the council can designate from among its members a chairman for each of those committees.  This would give, outside the council, 24 additional persons who could place their expertise and their advice at the disposal of the council.  I think this is a reasonable balance to strike and provides a modest but potentially effective network to achieve what Senators have in mind.  I commend it to the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan raised a point about music being allotted a specific committee.  Expressing a personal opinion, I think music is very definitely distinguishable from painting, sculpture and architecture, drama, literature and the cinema, which all fit relatively easily into compartments. Music could not become compartmentalised in something else.  All of us would agree that it is probably the most important art form in many ways.  While accepting the Senator's point that perhaps it should not be interpreted in a too restricted way, there are many forms of music&mdash;and not necessarily just classical music&mdash; which have merit, and I am sure that the council will consider that point, too.  I would repeat that it is important that we do not try to tie the council down too much.</P>

      <P>If I may reply very briefly.  I find that over the last hour or so I have been very skilfully backed into a corner and I now find myself in agreement with many of <Col N="319" /> the points that have been made, both on the other side of the House and on this side, about the relative merits of the two sets of amendments.  Anything which I say at this point is based on a broad acceptance of the Government amendments and a desire only to improve them.  I agree with Senator Higgins that the wording of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subsection (1) could have been improved to make it a bit stronger.  I should like to see the terminology changed to read &ldquo;a committee to advise on the development of painting, sculpture and architecture&rdquo;.  These are only minor points and obviously they do not mean a great deal in the final analysis.</P>
      <P>The second point of drafting which it occurred to me might be improved was in connection with the mode of establishing committees and of choosing their chairman.  It is a fairly obvious interpretation of the Government amendments that the council shall not only nominate the members of the advisory committee but shall nominate the chairman of the advisory committee.  There could, after all, be some ambiguity in this regard.  I say that not to indulge in any kind of nit-picking exercise but merely to elicit the necessary assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that this is what is meant in order to obviate any possible doubt or confusion about it later on.</P>
      <P>The other ambiguity arising under section 6 is&mdash;and I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary here&mdash;very unlikely to arise.  I do not see much point in adjusting the amendment now to take account of it.  The best we can do is to hope that it does not arise.  I should like on my part to be as forthcoming as the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government have been and to accept the Government amendments in the spirit in which they were written. I do not think we can do more than that.  I should like to repeat my appreciation of the seriousness with which the Government have taken this House and the opinions expressed in it.</P>
