      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 12 in that order.  It is proposed to interrupt business at 7.30 p.m. for the purpose of taking No. 12 if it has not been already reached.  It might be of assistance to Senators to know it is proposed that we conclude the discussion on No. 12 not later than 5 o'clock tomorrow and that the Minister should be called not later than 4.30 p.m.  If necessary we will sit on Friday to conclude the other business if it has not been concluded before the discussion on No. 12.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader of the House set aside some time in the near future for a debate on Northern Ireland.  There is no need to underline the critical situation we face.  I should like to make two points in connection with the necessity for such a debate. Firstly, there has recently been a very successful and constructive debate in the other House and it is time we recognised that the only way to stop the shooting is to start talking.  It is not good enough to say that a debate at this time will rock the boat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>How do the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition hope to curtail the debate?  Why is there an assumption about concluding at 5 o'clock tomorrow?  Is the debate likely to fall about that time? If some Senators have not spoken by that time and wish to do so, can the debate not be continued further?</P>

      <P>The position is that the Leader of the House has made <Col N="71" /> a proposition in regard to the business, which involves the Minister being called at 4.30 p.m. tomorrow.  If that is agreed to, it becomes an Order of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking Senator Browne's point first, the reason for this is because the Minister is engaged on official business later in the evening and we were trying to facilitate him and have as full a discussion as possible in the circumstances.  Regarding the point raised by Senator West, when a motion dealing with it is put down we can facilitate discussion.  With regard to motions, I adhere strongly to the points of view I expressed from the opposite benches that we should proceed with motions regardless of whether it is possible for Ministers to be in attendance.  We will make every effort in listing motions to have the appropriate Minister in attendance but, even if this is not possible, I see no reason why motions cannot be dealt with.  Subject to the Whips having a discussion on this matter, the best arrangement would probably be to take motions as they are listed on the Order Paper unless the proposers wish to have them deferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I draw your attention to a Seanad debate on 1st June last?  I made a remark which is reported at Column 44 of the Official Report for that day.  I turned to the Minister and I said:</P>
      <P>Does the Minister know where it is going?</P>
      <P>We were talking about certain moneys. Senator Lenihan is then reported as saying:</P>
      <P>He cannot be quoted.</P>
      <P>I am then reported as saying:</P>
      <P>That is honest anyway.</P>
      <P>That report does not make sense, because a remark made by the Minister is not included.  The remark made by the Minister, to my best recollection, was: &ldquo;I do not know either where it is going&rdquo;&mdash;that is, referring to the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> It may be in the recording system which the Minister has or it may be a defect in the transcript.  I do not know. As it is at present, this report simply does not make sense.  I do not know what Senator Lenihan thinks.  We were both seated in different parts of the House, as you can see, and we both appear to have heard the Minister's remark.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read the report the very same thought struck me and I am glad Senator Browne has raised the matter.  My recollection is on all fours with his recollection.  In fact that is what the Minister said: &ldquo;I do not know either.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I heard the remark quite clearly.  The report, as it is, does not make sense.  It would only make sense in the context of the Minister being reported as saying just that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Senator Kit Ahern be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of the last meeting, last Friday fortnight, I indicated that we would not oppose Senator Dooge for election as Cathaoirleach on the basis that we in the Fianna Fáil group in the Seanad took the view that the sharing of power and offices within our democratic assembly should be maintained and continued.</P>
      <P>Since its formation under the new Constitution&mdash;the Seanad has operated now for 35 years&mdash;we have maintained a very honourable and valuable tradition in our democratic public life by sharing the offices of Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach.  In 1961 and 1965 Senator Ó Maoláin, who was then Leader of the House, went to the extent of specifying that this was the convention.  It was the honourable tradition and precedent and on both of those occasions there was a contest for the office of Leas-Chathaoirleach between the nominees of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties. We stated quite categorically that it was their right, our nominee having been elected Cathaoirleach, that a Member of either or any group other than the Fianna Fáil group was entitled to election as Leas-Chathaoirleach. On both those occasions the contest was between the Fine Gael and Labour Party nominees.</P>
      <P>I emphasise this point to show that for 35 years the Seanad has maintained an honourable position in this regard.  I should like to emphasise that in this respect we as a Government, when in Government, sought to do similarly in regard to various appointments under our control.  From the office of Chief Justice to many District Court office holders we, as a Government, appointed people who were notably opposed to us and quite vociferous in their support of both Labour and Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, it happened in regard to various State-sponsored bodies in which I personally was involved.  I had the honour with my predecessor, Mr. Erskine Childers, to serve in Governments where many people other than <Col N="74" /> those of our political persuasion were appointed to State-sponsored body positions.  This is one of the most valuable aspects in the political tradition which we have established in this part of Ireland.  At no period in this country's history is it more important to emphasise this tradition of power sharing.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the whole impetus of civilised thinking and development towards dealing with the tragic events in the North-Eastern part of our island is directed towards a large element of power-sharing between the communities in the North of Ireland. Here are we in free Ireland, having carefully built up in 50 years a tradition of democratic representative Parliamentary Government, something of which we can be very proud.  It is unfortunate, to put it mildly, that at this time in 1973 we should seek here in this House, with a very honoured past and tradition in this respect, to besmirch this tradition.  It is very unfortunate in the context of our own development as a Parliamentary democracy. It is doubly and trebly unfortunate in the context of the power-sharing efforts which are now being made in part of this island and to which the attention of the world is being directed as some way forward towards the solution of grievous problems in that part of our island.</P>
    <P>In saying this I want to emphasise that there is in no sense any personal slight in regard to Senator Evelyn Owens.  I am talking strictly from the point of view of principle and precedent&mdash;she is an excellent person.  However, we feel that in our candidate, Senator Kit Ahern, we have an outstanding candidate for this position in the sense that she is a person who has been associated with the vocational life of this country as a former President of the Irish Countrywomen's Association.  She has taken a vital interest in a practical way in the furtherance of the involvement of women in politics, in the vocational organisation of our people outside politics and in the rehabilitation of rural life, which is so important in our national life to-day. We are very proud to offer her candidature.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> The opposition to her candidature, which was quite clearly indicated would be the case both in the House and afterwards by Press release last Friday fortnight, is motivated not by Senators of the opposing political parties. I have heard expressed on a personal basis in the lobbies and in the House from many Senators the view that this matter should be unanimous. In my view it is part of a vindictive process on the part of very petty-minded people who comprise the present Government.  Undoubtedly the opposition to Senator Kit Ahern stems from a Government decision.  It indicts the present Government as a Government of total mediocrities.  I should like in particular that the media spell that out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Senator Evelyn Owens be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In doing so I do not wish to follow Senator Lenihan down the trail which he has blazed, but I should like to remind him that the Labour Party also have rights.  I propose Senator Owens because I believe she would be a most worthy occupant of the post of Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad.  Since Senator Owens was elected to this House in 1969 she has proved herself to be a most active <Col N="76" /> and dedicated Member.  She has contributed regularly to the debates and especially to those relating to trade union legislation and the social welfare code.  The fact that she is a nominee from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the Labour Panel is proof of the esteem in which she is held by her colleagues in the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that Senator Owens was President of the Local Government and Public Services Union for two years and Vice-President of that union for three years. She also served as Chairman of the Women's Advisory Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for four years.  As Senators are aware, this committee participated actively in the preparation of the submission of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to the Commission on the Status of Women.  In view of her record in that field I feel she would be an excellent choice for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach and that she would be a distinguished Leas-Chathaoirleach in keeping with the great tradition of Leas-Chathaoirleachs of the past.  It gives me great pleasure to propose Senator Owens for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to second the motion nominating Senator Owens for the post of Leas-Chathaoirleach. In this Senator we have a candidate of excellent qualifications.  She is very experienced in the industrial and trade union world and in the conduct of meetings.  She has an excellent record of service in this House.  This makes Senator Owens an excellent choice for the post of Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these qualifications she is a member of the Labour Party, the oldest political party whose members sit in this House.  That party have played a valuable part since their foundation in 1912 in the development and growth of this nation.  Since the foundation of this State in 1922, now 51 years ago, the Labour Party became involved in the development of this nation.  In these 51 years it is regrettable that no member of that party was elected or offered the post of <Col N="77" /> Cathaoirleach or Leas-Chathaoirleach of this House.  On that basis alone I can see no conflict arising on the power-sharing philosophy which Senator Lenihan has raised.  We in the Labour Party do not have to apologise for nominating a Member for any post in this or the other House.  I have pleasure in seconding Senator Owens's nomination for the post of Leas-Chathaoirleach. I would ask for the support of the House for her election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>As an independent Senator I should like to support the Fianna Fáil candidate for the post of Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I regret very much that the Labour Party have seen fit to nominate a candidate.  I should like to express my pleasure that the choice for this post rests between two women.  We ought to see much more of that in public life.  I should also like to make it very clear, as did Senator Lenihan, that nothing I say reflects in any way on Senator Owens. She is aware of the esteem and respect I have for her.  I regret that she has become in a sense a pawn in this power game.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Houses of the Oireachtas are seen to have this tradition of fairness and impartiality. I note that in the other House the Government parties have the monopoly of the Chairmanship&mdash;they hold the posts of Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  They are now attempting to do the same thing in this House.  This is highly regrettable. Whatever factors were present in choosing the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle they do not carry over into the Seanad.  The Seanad has its own traditions and they are very different from those in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context let me cite as an example that the Seanad had not traditionally looked for a quorum.  Do we now become a highly political assembly in the sense that every time we fall below a quorum do we look for that quorum?  Do we bring in a bitter note into our debates?  Do we focus more on the political points than on the merits of the measures which come before us?  We are described by constitutional writers as a vocational <Col N="78" /> body which is basically a different composition to the Dáil, yet we are reducing ourselves by this political game to the level of a fight between the Government party seeking the monopoly of the Chairmanship and the Opposition asserting their right to a sharing of this power.  The point is well made that we have here an example of an inability to share power.</P>
    <P>A few days ago we saw an example in the city of Derry of the ability to share the chairmanship and vice-chairmanship between the SDLP and the Loyalist parties.  In this House we seem to be incapable of coming to the same type of arrangement on this occasion. Senator Lenihan has made it clear that this is a new step in the procedure of the Seanad.  I have no doubt that when the Fianna Fáil Party are returned to power they will seek a monopoly of the posts of Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach of this House.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to know that this will be an isolated case, if the Labour Party achieve their ambition and get this post.  It has been made clear from the statements of Senators J. Fitzgerald and Moynihan that this is an attempt not by the Coalition Government but by the Labour Party to nail this job.  This is a sign of political immaturity.  We have been told the Labour Party have rights too.  The Seanad has a right to have a sharing of power and a balance in the assembly and we are being deprived, it would appear by the strength of the voting on the Government side, of this power.  I hope this will not introduce the elements of a bitter political forum which were absent in the last Seanad and which are not part of the tradition of the Seanad which, speaking as an independent Senator, I find a very valuable attribute of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lenihan stated that we would not follow this dastardly behaviour.  I must admit he is more charitable than I.  This is the fourth occasion on which I have been present for the election of a Leas-Chathaoirleach. The action of the Coalition parties in opposing Senator Ahern for this post to-day demonstrates clearly that they are earning for themselves the reputation of being the &ldquo;grab all&rdquo; parties.</P>
      <P>For years we have listened to their pious platitudes condemning Fianna Fáil for putting their people into every post in this country; however, today they seek to break a long-standing tradition that has existed in this House.  Senator Moynihan, a short time ago, stated that the Labour Party never got an opportunity of electing a Leas-Chathaoirleach.  Does Senator Moynihan know why?  On 3rd January, 1962, I was here when Senator Miss Davidson was proposed by the Labour Party.  She was opposed, not by Fianna Fáil, but by Senator Lindsay of Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>On that occasion the then Leader of the House, Senator Ó Maoláin, is on record&mdash;at col. 56 of the bound volume of the Seanad Official Report of 3rd January, 1962&mdash;as stating that the post of Leas-Chathaoirleach is traditionally filled by a Member of the Opposition.  Senator McAuliffe may recall that on 30th June, 1965, he was proposed for the post of Leas-Chathaoirleach. It was not Fianna Fáil that deprived Senator McAuliffe of that position on that occasion. Again, in the records of this House we find the statement from the Leader of the Opposition of that time, Senator Ó Maoláin, that this post was traditionally filled by a Member of the Opposition.  On 30th June, 1965, Fine Gael and Labour&mdash;the new-found bed-fellows&mdash;fought it out in this Chamber eight years after their marriage was dissolved in 1957 and, ironically enough, eight years before they were re-wed in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This marriage will not last forever either.  The Members of Fine Gael and Labour should remember this.  This marriage could be dissolved again.

      <P>I was deeply disappointed when I heard at the end of last week that it was proposed by the Government side of the House to oppose our nominee for Leas-Chathaoirleach. I was deeply disappointed not simply because&mdash;and I hope Senator Ahern will forgive me for saying it&mdash;this meant that Senator Ahern would not be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach. We know, on all sides of the House, that in every respect she is a completely suitable candidate for the post and would make an excellent <Col N="81" /> Leas-Chathaoirleach.  Throughout her time in this House she has gained the respect of Senators on all sides.  I was deeply disappointed, not only for this reason but also for what I think is a more important reason, and that is that this marks a complete and&mdash;I am happy to say&mdash;an unprecedented breach in the tradition of 35 years that has existed in this House.  The tradition has always been, for 35 years past, that the Government of the day fill the position of Cathaoirleach and that the main Opposition party fill the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach.  This was the position when Fianna Fáil were in office and I am happy to say&mdash;and I will give them credit for this&mdash;that it was also the position during the first and second Coalition Governments.  It is only now, with the arrival on the scene of the third Coalition Government, that we have a breach in this.</P>
      <P>Senator McGlinchey has already mentioned the attitude we took on the two occasions in 1961 and 1965 when there were two candidates for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach, both from the Opposition parties.  I think it worthwhile to quote the speech that Senator Ó Maoláin, the then Leader of the House, made on 30th June, 1965, when you A Chathaoirleach were first elected to be Leas-Chathaoirleach, at col. 132:</P>
      <P>The position of Leas-Chathaoirleach is traditionally filled by a Senator who is not a supporter of the Government.  When there was only one candidate, he was elected unanimously.  This time, however, we have two candidates equally qualified for appointment, and I feel that the choice is one that should not be influenced by those who support the Government in this House.  We shall, therefore, abstain from voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Harte suggested, if I understand him correctly, that Fianna Fáil were to be blamed for not voting for the candidate.  The line we took, quite simply, was that the position of Leas-Cathaoirleach is one that goes traditionally to the main Opposition party. Where there were two Opposition parties we simply felt that it would be totally wrong for us, as the Government party, who had a majority <Col N="82" /> in this House, to decide for the Opposition who their Leas-Chathaoirleach should be.  We felt that this would be open to the greatest criticism and therefore we should just stay out of it and allow them to decide it between themselves.  It was therefore, as has been pointed out, the Fine Gael Party who voted down the Labour candidate, as they were entitled to do.  This, of course, happened both in 1961 and in 1965.</P>
    <P>It is not merely the Senators who have long experience of the divisions in this House who have accepted that this situation existed.  I hope Senator Brosnahan will not mind my quoting a speech he made on that same day, 30th June, 1965, column 132, when he explained how he proposed to vote in the election.  He said:</P>
    <P>In 1961 I asked my executive... &mdash;that is the executive of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation&mdash;</P>
    <P>...for a direction on how to vote in the filling of the two posts which are held in this House for Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach. I was advised to observe the <i>status quo</i> since there was a custom that the post of Cathaoirleach went to the largest party in the House and that of Leas-Chathaoirleach went to the next largest party.</P>
    <P>In other words, this is an accepted precedent not merely in political circles but in this very important trade union.  I would commend this feeling of theirs to certain Members on the opposite side of the House. This very important trade union felt, quite rightly, that this is a matter which traditionally has been split in this way.</P>
    <P>I have been in this House, on and off, for approximately 15 years.  Perhaps only Senator Ryan has had longer experience of membership of it.  I can say, without any doubt whatever, that one of the great things about this House has been, year in and year out, that while we disagree on many things we have never had any difficulty about deciding such matters as this.  However strongly we might disagree&mdash;our disagreement was always strongest just immediately after a general election <Col N="83" /> when we meet for the first time&mdash;we have always been able to agree on the positions for the Chair.  I am sure the Chair will agree with me&mdash;from his own personal experience&mdash;that the position of Cathaoirleach or Leas-Chathaoirleach has always been, in one respect at any rate, an easy one in that there has always been a real, genuine feeling of co-operation among Senators on all sides of this House.  It is a very great tragedy that, after all these years this very genuine feeling of co-operation has been shattered in this way, in this undignified hunt for jobs.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Fine Gael Senators opposite, whom I take it are going to vote for the Labour candidate on this occasion and thereby break the tradition of 35 years, to stand up and justify this performance. I hope they will not just walk into the Division Lobbies.  I would like them to stand up and explain to the House and the public why, on this fundamental matter of the rights of all sections of this House, they are breaking the tradition of 35 years.</P>

      <P>There has been mention of 1965 during the debate today but I wish to go back to 1961, when I first entered the House, when we put forward Senator Miss Davidson as a candidate.  There was no National Coalition at that time; Fine Gael and Labour were two independent parties then.  There was an argument used, in favour of Senator Lindsay, that he had such a great knowledge of the Irish language that he should be appointed, which insinuated that the other candidates had not got sufficient knowledge of Irish, which was correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On the next occasion I was put forward and therefore they could not make that argument again. I received only six votes then.  I approached the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party that day and told him that he should give his party a free vote and allow them to elect whatever candidate they wished but they would <Col N="84" /> not agree.  If you, a Chathaoirleach, were a candidate on that particular day I am quite sure you would have got a majority vote.  I have never heard Senator Robinson speak before today but she really shocked me when she spoke about the immaturity of the Labour Party.  As Senator Moynihan has said, we are the oldest party in the country.  We are established since 1913 long before the other parties.  To speak about the Labour Party being immature is ludicrous.  We have never received any fair play in the House as regards the post of Leas-Chathaoirleach. The fate of that post rested in Fianna Fáil hands while they sat on these benches.  No Member of the House is entitled to occupy a seat here without voting on this issue.  I have no time for people abstaining.  They should vote for the proposal or against it. People who are elected to this House should exercise their power to vote on any issue that comes before the House. I certainly will never occupy a seat here and abstain from voting.  I have never done so as a county councillor or as a Member of this House.</P>
      <P>It is not in this House that the difficulty regarding the election of a Cathaoirleach or a Leas-Chathaoirleach started.  It started in Dáil Éireann on the day the new Dáil assembled. The National Coalition were prepared to allow the sitting Ceann Comhairle to remain in that office but a few people in the Dáil wished to weaken the position of the National Coalition by withdrawing him from that position. That was the cause of the difficulty that has arisen here today.  I repeat again, with no apologies, that we are seeking this post because we have never been afforded an opportunity in the past of getting any of the honourable posts attached to this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot hope to imitate Senator McGlinchey's imagery but one can certainly say to Senator McAuliffe that age is not necessarily a guarantee of wisdom.  A lot of talk has been heard about power-sharing over the past few years both inside and outside this House.  It appears now, as Senator Robinson pointed out, that we have a very limited concept of power-sharing on the Government <Col N="85" /> benches and that we are&mdash;if the vote goes as it looks like going&mdash;to have a situation in which the precedent of 35 years will be broken.</P>
      <P>I believe that there are precedents which should be broken, there are precedents which no amount of years or of usage will justify and there are precedents which are good in themselves but which can be broken in favour of a better precedent.  I am sorry that the Government have adopted this course of action because I feel they could have adopted a course of action which would have created a new precedent in this House.  May I remind Members of the House of what this House is and of what it is supposed to be.  Senator Robinson has already pointed out that it is supposed to be largely a vocational assembly and Senator Yeats has spoken of the type of spirit of co-operation that has characterised its debates.  That spirit certainly has been apparent since I came into this House in 1969.</P>
      <P>The opportunity, which I believe has been lost on this occasion, is the opportunity to underline the fact that there are still vocational elements in this House.  This could have been done by availing of the opportunity to nominate an elected independent, vocational person to the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach.  As I said, there should be power-sharing, but all democracies have experience of the situation in which the big people get together to squeeze the small people out. From this point of view I would be less than totally happy, although I would probably grudgingly accept power-sharing as between the two big <i>blocs</i> in this assembly&mdash;the Coalition, on one hand, and the Fianna Fáil Party, on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the House that there are seven or eight Independent Senators in this House, all of them elected, discounting completely any nominated persons.  That is a body of persons large enough and with collective and individual experience broad enough to justify the selection of one of their Members for this position. In the last Seanad one can cite, for example, Senator Sheldon, who filled the Chair as Acting Chairman for many, many hours at a stretch. <Col N="86" /> I do not think anybody could be found on any side of the House who would disagree with his conduct of the business of the House.</P>
    <P>I, and at least one other Senator in this House, have our own ideas about who should be nominated from among the Independents to this position.  We have refrained from nominating anybody because, in the circumstances of this vote and in the circumstances of these motions, it would merely be an empty gesture.  It is the mercy of God that there are not three parties taking part in the present Government, because then we might find ourselves in a pretty pickle indeed.</P>
    <P>I thought that this might have been the occasion for the creation of a new tradition&mdash;all traditions have to be created some time&mdash;a tradition of giving explicit recognition to the vocational and independent character which still lives on in this House despite attempts made to smoke it out.  For that reason I propose to vote against both the candidates.</P>

I would have preferred coming in to this discussion and to make this decision, that circumstances would have been such that the traditions which other Senators have spoken of might have been adhered to.  We must place this in its proper perspective.  We must look upon our decision here today in context.  No matter how wishfully some of us may think, let us for heaven's sake recognise the reality that, by and large, this House is composed of members of political parties and that it is a political assembly.</P>

      <P>There have been no Government directions whatever, but for Senator Lenihan's information I should like to tell him that, even after both motions went in&mdash;and this is no secret to my friends and colleagues in the Labour Party&mdash;I took some considerable time to consider and deliberate what my attitude in connection with this discussion should be.  We must look at this thing in its context. It is all right to talk nicely about power-sharing, about a non-political approach or about sacred traditions, if we forget how this arose.  How did it arise?  I am sincerely sorry that the ultimate victim in this House of the decision of the Fianna Fáil Party to play politics with the Chair in the other House should be Senator Kit Aherne. Fianna Fáil have not merely the right to oppose vigorously, but they have also a duty to oppose responsibly. While they were still in government, for political party reasons they refused to supply the Chair in the other House and withdrew the occupant of the Chair from that position.</P>

      <P>That decision of the Fianna Fáil Party was clearly a political decision.  It was taken solely in the interests and for the advantage of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It demonstrated clearly&mdash;and let us not forget this and let us not go up into the clouds talking about sacrosanct traditions and a nice power-sharing, non-political approach&mdash;that, when it suited Fianna Fáil, they were prepared to tailor their approach to the question of who should be the occupant of a Chair in order to suit their own political expediency.  It was a political manoeuvre directed against the present Government.  Of course, Fianna Fáil were entitled to do that.  The justification for it was purely and simply the advantage of Fianna Fáil and an effort to damage the prospects of the incoming Government.</P>
      <P>I have already said that I wished this situation had not arisen; but it has arisen, and I say bluntly that, if Fianna Fáil want to play rough, they should not squeal if they come out of it with bloody noses.

      <P>I was going to say a few words about the suitability of the candidates.  Let me say it. I regard both of the candidates as eminently suitable for the post.  As regards qualifications, perhaps there is not a lot to choose between them. They both have shown in their contributions <Col N="89" /> to discussions in this House that they are able to approach the business of this House on a very high level.  They have, each of them in their own way, on different occasions made outstanding contributions to the discussions in this House.  Perhaps there is not a great deal to choose between them there.  I do not know whether there is anything much to choose between them on the grounds of experience as far as chairing meetings is concerned.  I am prepared to accept that there is not.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil had it open to them, if they wanted to, to put into the field in this election a person who had outstanding qualifications in that connection and a person to whom I paid tribute on more than one occasion in this House, notwithstanding his interruptions when I was speaking a few minutes ago, and that person was Senator Yeats.  They chose not to do that, and they leave the choice between two Senators about whom I think one can say there is probably not a great deal between them on qualifications.</P>
      <P>Therefore I am asked, to choose between a Labour nominee and a Fianna Fáil nominee.  I have no hesitation whatever, when being presented with that choice, in choosing the Labour nominee.</P>

      <P>I find it very difficult to speak on this situation because I am genuinely anxious to see the new Government succeed and also to see a coalition working, because I believe that condemnations of coalition in the past were neither justified nor correct.  I believe that all life is a coalition.  I was one of the many people in the country who were exhilarated by the prospect of a change after 16 years' rule by a single party. In any country that is good.  I have also been quite excited by the calibre of some of the Ministers in the new Government.  I have admired and will continue to admire many of their decisions and actions in cutting through ridiculous red tape and in showing that they are in control.  Unfortunately, I cannot go along with this effort, which I am assured is not a Government decision, <Col N="90" /> and I am relieved to hear that from Senator O'Higgins.  I think it is a very ill-thought-out decision by the Labour Party who have been given more than their fair share of posts in the sharing out within the Government. May I pay tribute to their Ministers for doing a good job.</P>
      <P>We are a small community.  We have got to work together.  We have always done this here in the Seanad. I hope that is a pattern for united action in our free part of the country and ultimately in a united country. Let us forget about today.  Whatever the rights and wrongs of what happened in the Dáil with regard to the Chair it should not have come in here. The tradition should have been continued. I have been 16 years working with Senator Ryan and I share the record of being one of the longest serving Members here.</P>
      <P>I am exceedingly well disposed to the Government and exceedingly anxious to see them succeed in the task they have.  I should like to see them allowed a proper period for carrying out that task.  I have no doubt that they will get the full period and, perhaps, a second one to carry out the task.  As one who has great faith and confidence in this Government I appeal to the Labour Party not to repeat this type of drab policy again. The Coalition is where it is due to the faith and confidence that the country placed in one person mainly, in Mr. Liam Cosgrave, who is Taoiseach today.  He came across as a man we could trust in all respects, not merely in regard to law and order but also in regard to fair play for all. Please let this be the last of this and let us not have separate party decisions on these drab lines.  Let the Government rule and decide whether we are going to continue our valuable tradition or not.  In protest against what has been done I intend to abstain from voting on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. I have said all I had to say in proposing Senator Kit Ahern.  There are one or two points in the debate arising out of what Senator O'Higgins stated that I would like to refer to. <Col N="91" /> This is not a matter of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour.  It is all right for the rough and tumble of politics to reduce the debate to that level. This is a matter of preserving the basic democratic institutions which we have established at great pain and cost over the past 50 years.  It is the basic convention in relation to power-sharing of the kind that has operated in the Seanad for the past 35 years that maintains these institutions.</P>
      <P>We have today above all else, more particularly at this period in our history, a duty to the community in which we live to ensure that what has been achieved here is shown to the world to be a continuing attitude towards democracy in Ireland.  We have had enough of the other type of publicity in part of this island. They are now making the painful efforts through power-sharing procedures in the North Eastern part of our island to establish the sort of democracy that we have established here and cemented over the past 50 years.  In my view what we are doing today is a very grievous blow towards this particular aspiration which is the objective of every right-thinking Irish man and woman, namely the establishment of democratic procedures in every part of this island; democratic procedures under which it is acknowledged that the people opposed to you have a right to speak, a right to participate and a right to share.  We, in our group, represent practically 50 per cent of the Irish people.  We feel we have a right to participate and a right to share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already stated, I have met many Senators from all parties in the lobbies and corridors since we put forward Senator Kit Ahern's name last Friday fortnight and have found a complete unanimity of view that she should be elected.  After we put her name forward last Friday fortnight the <Col N="92" /> name of another candidate was put forward at the last minute.  I am driven to the conclusion, and the facts are inescapable that the Government decided at a meeting&mdash;which is usually held on Friday morning and a Motion was sent in last Friday afternoon&mdash;to direct the Labour and Fine Gael Parties to adopt this mean, petty, despicable attitude.  This indicates, as I said initially, that despite the media projection, this Government is basically a Government of mediocrity.</P>

      <P>That the National School Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1972, prepared by the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance under the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928, and laid before the House on the 27th July, 1972, be confirmed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke) Richard (Dick) Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main provisions of this amending scheme are, briefly:</P>
      <P>1.  The national teachers' pension scheme will be a contributory scheme (paragraph 7);</P>
      <P>2.  The establishment of reciprocity of pensionable service as between the national teachers' and secondary teachers' pension schemes (paragraphs 9 and 10);</P>
      <P>3.  National teachers who, in the past, had given service in preparatory colleges may have that service reckoned for pension purposes (paragraph 9);</P>
      <P>4.  A national teacher who had certain service in the Irish Folklore Commission and who had been allowed to have half of that service reckoned for pension may now have it reckoned in full (paragraph 23);</P>
      <P>5.  The national teachers' strike in 1969 will not interrupt pensionable service (paragraph 24).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national teachers' pension scheme has been a non-contributory scheme since 1934, a circumstance which was taken into account when the salary scales for these teachers were being drawn up or adjusted from time to time.  On the other hand, the pension schemes for post-primary teachers were&mdash;and are&mdash;on a contributory basis at the rate of 5 per cent of the teacher's pensionable rate of pay and this circumstance, too, was adverted to in the drawing up <Col N="97" /> or adjustment of salary scales for post-primary teachers.  The introduction of a common basic scale of salary for teachers generally as from 1st July, 1968, demanded that these discrepancies in regard to pension conditions be rationalised and, so, the superannuation of national teachers was established on a contributory basis with effect as from 1st July, 1968. Paragraph 7 of this amending scheme will give statutory effect to this situation.</P>
    <P>In preparing this amendment I felt it was only right to have regard to those national teachers who had to retire, either because they had reached the statutory age limit or because of disability, at the end of the school year which ended on 30th June, 1968 &mdash;that is, one day before the introduction of the improved pay structure for teachers.  Accordingly I have provided in paragraph 8 of the scheme now before the House that these teachers will, in their pensions and lump sums, get the benefit of the improved salary structures.  Post-primary teachers who had to retire at the end of the corresponding post-primary school year&mdash;31st July, 1968, for secondary schools and 31st August, 1968, for vocational schools&mdash;had their superannuation awards based on the improved rates.</P>
    <P>At present the secondary teachers' pension scheme allows for the reckoning of national teacher service for superannuation purposes.  There is not however a similar reciprocal provision in the national teachers' scheme for a pensionable secondary teacher who transfers to national teaching.  Paragraph 9 of this amending scheme will rectify that anomaly, and teachers who have retired since 1st October, 1956, inclusive, will have the opportunity of availing of this provision where applicable and have their pensions revised from the date of retirement.</P>
    <P>A small number of national teachers had, in the past, given service in the preparatory colleges but through lack of suitable provision could not receive pensionable credit for that service.  I propose, in this paragraph 9, also, to give any such national teacher, including those who may have retired since <Col N="98" /> 1st October, 1956, the opportunity of recovering the pensionable value of preparatory college service which ceased before 5th January, 1957; and where the opportunity is availed of, I propose to have pensions which have already been granted to these teachers revised with effect from the date of retirement.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to have, eventually, pension reciprocity generally for the teaching services in order that there may be greater mobility within the teaching profession.  Unfortunately, there are difficulties&mdash;not the least being the necessity for amending legislation&mdash;in the way of including vocational teachers in reciprocity arrangements. These teachers are employed by local authorities and their pensions are provided for under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956.  My Department is at present tackling this problem in collaboration with Departments of Local Government and Finance, but it will be a little time yet before the necessary proposals can be brought before the House.  In the meantime I thought it best to establish what reciprocity could be speedily achieved.</P>
    <P>An amendment to the national teachers' pension scheme in 1967 allowed a teacher who had at least three years whole-time service in the Irish Folklore Commission prior to 5th November, 1951 to reckon half of that service for pension.  As the number of teachers involved is insignificant, and having regard to the nature of the work of the former Irish Folklore Commission I consider that a more liberal approach is warranted.  I have therefore provided&mdash;in paragraph 23&mdash;that such service may be given full pensionable credit.</P>
    <P>I believe that this amending superannuation scheme will be generally welcome by teachers and I am satisfied that its provisions are just and reasonable. I have no hesitation, therefore, in recommending to the House that it be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is welcome and supported by Fianna Fáil in the Seanad.  It introduces, and rightly so, reciprocity for pension purposes <Col N="99" /> between the secondary and national teaching professions.  I welcome, in particular, what the Minister has stated in regard to his proposal to extend this&mdash;which, of course, will require amending legislation&mdash;to vocational teachers.  This reciprocity for pension purposes&mdash;there are other matters contained in the motion but I will confine myself to this reciprocity principle&mdash;is highly desirable in order to influence greater impetus towards complete mobility within the teaching profession.</P>
      <P>When I was Minister for Education I was very interested in this development as I feel it is highly desirable from many points of view.  From a practical and financial point of view it is highly desirable to have total uniformity in regard to salaries and pensions.  From a teaching point of view it should be acknowledged that education is a whole in itself and should be viewed, philosophically and factually, as one <i>corpus</i> in which the profession of teaching is regarded as of importance and of equal importance whether it is at primary level, second level or third level.</P>
      <P>In time I would like to see this idea extended into third level education.  I would like to see total mobility, not just between primary, vocational and secondary teachers but right into third level institutions such as our technological colleges and universities. This conception of education is the one that has the greatest validity.  The traditional differences and barriers have up to now impeded its development and I welcome this reciprocity in regard to pensions between secondary and primary teachers as a step in that direction. I welcome also the Minister's intention of extending it to vocational teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like&mdash;and I am sure this would be the Minister's wish also&mdash;to see it extended generally so as to achieve not just mobility in regard to pensions but complete mobility in regard to teachers generally, be they teachers of young children in primary schools or teachers at the highest level of the educational system.  The question of educating people, <i>educare</i> in <Col N="100" /> Latin, leading people on, is one that is very basic and very fundamental.  I would certainly welcome basic teaching qualifications for teachers in all the institutes of third level education, including universities.  In certain instances, heretofore, we have not concentrated sufficiently on the basic elements of teaching in regard to lectures.  However, great the particular knowledge or specialisation at third level education, if the teacher has not got basic training in education, which should be applicable right across the board to all teachers at whatever level of education is applied, the whole system of education will continue to be faulty.  I welcome the Minister's proposal.</P>

Is maith an rud go bhfuil pinsean á thúirt.</P>
      <P>I welcome this proposal.  It is very essential and very important.  It was already prepared in July, 1972, and so far as I know the Irish National Teachers' Organisation have been campaigning for it for years.  Many of their members, and other teachers in the past, have taught for many years under deplorable conditions.  When they came to retire many of them, because they had worked in the Folklore Commission or because they were unable to secure positions when they came out of training, were unable to get pensions.  It is very gratifying that this has been rectified.  It will be most encouraging to the teaching profession in general.  We would all like to see a unified profession.  It has been suggested that there will be mobility between teachers so that they can move from one level to another without any loss of pension rights or salary.</P>
      <P>I welcome this motion and I am sure it will meet the wishes of teachers.</P>

      <P>When the comprehensive schools were being established it was arranged that the teachers concerned would be provided with a pension scheme on the same lines as that already in existence for secondary teachers.  In consultation with the Department of Finance it was decided that the most effective way of providing such a scheme would be by amending the existing secondary teachers scheme to embrace teachers in comprehensive schools.</P>
      <P>This amendment is intended to make that provision.  The amendment comprises a definition of a comprehensive school teacher, and then goes on to provide that each relevant paragraph and schedule of the existing scheme is amended to include comprehensive school teachers.  This amendment does not alter the secondary teachers scheme in any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> The essential principles of the secondary teachers scheme are broadly the same as those applying to other public service pension schemes, the main point of difference being that it is a voluntary scheme.  Therefore every comprehensive school teacher will have to decide for himself whether he will join the scheme or remain out of it.  The amendment provides that a comprehensive school teacher who exercises his option to join the scheme within six months of the date of confirmation of this amendment may have all his previous teaching service in a comprehensive school made pensionable.  If he has not joined within six months he may of course join at any later date, but then he could only reckon previous service up to a limit of  months in accordance with the terms of the existing scheme.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>In their 14-point plan announced before the recent general election, the Government stated their intention to reduce local rates by transferring on a phased basis from local to central taxation the burden of health charges on local authorities and the cost to them of local authority housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 30th March, the Government announced that, in the present financial year, 1973-74, the rate to be levied by each local authority for health services and local authority housing could be reduced by 25 per cent as compared with the rates levied for these purposes in 1972-73, this being the first phase in the total transfer of these costs to the Exchequer in a four year period.  Prior to the making of that announcement, however, 11 county councils and three <Col N="103" /> urban district councils had already adopted estimates of expenditure and determined rates in the pound for 1973-74.</P>
    <P>Under existing law, there is no provision whereby a local authority can reduce a rate which has been properly determined.  Therefore, in order that the ratepayers in those areas where rates had already been determined might benefit from the reductions announced by the Government, it was necessary that a legislative provision be made enabling the relevant local authorities to levy an amended rate.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a simple and short technical measure designed solely to validate any modified rates in the pound adopted by the small number of relevant local authorities subsequent to the announcement of the Government's decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. As the Minister has stated, this is a technical measure to give effect to the policy decision of the Government, arising out of the commitment made by the Government in their 14-point programme before the general election. It is welcome in so far as it gives relief to ratepayers.  I will let time decide the wisdom of the decision: that will be a matter for future political debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, the decision to transfer these moneys to the Exchequer and the decision in regard to removing the food subsidies from value-added tax are two Government decisions arising out of election commitments which they will dearly regret.  Time will prove the validity or otherwise of my point. The first budget, already introduced, is indicative of how the Government, from the revenue point of view, have circumscribed themselves by reason of electoral commitments which were so specific that they had to be honoured, unless the Government discredited themselves.  Having honoured these two commitments, both under this heading and under the heading arising out of the removal of value-added tax from food, the Government by adopting and following their commitments in these two areas have found <Col N="104" /> themselves with a sort of Frankenstein.</P>
    <P>We saw the first evidence of it in the budget where there was not sufficient revenue available to bring in a proper budget geared for growth that would provide the proper incentives both for people at work and for people seeking to invest.  As far as the budget is concerned, it is a thing of shreds and patches arising out of the fact that the Government had so circumscribed themselves by reason of the commitment I mentioned, that is, the total amount of £12.7 million arising out of transferring the health charges and the housing subsidies from local authority rates to the Central Fund.  That, allied to the £19 million odd under VAT, comes to something in the region of £33 million.  This is the straitjacket in which the Government found themselves in the budget.</P>
    <P>I believe it is relevant in this discussion to raise this matter, because at the time the Dáil was discussing it the budget proposals had not emerged. They have now emerged since the Dáil discussed this Bill on the Second Stage.  In my view, the publication of next year's budget, if the present Government are there to produce it, will further endorse and emphasise the point I am making.  This commitment of £12.7 million will be a rising feature in the next four years and is an inescapable commitment which will put the Government in a straitjacket in regard to revenue.  It cannot lead to anything else except financial chaos.</P>
    <P>The recent budget, which the people rejected in the Presidential Election, is the first example of the type of financial difficulties that political parties can get into when in government by reason of trick-of-the-loop policies. There was no need for the Government to produce the trick-of-the-loop 14-point policy because there was, by reason of the logical swing of the pendulum, a swing against the Government of the day in the last general election which would happen anyway after 16 years in office.  There was no need for the Government to hold out the extra bait, and this Bill is evidence of one aspect of the extra bait that <Col N="105" /> was held out to the electorate and is one of the matters that put the Government into a budgetary jam&mdash;I do not mean jam on bread; I mean a budgetary jam&mdash;and that particular straitjacket is one from which they will not escape easily.  It will be a rising and a mounting factor which will not just put them into a straitjacket by the time the next budget comes around but will lead to a strangulation situation as far as the present Government are concerned.</P>

      <P>As the Minister has stated in his speech, this is largely a technical Bill.  A set of circumstances arose because certain local authorities did not defer the striking of their rate until the Government had an opportunity of honouring one of the items on their 14-point programme.  The local authority of which I am a member, Limerick City Council, did in fact defer the striking of their rate in the belief, which was subsequently justified, that the Government would honour their commitment.  In fact, instead of striking an increased rate of more than £1 in the £, as a result of the Government measure we were enabled to reduce our rate by 35p, which is quite a considerable saving.</P>
      <P>I am interested to note the change that has come over Senator Lenihan since he became a member of the Opposition.  Before, as a member of the Government, he was an unqualified optimist.  He now seems to have become a prophet of gloom.  Some of the subjects he has touched on might be more appropriately discussed on the Appropriation Bill when it comes before this House in due course.</P>
      <P>However, this measure is one that is generally welcomed.  It is unfortunate that certain local authorities did not wait a little bit longer: if they had, this Bill would probably not have come before the House.  Now that it has done so, it should be universally welcomed.  It is merely a technical adjustment and proves once more that the Government intend to honour their 14-point programme, and this House should unreservedly welcome it.</P>

      <P>It is now painfully <Col N="106" /> obvious that the 14-point plan announced by the Government before the election was grossly dishonest.  The Minister has told us today that the announcement stated their intention to reduce local rates by transferring on a phased basis from local to central taxation the burden of health charges. That 14-point plan was dishonest in this way: the Government should have told the people before the election that it was their intention to cut the health estimates in the present year.  I am chairman of the North Western Health Board and only two days ago we learned to our horror that the estimate for this year has been cut by almost £1½ million out of a total estimate of less than £8½ million.  The Government should have told the people in Counties Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal before the election that they would not be able to do the work they intended to do.</P>

I am stating that they reduced the expenditure to provide the money necessary&mdash;in our region alone by £1½ million.  There are eight regions in this country and if one multiplied eight by one and a half, we find in all probability that the health estimates in the present financial year amount to £12 million less.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House but I should like to make one point which I think is of some substance.  The proposal in the 14-point plan which, as the Minister has told us and we remember very well, is to reduce the local rates by transferring in a four year period the burden of health charges from local rates to the Central Exchequer, was an extraordinarily misdirected one.  The cost this year is &mdash;£12.7 million.  The cost next year and successive years will be at least that and with inflation running as high as at present and the continuing improvement in health services, which inevitably grow ever more expensive, the cost in future years will clearly be even more.  I feel it not unreasonable to say that four years from now the annual cost of this proposal will be in the region of £55 million or perhaps £60 million. That is a very large sum of money. It is worthwhile considering what the benefit to the ratepayer will be.</P>
      <P>All of us know that of all forms of taxation, the most unpopular and in many respects the most burdensome is that of local rates.  There are people of course, who can afford to pay them but there are many others who can not.  I am thinking particularly of retired people, widows perhaps living in large and heavily rated houses on very small incomes who find themselves with these very heavy burdens in rates to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of all this very large expenditure which the present Government have undertaken is to leave these people essentially no better off.  I know the Minister will tell us that but for this proposal they would be even worse off this year.  Nevertheless he must agree that essentially retired people and widows, the rate-paying public in general, are no better off this year than they were last year: the burden of rates on them is just as <Col N="109" /> heavy.  There is a saving in some cases of perhaps three pence in the £. In other cases there is no difference and in others there may be one penny or so in the £ extra to pay.  But, essentially, this extraordinarily expensive scheme, which will cost in the region of £60 million a year in another four years, will at the end of all this time and as a result of all this enormous expenditure leave the rate-paying public, the ordinary private householder, in the position he was in in the financial year 1972-73.  This seems to me to be a classic instance of a totally misdirected, extravagantly and foolishly planned scheme.</P>
    <P>As has already been pointed out, the then Fianna Fáil Government at a late period in the election proposed a different scheme.  I would put it to the Minister and to Senators generally that our scheme was a far better one. Under it, all the burden on the private householder would have been lifted and the eventual cost to the Exchequer would have been no higher, I suspect perhaps even lower, than under the proposal in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked in the Dáil a week or so ago what proportion of all rates came from private hereditaments as opposed to factories, licensed premises and business premises of all kinds.  He sought to evade the issue by saying &ldquo;the great bulk&rdquo;.  I am not an expert on semantics and I do not know what &ldquo;great bulk&rdquo; means, but to me, and I suspect to most people, when someone says the great bulk of something is in question this would suggest 70, 80 or 90 per cent.  When the Minister was pressed he admitted that on one way of estimating the thing 49.56 per cent of all rates were collected from private householders and on another more favourable way of estimating it, 53 per cent.  Fifty-three per cent he stated was the bulk, but this does not seem to be so.</P>
    <P>We have the situation that almost half the total remission of rates in this Bill and in successive measures of the kind during the next three years will go to the businessmen, owners of factories, large blocks of flats, <i>et cetera</i>, and will not go to the ordinary <Col N="110" /> private householder.  This extraordinarily expensive scheme is entirely misdirected and the money could be spent more profitably either as we proposed by completely freeing the ordinary private citizen from rates or by further improving social services or such schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority which over a number of years have been deeply concerned with the increase in local taxation, I and the other members of the local authority deeply appreciate the manner in which the relief has at last come.  At this point in time it is ridiculous to say that health charges should still be continued as a charge on local authority rates.  In the local authority of which I am a member the local rates, until the present relief came from the Government, were £8 in the £.  The health proportion of that £8 was £5 and this left very little for the development that was required locally for sewerage, lighting, <i>et cetera.</i>  If the Government's decision had not been implemented or if the Fianna Fáil policy had continued we would very shortly have the position where only health charges could be met by the local rate-paying community, many of whom, as Senator Yeats has stated, are retired persons, persons in a small income, <i>et cetera.</i> The gesture to remove in the first instance one-fourth and absorb all the current year's increase was a major one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Yeats stated it means no relief.  It is true that some local authorities did not say much but at least they developed their local services due to the extra relief.  They are building more houses, they are developing more water and sewerage schemes and they are spending more on public lighting, which is helping the local citizens to whom they have a responsibility.  I know from my own local authority and from many others associated with municipal authorities that not only Labour and Fine Gael but Fianna Fáil members have for years pleaded to have the impact of the health charges removed from local rates.  This is a good start and is <Col N="111" /> deeply appreciated by those who represent the ratepayers in my local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little puzzled by some of the arguments being made against this because I am not quite sure if I should accept Senator Lenihan's statement that the Coalition would have won the election whether they had introduced this scheme or not or the suggestion which has been made by Senator McGlinchey that it was because of the scheme announced in the 14-point plan that the National Coalition won the election.  I should not like to have to decide this for them.</P>
      <P>I am surprised at a person of Senator Yeats's eminence in this field making comments which he will have to admit even to himself, if he takes a look at them in the printed report, are extremely foolish.  What he is, in effect, saying is that although rates in this city, for instance, were not increased&mdash;though they would have been increased by well over £1 in the £&mdash;there was no saving to the ratepayer as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>

On a £50 valuation they would be paying more than £50 in the year more.  This is a fair point.  It was a good saving and has been much appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Yeats's comment on the question of the increase which is bound to occur during the years because of inflation or for any other reason is the strongest argument which can be put up by anybody for a responsible Government taking over those charges from the rates.  It would be unreasonable to ask ratepayers to continue to pay for them.  He trotted out a little hare which was trotted out in the Dáil but did not run very far.  This related to whether 53.56 <Col N="112" /> per cent of the rates is or is not greater than 46.44 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>None of us has to be a genius to understand that 53.56 is the greater portion of a division if the balance of 46.34 is on the other side. It is futile to argue over this.  The fact is that the greater portion of this is being paid by people who are resident in houses and not people who own factories or business premises.  I should like to point out that those who own factories and business premises and who are getting away with a reduced rate if they are making a profit on their buildings are repaying up to 50 per cent of that in taxes to the State.  The amount they will ultimately get will be very small.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to postpone for a period of 12 months the local elections which under existing law are due to be held this month.  The Government's decision to seek legislation to postpone these elections was based on two considerations. In the first place the Government had regard to the number of elections that had already been held during the past year and to the proximity of the Presidential Election. Senators will recall that referenda were held in May and December, 1972, a general election in February, 1973, and the Presidential Election on 30th May.  Clearly, it would be asking too much to expect the electors to come out again to vote at the local elections a few weeks later.  The Government <Col N="113" /> also had regard to the necessity for a reappraisal of the local government structure which it is intended to examine afresh.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is enacted the election will be held in June, 1974, and every fifth year thereafter.  The Bill extends the terms of office of existing members of local authorities accordingly and makes minor consequential arrangements in relation to appointment of school attendance committees and the meetings of vocational education committees.  These are purely technical matters and the provisions in this regard are identical with those contained in the Local Elections Act, 1972.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw special attention to section 2 of the Bill.  That section proposes to empower the Minister for Local Government to effect any future postponement of local elections by order, subject to the limitation that such an order will not have effect unless and until it has been approved by a resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is the fourth occasion on which local elections have been postponed in the past eight years&mdash;the fifteenth occasion since 1919&mdash;special legislation being introduced each time.  It seems desirable, therefore, to introduce a simplified procedure which would be less wasteful of parliamentary time and section 2 does this by providing that the postponement instrument will be an order, not an Act.  I would stress that such an order cannot come into operation without the specific approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas and the final effective decision on whether local elections should be postponed will continue to rest with the two Houses of the Oireachtas, following full and open debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill was going through the Dáil many Deputies were anxious to know what are the Government's intentions in relation to local government reorganisation and I am sure Senators are also interested in this question.  It is my intention to have a fresh look at the local government structure.  This, of course, will take time and until the examination is complete I will not be in a position to indicate <Col N="114" /> what structural changes will be proposed.  In consultation with local authorities, I intend to give early attention to the question of equality of representation as between the different county electoral areas.  In general, these electoral areas were drawn up over 30 years ago and do not reflect the significant changes in the distribution of population which have taken place in recent years.  I hope that at least the more serious anomalies in this regard will have been dealt with before next year's local elections.</P>
    <P>Senators may regret the necessity for this further postponement of local elections, as indeed I do.  On this occasion, however, it can at least be said that there is no area without a local council since the present Government restored local representation in Dublin and Bray.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to extend the statutory limit on the amount of capital available to Fóir Teoranta to finance its operations.  The Bill also provides that Exchequer loans be written off equating to certain investments which were transferred to the company from Taiscí Stáit Teoranta and which are now worthless.</P>
      <P>The company was set up under the Fóir Teoranta Act, 1972, and it began operations in April, 1972.  Its function is to provide reconstruction finance for industrial concerns which may be in danger of having to close down or suspend activities because they are unable to raise necessary capital from the normal commercial sources.  They must, however, be basically sound and be capable of becoming viable.  It is, therefore, the last link in the chain of State assistance for industry.  The governing legislation requires that industrial concerns fulfil a number of conditions in order to be eligible for assistance from Fóir Teoranta.  The employment content and the capital employed in them must be significant, the owners must have made a reasonable contribution to the initial capital, prospects of profitability on a permanent basis must be reasonable and there must be evidence that failure to receive financial assistance would have serious repercussions at national or local level.  In this context industrial activity has been interpreted in the broadest possible terms to include all economic activities that can reasonably be described as being of an industrial nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta has already disbursed approximately £5 million to firms requiring assistance.  Some of this finance was used to honour investment commitments inherited from Taiscí Stáit Teoranta, which was dissolved in <Col N="116" /> March of last year, but the greater proportion was in respect of applications made to the company itself.  To date it has provided assistance to 56 firms with a total employment content of approximately 8,500 persons.  For the most part this finance has been disbursed as long term loans and the amounts provided in individual cases have ranged from as little as £2,500 upwards.  Generally it is small and medium-sized firms which have availed of the Fóir Teoranta facilities.  Where the company has undertaken a commitment of £250,000 or more in individual firms, the prior approval of the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce has been obtained because of the very significant amounts involved.</P>
    <P>As the State lender of last resort the company's objective is to take all possible steps to strengthen the position of a firm in temporary difficulties which has reasonable prospects of succeeding in the longer term.  It therefore adopts a sympathetic attitude towards applications for assistance. At the same time it must be prepared to refuse assistance where the evidence suggests that the applicant firm has no reasonable chance of ultimate success and some applications have been rejected on this basis. When necessary, it has insisted on management changes and the nomination of some directors as a condition of providing financial assistance. These steps have been necessary to guard against the danger that support might be given to concerns which might not of their own accord implement the changes required to improve the prospects of profitability.</P>
    <P>The legislation which established Fóir Teoranta provided that the company could borrow to a limit of £7.5 million to finance its operations and it was expected at the time that this limit would suffice for a few years. The demand for reconstruction finance, however, has far exceeded what was anticipated.  As I have already indicated, the company has disbursed approximately £5 million to date; in addition to this it has had to borrow £1 million to recoup the industrial Credit Company in respect of <Col N="117" /> bridging finance provided to Taiscí Stáit Teoranta and it has undertaken further commitments which have brought it close to the existing statutory limit on its borrowing powers. Amending legislation to increase its resources is therefore essential to enable it to continue the useful work it has been doing to date.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the present Bill proposes that the new limit on borrowing by Fóir Teoranta be fixed at £17.5 million, an increase of £10 million on the present limit.  Up to now the company has been almost entirely financed by borrowing from the Exchequer, as the returns on its share and loan investments, including those inherited from Taiscí Stáit Teoranta, have been negligible so far and this position is likely to continue for some time.  It is proposed therefore&mdash;in section 3 of the Bill&mdash;to raise from £7.5 million to £17.5 million the limit on the power of the Minister for Finance to provide loan capital to the company.</P>
    <P>On the dissolution of Taiscí Stáit Teoranta their liabilities and investments were transferred to Fóir Teoranta. These included investments in Aviation Development Ltd, Cloth Manufacturers Ltd, (Cootehill), Ever-fresh Foods Ltd, and Fenian Gun Company of Ireland Ltd.  These four companies have ceased trading and the amounts accruing to Fóir Teoranta from the realisation of their assets will be negligible.  The book value of these investments stands at £1,142,000 and Fóir Teoranta carries a liability of an equal amount to the Exchequer in respect of them.  The company proposes to write these investments out of its balance sheet and it is desirable that it be relieved of its liability to the Exchequer in respect of a similar amount.  This is the purpose of section 4 of the Bill.  The company does not wish to carry a liability in respect of worthless investments inherited from Taiscí Stáit and the write-off of this liability will help towards giving a fairer reflection of the cost to the Exchequer of Fóir Teoranta's activities.</P>
    <P>The high level of demand for reconstruction finance may be attributed <Col N="118" /> to a number of factors, such as the rapid technological change in industry, the continuing impact of free trade and the falling value of money as a consequence of which individual firms require larger amounts of assistance than had been envisaged.  It is predictable that in this situation a number of basically sound industrial concerns will experience temporary trading difficulties and it is very desirable that the State should take positive action to ensure that these firms are not forced out of business unnecessarily.  In view of the heavy cost of providing jobs in new industries, it is important that every possible step be taken to maintain existing firms and preserve employment where firms appear to have a reasonable chance of survival.  The achievements of Fóir Teoranta in the relatively short period since its establishment have been considerable.  The company provides an orderly and expert procedure for the rehabilitation of these potentially viable firms and it constitutes, therefore, a valuable element in the range of facilities designed to assist our industrial development.</P>
    <P>The present legislation will make available to Fóir Teoranta an additional £10 million to carry on its functions.  It is envisaged that this additional provision should suffice for at least two years ahead.  I should qualify this, however, by pointing out that in the field of reconstruction finance, where there is not an even pattern of demand for assistance, it is even more difficult than usual to predict requirements in advance.  Apart from increasing the limits on the finance available to Fóir Teoranta no further changes in the company's governing legislation are considered necessary at this stage.</P>
    <P>I therefore confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>Is beag atá le rá agamsa ach fáilte a chur ós comhair an Bille seo.  I should like to welcome this Bill.  It was an important piece of legislation originally when it came before the House and was welcomed on all sides.  It has saved some industries <Col N="119" /> from liquidation and has saved many jobs.  When originally this Bill came before the House I was very perturbed that no provision had been made for the tourist industry.  We know that within the last two or three years, owing to the position in the North and many other factors outside our control, many hotels have run into deep waters. I do not know if there is legislation to rescue those.  I am very sorry they have not come within the ambit of this Bill. When the Bill was previously before the House I made reference to this problem.  Our tourist industry is the second biggest we have.  It is regrettable that no provision has been made for rescue operations for hotels which have run into difficulties through no fault of their own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to extend the customary welcome to the Minister.  I have two brief comments to make.  First, at a time when our home market is being progressively opened up by the EEC requirements many small and medium-sized industries are experiencing considerable difficulties in maintaining their base and there is evidence of this in the trade statistics showing the increased percentage of competitive imports eating up the home market.  I wonder if perhaps the orientation of Fóir Teoranta could not be changed somewhat, so that instead of regarding this body as a last resort to which a firm in some difficulty might come, they could themselves, particularly with reference to the Minister's own Department and the Department of Industry and Commerce, initiate surveys of industries and try to identify at an early stage industries that would require such help.  Very often when firms come to Fóir Teoranta it is too late to save them.  Many of our industries are old family-established industries and very often they do not realise that they are in need of help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister recognised in his speech that a job saved in home industry, particularly a job serving the home market and thereby saving imports, is at least the equal of a job created in a a new industry, say, export-orientated. <Col N="120" /> There might be room for closer collaboration between the IDA, the ICC and Fóir Teoranta in a global attack on the problem of employment preservation and development.</P>
    <P>The second point I should like to make is that the Minister pointed out that special criteria exists for the refusal of loans.  Perhaps he could expand on the criteria used in view of the fact, which he pointed out, that firms come as a last resort to Fóir Teoranta and a refusal literally means the death-knell for a company and, therefore a loss of employment.  Could it be possible that since the firm makes its approach as a last resort, the Minister might be used as a court of final appeal?  Perhaps we could have made available to us from time to time a list of those firms that were helped and the reasons for giving such help, and also a list of those refused help and why these refusals were made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to state that I welcome this increase in financial assistance for industries which are in difficulties.  From my experience, particularly in the West of Ireland, I could give many reasons why some industries find themselves in difficulties but the obvious reason is the lack of education and tradition in the management of industries.  There is also a lack of education and tradition in the crafts and trades that are important at the present time.  It is not only important to provide financial assistance for industries which are finding it difficult but also to provide a comprehensive educational programme for managers of such industries.  There is a demand at the present time for goods and services which a few years ago we did not expect would arise.  We have not the equipment or personnel to turn out many of these goods and services fast enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should take special note of the fact that we will not get them fast enough because we have not the training or tradition in both management and the manufacture of the crafts. Not only is it important to provide financial assistance for industry it is also of the greatest importance that a programme of education in management <Col N="121" /> be started without delay.  Some two- to three-week courses in management have been provided in particular small industries, but a course of night-classes in each county would be of great benefit to managers in industry. It is particularly difficult for people in the West of Ireland where, I might say, none of us have ever met a manager, let alone learn anything from one.  It is very important that such knowledge be conveyed without delay.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to raise with the Minister.  Am I correct in believing that Fóir Teoranta do not assist industries which have not already got assistance from the IDA?  I do not believe this is a good thing.  There are many industries which for one reason or another have not been grant-aided by the IDA and who deserve some assistance from this fund.  From an economic and social point of view the jobs are important, even if the IDA in the first instance might have decided that such industry was not a subject for grant-aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to supplement the last point made by Senator McCartin I should like to make it clear that I do not quite understand whether the money is paid in respect of trying to make a thing viable without having regard to the other factors that go to make it viable.  For example, under the Industrial Training Act, 1967, and through recent upward movements the whole question of levying grants can colour reality.  Consequently, people have to provide a certain amount of the total wage bill so that they can have training managers, training officers and job demonstrators appointed.  If people are to be paid it would be very desirable if we knew that the money which they will receive to get out of trouble, as it were, was not sufficient and that consideration would be given to some further supplement towards a properly-geared training scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I express my own sense of pride and pleasure in making my own maiden contribution to the Seanad?  It may seem strange that one <Col N="122" /> can be a Member of the other House of the Oireachtas for so long, as I have been, and not participate in the proceedings of this Assembly, but I feel privileged to do so today.  I should like to thank Senator Halligan and his colleagues for the welcome extended to me.</P>
      <P>We can all accept what Senator Ahern properly said about the tourist industry.  We share her desire to assist it through its present difficulties.  Of course, it is a matter for Bord Fáilte and the ministerial responsibility of the Minister for Transport and Power. Fóir Teoranta is an organisation which by statute is limited to giving assistance in the industrial sector and on that account, while one can sympathise with the objective of the remarks of Senator Ahern, tourism, unfortunately, does not qualify for assistance from Fóir Teoranta.</P>
      <P>In relation to some of the points made by Senator Halligan, the IDA, ICC and Fóir Teoranta work very closely together.  Indeed, the team which operates Fóir Teoranta is a team which is seconded by the ICC to do the work of Fóir Teoranta and there is a continual link-up of information and skills between the two organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 of the Fóir Teoranta Act, 1972, provides specifically that there will be an annual report to the Minister for Finance who, in turn, must make the report available to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The first financial year ended on 31st March last and the report is in the course of preparation and will be made available shortly.  I think people will find this a very interesting document.  It will show a pattern of disturbance and difficulty arising out of free trade and other conditions&mdash;these difficulties will be overcome because of the availability of this money.  It must be some cause of anxiety to us that it became necessary to establish a State money-giving institution as a last resort to provide such money to tide the industry over passing difficulties.  I suppose it is because the private sectors handling money were not prepared to take the risk.  Although we are, in this Bill, writing off some losses, the losses are not commensurate <Col N="123" /> in any way with the benefits which have flowed from this operation.  We are hopeful that there will be a continuing improvement on the return in future years.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the loans have been advanced on the basis of providing a moratorium for a number of years against the payment of interest and repayment of capital.  This is done to ensure that firms will be given liquidity to get them over their short-term difficulties. If immediate repayment of principal and interest were demanded, the very benefit conferred would be neutralised.  Therefore, it will be some time before the money given will flow back to Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>The point was made by Senator McCartin that Fóir Teoranta could not help any firm which had received IDA assistance.  I do not think there is any foundation for that belief and if he has any information to the contrary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not.  Many of the concerns now receiving help were brought into being long before the IDA was established, so it could not have any foundation.  Fóir Teoranta are not concerned with the origins of any organisation.  What they are concerned about is the possibility of industrial firms continuing in existence if they are given financial assistance to get over some temporary difficulty.  If that can be established and there is an industry with reasonable prospects of success, giving reasonable employment, then the assistance will be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the greatest difficulties is one to which Senator Halligan referred, and that is the inadequacy of notice <Col N="124" /> given by firms when they are in difficulties. I think one of the great deciencies in our State services is that we do not have any particular Ministry responsible for identifying areas of potential industrial difficulty.  It is everybody's responsibility, so it is no-body's responsibility.  I should hope that measures will be taken to identify likely pockets of difficulty so that assistance can be given well in advance of crisis situations.</P>
    <P>My own ministerial experience is that quite frequently I am approached by industrialists in difficulty, or by public representatives who have not the least idea where to go for help. They know that their situation is so difficult that they have no prospect of getting money from the bank.  Again and again it is found that the door is about to be closed on the following Friday, the pay-packets for that week are in jeopardy for the workers and no preparation has been made by way of accounts or providing information which could be of assistance to Fóir Teoranta.  Fóir Teoranta have provided something in the nature of a fire brigade or ambulance relief service.  I think they have cut through the red tape rather successfully.  They have had very considerable demands made upon them in the last year.  I hope that the information services which they are developing will make the assistance which they can give better known to the people throughout the country and will help to ensure that longer notice will be given in future by firms which are getting into difficulty.</P>
    <P>Quite often it is the lack of management skills which gets the firm into difficulty and this very lack of skills and information leads them not to call upon services which are available to them.  We all have a responsibility to ensure that more is known about Fóir Teoranta so that many of the closures which are pending can be avoided.</P>
    <P>Senator McCartin and Senator Harte mentioned retraining both for management and for workers.  These, of course, come under the responsibility of IMI and AnCO.  Fóir Teoranta again and again called upon the <Col N="125" /> services of these organisations to provide training necessary for firms which are in difficulties.  As I mentioned earlier, difficulties often arise out of lack of information and lack of liaison between firms which are in difficulties and Government agencies which can help them.  Rectifying this is part and parcel of Fóir Teoranta's work.  I think they have been doing it successfully, so that is why I trust the House will approve of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill increases the statutory limits on Exchequer participation in Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta, it provides that the company may borrow in foreign currencies and that the Minister for Finance may guarantee such borrowings and it provides for a larger board of directors for the company. The opportunity is also being availed of to make administrative changes desirable as a consequence of the integration of the food project with the other activities of CSET and to introduce some minor amendments to the existing legislation which will give the company more flexibility in relation to its managerial structure and to the submission of its annual accounts to the Minister for Finance.  A provision relating to directors and staff of the company who may become Members of either House of the Oireachtas is also included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CSET has begun work on a major programme of modernisation of sugar plant which is estimated to cost in the region of £7 million over the next four years.  Primarily because of the heavy demands in recent years on available capital to support the food processing project the renewal of plant and equipment in the sugar factories has been unduly delayed.  Some of this plant and equipment is now obsolete and its replacement is an urgent priority.  The programme of modernisation will bring about an improvement in conditions and create a more satisfactory working environment at all four factories. The greater part of the investment will be at Carlow and Mallow where existing handling and processing facilities are insufficient to cater <Col N="127" /> adequately for the quantities of beet which they receive.  The expectation is that within the EEC the production of Irish beet sugar can be maintained at a level of 170,000 to 190,000 tons.  The present EEC arrangements, which remain in effect until July, 1975, provide that this country may produce 150,000 tons of beet sugar for which the full EEC support price will be guaranteed and a supplementary quota of 52,000 tons.  Last year CSET processed 154,000 tons of sugar from 83,000 acres of beet.  The yield was disappointingly low because of the abnormally poor weather.  The company has contracted for 76,000 acres of beet in the current season and, given average weather conditions, this should yield approximately 170,000 tons of sugar. CSET is confident that its growers will continue to favour the beet crop despite the attractions of other farming pursuits within the EEC.</P>
    <P>The existing statutory provisions relating to borrowing by CSET have been interpreted as empowering the company to borrow in Irish currency only and it is now essential that the company be empowered to borrow in foreign currencies.  The company has recently completed negotiations with the European Investment Bank for a loan of £2.8 million to finance in part its factory modernisation programme. This in fact is the first loan of the European Investment Bank in the new member countries of the EEC.  Further suitable opportunities for foreign borrowing by CSET are likely to arise from time to time.  Provision is made in section 4 of the Bill to empower the company to borrow by means of debenture in foreign currencies.  Borrowing by the company otherwise than by debenture is not governed by legislation. As a consequence of the company's intention to borrow abroad, it is necessary to extend the existing guarantee powers of the Minister for Finance.  For instance, the European Investment Bank, to which I have already referred, requires a ministerial guarantee as a condition of making a loan to the company.  Sections 2 and 7 of the Bill extend the Minister's powers of guarantee; section 2 relates to debenture <Col N="128" /> borrowing by the company and section 7 relates to borrowing otherwise than by debenture.</P>
    <P>At present CSET is required to submit its annual accounts, duly audited, to the Minister for Finance within 90 days after the end of each accounting year.  For many years the company has been unable to comply with this requirement because its activities are too diverse to allow for proper completion of audit within the period specified.  It is usually up to six months after the end of the accounting year before the accounts are ready for submission to the Minister and it is proposed, therefore, in section 3 of the Bill to extend the time limit to six months.  The section also removes a requirement in the 1933 Act that all changes in the format of the CSET accounts shall be prescribed by the Minister for Finance in statutory regulations.  This requirement is unnecessary and in fact the Minister has not at any stage issued such regulations.</P>
    <P>The existing legislation provides that the board of CSET shall consist of seven members.  It is now proposed to provide for a maximum of ten members and the necessary provision is included in section 4 of this Bill.  The extension of the board to ten members is desirable because of the wide variety of operations for which they are responsible, particularly now that the food processing project has been fully integrated with the other activities of CSET.  In addition to the changes relating to the number of board members and to foreign borrowing, to which I have just referred, the section removes the requirement that the company must have a managing director. This requirement is too restrictive and in fact the company has not had a managing director for some years. Qualifications regarding the financial interest of the Minister for Finance in the company and the duty chargeable on sugar are also being removed as these are no longer relevant.</P>
    <P>CSET will require assistance from the Exchequer towards the financing of its sugar factory programme and, as the company's average level of borrowing is already considerably <Col N="129" /> higher than its equity, the company has made clear its preference for share capital.  Shares to the existing authorised statutory limit, of £5 million have already been issued&mdash;£4½ million to the Minister for Finance and £½ million of preference shares to private sector interests.  Section 5 of the Bill proposes an increase in the existing authorised share capital to £10 million.  It is intended that the existing £1 million Exchequer loan to the company will be converted to shares, bringing the issued share capital to £6 million, and a provision for a further £4 million should on present indication be more than adequate for a period of at least four to five years ahead.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed&mdash;in section 8&mdash; to increase from £5 million to £10 million the statutory limit on advances and guarantees from the Minister for Finance to CSET.  The existing advance of £1 million is, as I have indicated, to be converted to share capital and all that is guaranteed at present by the Minister is a debenture loan of £900,000.  The Minister will be called upon to guarantee borrowings by the company from the European Investment Bank and possibly from other sources in future years and in order to cater adequately for this contingency, a new limit of £10 million on advances and guarantees from the Minister is proposed.</P>
    <P>In an effort to reduce the very serious losses on food processing this operation has been integrated with the other activities of CSET under the direct responsibility of the CSET board.  The advantages to be derived from this integration are an improvement in overall efficiency and the elimination of costs arising from the operation of two separate companies. Sections 9 and 10 of the Bill arise as a consequence of this change.  Section 9 enables CSET to take over the Erin Food's investments in associated companies as Erin Foods is now a dormant company.  Section 10 removes the obligation on Erin Foods&mdash;which is an approved subsidiary company of CSET within the meaning of the 1962 Act&mdash;to seek the approval of the <Col N="130" /> Minister for Finance for alterations in its memorandum and articles of association and to submit its accounts to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes certain provisions in section 11 as regards membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas by directors, officers and servants of CSET.  Provisions relating to Oireachtas membership have for some time past been included in legislation pertaining to State-sponsored bodies and it is considered that the opportunity afforded by the present Bill should be taken to extend them to CSET.</P>
    <P>The position of the food processing project is one of serious concern to the Government.  Since its establishment more than 12 years ago there has been a total investment of £25 million in the project and up to £10 million of this investment has been written off as irrecoverable.  The main causes of these losses have been overproduction in earlier years, and the continuing inability to achieve export prices sufficient to cover production costs and overheads.  The proliferation of small processing units has significantly inflated production costs.  Bulk sales to major food manufacturers, particularly in Britain, have accounted for a high proportion of exports and profit margins have been entirely inadequate because of very keen competition. There are no prospects of profitable operation in the bulk export market and in the past 12 months intensive efforts have been made to find new and profitable export markets.  In the financial year ended on 30th April last the food project had an operating loss of the order of £660,000 and there is unlikely to be a significant improvement in the current year.  This level of performance is unacceptable as it involves a degree of subsidisation from the other operations of the company which they cannot support in the longer term.  In addition deliveries of raw materials for processing have fallen short of requirements.  The company has had to import potatoes on a limited scale this year to meet essential requirements for the Tuam potato factory, when a large number of growers failed to honour contracts, and this <Col N="131" /> situation cannot be continued as a permanent arrangement.  In any event such a development would be contrary to the basic concept of the food project which was designed to assist the development of horticulture in this country.</P>
    <P>The board of CSET is committed to taking all steps necessary to reduce food losses short of any steps which might lead to redundancy of full-time employees.  The number of production units, however, which operate well below full capacity, adds very considerably to company costs and some rationalisation of these may be inescapable.  The board of the company has been asked to give special attention to this problem and the Government will be prepared to consider favourably any constructive proposals which they may submit to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>CSET is one of our major industries both in terms of output and employment.  In its latest financial year it has achieved an estimated turnover of £34 million, comprising £17½ million on sugar, £9½ million on processed foods and £7 million on associated agricultural activities. Average year-round employment by the company is almost 4,000 and in addition payments exceeding £10 million are made to more than 20,000 farmers.  The bulk of the employment given by the company is in provincial centres, in some of which alternative job opportunities are few.  Ireland's entry into the EEC presents a strong challenge for the company in that it no longer has a right to a monopoly position on the home market on production and sale of sugar while export opportunities for items such as agricultural machinery and food products should improve.  The company must be properly geared to meet this new challenge.  The present Bill is designed to aid improvements in company efficiency and to facilitate financing arrangements.  These steps are an essential part of the company's adjustment to the new EEC situation and I confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. At the same time, it is regrettable that the Sugar Company&mdash;an old established company&mdash;find it necessary to borrow money at this stage to replace plant.  I can assure the House that it is not the fault of the farmers that this has occurred.  It is not because of any great price that they have been given in the past for what they produced.</P>
      <P>In connection with the breakdown of the loan investment, I know that Carlow is getting £3.6 million; Mallow is getting almost £3 million; Thurles, in which I am interested, is getting only £.29 million, which is a little over £¼ million; Tuam is getting a little more&mdash;£.72 million.  The reason given by the Minister for such a small grant for Thurles is that the plant there is in much better condition than in any of the other factories.  I live near Thurles and I am inclined to doubt the advice given to him from the Sugar Company with regard to the situation in the Thurles factory.  The plant in Thurles is as old as those in Mallow and Tuam.  If the company intend to work the four sugar factories, the same type of equipment is needed in each.</P>
      <P>It has been said that the beet acreage will not drop.  The Sugar Company and others have intimated that they are confident that the farmers will continue to grow beet.  I do not altogether agree with that.  In the case of the Thurles factory, last year we grew 21,000 acres of beet in the Thurles area.  That is just what is needed to run a factory efficiently and without loss.  This year the acreage in Thurles is down to 15,000, a reduction of 6,000 acres in one factory alone. That 15,000 acres for the Thurles factory includes beet from Kerry and Waterford, which formerly went to Mallow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The beet which at present comes from Kerry to Thurles passes by rail through Mallow on its way to Thurles. Therefore, unless something is done about the Thurles and the Tuam factories, they will go.  If Thurles closes it will be said by the Sugar Company that it was not their fault it closed but because <Col N="133" /> the farmers will not grow the beet.  It is very hard to expect farmers to take the same price today for a commodity which they received almost five years ago.  The increase which we beet growers have received in the last five years is 47p.  I understand that we will get an extra 7p this year as a result of an increase in EEC prices.  The cost of the production of beet has risen by 50 per cent, so in effect the farmer today is getting less for his beet than what he got five years ago.  The only other section of the community that did not get an increase during that time is the Members of this House although I noticed that when this Bill was being discussed in the other House, some Member thought Senators were receiving £1,860.  If one compares the price of beet with the price of other farm products during that time, the price of milk has gone up by 100 per cent and of cattle by 100 per cent.  It is very difficult to expect farmers to continue growing beet at a loss, if they can make money easier in some other way.  We, in County Tipperary, were a milk-producing county but were growing beet down through the years until this year, when there was a decline of almost 3,000 acres.  Wexford was a tillage county until now and this year the beet acreage there has declined by 3,000 acres.  This means that in Wexford the farmers must be finding another way of making money apart from the growing of beet.</P>
    <P>I have heard members of the Sugar Company say that there is no danger that the Thurles factory will close, and I am sure that the Minister will agree. However, I have grave doubts.  If the acreage of beet declines any further in the Thurles area, Thurles and Tuam will be out as regards beet-growing. The only other factory in Thurles is Erin Foods where are packaged all the foods manufactured in the other plants, but a number of those plants will close down, resulting in disemployment in the Erin Foods factory in Thurles also.</P>
    <P>It would be disastrous for us if we were to lose that factory in County Tipperary.  It has been in operation since 1933.  It is giving good employment; both the workers and farmers benefit from it.  Some effort will have <Col N="134" /> to be made to keep it open.  I believe the only way we can do that is to increase the price of beet.</P>
    <P>Under EEC conditions this country may produce 150,000 tons at the full EEC price and then we can have a supplementary quota of 52,000 tons. The Sugar Company say we will be able to produce 170,000 to 190,000 tons, but it is not going to happen. Our production last year was 154,000 tons from 83,000 acres.  Admittedly, last year was a bad one for beet due to weather conditions, but this year, the overall drop is 9,000 acres leaving us with 76,000 acres.  It appears from that we will not come up with the quota allowed by the EEC.</P>
    <P>Tuam, I understand, is down almost 100 per cent in beet growing this year, and were it not for what beet is grown east of the Shannon, the factory in Tuam would not be needed at all.  The beet which is grown east of the Shannon in Offaly and Laois could be very easily diverted.  I am sure what the Sugar Company has in mind is to divert that beet to Carlow.</P>
    <P>There has been a slight increase in acreage in Carlow and Mallow.  I feel one of the reasons for the increase in Carlow is that beet has been diverted from Thurles.  Part of the beet grown in Laois and South Kilkenny has been diverted to Carlow and I cannot understand why.  As far as the increase in Mallow is concerned, I imagine it is because people have given up growing vegetables and had to get beet contracts instead.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the farmers will grow beet if they get a proper price for it.  I know it will be said that we are tied to the EEC price and we cannot give higher than that.  When we were not tied to the EEC prices we did not give it either.  There must be some way of getting around this EEC price.  I understand that in the EEC countries&mdash;none of the factories are State-sponsored; they are owned by co-ops. or privately&mdash;they have different ways and different prices. Some of them give the beet pulp free to the farmer which means quite an increase in his price.  I feel that the Sugar Company will have to find some <Col N="135" /> way of giving the increase to the farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister might ask: Have you not got an organisation which looks after beet prices for you?  We have. That organisation has been doing a very good job through the years, but it is a difficult job every year to get the Sugar Company to give you a fair price for your beet.  We were never satisfied with the price we got, but we had no option but to take it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his speech that the annual accounts of the Sugar Company should be in his Department within 90 days but that it usually takes six months.  I imagine the very same applies to the fixing of the price for beet because the growers always maintain that the price of beet should be fixed on 1st September each year for the following year, and we are never able to get an answer from the Sugar Company until about 1st February of the year in which the beet is sown.  By that time farmers have their minds made up what kind of crop they will grow, and they might not grow beet at all that year.  We feel this is a decision which should be made well in advance.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company have lost quite a lot of money in the past few years.  I believe it is due to the formation of Erin Foods and the growing of vegetables. I am not against the growing of vegetables, but I feel that the two companies should have been kept separate and the profits made from sugar should not have been ploughed back into vegetables.  That is one of the reasons why the beet grower lost money.  The Sugar Company were not able to pay the price because they had to subsidise Erin Foods.</P>
    <P>The potato plant in Tuam was mentioned and the fact that farmers did not honour their contracts last year.  I feel very strongly about this matter.  A contract should be honoured.  It was very hard to blame the farmers in the Tuam area last year when they got such a high price on the open market. In a case of that kind there should be a percentage increase if the price goes up and if the price decreases on the open market it should work the other way.  There should be a percentage one <Col N="136" /> way or the other.  That would help the Sugar Company to get the extra potatoes. I do not know what was paid for the potatoes in England or wherever they got them, but I am sure that by the time they got them here they were nearly as dear as the Irish potato.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company have other enterprises. In Thurles they have a pig fattening unit which was never a success. I do not know why, because there are co-ops starting from scratch, having to collect money from farmers, and making a success of pig fattening units. Thurles has never got off the ground. We must give credit where credit is due: they have made a success of Gowla Bog in Galway and they have two very successful lime works in Mallow and near Thurles.  Their greatest achievement is their engineering section in Carlow where they manufacture the &ldquo;Armer&rdquo; harvester.  This harvester is known all over the world. At the moment they have got a very big order for harvesters in Spain.  That is something I am very proud of.  I hope that the engineering section of the company will go further afield than even the harvesters.  If a success can be made of one machine there must be numerous other machines that can also be made a success of.</P>
    <P>A computer was installed a few years ago to expedite the making up of accounts.  I am sorry to say that instead of expediting it it slowed down matters.  Farmers now complain that after sending their beet to the factory it takes a month before they hear what the beet weighed <i>et cetera.</i>  This is most unfair to the farmer who should know within seven or eight days what his beet weighed and what the sugar content was.</P>
    <P>The number of directors on a board does not mean very much to me.  A small board can do more work than a large one.  A board with the three right men could be much more successful than a board with ten members. It has been stated that different sections of the community, such as farming, trade unions and others should be represented on a board and that certain areas should be represented, that the area west of the Shannon should be represented by three or four.  I do not entirely agree with this. <Col N="137" /> It does not matter where the man comes from or to what organisation he belongs.  If he has made a success of other industries or of his own business he is the type who should be director of the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>It was stated in the other House that Members of the Dáil could not be directors of the board but there was nothing wrong with Members of this House being appointed directors if the Minister considered there was a suitable candidate.  I agree with that. We are not elected in the same way as the Members of the Dáil.  We are known as a vocational body and there are nominating bodies to the Seanad. If there is a Member of this House capable of being a director of the Sugar Company his membership of the Seanad should not prevent this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHalligan" hpid="Mr. Halligan Mr. Halligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Halligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret that because of the exigencies of the time situation we cannot speak for as long as we might wish on this important Bill.  As a former employee of the company I have some personal interest and some knowledge.  Many of Senator Ryan's arguments were all too familiar to me as a former member of the planning department, particularly the rivalry between various areas regarding beet acreage and suspicion that a factory was on the point of being closed down.  It is an inescapable fact that the price of our sugar beet is a matter for the EEC.  Nothing will alter substantially the return the farmer will get.  That is part of the benefit of being members of the EEC. The House should recognise too that the sugar beet industry is one which will come under great pressure in Brussels because of the responsibility that the Community as a whole has towards the Third World.  In fact one would find one particular commissioner looking askance at any development of the sugar beet industry in any part of the Community.  We will have to fight a tough corner for the enlargement and modernisation of our sugar industry, as is evident from the money which will be expended on the programme and the loan we have recently obtained from EIB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before hurling all the criticism we <Col N="138" /> can at the Sugar Company, we should recognise that it trail-blazed to the extent that it undertook the developmenal role that the former Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, wished to see various State bodies take on themselves and which so few of them did.  The imagination and energy of the former general manager was responsible for the development of the company in so many fields.  Senator Ryan mentioned machinery, Gowla bog, fertilisers and lime.  All of these were areas in which he pioneered and the most important development of all was food.  It was a far-sighted and courageous decision, one which has faulted in the meantime and which is of great concern to the Government and the trade unions, the farmers and the various business interests in the towns where the plants are situated. Initial marketing mistakes were made, particularly in regard to the UK market.  Mistakes were made in the early sixties, through failure on the part of the then Minister for Finance to set out proper comprehensive criteria whereby one could evaluate the role of the semi-State body.  The criterion for success was confined simply to the balance sheet.  If one made a profit one was doing well; if one made a loss one was doing badly.  There was no attempt to develop a criterion that would look upon the total impact of the company within the community.  This was a matter of great concern to the company at the time and I personally was involved in an internal company attempt to develop criteria, for instance, that we should take into account the farmer's income in relation to vegetable growing; that one should take into account the new employment in the various areas and the impact of that employment in areas where no other industries existed and therefore the demographic payoffs in terms of stabilisation of the population.  In many areas it would be impossible to sustain even small factories, because the rural population had been run down below the point of re-generation.</P>
    <P>There is the question of import substitution to which I referred briefly <Col N="139" /> on the Fóir Teoranta Bill.  There was an attempt to evaluate the multiplier effect.  It was interesting that at that time the Economic and Social Research Institute had done work on an aspect of the Irish economy showing that the processed food industry would be the biggest pay-off in terms of national investment.  This should all have been done by the previous administration.  The restraints which were imposed on the company at the beginning should not have been put there.  The company could not sell on the home market more than a certain proportion of its output on the grounds that it was competing with private enterprise.  Often the same private enterprise was an Irish subsidiary of a foreign company.  So we were protecting the home market for a foreign interest against ourselves.</P>
    <P>If there was ever a case for an Oireachtas Committee for the examination of the roles, functions and results of semi-State bodies, here was a case in point.  We are now in the situation that in the food industry there has been over-investment, leading to over-capacity.  The Minister states the Government is correctly trying to get out of the situation where all the steps necessary to reduce food losses have to be taken, short of any steps which might lead to redundancy in full-time employment.  This is a very tricky operation.  We are in a situation of over-investment, over-capacity and at the same time without a proper brand image in the foreign market through a management decision of some time past which in retrospect is open to a new evaluation.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan correctly hit the point that perhaps the way out of the problems of over-capacity in the food sector would be to give the company a clear-cut developmental mandate; to say to it: &ldquo;Yes, go ahead and develop in different areas in which you have the expertise.&rdquo;  Senator Ryan mentioned&mdash;I endorse what he said&mdash;the machinery enterprise in Carlow.  One could also suggest that the food side of the enterprise might deal in foods other than vegetables.  For example, the Errigal Co-Op, which was formerly a very sick child of the whole <Col N="140" /> group, is now a profitable enterprise in fish processing.  There is no need for any of us to deny the fact that a very serious financial situation exists in terms of the food operation and of the resulting serious drag on the whole sugar operation.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the beginning of my speech that there is a problem with sugar quotas within the Community.  It is essential that in the renegotiations we establish two things: first, the need for sugar quotas to be established by the Community.  I know that some countries within the Community do not wish sugar quotas to be established. Secondly, that we get a sufficient sugar quota for the farmers.  The future financial viability of the company, the support of the food subsidiary and also for regional considerations, particularly in regard to the Tuam factory, a substantial increase on our existing quota of 150,000 tons is essential.</P>
    <P>As I understand the situation, national consumption is 240,000 tons. One might say that this should be the target for a 32-county market.  Reason would suggest that we are not likely to get that quota in the very tough bargaining arena of Brussels.  We could, with justification, expect what the Minister has indicated, a figure between 170,000 and 190,000 tons.  That figure would give us a solid basis for the continued development of the company, but we should not leave out of consideration the considerable difficulties which face us in Brussels.  Some of the discussion in respect of the EIB loan is a case in point and a danger to us all.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about Tuam.  That is a valid concern.  I always had the impression that Tuam was the cinderella of the operation.  One must take into account the fact that the area did not generate sufficient beet from within itself.  Senator Ryan correctly referred to the sugar beet east of the Shannon which had to be taken west in order to keep the plant up to the requisite capacity.  Last year we had the situation of the shortfall in the potato crop through the breaking of contracts.</P>
    <P>We must look at the problem not <Col N="141" /> only as a company one but one of development within the community. Perhaps greater community involvement in the company might be a way out.  For example, in terms of the potato contract, there might be co-operative growing between the company and growers within the context of a national potato market because the absence of such is the basic problem. A more determined effort to get greater numbers of beet growers in the west should be made.  General Costello, in particular, was very much to the fore in attempting that effort at a certain stage.  Perhaps the time has now come to revive such an effort.</P>
    <P>Lastly, may I repeat the plea that this company, which has shown more management expertise than the rest of the semi-State sector, a commendable initiative and commercial expertise, should be given a clear developmental mandate.  It should be allowed to develop in other areas, particularly in the engineering and chemical fields. I was associated with such an abortive attempt to develop in the chemical field in the early 1960s which, had it succeeded then, would have been of great benefit for our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out the danger signals which are there for us all in respect of the food operation and of the consequences existing in terms of the overall financial structure of the company.  The danger signals exist and therefore it behoves all of us, farmers, trade unionists, and commercial interests where the factories are situated, to come together and attempt to chart out a more secure future for this company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to take this opportunity to welcome the Minister to the Seanad and to wish him well in his new post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reluctantly, I cannot welcome this Bill to the House because it is a shame that such a company as the Irish Sugar Company, which had for many years with a complete monopoly in its own industry and complete protection, should be the first public company seeking legislation to allow them to borrow money in order to become a viable unit.  As I say, I do not welcome this Bill; however, its provisions <Col N="142" /> may represent an investment for the future and give us an opportunity of examining the workings of the Sugar Company.  The Minister has a very onerous task in asking the Sugar Company to get down to business.  I have always been and probably will be classed as an agitator against the Sugar Company.</P>
    <P>There are three reasons why, I think, the Sugar Company are seeking this legislation.  The first one is its bad management.  There has been bad management by the Sugar Company. I contradict Senator Halligan on that point.  Secondly, while the diversification programme of the Sugar Company was achieved in a small way, the diversification section did not have enough foresight to allow it to become a viable unit.  Thirdly, over the years, the Sugar Company, despite all the popular people on its management board, always had a very weak liaison between the farmers and themselves.</P>
    <P>It is sad to hear Senator W. Ryan from Tipperary make his case for the Thurles factory against a West of Ireland venture in Tuam.  Obviously, the writing is on the wall for both of those factories.  I am afraid it will be a sad state of affairs when either Tuam or Thurles will have to fight to see which of them will remain open.  But whichever remains open will be the next to go.</P>
    <P>This £7 million is being given to the two major factories, Mallow and Carlow. These two factories are surrounded by large hinterlands and could never be in trouble.  It is a completely different situation in the West of Ireland.  The Tuam factory was situated there as a social aid to the West.  It is now said it will be maintained on an economic basis. There can never be any justification for the maintenance of the Tuam Sugar Factory on an economic basis, particularly when one takes into account the development of the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I accept that there have been difficulties at Tuam.  Maybe the farmers were not up to the required standard or may not have been honest enough.  There is, however, a third cause.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> Some of the reasons why the Tuam Sugar Factory has been consistently in trouble must lie with the Sugar Company. I have been associated with the Sugar Company for many years.  I was for many years the secretary of the glucose association in Tuam and I knew the intimacies of the stop-go policies of the company with the farmers.  The result of it appeared last year when, for the first time in the history of agriculture here, the farmers found an alternative.  The farmers who were supplying to them from outside the West said: &ldquo;No, we have an alternative and we are going to accept it.&rdquo;  They told the Sugar Company what to do with their price of £12 per ton for potatoes which they had continued to give over the four or five previous years.  I asked the previous Minister and the Sugar Company if they were so naive as to think that £12 per ton was a just price to offer for potatoes with the rising costs in farming.</P>
    <P>I now ask the Minister and the Sugar Company if £7.10 per ton for beet is a realistic price in this day and age?  It is not and never will be.  Unless some positive action is taken now, none of the four factories can continue with that humiliation of a price for a commodity produced on a farm.</P>
    <P>I listened last Friday to the Minister when on his official visit there for the opening of another plant he said the State were putting close to £1 million into Tuam.  He forgot to tell them that it would be spread over seven years, four years or three years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not say that. When I went home that night and made up my calculations I found that if we took account of the depreciation of the Tuam plant over the last five years, there would not be very much difference in the sum invested over the last four years and the amount invested over the next four years.  My figures may be a little out, but there will not be £100,000 between us.  That is not a lot of money when we are talking about a plant that is maintaining a work force in the town in which I live.  I can say <Col N="144" /> without hesitation that town survives on that plant.</P>
      <P>I have already said there was not a lot of foresight.  We talked about machinery and the achievements of the machinery section in Carlow.  Three years ago, when discussing the Appropriations Bill in this House, I suggested to the then Minister for Finance that there should be an extension of the agricultural machinery section to the Tuam factory.  I felt they had the manpower, engineering staff and the qualified technical staff to move into the farm machinery business.  I was told that the chairman of the Sugar Company at that stage was also the chairman of the work study group set up by the Department to look into the importation of farm machinery.  At that stage, the figure for this was £10 million; God knows what it is today.  I raised the matter the following year and again last year, but all I got was a deaf ear to the situation.  The new Minister may not turn a deaf ear to this situation and the Sugar Company may lend a hand in the development of other articles of farm machinery. They could have gone into this field, particularly in Tuam, where the sales force and technical staff were available. It could have been a very viable and sound industry for the town.</P>
      <P>The farmers in the West of Ireland have now other alternatives.  While those other alternatives are far more lucrative than growing beet, the skilled workers in the plant in Tuam must be taken into account.  Unless the Minister can give us an assurance today, they must have worries about being declared redundant in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much work could be undertaken by the Sugar Company themselves.  They made a start, but they did not go far enough.  Senator Halligan raised the point that they had not got a mandate to diversify.  In this field of farm machinery they have had that mandate to diversify over the last four, five or six years.  I cannot pinpoint the particular time but if the Minister refers to his files he will find that the Chairman of the Sugar Company also chaired a national work study committee on farm machinery.  If that was not a mandate for them to move, then I do not <Col N="145" /> know what a mandate is.  I would urge the Minister to ask the Sugar Company to get down to business and to see what can be done in the lucrative field of farm machinery.</P>
    <P>One could attack the management of the Sugar Company.  About this time last year there was great worry among the committed young men in Erin Foods.  Word was received that Erin Foods would be thrown into the back-yard of the Sugar Company and amalgamated with it This has now happened.  To be fair, it was not the suggestion of the present Minister but his predecessor, Deputy Colley, who agreed to the amalgamation of Erin Foods and the Sugar Company.  I do not think this was a very wise decision. I have not been given any proof that the management, board and staff of the Sugar Company will be able to handle the affairs of Erin Foods better than the fine young men who were handling it at that stage.  I know a lot of people who were in Erin Foods at that time who bolted from St. Stephen's Green House and were never seen since.  These were young committed men.  We are back again to the old &ldquo;sugar daddies&rdquo; in St. Stephen's Green House pumping out their usual stuff.  The result is the Bill before us today.  As I said at the start, this reflects back management at the top of the Sugar Company which has brought them to the situation in which they have to go to Europe to beg for a few bob for survival.</P>
    <P>I have questioned this on numerous occasions.  I remember last December one instance of where the old &ldquo;sugar daddies&rdquo; discovered that there were two commodities on sale in this country, namely Fry-Cadbury's &ldquo;Smash&rdquo; and Knorr &ldquo;Instant Potato&rdquo;.  These came on the market here.  The old &ldquo;sugar daddies&rdquo; got upset and wrote a long letter to the Minister for Finance, who sent it to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, who sent it to An Bord Dumpála.  I questioned in this House what would be done regarding the protection of the Erin &ldquo;Supermash&rdquo; on sale here.  I was informed that An Bord Dumpála were looking into the matter.  The Department of Finance had passed the buck to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries <Col N="146" /> and it rested between this Department and An Bord Dumpála.  I have never heard what happened to the document which was sent to An Bord Dumpála.  I have never seen the reply that was sent back from An Bord Dumpála.  I do not think any reply was sent back.</P>
    <P>In any event, in my home town. Tuam, Knorr &ldquo;Instant Potato&rdquo;, Fry-Cadbury's &ldquo;Smash&rdquo; and Erin &ldquo;Supermash&rdquo; are on sale on the one shelf in the one supermarket.  I think it is a public disgrace that something was not done to stop the vultures from outside coming to this country and completely annihilating our processed food industry, and they will because their prices are lower.  In case the Minister for Finance does not already know it, the price of the other two commodities is cheaper on the Irish market than is Erin &ldquo;Supermash&rdquo;. It is something that at this late stage should be looked into.  We must face this matter squarely and have a close look at the whole situation.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that, if it were the other staff of Erin Foods who were handling that situation, instead of the &ldquo;sugar daddies&rdquo; of the Sugar Company who now seem to hold the reins, they would have done something; but the lads in the top stories of the building in St. Stephen's Green House seem to have forgotten that Fry-Cadbury and Knorr are selling more instant potato mash than Erin are and I think that is a disgrace.  One should have a good look around and see who is honest.</P>
    <P>Lastly, the Minister pointed out that it does not matter whether the board of the Sugar Company have three, ten or 23 members.  He said it does not matter if we in the West of Ireland have only three members on the board.  I wish that were true.  I would be satisfied at this stage to say that I would hope the Minister for Finance when he is appointing three extra men&mdash;I do not know if he is appointing the ten or the three extra&mdash;will see to it that the West of Ireland is represented on the Sugar Company board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> We had a fine man, and a non-political man, who is dead and gone now, God rest him.  That was Tom Naughton, who was new on the board of Erin Foods and who had progressed to the board of the Sugar Company when a tragic accident took his life. I do not think he can be replaced on the Sugar Company board.  I would hope that the Minister would have a good look around the West of Ireland. Whether the man he chooses is political or non-political is immaterial to me provided he knows what the West of Ireland wants from the Sugar Company and that he fights his cause on the board to get what the West of Ireland wants.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister seriously to think&mdash;he can put whomever he likes in the nine other seats, it makes no difference to me&mdash;and give us one honest non-political or political person so long as he is a man who knows what the people of the West of Ireland want from the Sugar Company and knows how to fight their cause.  I not alone ask but plead to give it very special consideration.  What I have said may not sound very realistic to a lot of people but I have read the Dáil Reports on this Bill and have not seen a lot of enthusiasm from western people about it.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company could be a great organisation if some of the deadwood that are there now could be extricated from it.  It could be replaced with some of the fine young men who work with Erin Foods, who staked their claim with Erin Foods and who, in my opinion, were sold down the drain.  There were a lot of fine young men who were committed, particularly those who worked with us in the West of Ireland, to the betterment of the workers in the plants, the farmers who supplied, and the company itself.</P>

      <P>I am just winding up. I could, in a passionate kind of way, <Col N="148" /> keep talking all night about the Sugar Company and the West of Ireland and the company's commitment.  They have a lot to offer.  They were always a success.  There is just one final point which I want to make.  We have heard that Erin Foods are a unit of the Sugar Company that have lost a lot of money.  Could somebody tell the people in the West of Ireland if the potato plant in Tuam, as a section of Erin Foods, has lost a lot of money? That is a good question, because, with all the millions that have been given to Mallow and Carlow, I think there is an odd rude clod down there causing great worry to the people in Erin Foods who are compelled to produce their figures on all commodities produced by Erin Foods.  I should like to know from the Department of Finance who are the bosses in that place, if the figures for the Tuam Potato Factory, both in production and sales, have shown a loss over the last four or five years.  I do not think they have.  I am awaiting that reply and I hope the Minister might dig it up for me and let me know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments on this Bill will be very brief and I think I can finish within the time.  Senator Killilea speaks with deep pessimism of his home town, Tuam.  He sees no great hope in this Bill for providing any great development for Tuam itself. I know he is concerned.  He has made many criticisms of the previous Minister for Finance, his Fianna Fáil colleague, Deputy Colley, for decisions concerning Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teo.</P>
      <P>I want to make a point which I hope I can develop on another occasion when we come to discuss developments in the European Community.</P>
      <P>There is mention in this Bill of a loan from the European Investment Bank.  I think a number of the difficulties mentioned here today could be met if we were clear on a few simple points.  When a loan is sought from the European Investment Bank it has either a social criteria or a marketing criteria.  This is very important. Senator Killilea mentioned that the factory is important for social reasons in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> The negotiating of a loan from the European Investment Bank is a matter for congratulations to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann&mdash;someone has already congratulated them in this regard&mdash; for having been so quickly off the mark.  It is, however, a matter of very grave concern that we have negotiated a loan before we have formulated an adequate regional policy which would specify investment criteria in an area such as the West of Ireland.  It does not make sense to the people of Carlow who have received £3.7 million, the people of Mallow who have received £2.8 million, the people of Tuam who have received £0.72 million or the people of Thurles who have received £0.29 million, that they are entering into competition with each other in a slagging match in the public Press. What is important is that we know what we are about.  What we are about is the marketing criteria.  A company has negotiated a loan.  This is no replacement for social planning and we have to be clear about the assumptions upon which such economic thinking is based.  They are market economy assumptions.  Let us all be clear on that point.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was discussed in the Dáil Deputy Hussey pointed out that representation of the West of Ireland people on the board might enable better control.  This, to my mind, is an insufficient opinion.  In a body such as Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta, it is important that all the people involved in any stage of production or processing be also involved in decision-making.  It would be a more fruitful contribution if somebody spoke about the necessity, for example, of developing industrial democracy within this company.  It is an ideal company within which to develop it.</P>
    <P>Senator Killilea was generous in apportioning blame.  He blamed the farmers of the area and said some blame accrued also to other people and then was critical of the management of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta.  When we are discussing this Bill we are just looking at the tip of the iceberg.  We are talking <Col N="150" /> of a company that have plants in different parts of this country and that have sought, in order to make themselves more efficient and to modernise themselves as a commercial enterprise, a particular kind of loan.  That loan has no regional component as far as I can see.  I should be glad if the Minister could give us an assurance that in future negotiations with the European Investment Bank the regional component of such loans&mdash; where the economic and social criteria commence and stop&mdash;would be taken into account.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to draw attention to one of the problems of the Tuam plant.  One of the finest examinations of West of Ireland agriculture has been that carried out by Dr. John Scully.  That report was published&mdash;one of the most interesting sentences in it is the first one&mdash;without commitment by the Minister for Agriculture of the day.  It was one of those true discussion documents we have had in the history of the State from civil servants. It was published without commitment.</P>
    <P>The last sentence is probably the second most important one.  Dr. Scully pointed out that the problems of western agriculture could not be considered without viewing agriculture as a competent part of regional policy in general, that is, that industrial development, agricultural development, the useful services sector had to be considered together.  Certainly, it is welcome if a company takes a good decision to modernise itself but it is a matter of concern&mdash;and some confusion&mdash;that we are not clear as to whether the loan was used as something to gear up the company or whether it was used for social purposes. These are all matters which we can discuss at greater length when we come to discuss developments in the European Communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most grateful to Senators for their contributions and for their co-operation. The difficulty we find ourselves in is that one of the conditions for taking up the loan, which is not £7.5 million but only £2.8 million, is that there may be a penalty clause attaching to it if it is not taken up by <Col N="151" /> 27th of this month.  The Bill is substantially the same as a Bill which the previous administration had intended to introduce.  It is one which anticipates the future commercial success of the Sugar Company.</P>
      <P>Senator Higgins and others wanted to know what is the test of the European Investment Bank investment of £2.8 million.  It is proper to say that they require that any project be a viable project so that that in itself is a recognition by the European Investment Bank that the Sugar Company is a successful enterprise and one with great potential.  It is as much a vote of confidence in Tuam and Thurles as in Mallow and Carlow.</P>
      <P>On the question of the distribution of the investment, the Sugar Company have the responsibility of deciding where the money is to be invested, not the Government of the day, be it the last Administration or this one.  The Thurles factory has by far the most efficient equipment of the four.  It has had the greatest amount of investment over the years and that is why at this stage it is not necessary to put money into it.  So far as the Tuam plant is concerned, it is at present more than capable of processing everything that is offered to it.  We have had deputations of workers from other areas complaining that sugar beet and other produce are being taken from their areas across the Shannon to Tuam resulting in workers in those areas being placed on short time.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to fault anybody for not producing because they find the price unattractive.  What we have to do is to find markets and we cannot find markets unless we put our produce on the market at a price which the market is prepared to pay.  I would ask everybody to put that priority above party or local politics.  It is a fact of life from which we cannot escape.  I believe the board are now making a genuine effort to meet the hope we all have that Ireland, which is in a special position to produce the best food in the world, will avail of the opportunity which is now open to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would welcome the co-operation of <Col N="152" /> the House&mdash;I know I am asking a great deal&mdash;to give me all Stages of this Bill now in order that we can avoid the penalty clause which might otherwise be applicable and which would work to the disadvantage of Thurles, Mallow and Carlow.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Redundancy Contributions (Variation of Rates) Order, 1973.</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on 13th June, 1973.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion seeks approval of a draft order to provide for increases in the rates of weekly redundancy contributions.  The authority to make this order is contained in section 28 of the Redundancy Payments Act.</P>
      <P>The main reason for these increases is the increased number of redundancies in the year 1972 which has meant that the fund has been depleted. There is thus the necessity for putting the fund into a buoyant condition again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major change envisaged in this order compared to past practices is that we seek the increases in respect of men and women&mdash;that is the contribution that the employer would be <Col N="153" /> expected to pay in respect of men and women employees.  We are now looking for these increases solely from the employer.  In other words, we are not seeking to increase the rate of contribution to the insurance stamp from either male or female worker under the heading of redundancy: we are seeking the total increase from the employer.</P>
    <P>We are taking this decision to change from past practice because, in my opinion, the person who suffers mainly from rationalisation of work procedures and any resulting redundancy is the employee.  Speaking in a general sense, redundancy or any changes in work procedures are usually a result of management decisions&mdash;taken, perhaps, for the greater good of the firm in question.  The main casualty of such planning measures at the level of the firm is the worker, who very often in many cases is forced to search for fresh avenues of employment for many weeks and months.  I believe it would be unfair to burden the worker with any extra contributions necessary to keep the fund in good condition or to impose any extra levies on him.  This is to provide him with sufficient financial help at a time of economic adversity when he is out of work.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that the practice in Britain is that workers make no contribution to the redundancy fund.  Admittedly, the difference between here and Britain is that their payments are solely in lump sum form, whereas we here have a weekly and lump sum form.</P>
    <P>The only departure from past practice is that we are seeking to put the redundancy fund in a position where it is in a more healthy financial state &mdash;if one can say that of a redundancy fund&mdash;and we look for the extra cash needed solely from the employer. Maybe there are certain employers who would object to this and say that it is putting an extra burden on the employer, but it is in the direction of the practice of EEC countries, where the employer must pay a much larger social cost per employee, and it is the practice in this country for employers.  We therefore think we <Col N="154" /> are in the mainstream of European developments in this area by taking this step to seek all the increases from the employer and to leave the employee's contribution, male and female, as it was.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>We are prepared to agree to this order.  The only comment I would make is that although we accept the reasons set out by the Minister for imposing the full charge on the employer&mdash;we can see the arguments he put forward are good&mdash;it is perhaps a mistake to look on it from the point of view of stressing the placing of the burden on the employer. Of course the burden will not be on the employer: it will be on the general consumer.  Obviously employers will pass on costs of this kind to the public at large.  We should be quite clear that it is a sum that will disappear in some mysterious way out of the personal pockets of the employers of Ireland: it will in fact be paid by the people of Ireland. However, in the circumstances it is a reasonable step and we are prepared to agree to it.</P>

      <P>First of all I should like to say how pleased I am to be back in the House where I started my political career in a somewhat different capacity.  Secondly, I should like to apologise to the House for the fact that I was unable to be present here several weeks ago when the European Communities (Regulations) Bill was being discussed.  I was sorry to have missed that debate, which was a very constructive one. I hope in my concluding remarks to refer to some points raised there and to the attitude of the Government on the points raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> Senators are aware of the provision in section 5 of the European Communities Act under which the Government are obliged to report twice yearly to each House of the Oireachtas on developments in the Communities. This is the first such report.  The last time that an opportunity was given for Ireland's interest in the activities of the Communities to be considered in this House in a comprehensive manner&mdash;apart from the debate on the passage of the European Communities Act&mdash;was on the occasion of the debate on the White Paper on Accession to the Communities.  This covered developments in the Communities up to the time of signature of the Treaty of Accession on 22nd January, 1972.</P>
    <P>It was thought well in this first report to cover developments in the Communities from then up to 15th May of this year, which was the most recent possible date.  The first report is for this reason longer than subsequent reports may be expected to be in that it covers a period of about 16 months; subsequent reports will cover developments during a period of about six months only.</P>
    <P>The first chapter of the report describes the developments connected with the enlargement of the Communities. These include: (i) the decision taken by an overwhelming majority of the electorate to amend our Constitution in order to allow the State to undertake the obligations necessitated by membership of the Communities, (ii) the resolution passed in Dáil Éireann on 26th October, 1972, approving the treaties governing the European Communities; (iii) the European Communities Act, 1972, which enables Ireland to fulfil its Community obligations; and (iv) the subsequent lodgment in Rome and Paris of the appropriate instruments of ratification.</P>
    <P>Chapter two concerns the major event in the Communities last year which was the meeting of Heads of State or Government in Paris on 19th and 20th October.  Therein the outcome of the Summit Conference is briefly <Col N="156" /> described; briefly, because the reverberations of what was decided at this conference make themselves felt throughout the report and the effect of what was decided on activity in relation to, for instance, regional policy, social policy and economic monetary union becomes clear in subsequent chapters. Thus the report as a whole points up far-reaching implications of the final decision of the Summit to set as the objective of the Communities the transformation by the end of the decade of the whole complex of relations between member states into a European Union.</P>
    <P>Chapter three, on the institutions of the Communities, discusses a number of Summit proposals concerning their roles in relation to each other and improvement of the decision-making procedures.  These are of very great importance in the light of the need for the Communities to come more directly into the public arena where they can be seen to represent as well as to take account of democratic processes. The Government are fully conscious of the contribution that we can and should make in this field.</P>
    <P>The chapter on the external relations of the Communities makes clear that, by membership, we have become involved in a network of relations which, in effect, covers the globe.  The Community is the world's most important single trading entity and its interests accordingly are world-wide.  Under the Common Commercial Policy member states no longer conclude bilateral trade agreements but the Commission negotiates with third countries on the basis of mandates agreed at the level of the Nine.  This aspect of the Community activities will be highlighted at the forthcoming multilateral trade negotiations in the context of the GATT where the Community, along with the United States and Japan as the three pillars of the world trading system, will have a major role to play.</P>
    <P>In this context also we are involved with Community efforts to still further liberalise its relations with developing countries by, for instance, improving the system of preferential access to its markets for exports of manufactures from these countries and by increasing <Col N="157" /> the volume of official development assistance to them.  In this latter regard we shall shortly accede to the 1971 Food Aid Convention.</P>
    <P>The developments in the area of Customs Policy are, as might be expected, of a rather technical nature, involving, for example, our phasing in to the Common Customs Tariff of the Community.  One aspect of Community activity in this area, however, will have come to the notice of most travellers within the Community.  This was the increase in the scales of duty-free goods allowable in intra-Community travel.  This concession is designed to make more real to the citizens of the member states the progress being achieved in the creation of one internal market; in such a market, of course, as within a single state; no duties would be payable and there would not be any customs hindrance on internal movement of goods.</P>
    <P>The Community's policy on free movement of persons, services and capital is designed to achieve the same freedom in these matters.  Besides the agreements already made on the free movement of workers, which we shall apply from 1978, there are the complex provisions on right of establishment and recognition of diplomas. This is an extremely difficult area, especially in regard to the professions, and along with the other member states our purpose is to ensure that in realising the aims of the Treaty of Rome no essential interest of any profession is damaged.  Action and proposals in regard to the movement of capital are dealt with in some detail at chapter 14&mdash;page 66 and 67.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy is the most important single area of present Community activity as far as this country is concerned.  The two main aspects of Community policy in regard to agriculture are, on the one hand, the single Community market with common prices for agricultural produce and, on the other, structural improvement of agriculture.  The Common Market is designed, by means of the common pricing policy, to raise the standard of living of those who earn their living from agriculture to a level comparable to that of those <Col N="158" /> in other employment.  The structural reform policy is designed to mitigate the adverse effects of the lowering of the agricultural population which is now a feature of all developed countries. The measures adopted in pursuit of the latter policy during the past year are very significant and programmes are at present being drawn up for their implementation in this country.</P>
    <P>In regard to Competition Policy the Commission has always been active in ensuring that conditions of competition within the Community are not such as to distort trade between the member states.  Chapter eight draws attention to an important interpretation of the Treaty by the European Court of Justice during the past year. The Court ruled that a take-over by a dominant firm in the Community could constitute an abuse of the Treaty provisions concerning competition. The chapter also refers to the current examinations of state aids in the three new member states.  The results of these examinations are not yet known.</P>
    <P>The Community Industrial Policy affects a number of areas of Community activity and is designed to develop Community industry by, for instance, encouraging co-operation between firms through the so-called &ldquo;Marriage Bureau&rdquo; recently set up. Under this funds are made available to foster links between enterprises, especially small and medium-sized firms.</P>
    <P>Moves towards the approximation of company law are described in chapter ten.  The adoption of a European Community Statute is another proposal in this area.  It envisages the creation of companies under a law common to the member states and worker participation in the management of the company is also envisaged in the draft statute.</P>
    <P>The elimination of technical obstacles to trade resulting from disparities between the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the member states and the approximation of their legislation are dealt with in chapter 11.  Because of the many detailed and technical regulations now <Col N="159" /> in being, the reality of the Common Market is brought home to many sectors of the economy.  In this chapter also is described the effect of the adoption of the Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgements in Civil and Commercial matters to which, subject to any agreed adjustments, we are obliged to accede in due course.  This is a step towards the creation of a common area of law for civil and commercial proceedings, in that the judgments in such proceedings in the Courts of each member state would be recognised and enforced by the other member states.</P>
    <P>The problems of the preservation and improvement of the environment now exercise all developed states.  These problems pre-eminently involve international co-operation as pollution and nuisances do not respect national boundaries.  Accordingly, the Commission has made proposals for action at a Community level and the Council has decided to finance research projects in this area.</P>
    <P>The activity at Community level in the field of science and technology has been mainly confined to the area covered by the EURATOM Treaty, which includes environmental research. However, the Community has taken certain initiatives in co-operation with third countries in science and technology and up to 19 European countries are now participating in a series of projects initiated under the general title of European Co-operation in Science and Technology.</P>
    <P>The implications, described in chapter 14, of the creation of an economic and monetary union&mdash;the intention to establish which by the end of 1980 was re-affirmed by the Paris Summit&mdash;are of the most far-reaching kind.  Its establishment is indeed closely bound up with the achievement of the European Union which the heads of state or Government set as an objective by the end of this decade.  The recent disturbances of the international monetary system have been seen as a further incentive to achieve an economic and monetary union in the Community and the detailed <Col N="160" /> decisions which have been taken on fiscal regulations, narrowing of margins, monetary co-operation, etc., are all designed to fulfil this aim.</P>
    <P>Closely tied up, in our view, with the steps towards achievement of an economic and monetary union is the progress made towards the adoption of a Community regional policy.  Without a regional policy it is to be feared that the resources of the member states would continue to concentrate themselves in the areas of greatest immediate return, to the detriment both of these areas, which would increasingly suffer from overcrowding and pollution of the environment, and of the underdeveloped areas of the Community, which would continue to decline and lose population.  It was thus, with the interests of the Community as a whole as well as our own immediate interest in mind, that the Irish delegation at the Summit pressed for a decisive commitment on the development of a Community regional policy.  The Commission has now laid before the Council the guidelines for such a policy.</P>
    <P>The commitment to a Community Social Policy also derives from the Summit and from the need which became evident before the Summit to give the Community a more human face.  The Community already of course had the European Social Fund for the retraining and resettlement of workers, to which we have made application for sums in the region of £3½ million in respect of various projects. The Summit, however, has given a major new impetus in this area as a whole and the Commission has laid before the Council its guidelines for the proposed new Social Action Programme designed to form the basis for a Community Social Policy by means of action aimed at full and better employment, improvement of living and working conditions and participation of the social partners in economic and social decisions.</P>
    <P>In the field of transport policy activity hitherto has been concerned with transport by rail, road and inland waterway.  The Commission has now, however, made proposals for Community action in regard to air <Col N="161" /> transport and has been considering sea transport in a preliminary way. One of the most controversial proposals in the existing area is that of weights and dimensions of lorries&mdash; the so-called &ldquo;Juggernauts&rdquo;.  We take the line here that transport economies and road costs must be taken into account in arriving at a solution.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Commission has also been active in the field of energy policy which has recently been giving rise to concern in all developed countries. The Community has already decided to take measures to guard against a short-term oil supply emergency.</P>
    <P>Senators will have seen in the report how wide-ranging are the activities of the Communities, only some of which I have tried to highlight in my remarks.  However, as I mentioned at the beginning, the present report is exceptional.  It is so not alone because it covers 16 months of Community activity but also because this period emcompasses two major landmarks in the history of the Community&mdash;the Summit and the enlargement of the Community from six to nine members.  Such major developments are not frequent occurrences and I think I can assure Senators that the second report for this year, while recording further progress in the evolution of the Communities, will not be as replete with major new departures as is the present one.</P>
    <P>All that I have said so far is concerned with the First Report on Developments in the European Communities. I think, however, if the Leas-Chathaoirleach has no objection, it would be right for me to touch on a subject which is legitimately of great interest to this House and on which my colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, said I would speak, if the opportunity arose, in the debate we are about to have: that is the question of the involvement of the Oireachtas in regard to European Communities legislation and in regard to regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>
    <P>I am authorised by the Government to say that it is their intention to introduce an expediency motion in this <Col N="162" /> House and in the Dáil to the effect that a Joint Parliamentary Committee be appointed consisting of those members of the Dáil and Seanad who are designated delegates to the Assembly of the European Communities together with ten other members, seven of whom shall be drawn from the Dáil and three from the Seanad.  This Joint Committee, in the opinion of the Government, should have the function of examining, firstly, such proposals for regulations, directives, decision and recommendations of the European Communities and their institutions and, secondly, such Acts of the European Communities and their institutions as it may select and, thirdly, of examining regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972; and to report thereon to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It should also have&mdash;and the Government consider this most important&mdash;the authority in the case of future regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972, by a majority decision, to put down a motion in either the Seanad or the Dáil to annul any such regulation&mdash;the annulment to be by both Houses.</P>
    <P>In coming to their decision that such a power should be available to the Joint Committee the Government were highly conscious of the need to ensure that the Joint Committee has a clear-cut watch-dog role not merely in regard to proposed Community legislation but also in regard to regulations made by Ministers under section 3 of the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>
    <P>This gives the Joint Committee power to intervene at three different stages in regard to legislation emanating from our membership of the European Communities.  At the first stage the Committee is entitled to examine such proposals for regulations, directives etc. as it may choose and to report its views to the Oireachtas. These views would necessarily be taken into account by the Government in making up their own mind on what policy they should pursue.  It must be understood, of course, that the Government are not bound to follow the Committee's views.  The Government remain responsible for their own decisions&mdash;and these can ultimately be <Col N="163" /> challenged either in the Oireachtas as a whole or by the public in periodical exercise of the franchise.  Nevertheless, the opportunity thus given to a Joint Committee of both Houses to influence Government thinking and have an effect upon it is an important departure from normal practice and one which, I think, will be welcomed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>At a second stage, when the Communities have made a directive, the Joint Committee may again report to the Oireachtas its views on how the directive should be implemented.  This is a function which is no less important that the previous one as it enables the expertise of the Oireachtas, expressed through its Joint Committee, to be brought to bear on the formation of regulations designed to put into effect non-self-enacting Community legislation.</P>
    <P>It could be at times that the lapse of time between the creation of a directive and its implementation by a regulation under the European Communities Act, 1972, would be so short as to make a full examination by the Joint Committee inpracticable. This would happen only in rare cases but, even in such cases, there remains the third stage&mdash;that of examining the regulation itself.  In this respect I should say that, in the examination of a regulation or, indeed, in the examination of any matter brought within the purview of the Joint Committee, it is the intention that the appropriae Minisers will make themselves available to the Committee, at mutually convenient times, for a discussion of the subject concerned.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, it is the intention of the Government that the Joint Committee, if it should not be satisfied with a regulation made following its coming into being, should have the authority, by majority decision, to put down a motion for the annulment of any such regulation.</P>
    <P>The precise way to arrange for such authority is at present being studied but we consider, following our preliminary examination, that it will best be done by bringing in an amendment to section 4 of the European Communities Act, 1972.  Such an <Col N="164" /> amendment will probably take the form of removing the existing requirement to confirm regulations made under section 3 of that Act and substituting instead the authority for the Joint Committee to put down a motion of annulment, as I have just described.</P>
    <P>In effect the Government's view is that it is more in keeping with the dignity and authority of the Oireachtas that the confirmation procedure should disappear and be replaced with a far more important provision to allow for the annulment of regulations instead.  In approaching the matter in this way I feel that the Government have gone all the way that it is possible to go in satisfying the legitimate demand in both Houses for a proper involvement of the Oireachtas in European Community matters.  We are consciously responding to this demand by the Oireachtas and, in doing so, we hope that we are putting to rest any idea that the Oireachtas is merely a rubber stamp for decisions already taken elsewhere and for their consequences.</P>
    <P>May I add a comment at that point? I would be concerned that, in giving these additional powers to the Oireachtas, this should not so satisfy the concern of legislators in this country for the democratic control of Community decisions that the pressure for increased power by the European Parliament over such decisions should be in any way reduced.  I emphasised that because in the past I personally have had some hesitation about going so far in the Oireachtas in giving powers here that people might feel that that has in some way resolved the problem and that we need not press on with securing adequate democratic control within the Community structure itself.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am authorised by the Minister for Finance to inform the House that proposals by the Joint Committee for secretarial assistance will be sympathetically considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister brought into his last sentence the matter which I was about to mention.  That is the importance of the administrative back-up for any such Joint Committee.  It goes without <Col N="165" /> saying that we, on this side of the House, welcome entirely the whole idea of having a Joint Committee.  In particular I welcome the idea of having the annulment procedure introduced. If this is to work it can only do so with a very substantial administrative back-up.  This is all-important. There is no point in talking about shadows here in a matter as important as this.  It cannot work unless there is a completely organised Secretariat and a completely organised administrative back-up.  I welcome the principles adumbrated by the Minister in regard to the Joint Committee and in regard to the annulment procedure.  I do not think what he envisages will work unless there is a complete administrative back-up.  To go into that caveat which the Minister mentioned in his last sentence, I hope in whatever discussions he has with the Minister for Finance on these urgent matters that this will be borne in mind.  Otherwise, it could result in total chaos and failure.  There is no point in talking about matters of this kind unless we are serious.</P>
      <P>I agree with the view that nothing we do at this level should in any way hinder the objective which we have to give greater powers to the European Parliament, our declared objective in this respect, in order to ensure that the European Parliament itself has greater control than heretofore. The European Parliament at present has tended to be a talking shop.  We must get down to the reality of giving the European Parliament itself the teeth envisaged by the Minister in regard to our own Parliament here.  It is envisaged that by 1975 the European Parliament will have budgetary functions.  All we can do to hasten that development, which is basic in regard to any Parliament, must be expedited.  If we do not get down to the basics of ensuring that the European Parliament will have budgetary functions as soon as possible&mdash;and January, 1975, has been mentioned&mdash;the European Parliament will become a chimera.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall debate on this matter centres on the report which must be presented, and rightly so, every six <Col N="166" /> months in regard to developments within the Communities.  Ireland's interests should be paramount so far as we are concerned.  I should like to spell out here, loudly and clearly, what these interests are.  It is important we should strip this debate of verbiage and involvement in matters which may not be real and concentrate on the matters which are real so far as the people on this island are concerned.</P>
    <P>Number one is the common agricultural policy.  It should be emphasised, to a far greater degree than has been done, that the common agricultural policy as it pertains to Ireland is in effect a regional policy <i>vis-a-vis</i> rural rehabilitation.  So far as circumstances of Ireland are concerned, with about 20 per cent of our people depending on agriculture for their income, with the highest percentage of any member country involved in agriculture, for us the common agricultural policy is basic.  I am glad to see that the Minister has adopted this attitude within the Community and at the Council of Ministers meeting.  This attitude is fundamental.</P>
    <P>There is considerable pressure from many sources to dilute the common agricultural policy.  We know well the British attitude towards a cheap food policy, which has been traditional over 130 years since the abolition of the Corn Laws.  We realise now the pressures coming from the United States of America to work towards the dilution of the common agricultural policy. Our attitude stands with the French attitude.  France, like Ireland, has the next highest percentage of people dependent on the land.  The caveat I should like to mention here is that we should not allow our stance in this direction to hinder or impede our investigation, from Ireland's point of view, of alternative methods of working out a high income, and a guarantee situation for our farming community.  I want to emphasise here that, if there is any change in the common agricultural policy, if over a period we engaged in strong action to retain it in its present form, or if we are faced with a situation where <Col N="167" /> it must change or be amended, we are fully aware of the alternatives to the common agricultural policy as it exists at present.  We must be very careful in this direction not to abandon our legitimate claim that the common agricultural policy in its present form represents the best guarantees we have.  This is our diplomatic stance.</P>
    <P>It is arguable that there are other income-related alternatives as far as medium and small-sized farmers are concerned.  If there is any change in that direction we must ensure that we have all the alternatives worked out so that the same amount of financial in-take to the farming community will continue or be enhanced on the same percentage basis as it is at present under the CAP as it is organised at present.  There are pressures towards a deficiency payments system and income-related systems.  I would suspect very much the areas from which these pressures come.  I know they come from areas, Britain and the United States of America, which want to dilute the common agricultural policy.  If by any chance these pressures look like succeeding we should have a series of options open to us which would give us an advantage equal to that given us by the present CAP policy.</P>
    <P>This is very important.  It is a very logical planning area for the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Finance, and the other Departments. We must be in the position that, if there is any amendment or change in the common agricultural policy, we will benefit as well as we do at the moment, or indeed even better.  This sort of investigation in depth as to the various options open to us in the event of the dilution of the present common agricultural policy should be engaged in a very detailed fashion by Government Departments here at home.  This matter, particularly under American pressure in the current year, could become a very pertinent factor in the whole debate concerning the CAP within the Community.</P>
    <P>I say this because we have a very real interest in ensuring that the <Col N="168" /> small and medium-sized farmers are enabled to derive an income which assures them of a similar standard of livelihood as people in other income-earning capacities in this country&mdash;a right which has been denied them over the years.  We have a particular interest in this aspect.  It needs to be emphasised that, as far as Ireland is concerned, the CAP or whatever varied version of the CAP is adopted, is a regional policy <i>vis-a-vis</i> our people living in rural Ireland.  To that extent, we have a very positive interest in ensuring that the CAP, or a version of it, result in the same income benefits as far as the small or medium-sized farmer is concerned and that this is maintained or enhanced.</P>
    <P>The reason I mention this point is because one of the criticisms which is made of the CAP as at present organised is that it benefits very large farmers as well as small and medium-sized farmers.  This is to some extent a criticism which carries some weight. But, as far as Ireland is concerned, it carries very little weight because of the limited number of large farmers. Whereas this particular criticism may have validity in regard to the under 3 per cent of farmers in Great Britain or the small percentage of large farmers in some other member countries who derive a tremendous income by reason of a CAP, it has very little validity as far as our medium and small-sized farmers are concerned.  If there is any shift in the common agricultural policy our emphasis must be to ensure that it will be income-related to our medium and small-sized farmers and that if anything else is devised, our farmers below a certain level will benefit to a greater degree than they benefit under the existing common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise this matter because I felt, when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs, that this aspect was not stressed sufficiently. If we get the figure of $600,000 or £200,000, which is the sort of money being talked about in the budget preparations going on within the Commission at the present time, allocated to the Regional Development Fund over the Community as a whole, and <Col N="169" /> if it is parcelled out in the most advantageous manner possible, we would of course benefit from that because we satisfy all the criteria which go to mark a region qualifying for aid of this kind.  Allowing for all that, however, the amount of money which could be allocated to us in the year starting 1st January, 1974, would be still small enough related to the type of benefit that we are now deriving under the common agricultural policy or under any alternative to the common agricultural policy.  We should look at this matter as a totality in the common agricultural policy, regional development policy and in the social policy.  Policies of the Community are all entwined as far as we are concerned.  We will be seeking a very high proportion of money from the Regional Development Fund, but it should not blind us to the fact that the basic matter from our point of view is the common agricultural policy or, if there is any alternative or change in that, a common agricultural policy which will primarily develop and help the small and medium-sized farmers.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Regional Development Fund and the progress that has been made towards preparing a budget and projects to gather up whatever budget is prepared, I had a discussion yesterday with Commissioner Thompson in Brussels on this matter and there was one aspect that he emphasised &mdash;and I am certain that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is also fully <i>au fait</i> with this respect&mdash;and that is the importance to a country like Ireland, which satisfies all the desiderata in regard to aid out of whatever fund is available, to have specific projects ready on the table by 1st October which is their deadline in regard to announcement of what budget will be available and what percentage of budget will be available to each member country.  From the practical point of view we all appreciate that, for a small country that will be entitled to a percentage over the odds by reason of satisfying the criteria, it is tremendously important that we should be in there with specific projects properly researched, properly prepared, <Col N="170" /> properly costed and that they should be on the table before the Commission on 1st October or within the immediate days after that date.  I am certain the Government are doing this, but I wish to emphasise it because it is all-important and essential.  There is no point in going to the Commission with half-baked proposals or proposals couched in terms of generalisation or anything of that kind.  What we want are specific projects related to specific areas that will qualify.</P>
    <P>A further matter I should like to mention in this context is that the whole island&mdash;I will not talk about part of the island which jurisdictionally is not within our control at the moment&mdash;will be regarded as a peripheral area for development.  We satisfy all the criteria in that respect but&mdash;and here is the gloss I want to put on this situation&mdash;within that definition it is recognised in Brussels that part of this island, the north-west, the west, the south-west, deserves particular attention and treatment.  While we can retain the status of an underdeveloped area for the whole island, or a peripheral area which is the phrase now being used, we can, in addition to that, get extra and special treatment for the areas that within that definition are still more underdeveloped than the overall underdeveloped region.  I have been again assured by Commissioner Thompson and the Commission itself is fully aware of this particular nuance in our situation&mdash;that whereas Dublin, the east and south of Ireland are developed areas and qualify under the overall peripheral definition, in addition to that the underdeveloped areas to the west, south-west and north-west qualify for whatever special development projects we can present to the Commission. What this amounts to is that, on the basis of whatever amount of money is allocated to us on the 1st October, 80 per cent of that will be available for spending by the national governments concerned.  We will get priority within that expenditure for projects situated in the underdeveloped parts of the overall underdeveloped areas so that the projects that we submit in the areas I have mentioned will receive much greater attention and be expedited to <Col N="171" /> a far greater degree than projects in the developed part of what may be called the underdeveloped area as a whole.</P>
    <P>I also wish to emphasise that this should be looked at in a total manner by the Government and I am informed that the Commission will do so; also in this respect that there are particular projects which were submitted by the last Government, and I presume they are being followed up by the present Government, such as a main highway to the west of Ireland from Dublin to Galway, with the highway offshoots from that.  This would be a very immediate way of attracting industry into the western undeveloped area because distribution and transport are all important in regard to industrial establishment.  Industry will follow a highway.  It is as simple and straightforward as that.  In our time as Government we did have proposals which envisaged the European Investment Bank giving loan finance to projects such as I have just mentioned and we had processed that to some degree.  I presume the present Government is following this on.  Here again there is ideal scope for a link-up with the regional development policy, under which the Regional Development Fund will make available grant assistance up to a certain percentage towards infrastructural works of that kind.  There should immediately be a liaison adopted between the Government here, the Regional Development Fund and the European Investment Bank to ensure that not alone will the grant assistance be made available but the finance assistance as well.</P>
    <P>One of the areas in which the Regional Development Fund can be helpful is in subsidising interest rates from the European Investment Bank. Instead of people working off at tangents or in different areas there can be immediate liaison between the European Investment Bank, the regional development people in Brussels and the Government here.  Here again there is a field for co-operation.  I mention that because I feel the Government here, in order to get the most immediate and practical benefits out <Col N="172" /> of the Regional Development Fund, must between now and the 1st October &mdash;and that is only a matter of a few months&mdash;have the lines cleared with the loan agency which is the European Investment Bank and with the grant agency which is the European Development Fund and ensure that, whatever projects are being processed, there is total agreement and that the lines are cleared between now and 1st October so as to enable us to move in very fast.  As I have mentioned 80 per cent of the grants that will be available will be made available to the home Government here provided the national government have adopted criteria in regard to their projects and that they are in accord with the criteria which are now being prepared by the regional development office within the Commission and which are well known to the Government.</P>
    <P>Putting the matter very clearly and bluntly, the criteria will be the criteria of overall contribution by whatever finance is made available towards a positive rehabilitation in the economic and social sense of the particular area of the region that is being helped. It is not going to be a &ldquo;pork barrel&rdquo; operation.  It is not going to be a question of just giving money on the say-so of the Government.  It is important for the Government to have their homework done in regard to each particular project presented by the Government to indicate that there are very positive economic and social reasons why a particular project or projects should be developed in regard to a particular region.  It must be proved that particular region will benefit in a positive way by such induction of finance.  It is not just going to be a question of giving the 80 per cent to a national government just because the national government says it wants it.  It is not going to be a political handout or a handout generated by some particular pressure group that does not stand up on examination.  It will be a grant given towards a positive programme, a project that has a positive attitude and will be in accordance with the regional rehabilitation and development of an area as envisaged in the policy of the Community.  The other <Col N="173" /> 20 per cent will be directed to Community involvement in what they think, on the advice of member countries, would be appropriate development of a particular area.</P>
    <P>It is important that we be with this.  The major criticism that I have heard in Brussels in regard to other funds that have been operated, such as the FOEGA Fund under the agricultural policy and the Social Fund, has been a weakness on our part here in regard to presenting detailed, documented, properly researched projects to the Commission.  I am told that some other countries are ahead of us in this respect and that now we have a chance under a new fund for which we are particularly qualified to benefit to a greater degree than any other country in the Community, and in this instance we must really be &ldquo;good on the job&rdquo;.  The point of view I am expressing now in regard to the Regional Development Fund is one that is equally applicable to the presentation of cases under the Agricultural Guidance Fund and also under the Social Fund.  I do not know what staff or administrative adjustments is required to ensure that this whole area of our dealings with the EEC is improved and expedited, but whatever is necessary in this area I am mentioning should be given top priority.  I am certain that I will not find the Minister lacking in agreement on this particular aspect that I am just mentioning, but it is all-important and, so far as the EEC means something to us from the economic and financial point of view, this is the area in which we should be totally concerned and totally operative. I might say that it behoves a small country to be more efficient in this area than larger countries.  This is one aspect in which we should be up and doing.</P>
    <P>We will be designated a peripheral area so that overall we will be regarded as coming under the definition of being eligible for help from the regional fund.  I have said that whenever such help comes it will be weighted towards the underdeveloped areas of our region.  I think the importance of being designated a peripheral area as a whole lies in the tax remission <Col N="174" /> on exports which the IDA utilise as a very attractive inducement to industries to come to Ireland.  I am sure that the Minister is very much aware of the importance of maintaining this inducement situation in the months and years ahead because in the negotiations we secured a situation whereby we are allowed to carry this particular inducement into the EEC.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that there is a tug-of-war within the Commission between different departmental areas and that there is an overall aspiration towards the elimination of any elements in a member state's policy that distort competition in any way and that the department of competition within the commission looks ashamed at our particular tax-free inducements and profits from exports, which we alone have within the EEC in that sense, and it was a considerable achievement on the part of Dr. Hillery as our negotiator to ensure that we carried this situation through.</P>
    <P>But, having carried it through, it is very important that we maintain it. I would argue again, looking at the totality of Community policy, that as far as Ireland is concerned and with the agreement now that we are an underdeveloped country as a whole, we can make a very strong case that the 100 per cent tax remission is an essential ingredient in attracting industry to Ireland by reason of the definition which the Community have adopted.  Therefore, if we can carry that very single measure which is on our Statute Book right through whenever discussions and negotiations take place with the other member states and the Commission, I feel we will have done a major job.  We have won the first round in ensuring that we retain that by reason of the definition of the country as a whole as coming within the underdeveloped category. That means that we have a very strong case to maintain and retain the tax remission provision which is across the board throughout the State, even though it may be running contrary to the provisions and the regulations which have been adopted under the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>This is a very fundamental matter. <Col N="175" /> On the very criteria adopted by the Community in defining us as overall an underdeveloped region, and by reason of their own definition of us as a peripheral region in the island as a whole, I believe we are entitled to retain the tax remission incentive.</P>
    <P>There is no point in talking about regional policy or any new-fangled policy developments if we forget the basics of our situation.  I would say that the two basics of our situation from the economic point of view are, first of all, the Common Market agricultural policy or whatever variation of it is adopted that gives us equal if not greater yield, and, secondly, the 100 per cent tax remission on our exports which we now have for the whole of the State and which we want to retain. We should not allow any blandishments in any other direction towards regional policy or towards moneys from whatever source to ignore these two basic factors, one in the agricultural area and the other in the industrial area. The Community may talk about all sorts of aids and incentives towards an underdeveloped area or towards a regional area, but it is the aids and incentives that are there already under the 100 per cent tax remission legislation that will be most helpful to us.  Under those who headings we have a very large amount of what we would want in regard to aids and incentives towards agriculture and industry.  We want to get more, of course, from the Regional Development Fund but I would not be dissuaded from those two safety rocks of policy to which I am certain we will continue to adhere.</P>
    <P>There are other matters mentioned in the report.  I do not propose to go into them because I thought I would bring the matter down to the basics of Irish farm policy; <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Community, if I have any criticism to make of the Minister in regard to his statement on his Estimate and on his attitude generally I would make it on this level, that I do not believe in chasing shadows as against substance. I do not believe in having wide-ranging foreign policy for a small nation unless the policy or policies are totally geared <Col N="176" /> to Ireland's requirements.  First and foremost, we are a small nation and I do not believe in posturing or adopting postures.  I believe that foreign policy should be an expression of the practicalities and needs of the Irish nation and the touchstone in the criteria to be adopted at all stages must be just what I have stated.</P>
    <P>I have sought to make my contribution here a severely practical one. Engaging in foreign policy postures that are not related to realities in Ireland and the requirements of Ireland from the social and economic point of view are too expensive a luxury to indulge in.  We should be totally concerned in everything we do with what is needed and good for Ireland.  It is with that attitude of mind in view that one of my last executive actions before leaving office was to recommend to the Government&mdash;it was adopted by the Government&mdash;that we appoint an ambassador in Tokyo.  Our contacts in Japan from the trade point of view and from the point of view of industrial investment here in Ireland by Japanese coming into Ireland as a basis for operating in Europe show that this was a priority area for the appointment of an ambassador and that this should take precedence over whatever other notions we might have in regard to appointments in Moscow or Warsaw. While I agree in principle that we should extend our embassy strength I feel that we must set an order of priorities where first things come first. A small nation must devise its priorities. There is no point in a small nation having a global strategy in which we interest ourselves in everything and anything if we do not concentrate on priorities and put money where the priorities lie.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see that the present Minister is going ahead with the appointment of an ambassador in Tokyo and one in Luxembourg, which is basic to our needs <i>vis-a-vis</i> the European Parliament which we hope to see develop.  Anything we can do as a country to develop the European Parliament, to enhance parliamentary control and to ensure a stronger role for the European Parliament <Col N="177" /> is one with which, I am sure, all political parties in the Oireachtas will be in full accord.  In regard to embassies, the criteria attached to such developments should be what is good, what is needed and what the requirements of Ireland are.  As a small country it would be quite crazy to adopt any other yardstick.  I issue that as a cautionary admonition on foot of a very detailed reading of the Minister's Estimate speech on foreign affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to spend some time at the start of my speech in dealing with the question of Government regulations but the Minister has disarmed me and, indeed, to a considerable extent, delighted me by the section of his speech dealing with this matter.  I felt, and I suspect that other Senators felt, that the manner in which the 22 regulations in this year's EEC Regulations Bill were passed through both Houses was nothing short of deplorable.</P>
      <P>Listening to the Minister's speech, and rapidly reading through his script, I think the proposals made in it are, on the whole, admirable.  His proposal is that when the Community submit a directive which requires action by us in order to implement the directive in this country the Joint Committee should consider the matter prior to the making of the Government regulation. I am not quite clear what the Minister means when he says, in his speech:</P>
      <P>At Second Stage when the Community submits a directive the Joint Committee may again report to the Oireachtas its views on how the directive should be implemented.</P>
      <P>Taking that literally, it does not seem to be workable because I cannot imagine how a Committee can say how something should be implemented. I take it what is meant is that the Civil Service officials will provide a draft regulation and bring this before the Committee to be considered by them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What we have in mind is that a directive may leave a <Col N="178" /> certain leeway as to how things are done.  I feel it would be appropriate for the Committee, for example, if the matter were of grave importance, to propose that it should be done by statute rather than by order.  The Government may or may not accept that.  Secondly, as regards the normal procedure as to whether it should be done by order or by regulation, if the directive leaves, as it would normally do&mdash;that is the reason why it is a directive because it leaves some leeway for each country to do it in its own way&mdash;enough leeway for it to be worth the Committee's while to advise the Government as to which of the number of alternative approaches should be adopted, the Committee have the opportunity of doing so. Again, the Government might or might not accept the Committee's view but we feel that, unless there is such urgency where there is no time for the Committee to do this, they should have the opportunity of advising the Government on that matter. If the Government do not take its advice or do not like what is proposed, the Government can on the Third Stage put down a motion against the regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a feeling that this is not really the way in which a Committee would be in a position to work.  I would prefer&mdash;as a potential member of the Committee &mdash;if the Government would come along with a draft statute or a draft regulation and allow the Committee make its way through it and decide whether, in their view, it should be amended or not.  Taking some of the regulations that we passed last week, a number of them were highly technical in their form.  There were all kinds of proposals taken out of various pieces of legislation that had gone in past years in relation to, for example, the sale of eggs, giving powers to Department inspectors to go into premises, inspect them, withdraw licences on breach of conditions of the EEC or the Government, powers of bringing to court and fining.  I do not think the Committee is in a position to list these types of provisions which should be put in a directive. <Col N="179" /> If the Minister would like to try it the other way, by all means let him, but he will find that it will work much more smoothly and efficiently if a draft of some kind is brought before the Committee for their consideration. Certainly, the general principle that the matter will normally be considered by the Committee before the Government actually makes a regulation is ideal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Committee wish to do so.  We feel that the onus should be on the Committee to take the matter up with the Government. When they have been able to give advice to the Government and following the line the Government have taken with the Council of Ministers, when they see what emerges, if not satisfied that this reflects their views and wishes, they could then move later on to another regulation.  If, in fact, the directive meets broad requirements but leaves leeway for being implemented in a different way, then the Committee should have the opportunity to press a view.  However, I think the onus should be on the Committee to take the matter up with the Government.</P>

      <P>I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  I am not referring to what the Minister has described as the first duty of the Committee &mdash;I shall come to that later.  Going through the 300 or so assorted regulations, directives, and so on, that stem from the Community each year, that is the first thing.  I am dealing with the specific case where a directive has been made which requires some form of Irish legislation to bring it into force.  I am limiting myself to that.  I take it that in such a case the Government would make it clear to the Committee that some action of the Irish Government was required.  There will be some directives which possibly would not really need any action on the part of the Irish Government to bring them into force.  I do not think that the Committee are in the position to decide which is which.  The Committee need guidance.</P>

      <P>Ultimately, it is the Government which would decide the borderline cases.  The civil servants in the various Departments will ultimately have to decide in each case whether an Irish Government regulation is required. In that case, surely they ought to tell the Committee that a regulation is needed.  Then here is the question of how best the Committee can give their advice as to what kind of regulation will be put in.  The Government, through their various Departments, will need to see if in each specific case a regulation is needed.</P>
      <P>However, I am very happy with the general principle, that the Committee will be given the power to advise on these matters of regulations.  It is an enormous improvement on the situation we had with this recent Bill and indeed it is an improvement on the terms of reference that were originally drafted last January for this Committee.  It is a very satisfactory improvement and I am delighted to see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of this report, it gives us a chance throughout the year to have a general debate on events in the European Communities.  I will have a number of criticisms to make on the manner in which this report has been prepared and I should like to assure the Minister that I am not trying to make any political point. We are new in the EEC and are only just embarking on this great enterprise. We are all learning as we go along and I think it is very important that, this being the very first report that has come out, anyone who has anything to do with it should be willing to produce suggestions as to how the form and the wording of the report can be improved. To my mind, the whole way in which it has been put out could be greatly improved but I want to assure the Minister that I am not simply trying to make a political point.  It is important that we should start right, and as we go along in coming years we should gradually establish a pattern which, as far as possible, will enable us to <Col N="181" /> supervise in a democratic way the activities of the European Communities. In particular, it is vital that all Members of each House of the Oireachtas should, as far as possible, have a very accurate view as to precisely what is going on.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows far better than I that there is an immense range of activities in the EEC.  For example, I took up one single issue of the official journal, which happens to be dated 4th June, but it could be any date&mdash; these come through our doors week after week&mdash;which lists the various directives and opinions of all kinds going through the EEC for discussion in the European Parliament.  I find that there is a directive, for example, on the approximation of member states legislation on radio interference caused by fluorescent lighting tubes, which is a point of interest to those who make such things.</P>
    <P>There is a regulation for a common system for the import of hydrocarbon oils; there is an opinion on the proposal for a regulation on the carriage arrangement on ships, boats, hovercraft, and so on.  There is a regulation dealing with bonded goods and the amount of processing that can be done to them before they are made available for consumption.  There is a resolution for an agreement between the EEC and the Arab Republic of Egypt.  Other matters deal with road, rail and inland waterways; common rules for the normalisation of types of railway undertakings; a directive for agriculture and mountain areas and certain other types of poor farming areas.  That is of great interest to us and I shall be dealing with it later.  There are trade arrangements for agricultural products, matters dealing with inter-Community trade in cattle and pigs and the question of imports of raw sugar from African states and Madagascar.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that in one single issue of the official journal some of these matters are important, others are less important.  Everyone of them, in its own way, to a lesser or greater extent, is derogating from the democratic rights that we have as a Parliament. In other words, it is vital we should ensure that we manage to <Col N="182" /> exercise a continuing supervision and, in so far as it is possible, control of all this immense mass of material that is going through the EEC at any particular time.  For the most part these are rather unimportant matters, but some of them are important enough. When one considers the programme set before the EEC for the coming years, such as the entire question of economic and monetary union, regional policy, social policy, the picture before us is still of a very amorphous and unknown form of European union in 1980.  It is therefore vital that on all these matters we should try to establish a pattern, through both the Oireachtas and the European Parliament, of preserving the democratic rights of the Irish people, as far as possible.</P>
    <P>One important thing is that individual Members should be informed about what is going on and, of course, the Joint Committee which is now to be set up will be one of the most important elements in this.  One of the important duties clearly which the Committee must perform, almost before they do anything else, will be to consider very carefully what type of information should be provided, in particular what type of information should be available in the Library.  They should make recommendations about the indexing of this material and the number of staff which they think would be needed to look after it.  On matters of this kind they can perform a valuable service even before they do anything else.  I certainly hope that the Minister will do his utmost to see that, whatever the requirements of the Committee may be, they will be made available. The burden on the Committee will, of course, be very great and indeed the burden on the Government and the Civil Service in providing the various facilities that will be needed will also be great.</P>
    <P>With regard to each of the 300 or so legislative proposals that come out each year in the EEC the Committee would certainly need a note from the relevant Department about the general affect of the proposal, what Department is concerned with it, its effect on existing Irish law, if any, and a very general statement of the views of the <Col N="183" /> Government, which ultimately, will be reflected in the Government's attitude in the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Committee then, as the Minister has said in his speech, can work through all this material.  I am doubtful if it would be possible for the Committee to keep up, as the Minister knows.  Other countries in the EEC have attempted to keep an eye on this enormous mass of assorted legislation. It is easier for the continental countries than it is for us because they have a highly developed committee system. We will have one EEC Committee. They have 12, 15 or more committees dealing with a whole lot of different matters and these questions of EEC legislation are sent to whatever committee has competence in that particular subject.</P>
    <P>Even with a number of committees dealing with these matters, I think it has been found, on the whole quite impossible to keep any kind of real track of these matters.  Our single Committee, particularly since ten of its 20 members will be absent very frequently and not able to go to its meetings, will find it impossible, even with very adequate secretarial assistance to deal at all intensively with much of this material.  All they will be able to do is to sift through it, and the more important items that are clearly of great importance to this country can be dealt with in detail.  I am afraid it is inevitable that a very large proportion of the 300 or so directives and regulations that will come before them will simply have to go unreported.</P>
    <P>The report itself is, as I have mentioned, inadequate in certain respects.  I agree that this first report on development of the EEC was a difficult one to prepare.  There were a good many matters in arrears.  It covers a much longer period than the six months which will normally be involved and to a considerable extent a very good job has been done.  It covers a very wide range of material and, so far as it goes, it does so very competently.</P>
    <P>There are certain missing details. Perhaps of less importance is the criticism I would make that in many cases the directives listed are not listed <Col N="184" /> by their number, which is really vital for anyone who wants to trace it down. In many cases, the date of the directive is given, which at least would be of some help in finding it, but in other cases the directives are merely mentioned without any dates, which makes it impossible to track them down.  That is a relatively small matter and I certainly hope that in future any directives, regulations or matters of that kind will be given by their official numbers to enable them to be found.</P>
    <P>A more important point, which is reflected almost through the whole report, is that there is very little said about Government policy.  Mainly there are bald statements as to what has happened, what has been decided &mdash;I shall come to many of these matters later on&mdash;but there is very little in the way of a statement about what the Government think.  The Minister's speech just now on certain issues that were dealt with in the report brought out matters of Government attitudes, policies and opinions which could very conveniently have been put into the report, but were not.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament as dealt with in one section of the report, is clearly a matter of very great importance to us.  Year by year, as the volume of Community legislation grows ever greater and as the degree of economic social and regional union, &mdash;political union even ultimately&mdash;of the Community grows greater, it is clear that the powers and functions of the Oireachtas and the other Parliaments throughout the EEC will tend to be diluted.  When one, therefore, speaks of greater powers for the European Parliament this is not a suggestion that those greater powers should be such as would take over from us, it merely is that authority and functions that we are losing any way, which are still going abegging and disappearing into the bureaucratic morgue of the EEC, should end up in the hands of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Even now, to my mind, the European Parliament is a body of some considerable importance.  It clearly has a great many faults.  It clearly lacks to put it mildly, authority.  None the less, if one visualises the situation in the <Col N="185" /> EEC without the European Parliament, which would make it a complete bureaucratic wilderness without any element of democracy at all, one can understand the importance even of its present position.  The fact that, for practical purposes, every single item that comes from the Commission before being acted upon by the Council of Ministers must be discussed in the European Parliament in itself is of considerable importance.  Quite clearly, however, increased powers are needed.</P>
    <P>I am not very happy about Government policy on this matter.  In the report the only really solid statement of policy with regard to the European Parliament is at paragraph 3.12.  It says:</P>
    <P>In the view of the Government the introduction of elections to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage could constitute a worthwhile step in enhancing the democratic character of the Communities ...</P>
    <P>They are fairly ongoing with regard to that; but, when it comes to discussing actual increased power to the Parliament, then an element of considerable vagueness creeps in.  We are told in paragraph 3.10, for example, that the Government think:</P>
    <P>It is desirable for the Governments of the member States to examine together possible ways of introducing a more democratic tension into the relationship between the Parliament and the Council while respecting at the same time the position of the Council as the Communities' primary decision-making body.</P>
    <P>I think I know what is meant by &ldquo;a more democratic tension&rdquo;, but nobody could suggest that it is a very solid undertaking to give greater powers to the European Parliament. I may be unjust, but I have a feeling that not merely our Government but other Governments are tending to push the idea of direct elections in order to seem to be doing something without at the same time giving any real authority to the European Parliament. It is a nice easy thing to do. &ldquo;Oh, yes, let's have direct elections; <Col N="186" /> everyone is happy.&rdquo;  But the introduction of direct elections in themselves would not increase the authority of the Parliament in any way.</P>

      <P>Might I intervene to assure the Senator that the absence of more detail here, apart from reflecting the fact that the report is factual rather than intended to make policy, also reflects the fact that a proposal from the European Commission on this question is just coming forward.  The Government's attitude to the matter is best formulated in the light of a concrete proposal.  I hope the Senator will not feel that because more is not said here we are not most concerned about this.  Indeed, it is one of the primary objects of Government policy in the Community and one on which I am consulting with other Foreign Ministers with a view to achieving the maximum progress.</P>

      <P>With regard to direct elections, clearly the introduction of direct elections would have certain advantages from the point of view of the people of the various member countries of the EEC in that they would be directly involved, and might thereby think that the European Parliament was their Parliament in a way they do not feel now I am not certain there would be any great public interest in direct elections unless the European Parliament at the same time was given increased powers.  There might be a situation, which would be entirely deplorable, where you have a 20 per cent poll.  The situation is made more difficult in this country because, the Minister knows, we have a system of proportional representation, which he helped to bring about.  There must be three seats minimum in a constituency. That means electing ten people by proportional representation in Irish conditions.  The maximum number of constituencies you can have is three, the average population of each would <Col N="187" /> be one million and the average number of voters would be about 700,000. These are enormous constituencies electing three or four members to Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is perhaps assuming that in direct elections the European Parliament would retain its present size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate there have been various suggestions made for dealing with this matter.  I am merely pointing out there are considerable difficulties.  You would have people who were almost presidential candidates who would be far removed from the ordinary man in the street and equally they would be far removed from Parliament itself.  One advantage of having representatives who are Members of the Dáil or Seanad is that they are exposed directly to the political life of the country, and this has considerable advantages.  If we had direct elections as they stand with ten members they would be so far removed from the electorate that it is difficult to see the electorate taking much interest and equally they would be cut off from Parliament.  As the Minister states, there have been various suggestions for dealing with this by increasing the number of four delegates, say, from ten to 30, of whom ten might still be from the Parliament and 20 from the electorate. Direct elections will not necessarily solve any problems and could create a great many more.  In the absence of increased powers to the European Parliament I am not at all certain that there would be much advantage and there could indeed be disadvantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the question of the Commission giving increased powers to the Parliament.  I notice the Commission have within the last day or so produced some relatively far-reaching proposals for Parliament.  I gather this was announced in Brussels last Wednesday. According to the new French Commissioner, Monsieur Claude Cheysson this proposal has a two-fold objective: first, to increase Parliamentary control over all Community activities and, second, to give Parliament the right to express itself effectively on <Col N="188" /> all guidelines and decisions involving the Community as such.  It is proposed that there should be a so-called Second Reading procedure, that in cases where the Council of Ministers might stray very far from the opinion of the Parliament in any given draft decision, the matter should again be brought up before the Assembly and the Council representative would be obliged to explain why the Council disagreed.  The difficulty with this procedure is that there is nothing to make the Council take a different decision a second time round; but at least it would be an advantage in that they would have to listen again to the parliamentarians and, as the Commission now point out, it would also give them a chance to cope with our national parliament, complain bitterly to their own government representatives and try to persuade them to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the more sizeable step forward is what seems to be a proposal to increase the total of the Community budget which will be controlled by the Parliament from 5 per cent to 15 or 20 per cent.  If one considers any national budget, including our own, allowing for matters which are spent from year to year and over which we have no control, probably not as much as 15 or 20 per cent is really free to be dealt with in any sort of manoeuvreable way. These new proposals would go a long way towards giving the Parliament some teeth.  I hope, when it comes up before the Council of Ministers, that the Minister will take an affirmative line on these or any other proposals that will come up from the Commission.</P>
    <P>One portion of this report which is very unsatisfactory is that dealing with the common agricultural policy.  Even though it is some 15 pages long and is the longest section of any part of this report, it is rather uninformative. There is, for example at paragraph 72, a discussion of the various development programmes for structural reform.  It lists the titles of these programmes, which it is hoped to bring into operation early in 1974. It states that Ireland is at present drawing up these programmes.  As I <Col N="189" /> understand it, these programmes should have been ready from our Government and the other governments last April.  They were not ready and the Commission had therefore to ask the Council of Ministers to extend the time to the end of the year.  I am not blaming the Government for this. As I understand it, no country has been ready for this programme.  We are all in the same mess.  In a report of this kind, nonetheless, it would be more candid and more informative if matters of this kind were listed, if it were stated that in fact the proposals were late, that an extension has been given and that it is hoped to have them by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I mention that not to criticise the Government, as there were serious problems in preparing these, but to criticise the nature of the report in which is too much bald statement of fact.  I should like to see more opinions.  I should like to see more facts.  The report is worded in such a way that no one could criticise any opinions which have been expressed. I would not mind if the Minister put in chunks of subeditorial matter giving his and the Government's views.  If one disagreed it would not matter because it would be the Minister's or the Government's view.  This is a political issue.  This is too cautious a document right through.</P>
    <P>At chapter 7.5 we have this very interesting matter of the scheme for mountain and poorer farming areas. This proposal is one which covers areas throughout the Community where slopes of the mountains are such that it is impossible to carry out agriculture without special expensive machinery and also poorer areas. These are defined by various criteria: where the average income is only two-thirds of the national level and so on.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty which I am sure has been exercising the Government but which is not stated at all in the report.  The mountain areas are straightforward.  If the conditions pertaining to the slope are right, you are in.  The other poorer farming areas must be listed by the government of each state and they must not exceed in all 2.5 per cent of the total area of the <Col N="190" /> country.  In our western areas, including Donegal, Sligo, Galway and Mayo, it is obvious they are far greater than 2½ per cent of the entire area of the country.  The Government have to prepare this list.  I understand&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that the list has already been prepared and sent off to the Commission.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, in chapter 7.5 the report says that the Council at its meeting at the end of April adopted a resolution and so on.  I understand the meeting was on May 15th.  It is an unimportant point, but it seems odd that the date of a meeting so very recent cannot be got right.</P>
    <P>However, I should like to know if the Government have sent this list.  If so, how on earth did they prepare it? Surely this is a matter of very great importance because the whole of the West of Ireland, and maybe other areas, are entitled to hope that they would benefit from this very valuable scheme.  We have a curious situation where these areas appear to have been selected without any reference that anyone knows of&mdash;I am not suggesting that it was done in a wrong way. I am sure the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries made out the list in accordance with all the right criteria, but this is a highly political matter which ought to be made known.  Certainly it should be dealt with in detail in this report.</P>
    <P>We all know what happened in regard to the price negotiations.  We all read the newspapers.  Therefore, I am not suggesting that anyone is misled by this report, but this example is highly expressive of the kind of criticism I am making of the report.  We know that when it came to the price negotiations, meeting after meeting was held, midnight sessions, all-night sessions, a very strong onslaught was made from a number of sources on the whole concept of the common agricultural policy.  A compromise was ultimately reached, but not a particularly satisfactory one for us.  It was a long drawn out, dramatic and very hard-fought battle of very great importance. It is dealt with in the report by classic understatement:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> The proposals were discussed by the Council (Agriculture) at their meetings of 26/27 March, 9/10 April, 15/17 April and again of 28 April to 1 May when the following decisions were taken:</P>
    <P>Full stop, end of report so far as that goes.  We know the kind of situation which existed.  As a report of developments of interest to Ireland and the EEC, it seems to me extraordinarily inadequate.  I should much rather see a sort of candid report from the Government and the Minister about what happened, about how happy or unhappy he was at the results.  When you get on to the prices listed, immediately after this, the situation is not much better.  We are given bald statements about export prices for crop products, livestock products, cereals, sugar and so on&mdash;the actual increases that were given.  When, for example, we are told that adult cattle are up by 10.5 per cent, that is utterly irrelevant in the context of rising world prices and world shortages.  What we would like to know is: how did Ireland do?  What real benefit do any of these price increases mean for the Irish farmer?  We are not told in this report.</P>
    <P>We need be in no doubt, certainly the Minister is in no doubt, that there is on the way at the moment&mdash;in full swing, you might say&mdash;a sustained and embittered attack on the whole idea of the common agricultural policy.  It comes from many sources.  Quite clearly, the entry of Britain into the Common Market has changed things considerably.  In agreeing to enter the EEC they accepted, along with everything else, the concept of the CAP. Nevertheless, it is quite clear that they hope to demolish it at the earliest opportunity.  Reform is the great word in use at the moment, but we know what reform means when it comes to this matter.</P>
    <P>The United States also is engaged in an attack on the CAP, particularly in connection with the forthcoming GATT negotiations.  Even the socialist groups in various European countries are engaged in an attack on the CAP in the guise of a search for cheap food for the workers.  It shows how far <Col N="192" /> things have gone when even the Community's own newspaper, <i>European Community</i>, a week or so ago had a veiled and not so veiled attack on the idea of the CAP and a suggestion that the time had come to change it.  I omitted to read the first page of that journal.  It says carefully that the views of contributors are not necessarily those of the Communities.  Nevertheless when in the Community's own paper an attack of this kind can be printed it shows that we are up against a situation which we must take very seriously.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but it is published by the Communities.  It is symptomatic of a situation of which I am sure the Minister is far more aware than I am, that we have a fight on our hands.  I do not need to urge any Irish Minister to stand fast on this whole concept of the CAP.  It is quite clear that the Government must not budge an inch from the Irish position which is not simply a selfish position.  We, of course, are concerned about our own special interests, but it is not simply a matter of being selfish.  It is quite clear that in this country as in other countries, for generations the average income in farming areas has been and continues to be far below that in the industrial areas.  This is still the situation in Ireland even after the very large rises in food prices over the past year or so.  If we go back over the last 20 years it is quite clear that the increased income accruing to the farmer has been considerably less than that accruing to those living in cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great catchcry these days is of food surpluses.  It is quite extraordinary that, in the context of a situation where millions upon millions of people are actually starving, and probably half or more than half the world's population are under nourished, there can be a situation where there are food surpluses.  Instead of cutting down on agricultural production, what is needed is a better rationalisation of world trade in order to see that there are no food surpluses, <Col N="193" /> because certainly, in world terms, there could not possibly be such a thing as a food surplus.</P>
    <P>On the question of peripheral areas, the decision as to whether all or only part of our <i>rus</i> is to be counted as a peripheral area has not yet been announced.  It was to have been announced first on the 14th June and now it has been postponed to today or tomorrow.  It may be that the Minister already knows the ultimate result. I certainly hope that we will come out of it well.</P>
    <P>Here again, there is a danger that if peripheral areas, not just in Ireland but in the Community as a whole, are fixed on too wide a scale whatever funds are made available for the regional fund will be diluted and will be of no great benefit to any particular area.  I hope the Minister will resist any suggestion that, for example, large parts of our neighbours in Britain or other industrial areas should be included.  It is quite clear that if huge sums are to be allotted for the rationalisation and improvement of inefficient industries it will mean that the areas that really need these funds will simply not get them.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in chapter 8.4 of the report to the examination of State aids, that is our own regional aids.  The Minister says that these have not yet been done.  According to the report, the Irish aids were scheduled to be examined about the end of May. I gather this has not yet been done.  I hope there is no danger that we will suffer as a result.  I notice, for example, that recently some Belgian aids were declared by the Commission to be invalid and were disallowed.</P>
    <P>It could be a very serious matter for us if steps of this kind were taken.  I do not know whether the Minister has any idea of whether we are in any danger of losing some of our aids to underdeveloped areas.  The real test of regional policy will be how much there will be and whether it is adequate. I hope the Minister will be absolutely firm on this, that he will not agree at the council to any proposal that is not adequate.  We have just got to dig our heels in here.  If there is any suggestion that the fund will be such that the regional policy will be stymied at the <Col N="194" /> start, we should resist it very strongly and if necessary refuse to agree to any regional policy at all rather than have a situation of that kind.</P>
    <P>We should know whether the Government have taken any decision about the fifth directive on company law. There is a very interesting section on it which proposes that there should be extensive work of participation in all plants of more than 500 workers.  This seems to be a very valuable step forward which if agreed would, of course, be introduced here.  I should be interested to know if the Government have any opinion on that.</P>
    <P>In external relations, the Community in one way are carrying out a very extensive and to some extent successful policy of development aid to countries particularly in Africa but also in the Mediterranean countries as a whole.  To some extent these policies do not go as far as they could.  The amount allotted as yet for development aid is not sufficient and, even though it would cost us in Ireland something to aid these matters, I hope the Minister will press constantly for as active a Community policy as possible, because our own problems which we have suffered in the past put us in the position to understand the problems of other countries now developing.</P>
    <P>On the association with Greece at chapter 48 of the report, I thought that this again its somewhat inadequate. It merely states that agreements with Greece and Turkey provide for eventual full membership of the Community for Greece and Turkey.  If only in order to avoid misunderstanding it might have been pointed out that the association agreement with Greece has been frozen pending the re-introduction of some element of democracy there.  The trading concessions are still maintained. It is, I suppose, an arguable matter as to whether they should be. In my opinion they should be, because if you are to start to decide whether you are going to trade with a country or not according to the colour of its government there would not be much world trade.  Nevertheless it is important that the Community have refused to go any further with any kind of <Col N="195" /> discussions, or meetings with regard to the association with Greece.  This could have been stated in the report. That section of the report has already caused some misunderstanding.</P>
    <P>With regard to relations with EFTA, the Community had been less than generous.  The negotiations with the former countries of EFTA provided for certain what we would call sensitive products&mdash;for example timber from Finland&mdash;to be admitted only on quotas to the Community and the quotas are very small.  This is an example of a somewhat too mean approach by the Community.  This has now been put through, but if future negotiations of this type take place the Minister should try to persuade the Community to be somewhat more generous because, for example, exports of paper from Finland to the Community are a very small part&mdash; about 6 per cent&mdash;of the Community imports of paper, but they form a very high proportion of Finland's exports.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to see in the Minister's speech the statement that under the common commercial policy member states no longer conclude bilateral trade agreements, but the Commission negotiate with third countries on the basis of mandates agreed at the level of the Nine.  I was glad to see it not because it was any surprise to me, because we all knew this when we entered the EEC, but at least it shows that this is the Government's view.  I was stupified&mdash;stupified is the only word&mdash;to read a very remarkable speech in last Friday's <i>Irish Times</i> by the Minister for Labour at the ILO Conference in Geneva.  It was very remarkable.  If I may, I should like to quote sections of it which must have caused very great misunderstanding at the ILO:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour, Mr. O'Leary, suggested yesterday that Ireland might combine with other small European nations in a joint programme of development aid concentrating on providing expert assistance particularly in training.</P>
    <P>It continues:</P>
    <P>...Parallel to the desirability <Col N="196" /> of undeveloped nations to combine, is there a case for a like combination, a pooling of aid resources by those nations like my own, sharing no colonial past, desirous of gaining no spheres of political influence amongst the underdeveloped and entertaining no ambitions to revive imperial glory under another guise?</P>
    <P>The imperial glory under another guise I take as a reference to our fellow-members of the EEC, Britain, France, Germany and Italy.  It can refer to nobody else.  It strikes me as a very strange remark indeed coming from an Irish Minister for Labour at the ILO. The prose is rather fascinating.  &ldquo;The cruel irony,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;of certain aid programmes is that they result in the creation of a whole new class of client capitalists whose conspicuous consumption, and Riveria-like revels&rdquo;&mdash;that is a nice phrase&mdash;&ldquo;throw into sharper relief the agony of millions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what all this means but he was suggesting to the ILO at Geneva that all small European countries could join together in trading and aiding various undeveloped countries because they have not got the imperialist ambitions that our larger colleagues in the EEC have.  Apart from anything else, as the Minister has rightly pointed out in his speech, this kind of thing is simply not allowed in the EEC and I do wish he would tell his colleague that we no longer have the power to do this type of bilateral trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few questions that I should like to ask the Minister. <Col N="198" /> First of all, on customs simplification, it seems to me that one of the most unfortunate aspects of the EEC up to now is that, instead of getting simpler, customs formalities seem to get more difficult.  I know in our earlier and more innocent days, as I certainly thought one could get into one's car or lorry at one end and drive to the far end and no customs men or formalities would interfere. There would be no bother&mdash;it is all one big happy family.  We all know that not only are there still customs men but for anybody involved in shipping goods things have to a large extent grown more difficult.  There are a fantastic number of complications involved.</P>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to press as hard as he can whenever the question arises at the Council of Ministers, even though it may mean some loss of efficiency, to try to eliminate some of these complications.  I know the Commission have this passion for harmonisation, for everything being in a neat order, that all laws and different matters are the same in each country so that nobody gets an unfair advantage; but I think this passion for harmonisation, for order, can go too far.  Even though it may mean that some fish escape the Community net I think we should try to simplify these incredibly complex customs formalities.</P>
      <P>Some years ago&mdash;and if I had not been a strong EEC enthusiast and not prepared to be shifted from my views it would have soured me for life against the Common Market&mdash;I had the curious experience of bringing a German musical instrument into Germany and it took me four hours with incredible complications to combat efforts to prevent me from doing it. The people who are constantly finding themselves in this situation must find it very difficult.  I would ask the Minister to try to do something about this.  I know that he is only one of nine, but at least he can exercise influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have the question of public supply contracts.  We are told in chapter 6.16 that Ireland's observations on a draft directive for the co-ordination <Col N="199" /> of procedures for the award of public supply contracts were forwarded to the Commission early in 1973 so that our views could be taken into consideration by the Commission. I do not know whether these reports are confidential, but I should have thought that what the views were could be listed.</P>
    <P>We have the European Investment Bank to which Senator Lenihan said we were to submit the schemes.  The report states that schemes have been submitted in the public sector.  I wonder could the Minister tell us what these are, or is that a confidential matter perhaps?  Why not schemes in the private sector?  I notice that recently quite considerable loans were granted by the bank&mdash;for example, in the case of a private factory in Hamburg shipping in and out of Hamburg into a more rural area.  It seems to me to be the very type of thing that could be used in Ireland.  In the public sector I notice that there is great interest that in Italy quite a considerable sum has been provided by the bank for the improvement of telephone services in Sardinia.  This sounds to me a delightful idea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We could do with it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it is one of the things we have put in for because heaven knows our telephone system could be improved, and if the European Investment Bank are prepared to do it in Sardinia they certainly should do it in Ireland also.  It sounds a highly desirable idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of VAT, we have the situation as yet somewhat inchoate, that sometime in the future there will be harmonisation of VAT throughout the Community.  I think that the Government have the feeling, and they may or may not be justified, that this is a long way away, that with any luck it will never happen.  I have a feeling that it is a good deal nearer than we may be willing to admit.  For one thing it is obviously very desirable.  It is not just a matter of harmonisation for harmonisation's sake.  It is very desirable <Col N="200" /> that there should be uniformity of VAT throughout the Community. From 1st January, 1975, the member States, including us, will be asked to pay a portion of receipts from VAT, not more than 1 per cent, in order to pay for the upkeep of the Community.  Obviously any country that has a global rate of VAT higher than other countries will be paying an undue amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the 1 per cent is related to the tax base and that levels of taxation levied locally are not relevant to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not 1 per cent of the revenue from VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the tax base. There are goods zero rated which are brought into the tax base.  This is with a view to ensuring uniformity and equity between countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not affect the issue but it affects communications in another way, and perhaps even in a more important way.  I mentioned the question of border supervision, customs men and all that paraphernalia.  Quite obviously, so long as there are different rates of VAT in different countries this must remain.  Because if there is 10 per cent on a particular item in one country and not in a neighbouring country then clearly there will have to be a border situation to collect this 10 per cent, whereas if it is 10 per cent in each country it does not matter. Goods can be shipped from place to place and VAT is paid at the point of origin.  If there is ever to be a proper Common Market in that sense of the word and any real reciprocation of border supervision there must be harmonisation of VAT.  This will of course, raise problems for us. There is a very great difference in VAT as administered in this country and our neighbours in Britain.  We have four rates, in Britain there are two, a zero and a 10 per cent, as I understand.  I do not know if there are any of the other members of EEC that have as many as four rates of VAT.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is hardly likely.  If there is any question of harmonisation of VAT I should imagine that they would insist on having probably two and certainly a maximum of three rates which would affect us.  Also, it is quite clear that since only two countries out of the nine have removed VAT from food it seems very likely that we will be required to put it back and it may be that the Government will regret very much having taken this step.  However this is a matter for another day.  I will not go into this in any great detail.</P>

      <P>That is a matter of opinion.  If I went into my views on it I might be terrible.  I shall reserve this for another day, perhaps 20th August. I think the Government should be considering this matter.  I doubt if the Minister can tell me, but I should like to ask him how our rates of VAT conflict with other countries.  In other words, are our average VAT rates higher or lower than the Community norm and how do the number of different rates compare?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is less then we may expect to have to put it up ultimately. If it is higher we may have the happy prospect of bringing it down.  It is clearly a matter of some importance to us anyhow.  I was disappointed to read this morning that the Government had apparently turned down, or at any rate ignored, a request from the Commission to introduce what one might describe as cheap letters to the EEC.  The Commission suggested, as is the practice in the original Six, that we should have a local rate for letters which would cover the entire EEC. In other words, it costs the same to send a letter from Dublin to Cork as it would to send it from Dublin to Milan, Bonn or Amsterdam.  This suggestion would not have cost very much.  The Commission felt, and I think they were right, that this kind of facility while not costing a great deal would bring home to the public, in a very direct way, the fact that we were members now of a single Community. I am disappointed to find that Britain and Denmark have said they will not come in on this scheme also. I think it is a great pity.  If the Minister has any influence in that matter I would urge him to try and get our Government to agree to that suggestion. I do not know whether it is possible for us to agree to it if Britain do not but, if we said that we were prepared to do so if the others agreed also, it would be an advance.</P>
      <P>I should like to stress again&mdash;I know the Minister is fully aware of the necessity&mdash;the need for maximum information not just on the basic type of fact as set out in this report but particularly on our own Government's attitude.  I know one can always get people to put down questions in the Dáil asking for the Government's attitude on this and that but I would like to see a situation where, whenever any directive came up, the Government made it plain in one way or another what their views were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that very often the Government might not be able to form a view but it is fairly easy to say so but, as far as matters are not confidential, I think the line our Ministers are taking at the Council of Ministers ought to be <Col N="203" /> known to us in advance.  I can see that there is a good deal of bargaining and, obviously, a Government do not want to have itself bound in any way before it goes to the Council of Ministers but, to a considerable extent, I think it should be possible for our Government and the various Ministers concerned to give their views on what the general attitude was and, certainly, it should be possible for them to give views on how each particular directive, regulation and so forth is going to affect us. I am convinced that the vital matter in EEC conditions is that the public in general and politicians in particular should have the absolute maximum amount of information on everything that goes on especially in so far as it concerns ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief on this because there really is only one point with which I want to deal. It concerns the point that Senator Yeats finished with.  I am diametrically opposed to his view on this.  I would hope that the Minister and the Government would not succumb to the temptation, and it probably is a temptation, to present in this report their own policy ideas in relation to the EEC.  I do not think that was the intention of the section of the Act which provided for the making of these reports.  The section was quoted at the beginning of this report and says:</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the European Communities Act provides that the Government shall make a report twice yearly to each House of the Oireachtas on developments in the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping they would improve on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind it would not be an improvement on it. The work of the involvement of the Oireachtas in the development of the Community in relation to regulations, directives and so on which come from the Community would be, to a very large extent, vitiated if consideration of these reports as they come up twice a year was to be side-tracked by a discussion, possibly a political discussion, <Col N="204" /> on the policy or the slant of whichever Government was here in relation to foreign policy generally.  There should be, and there will be, other opportunities for the Government to state their policy and their views on policy with regard to various aspects of the Community and it is proper that they should do so.  It would be proper for this House and the other House to have a discussion then on Government policy in relation to these matters.  I do not think that there would be the type of consideration which should be given&mdash;let me compliment Senator Yeats and the other speakers&mdash;and has been given to this report.  That kind of consideration would not be given if it were to be tied up with a critical discussion, or even a laudatory discussion, of Government policy.  I wish to express the hope that the Minister and the Government will resist that temptation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that the Minister has, notwithstanding what I have just said, announced his intentions with regard to the formation of what he described as a watch-dog Committee.  I know that Senators and Members of the Dáil have expressed their views regarding the desirability of having such a body in existence. Speaking as a Member of this House, I would have liked to see slightly more representation from the Seanad on that Committee because, in many ways, the full potential of the Seanad is not being used or has not been used in the past. It occurred to me that this was an area in which Senators, in particular, could play a very effective and very vital role. The Minister and the Government if they consider the matter further, may possibly feel that, with the demands on Members of the Dáil these days, perhaps it might be fairer to the Dáil to throw some more of the work in relation to this Committee on to the Seanad.  In doing so, they would help to make the Seanad more of a reality. Whether they do so or not, the fact that the Government have decided to <Col N="205" /> go ahead with the formation of this Committee will be welcomed from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Having become members of the Community it is very important that we should not be ultra-nationalistic in our approach.  At the same time we should be very careful that we are not simply going to throw out of the window our own parliamentary institutions and the involvement of our own parliamentry institutions and personnel in the work of the community, in overseeing it, so far as we can, in its relationship with ourselves. The Minister and the Government are to be complimented on the approach which the Minister indicated the Government were taking to this matter, even though it obviously is out of the question that it would be mandatory on the Government to accept without question any recommendation put up by this committee when it is established.  It is very much a step in the right direction that the committee should be put in the position, as it obviously is going to be, of expressing views and tendering advice on matters which could be, in many respects, of considerable importance to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is useful, since this is the first occasion on which the Seanad has debated a report from the Government under section 5 of the European Communities Act, to be clear on exactly what the nature of this report should be.  I should like to say straight away that I side very much with the view expressed by Senator Yeats, who gave a comprehensive analysis of this report.  I would remind this House that section 5 of the European Communities Act was, in fact, brought in as an amendment in this House by Dr. Hillery, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He did so in response to criticisms made in both Houses, but particularly in the Seanad, and in response to a demand for a report of developments, but not in a narrow factual sense, of political developments in the Communities. This must be so, because the Community cannot be reduced to facts about cotton, jute and tariff quotas. That is not what the Community is about.  We would be fooling ourselves <Col N="206" /> and would be taking a very narrow perspective if we imagined that it was.  Therefore, if the Community is a political concept and if the development of the Community is intensely political, then the attitude of the Government on the development of the Community is political and the Government ought to put much more policy content into this report, if the report is going to serve the purpose for which it was introduced.</P>
      <P>I believe that that purpose was to allow for accountability by the Government for the development in the Community and Ireland's role in relation to the development.  To me this suggests that what is really desired and what is really useful is that the Government should outline the political and economic developments in the Communities, the problems or the policy decisions which this poses for this country and give an indication of the Government attitude, and then allow Parliament to express views on this.  This is a meaningful relationship.</P>
      <P>If this report, which will be submitted twice-yearly to each House of the Oireachtas, is confined to a factual account, then it is not worth having, because we can get this factual information elsewhere, such as from the Government Information Bureau, or from the bulletins of the Communities themselves.  We can get factual indigestible information elsewhere. What we want in this report is much more than that.  Therefore, it would be interesting and imperative to have an undertaking from the Minister that the reports will contain the attitude of the Government on the various developments in the European Communities, and the role which this country has played in the discussions, and the role which it intends to play in relation to proposed programmes, such as the programme on social or regional policy and also on draft regulations and directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I begin by making the same sort of criticism that Senator Yeats was making of the nature of this report.  It is much too much a factual, bald document, containing matter which can be found elsewhere; containing a very bare outline of the policy consideration <Col N="207" /> behind the various matters dealt with and&mdash;this is the real point&mdash; not allowing this House, if it confines itself to the report, to play a very useful role, by not allowing it really to understand what the implications are and to express views which would then be helpful to the Government and to the Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>I propose to examine some areas of the report in more detail and to illustrate this and I hope that it will be possible to influence future reports.  I accept the statement made by the Minister that this report is perhaps an unusual one in that it covers a longer period, and a period in which there was a great rate of development through the enlargement of the Irish participation and through all the agreements we had to enter into.  After this, each report will cover a six-months' period and it will be possible to have a shorter report.  I would prefer if the report remained the same length, but dealt in more detail with specific aspects, giving a policy content and Government attitude, and allowing the Parliament to have this sort of dialogue with the Government on the basis of an accountability of what is happening on development in the Communities.</P>
    <P>The first chapter deals with a factual account of an enlargement in the Communities&mdash;a matter which can be found very easily elsewhere.  Chapter 2 deals with the summit and the conference with the heads of state in Paris.  It does not indicate that, although there was a commitment to go forward with economic and monetary policy, with regional policy, and with a rather new commitment to a more developed form of social policy which is an industrial environmental policy, that there was not a commitment to an institutional development which would allow for a healthy democratic control in the Community. Here there would have been an opportunity to express, perhaps, a commitment by the Irish Government to strive for greater institutional control.</P>
    <P>On page 10 of the report, paragraph 2.7, there is a heading &ldquo;Political Co-operation&rdquo;. Contained in that short paragraph is a whole area which never <Col N="208" /> comes before the Parliament, which is never debated in a constructive way in either House and which is of enormous significance at the moment.  This is the procedure by which the Foreign Ministers of the nine member states meet four times a year.  Their officials meet monthly in what is known as the d'Avignon Committee.  This d'Avignon Committee is not strictly an institution of the Community; it is not under any control, nor is it accountable to the European Parliament; nor is there any way in which the actual discussions and the matters which are debated at the meetings of the d'Avignon Committee can come before any European forum of accountability.  It is an intergovernmental machinery to debate matters of foreign policy and, it would appear, matters of defence.  This is an increasingly important question which we never seem to raise in Parliament for discussion.</P>
    <P>It is immensely important that this Parliament be given an opportunity to know, at least in general terms, what is being discussed in a committee like the d'Avignon Committee, and to know in particular what the Irish Government's attitude is to the various issues raised. This is particularly important if one looks at the types of subject matter which have come up in the discussions of the Committee.  One of the matters which has come up and on which there has been a number of detailed discussions&mdash;sub-committees of the d'Avignon Committee have been formed in relation to this&mdash;relate to the Security Conference in Helsinki.  There is no mention in this report about this conference. In strict legal terms you could say that it did not necessarily fall within what one would call development in the Community.  It is probably the most important political development. The Community has taken an attitude towards the Helsinki Conference and has decided that the nine member countries would be represented by single spokesmen and would have a Community attitude in so far as possible towards it.</P>
    <P>We are not given any indication of the Irish Government's attitude towards this critical question of security of European defence.  We need this all the <Col N="209" /> more because we are not members of NATO and, therefore we are the odd country out in these discussions.  I would like much more information on what the Irish representative, be he the Foreign Minister or his official does, when questions relating to NATO come up.  Do they absent themselves? Do they make a specific distinction?  Is there an attempt to carve out what I would believe would be a very complex, and probably a very well worthwhile Irish policy on the most involved questions that come up?  If we are playing this very complex role in this d'Avignon Committee can we not know about it?  Can there not be more accountability to the Parliament about Ireland's role in relation to this whole question of security as it will come at the Helsinki Conference?</P>
    <P>Other subjects which have come up at this meeting include questions like the Middle East and the recognition of Bangladesh and other questions where one would expect that there would be some feed-back to the Parliament on what attitude the Irish Foreign Minister was taking at the session of this d'Avignon Committee.</P>
    <P>This is an example of the very sharp policy content behind what appears to be a most innocent paragraph which does not really reveal at all what the problems are, or what role Ireland must play.  We have to play a different role because we are not members of NATO and we cannot go along with the crowd.  We either join NATO and go along with the crowd or we have got to do something different.  We have to carve out the special role which we have.  I would like to know to what extent the Government are prepared to provide the necessary information for a constructive debate on this whole area particularly in light of the fact that the Helsinki Conference itself is scheduled to open in July.</P>
    <P>The next chapter deals with the question of the institutions of the Communities.  Here, again, I think the weakness&mdash;Senator Yeats has already pointed this out very clearly&mdash;is the lack of a Government view on the question of the development of the institutions or, indeed, of the Community <Col N="210" /> itself.  It is a pity, because it either illustrates extreme caution or else it indicates that not much thinking has been done in this area.  In relation to the Council of Ministers it is stated that after the commitment to the summit that practical steps could be taken to improve the decision-making procedures and the cohesion of Community action.  To what extent is Ireland really trying to institute a relationship between the Council and the European Parliament which has now formed some control and co-operation at the European level which is democratic as well as being efficient? I think that there is a grave danger that the Council of Ministers, which is badly in need of becoming more efficient, will try to become more efficient at the expense of the democratic element.  It would be interesting to know what the attitude of the Irish Government is in relation to this question of improving the actual decision-making process within the council.  Is it also combined with a real attempt to make the Council more open, less secret, and more accountable for decisions taken?</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Yeats that the paragraphs relating to the European Parliament are extremely weak.  If this report, as we are told it is, indicates developments in the communities up to 15th May, I find it extraordinary that there is no reference to the very substantial procedural changes which have begun to be introduced into the Parliament and to the attempts which have been made very largely by the British delegates to the Parliament&mdash; not, I am sorry to say, quite so noticeably by the Irish delegates, though I am sure they have supported the proposals made&mdash;to allow for a more political role for the Parliament and to allow it to have a procedure providing for oral questions, <i>et cetera.</i> Senator Yeats has already quoted the section involved and they do not reflect any Government attitude.  They do not show the current political thinking on this subject in the Community and indicate what our attitude is towards it.</P>
    <P>The next matter I want to deal with is the names of Irish members <Col N="211" /> of Community bodies.  It would be factual information.  Most of us know who the delegates to the European Parliament are and who the judge of the European Court is, but it would be very interesting to have a full breakdown on who the Irish appointments were in the Secretariat of the Council, in the Commission and in the European Parliament.  I think this would be a matter of some real interest.</P>

      <P>Even that would be a very interesting comment.  The chapter on external relations and trade is not just a very helpful chapter.  It does not start with what I believe is generally agreed to be the most important aspect of external relations and trade, mainly the trade relations between Community and the United States.  This is an externally important area.  It is one in which there has been a lot of thinking and writing.  It would be possible to reduce the core of that writing to an indication of the political involvement of the Community and of the question of how it bargained with the United States, what the factors are, Ireland's role and Ireland's attitude towards this whole question.  There is no indication of this.  Once again it is a factual account of certain rather minor aspects of the foreign trade which really disguises and draws attention away from what are the main foreign trade issues.  The question of trade with Japan is another aspect of the whole question of foreign trade with the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of free movement of persons, services and capital, in chapter 6, I think it would be helpful if there was more indication of the degree of consultation with professional and vocational bodies in the <Col N="212" /> country.  I say this because I believe that we do not sufficiently appreciate the extent to which membership of the Communities places a strain on our resources and the main resource on which it places a strain is our manpower.</P>
    <P>We must learn, as a small country, to meet the European Community commitment by using our manpower. I believe that the Government must be much more ready than they have been to reach out to people outside the Government machine, outside the Civil Service, and to reach out to people who will provide certain expertise, who have a knowledge in the particular area who wish to be consulted and who would have a very decided role to play.</P>
    <P>We could tap more sources of manpower. The attitude of Ireland would be on a national basis which would not bring up the problem of different political viewpoints.  On many Community issues there is an Irish national standpoint on which there is no basic disagreement. Therefore, I should like the Government to consider being ready to call for expertise in the community, to seek help from either bodies or individuals with that sort of expertise.</P>
    <P>Looking at paragraph 6.7 on the question of rights of establishment it states, in a very cryptic way in referring to the establishment of the professionals and their right to supply services, as follows:</P>
    <P>These proposals raise problems for us which are under consideration in consultation with the Irish professional organisation concerned.</P>
    <P>What is the degree of this consultation? Is it a uniform sort of consultation or is it a sort of phone call to the president of an association or a letter to the secretary saying &ldquo;Have you any views on this&rdquo;?  What is the procedure and machinery for a consultation?  This whole area is under review and there are proposals for a National Economic Council which would be helpful in co-ordinating the information and the policy; but the professional and vocational groups in this country ought to be consulted a great deal more about <Col N="213" /> draft directives or draft regulations or even draft proposals at Community level which if they are implemented will vastly affect the lifestyle and the methods of operation of these bodies. If this consultation was introduced in a constructive way the Government would be met more than half way by these bodies.  They are very willing to be consulted and they feel there is a great lack of consultation and are very worried about the criteria for either a right of establishment or free movement. In the university context the question of the equivalence of degrees and diplomas is a matter of concern.</P>
    <P>In chapter 6.14 the paragraph we are quoting states:</P>
    <P>We were represented in the final stages of the deliberation for the working party which was set up to review progress generally in this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is the matter of the equivalence of degrees and diplomas</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and which met between February and October, 1972.  The working party submitted a report to the Commission in December, 1972. Consultations are continuing with university authorities here in the matter.</P>
    <P>We were represented.  Who represented us?  What was the basis on which this representation took place?  &ldquo;Consultations are continuing with university authorities.&rdquo;  With what university authorities?  At what level in the universities? At what level in the universities is this whole question of the equivalence of degrees and diplomas, a matter which is being discussed and which ought to be discussed and on which views ought to be sought? There is a danger of further erosion of university independence, in a sense, if the consultation comes too late and if it is at too high a level to penetrate down to the areas where decisions are beginning to be taken in the university at more democratic level.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to dwell on the common agricultural policy, which has been referred to by those more expert than I in dealing with it.  I wish to <Col N="214" /> move on to the chapters on more legal aspects.  There is a chapter on the competition policy of the Community with reference to the Continental Can Company position and that, although the Commission lost on the facts by not having sufficiently proved their case against Continental Can, they won the principle of being able to control mergers.  There is a rather vague attitude that there probably will be a regulation controlling mergers and that this may have to take place under Article 235 because there is no clear specific authority for it.</P>
    <P>What is the attitude of the Government on this question.  To what extent will it influence the legislation which is promised here and about which there is doubt about its imminence? What problems does it pose for this country?  What sort of controls have we already of supranational companies?  To what extent would we implement the merger proposals in the third directive on companies where there would be a responsibility to the workers in a company where a merger ensued?  None of these basic questions is raised at all by this unhelpful cryptic paragraph, which is typical of the way in which the report is written. Looking at the chapter on company law, I have already made brief reference to the third directive on mergers. Senator Yeats made reference to the directive on worker participation.  I should like to support his desire for an indication of the Government's attitude on this and to stress the importance of the proposal contained in this draft directive.  This last directive would apply only to public companies and to large public companies at that. It would require the creation of three distinct organs in a company which are quite new to Irish, large public companies. One would be a management body, the second would be a supervisory board and the third would be a general meeting of shareholders.  As well as that, the proposal would require worker participation on the supervisory board.</P>
