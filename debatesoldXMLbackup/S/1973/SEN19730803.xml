      <P>I said last night there are many good points in this budget. At the same time, it is necessary to point out that the budget fails miserably to implement many of the promises contained in the 14-point pamphlet which was issued by the Coalition before the general election.  I freely admit that in the present Government there are many very intelligent men.  Many of them are experts in their own field but, collectively, I feel that they are not fit to deliver the goods and this budget will in time show that.  The people as a whole are fairly intelligent.  They have long memories.  These promises were made quite recently.  Everybody knows that prices have skyrocketed; every day in the newspapers there are reports of new price rises.  No amount of talk from the Government Benches and no amount of promises, without the delivery of the goods, will satisfy the people or convince them that the Government have not failed miserably to implement what they said when in Opposition, would be an easy thing to do, namely control prices and keep prices down to a certain level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not one who will try to force the Government out of office.  I believe that, if they are given sufficient time, <Col N="992" /> they themselves will be the instruments of their own downfall.  Government is a very serious thing and people who aspire to office in Government should be reasonably serious in the statements they make.  As I said, I make allowances for some rather extravagant speeches but, at the same time, when people assume Government they should get down to brass tacks and, when making promises, they should ensure that, if at all possible, the promises are honoured.</P>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, and also the general public, will be keeping a sharp eye on what is happening.  We handed over to this Government a country in reasonably good shape.  The financial position was sound.  We handed over at a time when there was a windfall of some £30 million from the EEC because subsidies were being removed.  These have been used to augment social services.  But the benefits gained by increased social services are immediately eaten up by the increases in taxation.  Quite a lot of this windfall as a result of a saving on subsidies should have been given to the farmers because, despite the many rumours, and the many articles written by economists, the majority of the farmers are not in the secure financial position that they are said to be in.  It takes a great deal of capital to set up a farmer in business.</P>
    <P>I admit that, if a farmer realises his assets, he could find himself wealthy; but he is a person who must be encouraged to stay in farming because most of our industries are based on the farming community and on their output.  The Government will have to ensure that capital is made available one way or another so that the farmer will be able to get it at a reasonably low interest rate.  We know what has happened recently as far as interest rates are concerned.  All these things have an adverse effect on the farming community, despite the clamour people raised because they felt farmers were doing reasonably well over the last few years with increases in milk and beef prices.  But those profits will be frittered away if the Government are not able to ensure that capital is available to enable the farmer to get low interest rates <Col N="993" /> and increase his output.  In that way the country will become richer.</P>
    <P>It has been our policy all along to try and ensure that each budget is used as an instrument to stimulate the economy to ensure that the country will be in a better financial position at the end of the following year so that we can distribute any profits accruing to the social services. I would always try to provide moneys out of the Exchequer to ensure that the disabled, the mentally handicapped and other people in our society who are unable to fend for themselves would be treated generously and have some little comfort.  I do not think any able-bodied person would begrudge paying a fair share to ensure that this was possible.</P>
    <P>There are some good points in the Bill out I should like to remind the Government that we on this side of the House and people in general will keep a sharp eye on what is happening.  We will not engage in personalities but we will be very critical of the Government's efforts to ensure that the country will be in a better financial position. Our party will be an informed Opposition who will keep the Government on their toes and we will remind them of their election promises in their 14-point programme.  If they do not live up to them we will ask them to go to the country and answer for their mistakes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join with other Senators in making it clear that I do not expect miracles from a Government who have been in office for a few months only.  For that reason I certainly will not attempt to make a general criticism of that period in office because it would be unfair to do so.  There are things that physically cannot be done by any Government unless they have time to make plans and, in the physical way, carry out those plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain declarations of intent which the Government have made clear.  I think they would just as soon be judged on those declarations now.  I sincerely believe that this Government will need all the help they can get before they conclude their term of office, whenever that may be.  I <Col N="994" /> suspect that throughout Senator Lenihan's speech there ran a thread of relief&mdash;I am sure he is sorry he is not in office and that he misses being in office&mdash;at not being in Government at present.  It must be a very frightening experience to be in our kind of financially and economically exposed society with so little real power to do anything about the very grave economic problems with which the Government are faced, many of them through no fault of their own.  Outside influences of one kind or another are now tossing us around like a cork in a sea of turbulent economics with which more powerful countries than ours are finding it impossible to cope.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance returned yesterday from the United States after playing his tiny part there. Please God we will not get ideas of grandeur about the role we play in the reorganisation of international monetary control which we appear to have got over our position in the Common Market.  There he must have met all the other great countries&mdash; France, Germany, Britain, and the United States&mdash;who all find themselves in conditions of unequalled stress because of the sophistication of our economies and, as Senator Lenihan mentioned briefly, the extraordinary changes since the 1950s, only 20 years ago when, as he said, if you controlled food prices you controlled the economy.  That is no longer true because the needs of society have altered so much.  Therefore, the controls of societies of these kinds no longer answers to the old panaceas which we had.</P>
    <P>In ways it was very worrying to hear the Taoiseach last night in his very down-to-earth&mdash;as is his manner &mdash;and blow-by-blow account of this Finance Bill and an explanation of its contents, all signifying nothing.  This Finance Bill will not interfere to any great extent with the serious financial situation facing this country at present. In fact, the whole repetitious nature of a sort of <i>devant vu,</i> the sort of experience that: &ldquo;I have been here before&rdquo; was completed when Senator Dolan made, practically word for word, the first speech I ever heard the late Seán Lemass make&mdash;a very <Col N="995" /> fine speech, indeed, in the time of the first Coalition in 1947-1948 or whenever it was.  He made a very courageous speech saying: &ldquo;We have handed over the economy in a very sound condition.  See that you hand it back in that way,&rdquo; and so on.  The whole thing has gone on and on and, of course, answering nothing.</P>
    <P>This idea of an annual budget, the idea of the paternalistic hand-out, should be transferred to 25th December. The Minister for Finance could come in here in a long red cloak and white beard and play Santa Claus.  It is just as irreverent.  It used to be 2/6d.  It is £1 now or £2 or whatever it is in a devalued currency.  It is the same thing: <i>tous c'est change, tous c'est le meme chose,</i> nothing changes. There was a time when it did not matter very much because one solved one's problems simply by telling them to emigrate.  That was your problem. You gave a puff here and a clamp down there, a dampener to the economy, and they answered to the reins.  That is no longer so; things are much more serious than that.</P>
    <P>I was sorry the Taoiseach did not take the opportunity last night which the Minister for Finance probably did not have, even as short a time ago as the introduction of the budget, to re-assure a very worried society at the very frightening price changes and the price rises.  This is not playing politics.  It is much too serious for that.  The Fianna Fáil Government would not be in any different condition if they were in office.  There is a general feeling abroad that the economy is out of control, that the members of the Cabinet are for the most part sincere men of integrity who would like to control the economy but they cannot and we will all suffer greatly on this account.  This is the issue which brought down the last Government, and was used by the Opposition to bring them down.  They were not controlling prices and people were frightened by the increasing spiral in prices.  Their wages were not meeting up to the decline in the value of money and they were crushed between these two inexorable forces.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> They hoped the change of Government would end their suffering but it has not done so.  In fact, the price rises appear to have become even more dramatic than they were.  The reason for this is that there has been a change of Government but there has been no change of policy.  Fundamental policies are exactly the same.  The various hand-outs we have got are, perhaps, marginally better but, as Senator Lenihan stated last night, this budget was framed in the context of the Presidential election.  It reminded me of the famous Watergate committee to elect the President.  In this case we had a Cabinet using public funds in order to try to sweep the electorate into electing their candidate and this failed.  It had all that aura as far as I was concerned, everybody getting a little so that very few felt aggrieved.  That is all water under the bridge now and because the Government are apparently not able to control prices all of the concessions, even if they were reasonable at that time, are now completely eroded and might as well never have been given, particularly those granted to the social welfare classes such as old age pensioners, widows and people receiving children's allowances.</P>
    <P>For that reason I ask the Government to try to give us some kind of assurance that they know the answers to the dangerous problems with which we are faced at present.  As Senator Lenihan made clear last night, the two main parties enticed us into what is now accepted as the Common Market. There was a united front on this.  We in the Labour Party were the only people who fought, mainly through the magnificent campaign speeches of Deputy Keating, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, against entering the Common Market.  But we were overwhelmed, there was collaboration of radio, television, newspapers and so on and we were deluged and we were swept into the Common Market.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes maybe that is true but it is poor consolation now.  There <Col N="997" /> is one person who, unfortunately, is not present in this House, without any disrespect to the Parliamentary Secretary, to answer some of the questions that must be put about the Common Market and that, of course, is Deputy Garret FitzGerald, who acted as a one-man PRO for this whole enterprise and who swept us into the Common Market by the dint of his remarkable eloquence and misguided enthusiasm. In some ways I am sorry he will not be here to answer, as the months pass, for some of the cases he made&mdash;the price of food falling, the standard of living rising, <i>et cetera.</i>  In other ways, I am delighted that the Taoiseach sent Deputy FitzGerald into permanent orbit around Brussels, thank God, rather than Leinster House where he would, no doubt, continue to mislead us on economic matters were he to spend an undue amount of time here.</P>
      <P>We were told there was an answer to this prices question.  Deputy Keating frequently said it was inevitable that prices would rise because of the high cost of raw material, of high food costs, consequential high wages and salaries, the in-put into our industry and agriculture.  We were assured there was no problem and that it would not greatly discommode the people, that they would not suffer, that there would not be uncontrolled inflation because there was a ready answer to it.</P>
      <P>I should like to know what is the answer.  Were we right to enter the Common Market?  Denmark which was an enthusiastic proponent of the Common Market showed in a recent survey that 46 per cent of the population would like to get out if they had their way.  I am sorry about going back on these 14 points but I intend dealing with only two of them so that is not unfair.  This one immediately introduced strict price control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This document was prepared when the present Minister for Foreign Affairs believed he would be appointed Minister for Finance. There was to be strict price control. This was put out under the name of the Taoiseach and with the consent of the present Minister for Finance.  Was it a deliberate attempt to mislead the electorate or was it unintentional? <Col N="998" /> Were they misinformed?  If they allowed themselves to be misinformed, are they people who should be in charge of the economy of the country at the present time?  If they so misjudged the inevitable consequences of going into the Common Market, are they the right people now to be determining&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Please do not think I am taking sides in this.  I am outside both parties because I think both were mistaken.  Time will show that you were both mistaken.  I do not think that Fianna Fáil promised to introduce immediately strict price control.  From external and internal evidence it appears that we have made an appalling error of judgment in going into the Common Market. We are in the company&mdash;some would doubt whether it is good&mdash;of the British who are now finding much the same thing.  I expect that most people saw the headline in <i>The Sunday Times</i>&ldquo;Europe a Disaster for Britain say Top Civil Servants&rdquo;, a disaster for Britain.  There are many people here now who are beginning to believe that it is also a disaster for Ireland.  The adage that Britain's misfortune is Ireland's opportunity is no longer valid.  We are very much in the same sterling boat. If she goes&mdash;and it looks as if Heath will go&mdash;we are all in a very serious position, indeed, not because of the going of Heath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What action has the Taoiseach in mind between now and the next session of the Oireachtas to control prices?  In the light of our experience in the EEC, do they intend to again follow the advice given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Garrett FitzGerald, that we should <Col N="999" /> carry on with this proposal of an economic monetary union by 1980 in which all our currencies will be linked and in which there will be budgetary policies, greater integration of States and national economies, further erosion into our sovereignty, and when we will be under the complete control of non-elected bureaucrats in Brussels?  Nobody, of course, takes seriously the idea that there can be serious democracy in the Common Market.  They will not permit it.  We will find ourselves manipulated in the interests of the protection of the mark or the franc, the lira or some other currency if it suits the bureaucrats in Brussels quite irrespective of the interests of the unfortunate, tiny little island out here on the periphery with little or no power and little or no authority in the decisions taken.</P>
    <P>Recently we saw even the suggestion that we might have regional help under the regional policy scheme and the figure now mentioned is something like 3.9 per cent of £100 million over a three-year period which is, of course, peanuts in the present context of rapidly depreciating currency values.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could tell us in his reply what are the benefits from the EEC. Any farmer who thinks he is going to live in pleasant isolation in rural Ireland and not eventually feel the full effects of the economic hurricane which is going to strike the rest of us is living in a fools' paradise.  We are all affected by this.  Cattle prices will be affected because of the cost of feed. Everybody must know that you cannot live in isolation in an economy such as ours.  What is the answer?  Are we to continue with the proposal for the creation of an economic and monetary union with all its further dreadful implications?</P>
    <P>There is a possible way out for the Government and for their one-time spokesman on economic matters, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy FitzGerald, or, perhaps, the Taoiseach might deal with it.  While we got this undertaking here in the 14-point National Coalition programme immediately introducing strict price control <Col N="1000" /> we had a document in which, at the same time, an undertaking was given to certain leaders of business, to the public, to a number of members of the banking and industrial fraternity by Deputy Garret FitzGerald that there would only be price control for a limited period.  What is the position about that document?  Was such an undertaking given?  Was an undertaking of this kind given at the same time as the public were with complete and total cynicism told that the new Government would impose strict price control? Was that undertaking given by Deputy Garret FitzGerald with the authority of the Taoiseach?  If it was given by Deputy Garret FitzGerald, surely it is a most serious reflection on his integrity and credibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>You said the Government were composed of men of integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I am putting the question to the Taoiseach whether he would verify or not this document.  If he is unable to verify it, if he denies or contradicts this document, then what I said in the beginning is true.  I am looking for further information.  I may have been wrong when I said it was a Government of integrity.  It may not be. When the Taoiseach replies he will be able to clear up that point for us because it is then quite clear that this belief that prices could be controlled was not simply an act of blatant ignorance on the part of the then spokesman on financial matters, Deputy FitzGerald, but a very conscious and very deliberate attempt to mislead the public for the purposes of gaining office. For that reason it is a particularly contemptible behaviour pattern by people in democratic politics here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the imposition of strict price control, of course, there has been virtually no effective control of prices.  In political terms I have no doubts whatever but that this Government will not control the position and will eventually come to answer for its failure, probably on prices.  Of all the things that are likely to bring down this Government I think it is more than likely its failure on prices, not simply on prices but the implications <Col N="1001" /> of uncontrolled prices in any economy and particularly in an economy such as ours.  I would be sorry in some ways because, curiously enough, I believe if the Coalition goes out this time it will go out for ever.  I will not deal with that point now because it would be out of order for me to do so, but it is my belief that a certain kind of coaltion is a desirable alternative to one-party rule provided by the alternative party, Fianna Fáil, over the years.  I share Senator Lenihan's belief that a change of Government is desirable in what is called a democratic society.</P>
    <P>Just as sending Deputy Garret FitzGerald into permanent orbit around Brussels was a very clever idea by the Taoiseach, I consider the decision to send the unfortunate Deputy Keating into Industry and Commerce was a particularly clever idea, too.  As an old comrade of his&mdash; both, I hope, revolutionary socialists and Marxists&mdash;I feel very sad to see this pathetic person now attempting to do what he has told us, in his own clear-headed, precise, wonderfully argued, way with that Swiss-watch mind he has, that you cannot do: control prices.  To dump him in to carry out the impossible, to do the impossible&mdash;as I said somewhere, the political Canute of Irish public life&mdash;to indulge in all his prevarications and his &ldquo;I must stand back from that&rdquo;&ldquo;I must give this a little thought&rdquo;&ldquo;I must look into that&rdquo; but, inevitably, the Prices Advisory Body says: &ldquo;Up go the prices&rdquo;, and Deputy Keating is left holding the baby.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Senator to refer to Members of the Government by title, as is the custom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I shall do that with pleasure, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Up go the prices, as he told us the prices would go up.  I have considerable respect for the Taoiseach.  I have known him for many years.  I have regard for his integrity, too, if that is any help to him and to Senator FitzGerald. One cannot help feeling that he also saw his Deputy Keating, the the bus passenger, the train passenger, <Col N="1002" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce, coming and he has taken what steps he can to see that when he goes he will go for good.  That is sad from my point of view, because I dislike to see a good socialist being rendered completely powerless as I suspect the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be as a result of his spell in this particular Coalition.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Lenihan was correct about the implausibility of the proposal about food subsidies in a situation such as this, but I do not think it applies to fares.  I also share the astonishment of the general public at the recent decision by the Minister for Industry and Commerce not only to increase the various prices, which about a month prior to that he had fixed forever according to the headlines in the papers well disposed to him, but in relation to CIE fares increases.  He not only gave what was recommended but further increased the amount by which the fares could be increased. The purpose of this was to reduce the subvention or subsidy from the Government to CIE by making the consumer pay, by making the bus and train passengers pay.</P>
      <P>The ordinary person and the ordinary worker who uses public transport must pay.  There could not be a more typical member of the ordinary public than the person that uses public transport. He must pay rather than give a subsidy which could be taken from the wealthy person in the form of a really just taxation system.  No attempt has been made in the Finance Bill to give us any indication that there is a real concern for distributive justice implicit in the famous <i>Just Society</i> document, which we associate with Deputy Declan Costello, the Attorney General. Again that was another very clever decision by the Taoiseach, to send him down to the Law Library to preach social justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Just Society can only be achieved by effective redistribution of wealth, doing something to take some of the 75 per cent of the wealth owned by the wealthy 5 per cent and handing it across in the form of subsidies&mdash;for instance, in the case of the bus fares. This Government have chosen to take <Col N="1003" /> the simplest, gentlest, lowest income sector of the whole community and tell them they must pay for themselves. There is no attempt to reach into the pockets of the wealthy, of which we have many, to help pay for the increased bus fares, which are already particularly high.</P>
    <P>At the same time the Government continue the policy of Fianna Fáil, the particularly reprehensible policy of their predecessor Minister for Finance, whereby we find that all of the post tax profits, which went up as a result of tax remissions made by Deputy Colley when Minister for Finance, have further increased and no attempt has been made by the Government to deal with that.  This is a completely scandalous decision at a time when we are, apparently, according to all of these people when introducing their budgets, hard up, with money hard to find.  No attempt is being made to reach into the pockets of these people. I gave the figures recently in another debate&mdash;profits up by 53 per cent, 63 per cent, 30 per cent, 40 per cent of the various companies, industries and banks, all in one year.</P>
    <P>Prices all round are going up.  Fares, clothes, food, services up and up and up, apparently uncontrollably.  The only other thing going up as well is profits.  This is really where the Government are in trouble, because these increasing prices must be fed into the economy.  This is where I have always found myself in conflict with my fellow Senator trade union officials who did not seem to accept that, in a situation of this kind, where it appears that the worker is to be subjected to the exploitation of high prices because of the necessity to provide profits at an increasingly lower level of tax, the answer was simply to declare war on a Government of that kind and for the trade union men to declare war on a Government of that kind on behalf of their members.</P>
    <P>Let the Government defend the wealthy few if they wish to; that is their business.  Equally it is the business of the trade union official to defend the interests of the mass of the workers against the selfishness and <Col N="1004" /> greed of these people who continually demand more and more from our society at the expense and hardship imposed on ordinary people by badly-run industry, feather-bedded and protected by successive Governments. They are allowed to exploit a captive consumer unmercifully without any serious control.  The only person now between them and their exploitation is the trade union leader.  The politicians have all deferred their responsibility to the worker&mdash;all of them including my own party, I regret to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, all right.  If the Senator wants to make it appear like that, thank you for the compliment. It is quite shocking to see the attitude of Deputy Tully, the Minister for Local Government, to the building societies, the most inefficient enterprises in our society.  There are 14 or 15 of them all with rigged fixation of rates, a multiplicity of inefficient bureaucracies, not providing the service which they are allowed to do in our economy.  They are grossly more inefficient than the similar people in Britain, and God knows they are not efficient.</P>
      <P>Their advertising costs something in the region of half a million pounds&mdash; £360,000 or something like that, yet they pretend they are competing.  They are not competing at all.  It is a complete fraud, for which we pay.  Unfortunately, young people getting married have to pay exorbitant interest rates in our free economy.  But, piling insult on agony, the Minister for Local Government now reaches into the taxpayers pocket, into the pocket of the unfortunate bus and train passenger&mdash; ordinary workers&mdash;and pilfers his pocket in order to hand over to these building societies a subsidy to keep them afloat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened to private enterprise here?  I have heard about it for so long.  It does not want any Government interference, it is well able to manage its own affairs.  The profits are always extravagantly high in the building industry.  It is quite scandalous that people should make money out of providing <Col N="1005" /> housing for people.  It should be an exclusive Government enterprise. But when the building societies find that the profits are not quite what they want, then they turn whining to the Government and ask for help.  When the help is given, it is our money that is given.  Do we get it back when they make profits which they think are sufficient?  They get relief of tax on mortgages.  Then they get this further subvention from the Government, in this disgraceful decision by the Minister for Local Government.  Instead of taking the building societies into public ownership and nationalising them&mdash;as is, of course, Labour Party policy, although it is no good talking about that now&mdash;they are being helped to continue to plunder again part of the weakest section of the community, the most deserving section of the community: the young married couples trying to buy houses.</P>
    <P>Uncontrolled private enterprise, this is the policy running the whole way through this document, the Finance Bill.  The State should provide the finance for house building and eliminate the whole profit margin and profit motive from the building of houses.  I will not delay the House by giving the figures of the moneys paid to management, the cost of advertising, <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;12 per cent of the total income is paid to management in these enterprises.</P>
    <P>The Government will not be protected from the nemesis mentioned by Senator Lenihan.  His was a different one.  It appears in the form of the national wage agreement.  I do not care what the trade union officials try to do. No matter to what extent they are misled or to what extent they attempt to mislead the workers into accepting a national wage agreement, this kind of uncontrolled price spiralling fed into the economy would make nonsense of any wage agreement signed by anybody on behalf of the workers.  Although it is possible to get a national wage agreement, unless there are in-built provisions for a three-monthly review of wages, or even shorter, then I doubt if such an agreement could be held.</P>
    <P>Fortunately for the workers, the timing and the obvious uncontrolled <Col N="1006" /> nature of prices and the failure of the famous Keating stroke of a pen&mdash;&ldquo;Prices will now stop rising&rdquo;, which, of course, they did not&mdash;has been seen by the workers.  They know this when they cannot pay their train or bus fares, when they cannot pay for bread, butter, tea, sugar, clothes, services.  The worker knows they cannot deliver the goods.  I think the Government know that the trade union official will not find it too easy to deliver the goods either in a form of agreement on behalf of his members unless it is a particularly generous agreement&mdash;a 40 or 50 per cent increase over the last agreement.</P>
    <P>It is good enough for the banks, for the directors of the banks.  I read out Deputy Ryan's wonderful figure of 63 per cent.  Jim Larkin once said: &ldquo;Nothing is too good for the working classes&rdquo; when he was criticised for smoking a cigar or something.  If 63 per cent is good enough for the directors of the banks, it is good enough for the workers, or higher.  As Connolly said: &ldquo;We simply want the earth.&rdquo;  That is what they should work for.</P>
    <P>In passing, the Taoiseach referred to the fiscal policy in relation to mining, that it is being considered at the present time.  I should like him to tell us something about what has now become widely accepted as the great mine robbery in Ireland.  In 1969 we took £503,000 from the operation of the mines&mdash;not the fault of the present Government yet.  In 1970, £468,000 and in 1971, £219,000&mdash;a decreasing amount being taken from our mines. Most of the prospecting licences are held by outsiders, sometimes with a nominal Irish shareholder.  All but 22 out of 829 prospecting licences are held by foreign controlled companies. Would the Taoiseach please deal with this matter of the mines?</P>
    <P>I was touched by the recent burst of revolutionary Marxist-Leninist scientific socialism of the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he nationalised the Ardmore Film Studios.  Was the figure £300,000 or was it £30,000? He must have felt ten feet tall that day.  At last he had got something past them when they were not looking. Could I suggest to the Taoiseach that <Col N="1007" /> he applies his attention to the question of the mines?</P>
    <P>I am astonished, and in some ways not, I suppose, at the complete failure of our community who appear to fail to understand what has happened in the last ten or 15 years, and that is that the great case handed up to me over the years as to why we could not have anything&mdash;health, education, care of the aged, <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;is no longer true.  But nobody appears to know this is no longer true.  We are now per head of the population one of the really wealthy countries.  I do not know if you know Libya.  It was a strip of desert.  It is something like Libya, which had dreadful poverty and destitution and suddenly they found that they were sitting on an enormous oil-well and now they are one of the wealthiest countries in the Middle East, and that is saying something.  This has happened in Ireland and nobody seems to know, and what is worse, nobody except the people who own the mines seems to care.  Why is this so?</P>
    <P>The only hope I have is that the Government are intelligent people, that they like power and would like to stay where they are, and that they must know that they cannot control the economy, that it is out of control and that if they go out with an uncontrollable economy they will never come back.  This is a simple truth that all of us as politicians know: it is this avarice, this greed for power&mdash;it is perfectly reasonable, I am not complaining about it at all&mdash;that is my only hope.</P>
    <P>There is enormous wealth here in our mines.  Let me give a short list.  We now possess the largest zinc lead mines in the world, which is in Navan.  We have the largest underground zinc mine in Europe at Silvermines, the largest producing lead mine in Europe at Tynagh, the fifth largest mercury mine in the world and the most profitable mercury by-products mined at Gortdrum, one of the most important sources of magnesite in Europe and the most profitable barytes deposit in the world.</P>
    <P>This is the poor country&mdash;astronomical wealth is available to our people. We hear very little about the democratic <Col N="1008" /> programme that the land of Ireland belongs to the people of Ireland: this wealth does not belong to the people of Ireland.  It will not belong to the people of Ireland unless the Taoiseach does something about it. My only hope is that the position will be so bad for them that they will decide to nationalise these mines.  They can take them into public ownership. They can blame Marx or Lenin and their nasty socialism.  If they do not take them into public ownership they might decide that they will insist on royalties, what would be considered extravagant royalties by their predecessors because they, of course, handed over this wonderful wealth.  I saw on television that we had built a railway to cart the damned stuff out of the country for them.  Then we have Tynagh mines.  This is an enormous scandal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, but I shall not dwell on that point.  It is rather like the dreadful calamities during the war when Hiroshima or Hamburg were bombed: people just did not seem to be able to grasp the enormity of the tragedies of those times when 100,000 people were killed.  In this case we seem to have the same block.  Is it a genuine block or is it a deliberate block that this money is there and that the problems of health, education, care and old age and the wonderful amenities we want for our people are all at our disposal in our country in the most natural way in the world and that is in our natural mineral wealth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach did talk about the fiscal policy in relation to the mines.  If he will not take them into public ownership&mdash;and I suspect he will not&mdash;the question arises as to the royalties.  The 9 per cent royalties and 20 years tax free concession by Deputy Charles Haughey when in office, was quite scandalous.  I have heard of 60:40, 40 <Col N="1009" /> for the people and 60 going to the mining companies.  Would the Taoiseach consider, in his final decision on this matter, increasing the ratio to the very maximum of 95 per cent?  There is a precedent for this in an oil find in Florida.  Would this help Senators to understand the enormity of the wealth that is there?  Even if the company are only given 5 per cent of the takings in, say, Navan they still make an enormous amount of money.  They would gladly take it for that if they are forced to take it for that.</P>
    <P>Having solved the Government's financial problems for them, I would seriously ask the Taoiseach to call a halt to the great mine robbery and on our behalf and on behalf of the people to have the courage&mdash;because courage is needed naturally&mdash;to change in a radical way&mdash;certainly it would be radical for him&mdash;to turn away from the very wealthy, the people who already have so much and turn his own attention and that of his Government to the great problems of the unfortunate ordinary public in the very frightening financial economic position that they all face, in the months ahead &mdash;not even the years ahead&mdash;unless serious steps are taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>I had intended to deal with the problem of the declaration of the housing emergency and the absurdity of the suggestion that by increasing your housing output from 23,500 to 25,000 &mdash;and I think that was Deputy Molloy's figure&mdash;we would solve the problem.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and his Government do not appear to have the capacity to deal with the problem which originates in many cases outside their control.  At the same time, the Taoiseach and most of the Fine Gael Ministers at any rate, as did the Opposition, told us that we could safely go into the Common Market.  We were told that we could go into the Common Market and prosper. The Taoiseach owes it to the very frightened community now, before the Seanad adjourns for the summer recess, to reassure them that they really know how they are going to control the economy in the months ahead.</P>

      <P>This Finance Bill now <Col N="1010" /> under discussion is a very elaborate and complicated Bill.  It must be the longest Finance Bill that we have ever had before us with its 98 sections and 11 schedules.  Yet, in spite of this complexity and, certainly, the complexity of some of the sections, which baffle my imagination at any rate, it does in many ways fail to meet the real needs of the country.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his introductory speech listed three main national problems with which the budget intended to deal.  Two of these are the very directly related problems of unemployment and the rise in gross national product and national income.  The two go together.  This budget, particularly with respect to the capital programme which the Government had the wisdom to take over unchanged from the previous Government, should do something to help in these respects.  The budget, in other ways, may reduce the possibility of increasing the cost-of-living and increasing the number at work.  Other aspects of the budget may counteract some of the good which has been done.</P>
      <P>The greatest single failure in the budget is the third aim mentioned by the Taoiseach, the problem of inflation. He mentions this as a problem which needs to be dealt with but that is the last reference to it.  That is not surprising because this is, in most respects, a completely inflationary budget.  A large number of its provisions would seem to have been almost guaranteed, almost intended, to increase the dangers of inflation in our conditions.</P>
      <P>However, there are matters which one can welcome, in particular, the social welfare charges.  We all welcome these and are happy that it has been possible in 1973 to carry these out. They should do a great deal to help the poorer sections of the population.  I suppose it is hardly necessary to mention again&mdash;it has been mentioned very often both in the other House and here&mdash;that these social welfare improvements were first mentioned to the public well over a year ago during the referendum campaign before our entry into the European Economic Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is amusing to listen to Senators <Col N="1011" /> opposite, Members of the Labour Party, welcoming these welfare changes when one considers that over a period of months many of them, perhaps all of them, were urging the people of Ireland not to join the EEC.  It is directly as a result of our entry into the EEC that these changes have become possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in introducing the budget in the Dáil appreciated, as a good politician, that he was faced with the problem that it is not very easy to claim these considerable social welfare improvements as an achievement of his own, or of this present Coalition Government, in view of the fact that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, over a year ago, had pointed out to the electorate in the referendum campaign that these benefits would be available on our entry into the EEC. The Minister sought to avoid this problem by saying in his budget speech, as he put it in his colourful way, that the so-called EEC savings had been sunk without trace in a sea of inflation.  Later on, in the debate in the Dáil on 13th June, column 405 of the Official Report, he produced the colourful information that &ldquo;the Fianna Fáil Party had made off with £29 million, misapplied and misspent, before this Government took office&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One has visions of a great train robbery on a gigantic scale.  Of course, the trouble with the Minister for Finance's off-the-cuff pronouncements of this kind is that they do not always tally with what he has, and reads out, from his Civil Service brief.  We had this £29 million which Fianna Fáil misapplied, misspent and made off with before there ever was an election.  Yet we find in his budget speech, at column 1244 of the official Report, having listed the various savings on the agricultural estimates as a result of our entry into the EEC, he said:</P>
    <P>In sum, taking account of the items I have mentioned, the net Exchequer gain on the current budget in 1973-74 from EEC membership is estimated to be of the order of £29 million.</P>
    <P>This £29 million, which had been misapplied <Col N="1012" /> and misspent by Fianna Fáil, reappears in his official brief which he read out in the course of his budget statement.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, we certainly welcome the appearance in the budget of these social welfare changes as we also welcome the rather limited reliefs in death duties, reliefs which were considerably lessened in their usefulness by the unwise decision to double the succession and legacy duties.  There are also in the budget a number of changes, mostly very minor, in tax law.  I have already mentioned some of these sections of a quite incredible complexity.</P>
    <P>Amidst all of this verbiage in this very long Bill, there are, alas, only minor improvements in income tax allowances, and no change at all in basic rates.  Most of the remainder of the Bill lists, section after section, and part after part, at unprecedented length, increased taxes.  We had the increased taxes on VAT which I will deal with later, bringing in £5 million extra to the Government in a full year; taxes on alcohol, tobacco and on almost everything relating to motor cars.  These taxes relate, not merely to cars but to driving licences, and a new tax is to be levied the first time a car is taxed.  There are also increased fees for driving tests.</P>
    <P>We had very stiff increases, not in the budget but as part of the budgetary programme, in post office and telephone charges.  In the last couple of days, as a sort of supplementary budget for the benefit of the Irish public, we had this extraordinary business of the CIE rises.  As Senator Browne has already pointed out, we had the extraordinary situation of the Government, instead of as one would expect, accepting the recommendations of the National Prices Commission or even cutting down on the rises allowed by them, rejecting them in order to instruct CIE to impose higher increases on the Irish public than the Commission had seen fit to recommend.</P>
    <P>The greatest single flaw in the budget is that it does nothing whatever to deal with inflation.  The Minister, in his budget speech, gave this as one of the main aims of the budget.  The Taoiseach has referred to inflation as <Col N="1013" /> a problem which must be dealt with, and yet the budget does nothing to deal with it and in many ways adds greatly to the inflation danger in the coming 12 months.</P>
    <P>It is a difficult task for us in Ireland to deal with inflation.  For one thing, as a very open society and open economy, no Government can do anything to deal with increased prices of goods imported from abroad.  We must balance, in our economic circumstances, the drive for more jobs and for economic expansion generally.  We must keep a delicate balance between this need and the danger of increasing inflation still further.</P>
    <P>The budget increase in capital spending succeeds in preserving this balance. Quite obviously, the increase in spending on a wide variety of capital schemes is calculated to increase inflation.  It puts more money into circulation and will obviously increase imports and put pressures on prices.  The Government were justified in preserving the capital programme which they inherited because the inflationary effects of this programme, and there will be inflationary effects, would seem to be justified by the extra jobs and incomes which will be provided.</P>
    <P>The planned deficit of £40 million in this budget is another matter.  What will be the effect of this decision by the Government to unbalance the budget to the enormous extent of £40 million in this year?  The first obvious effect one can think of is that it will cost about £4 million each year for many years to come simply to service the debt we are incurring as a result of this budget, incurring not in order to build houses, or hospitals, or roads, or public facilities of any kind, but to balance the budget by borrowing £40 million.  This £4 million if used in another way could have done a great deal to improve still further the position of the old age pensioner or other social welfare classes.</P>
    <P>More important than the actual cost of servicing the debt, which will not end this year but will continue for years to come as a result of the deficit for 1973-74, will be the increase in the <Col N="1014" /> Government's already considerable financial problems.  In this budget the Government have rightly increased very much spending on the capital programme. Finding the money for this will be difficult.  It can be obtained to a limited extent from the banks or through public loans, but it seems probable that a considerable amount will have to be borrowed abroad.  This is by far the most expensive way in which one can borrow since there is no consequential gain to the Government, as there is if they borrow at home, from income tax on the interest.  It will add greatly to the Government's problems in borrowing money this year and will also add to the banks' problems in providing the finance.</P>
    <P>We already have the situation where the banks during the past few months have been cutting down in every possible way on credit.  We have a considerable credit squeeze on the way and in this respect I do wish our banking system could order their business in a more coherent way.  We had a sitution up to last February when, apparently under instructions from the Central Bank, bank managers were writing to their customers asking if they would like more money.  Quite suddenly there is a shift of gear and everything goes into reverse; bank managers say they have no money even for obviously useful productive purposes.  They say the amounts they can produce are very limited and they insist clients pay back overdrafts, <i>et cetera.</i>  It appears likely that, as a result of the problems which will exist in financing the State programme under this budget, the amount of finance available to the public will be even less than it has been during the past few months and this deficit will quite unnecessarily complicate that problem still further.</P>
    <P>A planned deficit on an annual budget is not necessarily a bad thing.  There are clearly circumstances in which such a deficit can be useful.  Last year, when a much smaller deficit was decided upon by the former Government, the circumstances were such that it was a wise move.  There was a big need for increased employment to increase the rate of expansion of incomes.  This year <Col N="1015" /> the necessity is somewhat less.  Real incomes are likely to increase considerably more this year and unemployment is falling; while the situation is obviously by no means satisfactory, it is improving and, therefore, the need for a deficit is less than it was last year. Whatever about the rights and wrongs of a planned deficit in the budget&mdash;and there are certain circumstances when it can be useful&mdash;there is no excuse at all for a Government unbalancing their budget for purely political reasons.</P>
    <P>One gets a strong impression that in this budget there was no question of deciding upon a £40 million deficit for any genuine economic reason.  One feels that, when the Government had assembled the various things they felt had to be done arising out of election promises&mdash;election promises which in many respects were very unwise&mdash; counted the cost of these, and collected together all the innumerable forms of new taxation listed in this budget and totted all the figures, they discovered they were £40 million short, so they decided upon a planned deficit.  There is no excuse in any circumstances for running a deficit for political reasons. All Governments wish to be able to give benefits but, at the same time, are afraid to impose taxation needed to pay for them.</P>
    <P>One also gets the impression from some of the remarks of Ministers during recent weeks that they hope the deficit will end up at less than £40 million. They appear to be relying, or counting, on a continued and perhaps an increasing rate of inflation which automatically will cut down this deficit. They could be right in that as, apart from the other inflationary aspects of the budget, the deficit will certainly contribute to increased inflation.</P>
    <P>The most inflationary single aspect of the budget clearly is the changes made in VAT.  These were totally misconceived and were the result of reckless and extremely foolish election promises.  Inflation is the most serious single economic problem we have to face.  It is not simply that prices are rising at the rate of around 12 per cent each year because, to some extent, people can be cushioned against <Col N="1016" /> that; social welfare classes can have their social welfare payments increased as, indeed, they have been. The workers will ensure that in the next wage round their wages are increased sufficiently to cover the increased cost of living.  Farmers will be able to keep abreast, but there are those who are retired or living on fixed incomes who cannot catch up on inflation.  The greatest single danger in the present situation is that, once you get to a certain point, it becomes almost impossible to reverse the course of inflation; it has now reached the unprecedented rate of 12 per cent a year and the entire economic progress of the country, on which so much is being spent and into which so much effort is being put, may be endangered if we do not do something about the inflationary situation.</P>
    <P>That is why these changes in VAT have been so unwise.  The taking of VAT off food was an election promise by the Coalition Government which in itself was tied in with the promise referred to by Senator Browne and other Senators that prices would be stabilised, with the hint that they might fall.  Time will tell whether food prices will fall in September when the VAT of 5.26 per cent is taken off food. Whether they fall or not it will be very, very difficult to police all the thousands upon thousands of shops throughout the country to make sure that, here and there, there are not ill-disposed shopkeepers who may not give the 5 per cent, or who may give only part of the 5 per cent back to the public. Whatever about that, it is more than likely that continuing inflation will in the end leave the public paying just as much as before.</P>
    <P>Between February and May this year food prices, according to official figures, rose by 5.2 per cent.  In three months they rose by more than the notional 5 per cent by which it is hoped they may fall as a result of the VAT changes in September.  One thing is certain: whether or not food prices fall in September, all other prices will rise.  It is very doubtful if the rises can be kept down to the amounts of increased VAT.  The whole situation may <Col N="1017" /> cause something in the nature of a price explosion.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has promised that he will have inspectors out to see that the 5 per cent fall in food prices takes place, but the problem is not a matter of merely checking food prices.  Prices of every single commodity in every single shop and supermarket in the country will have to be policed because, on the one hand, you have to see that the price of food comes down and, on the other hand, that the price of everything else does not go up by more than the increased level of VAT.  It seems to be an utterly impossible task and I cannot conceive how, where you have increases of a penny or twopence on a pound here and a pound there on all these commodities, they can possibly be controlled.  The whole exercise is an almost guaranteed way of increasing the trend of inflation.</P>
    <P>This promise to take VAT off food was misconceived in many ways.  It was misconceived, as I have mentioned, because of the impossibility of ensuring that it will work out in the way its sponsors might hope.  It was misconceived also because, while food is essential and you cannot live without eating, it is obvious that no household lives only on food.  There is a very large number of other commodities which are also essential such as shoes, clothing, food and light, and all the hundred and one items that any household has to buy in any week.  You would think in talking about food as a vital necessity that we were talking about some kind of survival kit that one might need if one were stranded on a South Sea island.  We are not talking about a starving man in the middle of a desert.  We are talking about ordinary Irish households.  We are talking about the things that the ordinary man and woman in the street buy each day and each week for themselves and for their families.</P>
    <P>There are certain types of households who spend a particularly high proportion of their incomes on food. There are people on social welfare, there are people with very large families, who have to spend the greater <Col N="1018" /> part of their income on foodstuffs. but one would have thought that the sensible way to approach this would be for the Government to cushion these classes against increases in the cost of food.  Instead of trying to achieve this result, a result which might save a person on social welfare perhaps 40p a week in lower food prices, in this extraordinarily complicated way which is affecting the prices up or down&mdash;and more often up than down &mdash;of every single commodity, one would have thought that it would have been much easier and more sensible to cushion those who have to spend a high proportion of their incomes on food against rising prices.</P>
    <P>While at the lowest rate of VAT many items are just as essential as food, such as, shoes, clothing, fuel and electricity, some of the so-called less essential items which are taxed now at 19.5 per cent are really just as vital and necessary as any others.  What household can live without furniture, furnishings, cleaning materials, electrical equipment, hardware, holiday and sporting equipment?  These are the kind of items ordinary people buy that are no longer in the luxury class.  Even the so-called luxury goods are now charged at 36.75 per cent.  What are these luxury goods?  Basically, they are radios, television sets and motor cars.</P>
    <P>I wonder if there is a household in the country that has not got a radio.  I think it is very unlikely.  Yet we are told this is a luxury with the implication that only the very wealthy buy one.  I do not know what proportion of households has not got a television set, but I know that we now provide free television licences for old age pensioners. They are not the very wealthy but they will have to pay 36.75 per cent on any television set they buy.  Can it be said that motor cars are a nonessential item which only the very wealthy own?  It seems to me that, both in town and country, a very high proportion of people who are by no means wealthy have to buy a motor car and they will now have to pay 36.75 per cent.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister for Finance, as reported at column 1261 of the Official Report, said in relation <Col N="1019" /> to these changes in VAT at the three different rates:</P>
    <P>It has been decided to keep the increase as low as possible on the rate applicable to basic commodities and to increase to a greater extent the rates on other, less essential, items.</P>
    <P>That sounds all right as a policy, but it is precisely what he has not done. The lowest rate, which was 5.26 per cent on the supposedly more basic commodities, has been increased to 6.75 per cent, an increase of 28.3 per cent.  In other words, for every £100 that the Government take in in tax on these commodities, the increase will be 28.3 per cent.  Taking the middle group, who are less basic according to the Minister but not in the so-called luxury class, the rates go up from 16.37 per cent to 19.5 per cent.  That is a fraction under 20 per cent of an increase. Then the so-called luxury items, such as radio sets and televisions, go up from 30.26 per cent to 36.75 per cent, a rise of 21.4 per cent.  In other words, the tax rise imposed by the Government is considerably higher on the basic more essential items than it is on the less basic more luxury items.  The reason for this is clear because, since for more money is spent on these basic items than on the more luxury items, there is more money to be got in taxes out of them.</P>
    <P>However, it is the exact opposite of what the Minister said he was doing. We now find the situation where the tax is being taken off food&mdash;prices may or may not go down but one hopes they will&mdash;but on the other items, which are for practical purposes just as essential as food to the ordinary household, a much higher increase in tax has been imposed than has been imposed on any of the others.</P>
    <P>The total net effect of the changes in VAT is that the Government in a full year will get £5 million extra from consumers.  In spite of the fact that that £5 million extra each year is to come from consumers on foot of VAT, the Minister has been able to claim&mdash;and no doubt as far as statistics go he is correct&mdash;that this will <Col N="1020" /> have the interesting result of a ½ per cent fall in the cost of living index.  One wonders how that could be.  It would seem to show quite clearly that the whole basis of the index is out of date.  Since the index was originally prepared some ten years ago living standards have risen so much that items which were then counted as luxuries&mdash;such as motor cars&mdash;and which therefore were weighted very low in the cost of living index scales have now become a much higher proportion of household expenditure.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, if the Minister wishes to claim a technical fall of ½ per cent in the cost of living, he is welcome to it.  The net result is that the Irish consumers are to pay £5 million extra a year.  That is what really worries them more than the actual figure of the cost of living index. Even if it were to cause a ½ per cent fall in the cost of living, it seems ridiculous to cause so much difficulty and confusion, to create so many inflationary dangers for the entire community, for the sake of such an unimportant change.  Except for food, the prices of everything in the country will be increased next September. Problems are being created quite unnecessarily for the trading community in having four rates of VAT where formerly there were only three.  VAT is a complicated enough tax as it is but it is being made still more complicated, and unnecessarily so, by these changes.</P>
    <P>There is a further problem created by this very unwise decision to take VAT off food.  That is in our relations with the EEC.  In regard to VAT, it is absolutely vital that there should be some degree of harmonisation in the nine countries of the EEC.  Harmonisation is a great &ldquo;in&rdquo; word in community circles.  One sometimes feels that the members of the Commission of the EEC must stay awake at nights wondering what next they can harmonise. One feels that some of their harmonisation proposals are a case of conformity gone mad, that they go to enormous lengths to produce documents of extraordinary complexity, create great problems for economic <Col N="1021" /> interests in the various countries, simply in order to have a situation in which they can say: &ldquo;Isn't this grand now, motor car windscreens or designs for mopeds&rdquo;&mdash;whatever it happens to be&mdash;&ldquo;are the same now in the nine countries.  That is another piece of harmonisation done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The harmonisation of VAT is really, genuinely, an important and obviously vital thing to bring about.  The whole concept of the Common Market as such is that you could start at one end of the Common Market and travel with goods through all the various national boundaries without having to be stopped by customs officials or fill up complicated documents and go through all the complicated ramifications which international trade so often requires.  It is obvious that so long as you have these very big inequalities, or indeed any inequalities at all, between the rates of VAT and the methods of levying VAT in the different countries, it will still be necessary to maintain fleets of customs officials at the borders. I think I am correct in saying that since the EEC was formed instead of decreasing, the number of customs officials has increased.  While there have been, in various ways, simplifications in the process of, say, bringing a lorry load of goods from France into Holland, at the same time because of these different rates of VAT there are still very great complications and there will remain very great complications until some degree of harmonisation has been carried out.</P>
    <P>It should therefore be the aim of the Government, bearing in mind that ultimately we do not know when&mdash;it may be quite soon or it may not be for a bit longer&mdash;we will have to align our VAT rates with those of the other eight countries of the EEC.  One would have thought that the Government would endeavour to see that whatever changes they made in VAT they did not, at any rate, bring us still further away from our continental colleagues. This is precisely what they have done.</P>
    <P>The prevailing view in the original six countries of the EEC was that VAT should be an all-embracing tax, that it should include everything including food.  The only two countries with <Col N="1022" /> zero rate food are now Britain and Ireland.  We were both, a month or so ago, given a special but purely temporary permission to do this provided it was done before 1st January next, which of course is being done here.  It was a temporary permission as the Minister admitted in his budget speech.  At column 1262, Volume 265 of the Official Report, he said:</P>
    <P>In joining the EEC we took upon ourselves certain commitments regarding the harmonisation of value-added taxes in the Community.  As yet, however, the degree of harmonisation achieved by the EEC is not such as to preclude substantial differences in the rates and structure of VAT applied in the member states, and accordingly, in making the changes just announced, we are not in conflict with present Community legislation.</P>
    <P>The pace and degree of the movement towards a Community-wide unification of the structure of the tax and, later still, towards a narrowing of the differences between the various national rates of tax are matters for discussion and agreement between the member States.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in other words, admits that we are not in conflict with present Community legislation, there being a clear implication that we could be in conflict with future legislation. There is a kind of what could be described as a hope expressed at the end of that quotation that since, after all, these are matters for agreement between the various countries we could always refuse to change.  I suppose we could have our power of veto if it came to the crunch.  I think we would be extremely unwise to exercise such power on a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>We have all these extraordinary complications and dangers brought in by this decision to zero rate food without any real prospect that we will be able to maintain this situation for more than a relatively few years.</P>
    <P>There is a further problem again related to the EEC.  As I understand it, from the year 1975 on we will be expected, along with all the other countries of the EEC, to pay a maximum <Col N="1023" /> of 1 per cent of VAT to the funds of the EEC.  This is not 1 per cent of the actual money raised on VAT.  It is a complicated calculation which is to be on the whole tax base. We have this situation that something like £16 million a year of VAT is being taken off food.  We would still be liable to pay 1 per cent of the retail price of all foods to the EEC.  Therefore, something like £4 million a year will be liable to be paid by us to the EEC on food which we will not be taxing.  This will be a further imposition on the Irish taxpayer.  There will be a curious situation.  Food is zero rated and still we will have to pay 1 per cent to the EEC.  I think I am correct in saying that that will be the position.</P>
    <P>The VAT election promise was a foolish one, but at least it was one which was possible to carry out.  It will cause terrible complications, further inflation, a great deal of dissatisfaction among consumers, but technically it can be done, as we are doing it in this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The promise on death duties made by the National Coalition during the election campaign was even more foolish because anyone with any sense could have told them at the time that it was impossible to carry it out in the form outlined.  The Coalition made use of the traditional fear of Irish farmers of losing their land.  We know that because of our history the Irish farmer, more so than farmers elsewhere in the world, have a horror of losing the family holding.  The impact of death duties on Irish farms because of the recent very rapid rises in prices of land was far greater than the actual figures would have suggested.  Every time a farmer died and the word went round the neighbourhood that the sons and daughters had to pay from £4,000 to £10,000 in death duties and there was a danger that the holding would have to be sold in order to pay this, a wave of horror went through the farming community.  The Coalition, in what can only be described as an unscrupulous manner, took advantage of this natural fear based on the history of the Land War and all the other events which took place in rural Ireland during the <Col N="1024" /> past century or so.  We need have very little doubt that it was an ineffective promise.  We have a statement by the President of the Irish Farmers' Association in relation to death duties which was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of July 23rd and I quote:</P>
    <P>.... This was, and still is, a burning issue, especially among the farming community.  No topic has been so tested in recent times as has the removal of estate duty.  Thousands and thousands of people attended meetings all over the country specially arranged to discuss this subject.</P>
    <P>With regard to the promise of the Coalition he says:</P>
    <P>These commitments, solemly given by the Coalition parties before the (General) Election, clearly influenced the outcome of same.</P>
    <P>Having given this promise and having gained, possibly, decisive votes as a result of it, when they got into office and investigated the situation they realised what they should have realised long before: that the promise was simply impossible to carry out in the form outlined.</P>
    <P>In this budget there are some reliefs &mdash;and they are welcome&mdash;in estate duties, but reliefs which do not go very far beyond merely levelling off the natural increase in land prices as a result of the very large increases in values of farmland in recent years. These reliefs will have a temporary affect.  At the same time&mdash;and this certainly was not promised in their election campaign&mdash;they have doubled legacy and succession duties.  In the election they specifically referred to death duties on property passed to a widow or to children, but nonetheless general impression was given&mdash;not many people, unfortunately, at elections read the small print&mdash;that all death duties were to be abolished. About 30 per cent of all farms are in the hands of widows who have no children or of people who are unmarried. These farms tend to be handed on to brothers, cousins or to other remote members of the family and these will be affected by legacy or succession duty or maybe both.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> In spite of the reliefs given this year in estate duties&mdash;the Minister has put about the suggestion that these are of fundamental importance, that they are the greatest increases ever given&mdash;we find that there is something like £13 million taken in a full year in the various forms of death duty.  The total saving to the taxpayer will be in the regions of £750,000 or about 6 per cent.  With inflation running the way it is and in particular with land prices increasing at the rate they are, if a notional saving is only 6 per cent it is quite clear that the value of the property concerned will rise by far more than 6 per cent in the next year and that, therefore, the Government will end up at the end of this year's financial year with more money rather than with less.</P>
    <P>The question of income tax was a very great disappointment to the public as a whole.  There have been no changes in income tax allowances except for a very minor concession in relation to working wives.  There was a time when the general impression was that only the better off members of the community were affected by income tax, but two influences have now created the situation that everyone is affected by income tax.  First, with the increase in incomes people are better off and, therefore, many more people are in the income tax bracket than ever were before; and, secondly, because the allowances to taxpayers have gone nowhere near increasing over the years to keep pace with the fall in the value of money. Therefore, on both these counts everyone is being brought into the net. Mr. Donal Nevin, spokesman for the ICTU, on the day after the budget expressed grave dissatisfaction that there was no improvement in income tax allowances for wage and salary earners other than for the working wife.</P>
    <P>I was rather startled to hear Senator Moynihan yesterday attacking Fianna Fáil rather violently for, as he put it, in 16 years never doing anything to increase income tax allowances.  I have already mentioned that all Governments, including Fianna Fáil, have been responsible for the situation that <Col N="1026" /> over the years these allowances have not in any way kept pace with inflation. Nonetheless, it is fair to point out that last year there were very considerable improvements in income tax allowances.  It was by far the greatest single easement of the income tax burden that has ever been put through. The allowance for single people was increased by £50 to £299, for widows by £50 to £324 for a married couple by £70 to £494 and there was a general increase of some £20 in child allowances at a total cost of £11 million. This was a very considerable improvement, and it may be that the memory of this is one of the reasons why there has been so much general disappointment over the complete absence for practical purposes of any changes in the income tax rates this year.</P>
    <P>There is the budget concession to working wives, which the Minister for Finance says now means that the relief for a married couple is the same as two single people.  This is only so where the joint income is less than £2,000. Once you pass £2,000 with a joint income for husband and wife, where the wife is working the wife or the household loses out.  It is simply not correct to say that the situation of a married couple and two single people can be equalised.  Nothing at all has been done for the wife does not go out to work, and, after all, this is by far the normal situation in Irish conditions, and you still have the situation that income tax allowances for a married couple are less than those for two single people.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters which one could raise on the various sections of the Bill, but I will conclude by expressing pleasure particularly as regards the improvements in social welfare in the Bill, support for the considerable increase in capital spending, and regret at many of the other items this Bill contains.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>The few remarks I wish to make will pertain to the Bill as its affects the agricultural sector of our economy.  In doing so, I should first like to say that Senator Browne this morning castigated both the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fine Gael Party <Col N="1027" /> for their efforts to take this country into the Common Market last year.  I am one of the people who worked hard at that time to endeavour to ensure that this country would become part and parcel of the European Economic Community.  I have no regrets for doing so.  I represent here the agricultural community.  I am a member of the agricultural panel.  My interests are mainly centred on agriculture and, of course, on those who work in agriculture and who derive their livelihood from food industries based on agriculture. Whatever may be said now against the Common Market, we must remember that there are 240,000 farm families in this country.  Big and small farms are benefiting very substantially from the price rises which agricultural produce has got since it came into the Common Market.  There are also many thousands of people working in our food industries up and down the country, in our creameries, in our sugar factories, in our meat processing factories, <i>et cetera.</i>  In that context I should like to say it is my belief that we must have many more industries of this nature based on agricultural produce to take up the slack in the employment which we have in the economy.  The ideal situation so far as I am concerned would be that every ounce of product which is produced on our farms would be put through our food factories and processed by Irish workers and sold packaged on whatever market can be obtained.  It should all be done by our own workers in our own factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment a very considerable number of our cattle are exported on the hoof.  That obtains because the meat factories are unable to compete adequately for cattle in the market place.  This situation can be righted and will be righted as time goes on. The Government of the day ought to promote in so far as it is possible for them this aspect of our economy to the greatest extent possible, because I see in it a great future not alone for our workers but also for our farmers. I feel that if we do this we will at least be on the right road.  I should like to remind Senators who spoke yesterday and this morning in the course of the <Col N="1028" /> debate that as a result of our entry into the European Economic Community the Government found that they had £30 million to spare from food subsidies which could be transferred by this Bill into social services, social welfare and children's allowances. When the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael people went out in 1972 to ask the people to vote for our entry into Europe this was one of the things which we told the people would happen, that this £30 million in farm subsidies would become available for transfer into social services, social welfare and children's allowances. Any Government in office at this time, whether Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, were committed to that promise which was made in May, 1972.  If this amount of money was not available and if the Minister for Finance endeavoured to give the same hand-outs in this Bill as he has given to the social services and children's allowances the Bill would probably be a very penal document.  It is penal enough as it stands, but without that £30 million which we have saved by our entry into Europe we could not possibly give these extra allowances without grave penalties on many of those who pay our taxes.  Senator Higgins mentioned yesterday that this was a social distress document.  I believe that it has made an impact on this social distress as it existed in so far as this £30 million was available to the economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few remarks on death duties and the problems created by them for farmers in particular and for property owners too. They are brought about by the increased value of land and property. This Bill has given certain reliefs.  In part 3 of the Bill, sections 52 to 60, the reliefs are spelled out and they go at least some way to relieving the hardships which are brought about by death duties.  However, the reliefs as they are spelled out are a long way from the promises which were made by the National Coalition when they went on the hustings last February.  These promises to knock out death duties completely won a considerable amount of support, in my belief, for the National Coalition parties.  This support <Col N="1029" /> naturally came from the better-off farming areas, from the areas where farms are better than average in size and in the south, east and midlands of the country, in particular.</P>
    <P>The reliefs that have been given in death duties are not enough.  There are still many hardships imposed on people as a result of death duties, I have no sympathy for the old farmer who holds on to his land and refuses to transfer it to his family.  I have sympathy, however, for the family who are left with and mulcted by the death duty clauses in this Bill as a result of that old man's passing.  We have many farms of over 80 acres in the south-east and midlands. If the owner of one of these farms dies and a widow is left, her tragedy is compounded by the fact that heavy death duties often ensue.  There is an urgent need to proceed further with the alleviation of these problems than is done in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are three categories who are affected by such a man's death.  The third category, the children, are the worst off if both parents die about the same time.  The pressures on a family in those circumstances are very heavy. If a husband dies, his widow has a fairly substantial amount of relief to get.  If the husband and wife die about the same time, the eldest child does not get any relief.  He is treated only as a child.  Such a child should receive the same benefits as his mother if she had survived.  This would alleviate to some extent the death duties on a farm.</P>
    <P>Land will not get any cheaper.  Property will not get any cheaper.  Land has gone way beyond its value in the context of profits which can be earned from it.  If land was valued at approximately the profit margins which can be derived from it we would be making some headway.  Land at present is making up to £900 an acre.  This, in terms of bank interest, runs up to £90 per acre per annum if one has to borrow money to buy it.  In this context there is no possibility of making that kind of money from land.  If the value of the land was related to its earning capacity for purposes of death duties we would make some progress.</P>
    <P>The motor industry was mentioned. This industry has been heavily penalised <Col N="1030" /> in practically every aspect of its operations.  The price of cars will go up.  Driving licences have been increased. Road tax has been increased by 10 per cent.  Petrol, accessories and parts have all been increased.  The motor industry is a large employer of labour, at local level in the service stations and garages and also at assembly level.  If these penalties are repeated on the motor industry for another year or so, the motor car could become something of a curiosity.  We have an ever-increasing number of people commuting to work every day from the rural areas into the local towns and cities.  The car is an essential part of their job.  These men are getting no relief in income tax to run their cars.  They are being mulcted under many of the sections of this Bill rather than getting relief.</P>
    <P>In Part V, section 88 of the Bill, oral medicine for animal use has been mentioned as having a zero rating.  It provides that medicine which does not qualify for the zero rate, oral medicine other than pet medicine is chargeable at the zero rate, and is not pet medicine chargeable at the 19.50 per cent rate, should be chargeable at the lower rate of 6.75 per cent.</P>
    <P>That means that if a farmer or a veterinarian goes to a chemist to buy animal medicine for oral use he is charged a zero rating.  If he buys that same medicine for intra-muscular use he is charged the 6.75 per cent rating. My interpretation might not be correct but I do not think I am far wrong.  If this is the situation, it is necessary to re-examine this section to see if the matter could be remedied.  It seems an extraordinary situation that if a particular drug is applied orally, it stands at a zero rating, whereas if it is applied intra-muscularly VAT is charged at the rate of 6.75 per cent.</P>
    <P>I want to make some reference to income tax.  Senator Yeats dealt fairly extensively with income tax as it affects the ordinary individual.  I have little comment to make on that aspect except that personal allowances are not being increased.  This facet of previous Finance Bills was always criticised by the present Government when they were in Opposition.  This <Col N="1031" /> was done in spite of the fact that last year and two years previous to that, as Senator Yeats pointed out, there were substantial reliefs.  The only relief we have this year is in section 2 which increases the wife's earned income relief from £74 to £104.  The middle-income group are carrying the heaviest burden in regard to income tax.  When I refer to the middle-income group, I am referring to people who are working in the food factories in my own constituency.  These people who work overtime, do shift work and many of them take home pay packets of £40 to £45 per week.  They will be heavily penalised by the fact that they have got no extra income tax allowance under this Bill.  Many of these people have young families to educate.  They are endeavouring to add little by little to whatever chattels and goods they have.  Many of them are trying to buy their homes.  They are carrying the economy of the country on their backs. They are the sector which keep our factories and offices in production. They are penalised under many sections of this Bill.  They have got very little relief.</P>
    <P>There are many demands to bring farmers into the income tax net. Farmers as a body do not want to opt out of paying their taxes.  It must be remembered that agriculture is only now coming out of a very long period of the doldrums.  Our exports traditionally had only one outlet and that was the British market and a damned bad market it was.  We got bad prices and our agricultural produce was subjected to restrictions whenever it suited the British.  Farming in that context was a depressed occupation and depended for its survival on whatever subvention the Government of the day here were prepared to give it.</P>
    <P>If agriculture is to make the contribution it is possible for it to make to our economy it needs a huge input of capital.  The President of the Irish Farmers' Association, Mr. P.J. Maher, recently suggested that he believed that a sum of £2,000 million was necessary for investment in agriculture in the next ten years.  It is regularly admitted by all that agriculture is heavily under-capitalised. I am pleased to see that <Col N="1032" /> within the last few days the World Bank made a loan available for us and this in conjunction with the Agricultural Credit Corporation, amounts to approximately £15 million, which is welcome.  However, in the context of what was stated by the President of the IFA, it is merely a drop in the ocean.  Our farms run to about 10½ million acres of agricultural land.  We have on this 10½ million acres approximately 6½ million cattle.  Every agricultural expert and every farmer knows we can carry an extra 4 to 5 million cattle on these farms without the slightest difficulty.</P>
    <P>The problem is to find the money to finance farmers to rear those extra 4 million cattle and keep them for a period of three years until they reach slaughter weight.  Rather than threaten farmers with income tax, we ought to offer them encouragement to invest in their industry to the hilt, to borrow to the hilt to invest and to pour back their profits into their industry in every way they can.  They should be assured that if they do this and if they increase their productivity to the point where it ought to be increased in the shortest possible time, we will give them the tax concessions and the annual holidays to which the personnel in any industry are entitled who are exporting their produce to the same extent as agriculture. Two-thirds of agricultural exports approximately are exported.  It means having an investment of capital and because of that it is entitled to these tax concessions just as much as any new industry which is set up and where heavy capital has to be invested in order to start the industry.</P>
    <P>For the first time in many generations farmers are able to pay their debts and can face those to whom they owe money.  It is time they were allowed to revitalise their farms to make them more viable and to stock them fully and to acquire some of the trappings which most of us in other categories are used to having without worrying where they come from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Finance Bill deals with the changes introduced in the recent budget and I will deal briefly with some of the provisions contained in it.  Like other Finance <Col N="1033" /> Bills, it contains some welcome provisions and some very contentious matters.  Some months ago the public were conditioned to the belief that if they could get rid of a Fianna Fáil Government a new haven could be created for Ireland and the Irish people.  The electorate opted for a change after 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government.  They were told, through the media in particular, that the Coalition groups with their superior talent, intelligence and new ideas could improve the quality of life for all. Therefore, the people made their choice and gave the new supermen an opportunity to implement their promises and to improve the quality of life as they had alleged they were capable of doing.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers, I believe that any Government should be given a little time to implement their policies and to organise their programme in order that benefits may accrue.  The present Government did not claim to be supermen, it was the media who were responsible for this, and they still enjoy the full support of all sections of the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing new has come about in the field of social services or their improvement. The public were conditioned into the belief that if Ireland entered the EEC all those benefits would come one way or another.  I was one of those who campaigned for our entry into the EEC and for that I have no apologies.  We as an island community could not afford to live in isolation.  Therefore, there was no alternative except to join with the other groups in the EEC. When we were endeavouring to encourage the people to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on that occasion, one of our main planks on the election platforms was the improvements that would accrue in the field of social welfare.  There were no surprises as a result of the budget this year.  The people expected everything they got and many of them were disappointed that more benefits did not accrue from the recent budget.  I canvassed from door to door last February and I told the people what they could expect.  They just laughed at me and said it was not adequate. None of us can foresee when this <Col N="1034" /> They got nothing more than I promised on that occasion from this Government, but they expected more.  Therefore, any benefits which came about did not surprise anybody.  They came because they were promised by all parties, because of our accession to the EEC. There was no jubilation in any sector of the social welfare beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed at the decision to remove VAT from only some items of food.  The Minister and the Government in their wisdom felt that items such as biscuits, minerals, lucozade, ice-cream, clothing, footwear and many other articles should be regarded as luxuries.  I do not know how anybody could regard those items as luxuries. We all know that footwear and clothing are just as essential as foodstuffs. The Government have erred in removing value-added tax from segregated items and failing to remove it from other essentials.  We must have clothes to protect us from the elements.  We live in a cold climate; we do not get much sunshine.  It was wrong to remove VAT from a few items and allow so many other essentials to remain subject to it.</P>
    <P>Thousands of old age pensioners live on tea and biscuits.  Biscuits are now a luxury.  Patients in hospitals, homes and institutions enjoy a bottle of lucozade, biscuits, minerals and so on.  Those are now all regarded as luxuries.  I do not know why they are classified as luxuries.  There is still time to correct this mistake and I would appeal to the Minister and the Government to ensure that the necessaries of life are free of VAT.  Taxation comes from one source only, from the wage earners' pockets, the property owners' pockets or the pockets of the professional man and businessman.  If a person can buy cheap food but has to pay dearly for clothing, then the breadwinner who has to pay gains nothing.  I fail to see how any benefit can derive from the removal of VAT from food.</P>
    <P>The argument will be made that family allowances have been increased to offset price rises.  This is poor consolation to the housewife who finds that she must pay more and more for the basic requirements of her family, <Col N="1035" /> rising price trend will be halted, if it ever will be halted.  It is no wonder married women find it necessary to go out to work to supplement the family income.  Efforts have been made in recent times to allow women to continue in their employment after marriage; I support those efforts but it would not be necessary for many women to continue in employment after marriage were it not for the fact that they must now supplement the family income.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what provisions have been made in this Bill, or in any other Bill, to provide employment for the thousands of young girls who become available for employment each year.  I have no doubt that many channels of employment will be closed to them in future because of the provision allowing married women to continue in employment.  What job prospects will there be in future for these young girls?  I hope the Government have some scheme in the pipeline to overcome the difficulties young girls will have in finding employment as a result of the thousands of married women who will opt to continue on in employment after marriage.  I hope we will never again have to endure the painful sight of seeing our young girls emigrating.  It is most encouraging to note that emigration is now almost non-existent.  Let us hope that it will not occur again as a result of this new provision allowing women to remain in employment after marriage.</P>
    <P>In relation to our income tax code, I am disappointed that there is no provision in this Bill for cases of hardship. People can become victims of circumstances outside their control.  Take the case of a small building contractor who gets into financial difficulties.  He may be building houses for the local authority; the local authority discovers he cannot continue and they take over the scheme and complete it.  This small building contractor is still liable for income tax assessed the previous year on his work.  He is in financial difficulties and is forced to sell his house.  The result is his wife and family have no roof over their heads.  I am thinking of the man who has been processed for <Col N="1036" /> a certain sum of money with an income tax assessment on that money.  He has now not got a roof over his head and his wife and family are in very, very poor circumstances.  There should be some provision made in the Finance Acts to cater for such cases of hardship. They are not very numerous.  I fail to see why the law must be upheld so rigidly.  I fail to understand why a man in such circumstances should end up in prison simply because he became a victim of circumstances outside his control and was unable to pay the income tax for which he was assessed.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make some effort to have provisions written into Finance Acts which would cater for such cases of hardship.  These are not people who can be regarded as tax dodgers.  They are people who have fallen on hard times through no fault of their own. Somebody should endeavour to humanise the activities of the Revenue Commissioners in this respect.  It is an anomaly that needs to be removed urgently.  I appeal to the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this matter with a view to issuing instructions to the Revenue Commissioners at least to listen to a person's case.  If they feel that lies are being told they can then proceed to implement the full rigour of the law.  Every effort should be made to humanise the activities of the Revenue Commissioners and this could be done by introducing a degree of flexibility into our income tax code.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the provision to increase the road tax on motor vehicles.  I protest at the manner in which this was introduced. The road tax on some vehicles was increased by 75 per cent.  That seems to have escaped the notice of many people.  It was stated that the increase was only 10 per cent.  I can cite the case of a small delivery van for a small businessman or a small company; formerly the tax on such a vehicle was £16; it will now be £28. That man has no alternative but to pass on the increase to his customers resulting in another increase in prices. I would not object to increased road tax if we were being provided with <Col N="1037" /> better roads but the contribution this year will not measure up to the increases levied on the motoring public.</P>
    <P>The road network in this country is not capable of catering for the increased traffic, especially the heavy traffic.  We now have, as the Europeans call them, the juggernauts but our roads were not constructed to cater for this heavy traffic.  It is noted that this particular item has not been increased in the budget provisions this year.  These vehicles take a heavier toll on road surfaces than the lighter vehicles.  They are dangerous on our roads and those of us who travel up and down the country know that if we get two of these vehicles in convoy along the road we have to stay behind them for miles before we get an opportunity of passing.</P>
    <P>Driving licences have been increased by 100 per cent and provisional licences have been increased by 200 per cent. These increases are bound to have repercussions on the motoring public. The tax on tractors has been increased. Some people think that the farmer became a millionaire overnight but 1972 was the first year in farming history that farmers enjoyed any measure of prosperity.  Some people feel that the farmers should be dealt with as quickly as possible in order to extract as much tax as possible.</P>
    <P>No worthwhile increase was given in road grants to compensate for the increases which were brought about in this budget.  The motorist who is paying tax on his vehicle is entitled to have better quality roads.  The Minister for Finance should ensure that more money is made available to local authorities to bring our roads up to a standard which will allow the motoring public enjoy greater safety and ease of driving.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the motoring public I should like to refer to the Tenth Schedule which provides for various amendments of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972.  In 1972 VAT on motor cars, and television sets, was 30.26 per cent.  Now, under this Bill, the rate will be 36.76 per cent.  The time has come for somebody to call halt with regard to penalising the motoring public any further.  Whether he buys petrol, or a <Col N="1038" /> spare part, he is taxed to the hilt.  His road tax has been increased and now he pays a further 6.75 per cent increase in VAT.  I should like to ask the Minister, and the Government, how much further can they go in their extraction of tax from the motoring public.  We have the dearest motor vehicles in Europe and it is not the fault of the assemblers.  The parts are produced cheaply in other countries and cars are only assembled here, but it is our method of taxation which is responsible for the fact that our motor vehicles are the most expensive in Europe.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the workers who must use their cars to travel long distances to work.  They are allowed no tax concessions as a result of having to use their own motor vehicles each day to go to work.  A case in point occurred when all the major oil companies decided to close their rural depots.  They gave their truck drivers the choice of operating from Dublin or becoming redundant.  All the drivers who had their homes established in the country and had their children attending local schools had to move to Dublin or else become redundant. Many of those people decided to drive to Dublin daily to continue in their present employment. Those people will not get any remission of income tax on account of having to use their car to get to work.</P>
    <P>The same case applies to those in the building industry which can be regarded as a mobile industry.  The builder must move from site to site and the workers must move also.  The time has come for our planners to reinvestigate our income tax system and allow those people who must use their cars to get to work greater tax concessions to compensate them for the cost of travelling to and from work.  It can, and must, be done. They are already heavily taxed.  They are paying taxes from the time the car parts arrive in the country until they are bought.  They also have to pay motor tax, insurance and driving licence.  As the saying goes, the last straw may break the camel's back. The time has come when the last straw will break the camel's back.  It is time for a re-assessment of the tax <Col N="1039" /> code.  The Government will lose revenue if depression returns and people discover they can no longer keep motor cars.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the cost of Government and the overall cost of the Civil Service.  The provisions in the budget will make our tax collection system more complicated.  They will mean employing more civil servants. One of the arguments used by Coalition spokesmen in the last election campaign was that we had a top-heavy Civil Service.  One of their promises has been broken because they will now have a Civil Service system which will be even more top-heavy.  This situation was brought about by our complicated taxation system.  We should have been endeavouring to simplify our taxation system but have not done so.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the increase in borrowing rates.  This increase will greatly inflate the cost of housing.  The present Minister for Local Government stated that we would have 25,000 new houses built this year, but I do not see how this promise can be implemented if house loans are to be increased week by week.  Anyone who wants to buy a house must avail of the loans and the biggest proportion of money being used for house building comes from the building societies and the local authorities.  The local authority comes in with SDA loans when the builder discovers he cannot procure any money from the building societies.  It will cost him more money each year to service that loan and it will cost more money to have the house erected.  The end result is that all sections of the community must continue to press for higher and higher wages in order to enable them to enjoy a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>This Government, which promised so much, will have to come to grips with this cancer of inflation.  This is strong language but there is no other way of explaining the present, inflationary trend.  It was operating more or less at a walking pace some years ago; the pace has now developed into a gallop.  Something must be done to <Col N="1040" /> stop inflation.  Where will it all end? The people are prepared to give the Government time, they are prepared to give them an opportunity of fulfilling some of their promises.  I am convinced that they made too many promises.  They deceived many people and they will be unable to fulfil all their promises.  I hope the day is not too far distant when the people will be afforded an opportunity of deciding what type of a Government they want or whether the present Government have fulfilled any of the promises made in their 14-point programme.</P>

      <P>Despite the claim made for the budget by Government spokesmen, this Finance Bill does nothing to redistribute effectively wealth and income from the rich to the poor.  This is regrettable.  We are to have higher taxation on alcohol and tobacco.  This will bear heavily on the poor.  The proposal to remove VAT from certain items of foodstuffs conceals the real position because there is to be a higher rate of VAT on everything else.  The overall burden of taxation derived from VAT is to be increased.  This will benefit the wealthy who spend only a small proportion of their total income on goods subject to VAT.  No effort has been made to ease the burden on the poorer sections of the community by spreading the burden of taxation more widely.  There is, for example, no tax on capital gains or wealth in general.  The taxes I have mentioned, plus higher motor taxes, higher insurance contributions, the large budget deficit, and the financing of the Budget by increased borrowing, are all highly inflationary on their own. In combination, they are extremely dangerous.  They will not help the chances of arriving at another less inflationary national wage agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened for the last two days to what has been said about this Finance Bill.  The Bill is being discussed as if it alone were responsible for setting the whole economic trend, as if it would or could order the lives of everyone in this community and of industry, agriculture and education.  We had people, like Senator Lenihan did yesterday, calculating that <Col N="1041" /> the removal of VAT from food would not result in any reduction in the price of food.  He was trying to convince the people before him and, perhaps, the people behind him that by some means or another the price of food would increase as a result of the removal of the 5 per cent.  Senator Lenihan, I am sure, is not so stupid as not to know that, if you deduct 5 per cent from the price of anything, the price must be less than it would be if the percentage had not been removed.</P>
      <P>Inflation is definitely a real problem, but the increase in food prices is something we all anticipated over the last number of years.  We cannot attribute this increase to the change of Government.  We may attribute it to some degree to the fact that we have joined the Common Market.  Senator Brown and others said that the fact that we joined the Common Market was already being regretted by all sections.  I do not know what sort of people Senator Browne knows who are in a state of panic about the state of the country and the rate of inflation. I know from the people I meet that they recognise that inflation is definitely a problem, but I do not think there is any great danger that the majority will develop high blood pressure or nervous tension through worry about inflation.</P>
      <P>If people like Senator Browne would care to come and meet the ordinary people in rural Ireland they will find that the average man or woman never felt more confident about the future than he or she feels at present, never felt more confident of the markets available to them for their produce, never felt more confident in a Government doing so much to order the world in which they live. Far from changing our minds about having joined the Common Market, I think the average citizen will be forever grateful to men like Deputy Garret FitzGerald, Minister for Foreign Affairs, who did so much to educate us on what lay before us when we became members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators have spoken as if this Bill should order the lives of every individual. That is not the position.  The Bill goes a long way to achieve certain <Col N="1042" /> hoped for results.  We have seen already some of the desired results.  Social justice has become a reality.  The gap between the income of the deprived and the privileged became less on 1st July.  We appreciate that.  I do not think that any piece of legislation such as we have before us today will change everything in the country.  I do not think that it is legislation like this that orders the lives and future of our citizens.  More important than any legislation like this is the leadership given by the Government. That leadership comes from individual Ministers and from our Civil Service.  We should be aware that there are many factors which will affect the growth of our economy besides this legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne mentioned the fact that we are one of the richest countries in the world.  This may be true, but it is also a fact that we are one of the poorest countries in Europe.  This is a fact we cannot deny.  I would imagine that the leadership given by our Government in the various sectors of Irish life is much more important than the small pieces of legislation or the adjustments of a few pounds here or a few shillings there in a budget of this nature.  While these things are important, we should realise that this country has only started on the road to progress.</P>
    <P>We should realise, when we are talking about the Common Market and the depression that has resulted from our membership of it in the minds of our people, that the farmers of Ireland have enjoyed an increase of 75 per cent in their income over the past two years. This is an unprecedented increase in the income of any section of our community. If Senator Browne or Senator Lenihan would walk around the towns and villages of rural Ireland they would see the results of this increased wealth in our local community.  We must of course be aware that, while this income has inproved the standard of living for the farming community, it has also improved the standard of living for the small shopkeepers, the small industrialists, the people who provide the goods and the services, the people who sell the machinery, the people who <Col N="1043" /> provide oil and the people who provide the seeds and manures.  All this has created a great boom of activity in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Instead of counting, as somebody has, the £2.50 increase on agricultural tax, we should look to the vast possibilities available to us to increase production.  The activities of the various Ministers and the confidence that the average Irish person has in the Government, will have a far greater effect on the progress of this nation than will something like an increase of 1p an hour, say, in the cost of running a tractor&mdash;and one old penny at that&mdash; which has been referred to as having a significant tendency towards the increasing of inflation in the country. While we have been debating this Bill perhaps we have laid too much emphasis on some aspects of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BobAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up the point about the increases given to the small farmer in the last few years.  While they have got increases they have also had to pay increased prices themselves.  A lot was said here today about the farmer.  I represent the farmers.  I should like Senator McCartin to consider the small shopkeepers. Nobody has been mulcted more than the small shopkeepers. They have been nearly wiped out altogether, and so have the small farmers. We hear that we are getting this and that.  I know what we are getting. How is it coming back to the small farmer?  Everything he got in the last ten years is taken off him by taxation. The small farmer trying to rear a family on 30 or 40 acres cannot make a living.  Neither can the small shopkeeper.  His is eaten up by big monopolies.  Every Member of the House knows that.  When Senators stand up here to speak, they should speak the truth.  This is the truth. When a big farm is being sold the Land Commission take it over.  They set it for ten years until it is worn out.  The big man with the money then walks in and buys it, when it should be divided among the small farmers.  If this were done our farmers could prosper.  Farms are left idle for years.  There are many hardy young <Col N="1044" /> men in my area who have to leave the land and go into industry because the Government of the day will not divide the land and give it to them.  If there are to be prospects in agriculture you must give the small farmer's son land enough to live on so that he can get married young and rear a family. The big man is getting richer and the poor man is getting poorer.  I am speaking on behalf of the small farmers.  Senator McCartin spoke on behalf of the small shopkeepers.  They are being run out of business and so are the small farmers by our own neglect.</P>
      <P>The land is there.  The men are there to work it.  They are not given the opportunity to work it.  I would ask the Taoiseach today to take up the matter with the Land Commission.  There is plenty of land lying idle all over the country.  It is taken over and set for years.  The big man grows crops on it for ten years then it is given to the small farmer.  When the land is there why not divide it among the small farmers?  Some small farmers are married and are trying to rear big families.  They are anxious to work but they cannot get the work.  I do not wish to take up the time of the House but I must raise this problem on behalf of the small farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man who has to drive 15 miles to work each morning is getting nothing for his car.  The big director is allowed £2,500 on his car.  The man who has to drive a car 12 or 14 miles to work gets no allowance on his income tax. These are the people we should be looking after.  These are the people who will make this country what we expect it will be in about 20 or 30 years.  They have to buy a car to get to their jobs. They have to pay for petrol and for the upkeep of the car.  They have to pay income tax on top of that.  The big director is in a different category and he can get an allowance of £2,500. There should be equality.  When the elections come up we are all backing the small man.  When elections are over we all forget the small man.  I urge the Government to think of the small farmer who wants land to work so that he will not have to go to England to find work.  Divide big farms and let him marry and rear his family.  Give <Col N="1045" /> him the land at a reasonable price. Then you will have an Ireland worthy of the name.  People died to keep the land for our own people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate, as is customary on a Finance Bill, has ranged over a wide area affecting economic, social and other matters.  I wish to deal as adequately as possible with the various points that have been raised but I think it is necessary at the outset to have a look at some of the principal factors which affect the economy.  I sympathise with a number of Senators including Senator Alyward, but I know he will appreciate that, no matter how anxious the Government are to fulfil their programme, and to complete the policy we have set out to implement, many of the ills he has mentioned have been with us for a long time.  Indeed, some of the criticism he expressed might more appropriately have been directed elsewhere.  I fully appreciate the concern which he has expressed and the anxiety which he and other Senators have shown in respect of so many sections of the community.</P>
      <P>This budget particularly as set out in the Finance Bill is implementing the undertakings precisely to do what the last Senator mentioned, that is, to look after the most needy sections, to assist those most in need and to cater for those groups in the community who need to be helped by the State through social welfare and other payments of a social welfare character.</P>
      <P>In addition, the budget set out and the Finance Bill is geared to expand the economy and to increase production. The figures for the last few years show that the growth rate of the economy for the three years, 1970 to 1972, averaged only 3 per cent.  It is anticipated that the growth rate this year, ending in mid-1974, will be higher than that.  This upturn in the economic growth rate has been accompanied by a substantial rise in consumer demand.  The value of retail sales for the first four months of this year increased by 18 per cent while the number of new private cars registered rose by over 30 per cent in the period January to May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As many Senators have pointed out, <Col N="1046" /> the economy of the country depends to a large extent on an increase in exports.  Exports in the first six months of the year rose in value by about 35 per cent.  Tourist receipts have also increased.  It was in those circumstances that the Government decided to stimulate the economy further by providing substantial sums on both capital and current account.  Senator Yeats referred to the fact that the Finance Bill and the budget did nothing in this regard. I must refer him to the figures in the Capital Budget which are quite significant. The Capital Budget shows that this year the public capital programme has been set at a level of £305 million. This is an increase of £56 million or nearly 23 per cent as compared with the expenditure in 1972-73.  If Irish Shipping is excluded and the air companies, most of the finance for which comes from foreign borrowing abroad, the programme represents an increase of 27 per cent over that for last year.  It is well to indicate the support for this policy which was expressed in the recent <i>Irish Banking Review Quarterly</i> which adverted to this and said that the budget was socially progressive and made a significant contribution to helping the deprived sections of society which are also the groups which have been most affected by the exceptionally high inflation of recent times.</P>
    <P>In addition, that article quoted, at page 5, an OECD survey of the Irish economy which was published before the budget and in which it recommended in favour of a stimulus to the economy.  It favoured faster rates of public expenditure as the appropriate means of stimulus.  The OECD report regarded higher public expenditure as more effective than tax concessions or monetary expansion because it can be applied more selectively and has a greater initial impact on domestic output in employment.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the progressive nature of the Government's spending in this regard, it can be seen that there is an increase of £21 million in respect of housing and ancillary services, an increase of £3½ million for educational buildings, an increase of £11 million for agriculture and an increase of £9 <Col N="1047" /> million for industry.  All of those increases are in line with the recommendations of the OECD which the Government decided on as the most beneficial and practical method of stimulating the economy.  The estimated current expenditure for 1973-74 stands at some £130 million above its level in the last fiscal year.  At the same time the capital expenditure has been increased.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say, as some Senators have said, that there is a risk that we may have endeavoured and may be trying to go too far.  At any rate the money is being provided in the areas in which on any assessment, including the remarks of Senators on all sides of the House and supported and endorsed by the OECD commentary published before the budget and by the commentary in the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> for June which advocate and support the items of expenditure which have been decided upon in the budget, it is most needed. In addition, this year&mdash;while there has been some small increase in motor taxation&mdash;there is an additional subvention of £2.4 million over and above that provided previously direct to the Road Fund for the purpose of road works and road improvements.</P>
    <P>The financing of these large sums has been so arranged that the net borrowing of £193 million is some £72 million above that for 1972-73. Senator Yeats adverted to the fact that it was unjustified this year to run a budget deficit of £40 million.  Compared with last year's budget, allowing for the expansion in public expenditure and the increase in the size of the budget, the £40 million projected deficit this year proportionately resembles and is similar to the budget deficit of last year.  The Government approach to the economy and to the management of our economic and financial affairs does not tend to be either inhibited or overcautious. We are also watchful for any unwanted side effects.  The development of imports and consumption is a possible source of danger.  The increased pace of economic activity has, naturally, attracted higher imports.  It is gratifying to note&mdash;and I think this is <Col N="1048" /> important&mdash;that the major increase was in materials for further production and that imports of capital goods have also risen substantially.</P>
    <P>So far as consumer demand is concerned, it is estimated that between January and April of this year it grew in volume by 6½ per cent.  A certain increase is welcome because it indicates a rise in living standards and it also means that people are consuming and purchasing goods of one character or another, but the disquieting factor&mdash; and this is one to which many Senators referred&mdash;is the incidence of inflation and the continued rise in prices.  We should be quite clear and specific about this.  Price rises are affected by a variety of interacting factors.  Some of these price rises are within the domestic control of the Government but the majority are outside the control of any Government and are involved in the general situation resulting from the obligation and need to purchase goods and supplies from abroad.</P>
    <P>Senators in the Fianna Fáil Party criticised the decision to remove VAT from food.  However, there was one exception&mdash;Senator Keegan wanted VAT not only removed from food but even from the items which were being retained in it, such as biscuits and less essential foods.  If we are to maintain our standard of living and maintain a modern economy by importing the necessary materials such as oil and essential supplies, we must pay prevailing world prices.  There is no alternative method to that as yet.  It is ludicrous to suggest that we can maintain our present standard of living and isolate ourselves and, as Senator Browne suggested, live in some kind of isolated Utopia where everyone would do the proper thing in all circumstances. This is not possible as we have inherited this State as it exists today.  There is no advantage in quotng Marx or Stalin.  One might as well quote what Brian Boru said in Clontarf. We must deal with the economic situation as we find it.  We never claimed we could isolate ourselves and it would not be a good thing for the economy to isolate ourselves from world events.  We have joined the EEC because we believe it offers the <Col N="1049" /> best prospects.  It is not perfect.  We have joined an arrangement which is already in being and which has existed for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>The first reflection of our entry was the substantial rise in cattle and other prices in anticipation of this country joining the EEC.  In so far as the Government are concerned we are endeavouring to deal with the factors within our control, to try to moderate the incidence of inflation and as a contribution to that we decided to remove VAT from food.  That is a significant contribution and one designed to help those persons least able to look after themselves.  These are persons with large families, the aged, the sick, widows and orphans. The increases in children's allowances, in social welfare payments, the improvements in the means test, the improvements in social assistance, the transfer of part of the charge in respect of rates from the county councils and local authorities to the Central Fund, are all designed to assist the economy.  The decision to remove VAT from food is in line with these.</P>
    <P>There is another important element in this which a number of Senators may have overlooked, that is, that it is a contributing factor in securing a new national agreement.  It has been recognised that the national wage agreements have avoided the worst effects of price rises and have endeavoured to secure some uniformity of changes in wage structures and salary adjustments and also to assist, as far as is possible to do so, the weaker sections in the community.</P>
    <P>While it would be a mistake to imagine that all the changes that have taken place have been due to the changes in respect of food, there is a justification for the decision based on a few simple facts for removing VAT from food.  The calculation in respect of the removal of VAT was given by me in introducing the Second Stage. It is estimated at 0.5 per cent on the consumer price index.  This figure emerges as a result of detailed calculation on the various items entering into the base of the index.  As Senators are aware, food has a high rating in the <Col N="1050" /> base and indicates the importance of food as a reflection of the actual outgoings in the average household budget. A few Senators spoke about fridges, household furniture, clothing, shoes, <i>et cetera.</i>  It is true that all these items enter into it but food is the important element.  Food is a daily necessity.</P>
    <P>To listen to some Senators one would imagine that the only items people needed were fridges, washing machines or other similar articles.  These are usually purchased once in a lifetime by the average household.  There is little use in having a fridge if you have nothing to put into it and no one suggested buying a fridge in which to store paraffin oil.  We operated on the principle that food was the most essential item and the one that figured largely in the household budget survey. Although that survey was carried out six or seven years ago, the general pattern of expenditure that was reflected in that survey would not have varied greatly.  It would probably show that the trend in all of these surveys is that, as people advanced in the economic scale and as living standards rise, a lower proportion is spent on food.  Senators on all sides reflect the common experience that the poorer sections of the community, pensioners, persons with large families and those in need of assistance are those who spend most on food and are those who are affected most by a rise in food prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in the course of a recent reply to a Parliamentary question which is contained in Volume 266, Official Report, 20th June, gave full details as to how this calculation is made.  Apart from these particular changes which I have mentioned, the VAT changes will have a net impact on the consumer price index of the reduction I mention. Some taxation increases are unavoidable. A number of Senators want us to do everything&mdash;to remove death duties, reduce income tax and to increase social welfare allowances, provided we do not ask anyone to raise the money to pay for these concessions or to pay more in taxes.  It cannot be done.  We have endeavoured to take the most needy cases first, to <Col N="1051" /> deal with them as was done in the budget and in the Social Welfare Act, to stimulate the economy by providing incentives and assistance in respect of building and development work and to deal with the other matters which were regarded as contributing to the general development of the economy and to the expansion and stimulation of economic development both in agriculture and industry.</P>
    <P>We are especially concerned, as a Government, to see that the price increases which occur will be as small as possible.  To that extent, the Minister for Industry and Commerce recently made a number of orders; the scope of these orders has been published and details are available to those interested.  Broadly, they are designed to lengthen the period of time by which applications for price changes must be notified in advance. In addition, the profit margins in respect of wholesalers and retailers have been reduced.  They mark, I believe, a significant extension of price control and are accompanied by a substantial increase in the number of inspectors and other staff employed in the Prices Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Some Senators advocated that we should have done nothing about food and allow a free-for-all to develop.  In those circumstances, the people who would suffer most are the poor, those with large families and the families whose incomes are lower and who, consequently, spend a greater proportion of their incomes on the essentials of life.  We are endeavouring to ensure that the broad general trend of economic policy will be so directed and guided by the initiative which the Government and individual Ministers have taken in collaboration with &mdash; because it is illusory to imagine that this is solely a Government operation or an operation by one or other Government Minister &mdash; employers and trade unions.  It is for that reason that we were concerned to see that there would be no breach of the national wage agreement.  In pursuance of that, we indicated our clear order of priorities and our concern that, in the discussions that will be taking place over the next <Col N="1052" /> few months, the changes in respect of value-added tax and other changes produced in the budget will contribute to that end.</P>
    <P>We, naturally, expect that excessive price increases do not occur.  We expect firms to absorb, as far as possible, through increased productivity, increased costs whether for labour or non-labour items.  The National Prices Commission lay special emphasis on the principle when considering applications for price increases.  There is, therefore, a clear obligation on both management and employees to ensure that the potential for improving productivity is fully exploited.  The action taken by the Minister for Industry and Commerce has had and, I hope, will contribute to having some effect, but price changes in the main are not ones that can be dealt with either quickly or on a once-and-for-all basis.  The indications are that between the period from November, 1972, to February, 1973, the consumer price index showed an increase of 5.5 points while the index for mid-May, compared to mid-February of this year, showed an increase of 4.4 points.  I do not suggest that that change is significant but it is at least a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>It has been the experience in Europe in recent years that there is an annual price rise of up to 8 per cent.  This country has had probably one of the severest rates of price rises in any of the countries of the EEC as well as the OECD.  We are endeavouring to curtail it.  It is for this reason that the Minister made the orders concerned and that he has had discussions with the Prices Commission. For that reason also it was decided to establish a National Consumer Advisory Council.  This council will be consulted in regard to any future legislation on these matters.  So far as wages and salaries are concerned, the changes in recent years have been guided by the national wage agreements. The fact that the Government were committed to this has been indicated clearly in the action we took in respect of a number of recent pieces of legislation, including the salaries of Senators and Deputies and public servants generally.  The agreements reflect, <Col N="1053" /> I believe, the collective decisions by the vast majority of Irish workers and employers and it is in the national interest that they should be maintained and supported by everybody and not undermined by sectional interests.</P>
    <P>We favour the voluntary negotiation of a further national wage agreement.  Such an agreement, like the previous agreements, should facilitate an orderly development of incomes with the minimum of disturbance in the achievement of the important social aim of improving the position of the lower paid workers.  It is correct to say that it is doubtful if this aim could be achieved outside the framework of national agreements. The decisions, therefore, to be arrived at over the next few months &mdash; whether there will be a third national pay agreement and if so what form it will take &mdash; have vital implications for economic growth, for employment, for prices and for industrial relations. The decisions will affect the economy as a whole and the standard of living of all sections.  The Government are prepared to play a constructive role in arriving at these decisions in order to ensure that a satisfactory arrangement will be reached.</P>
    <P>In this regard the management of monetary policy will require care and continuous review in order to maintain a reasonable balance between the various diverse forces at work in the economy.  Last year a number of Senators spoke about this matter.  In that year the total amount of bank credit increased by £320 million.  I think it is a fair assumption that the effects of this exceptionally large increase have yet to work their way through the economy.  The indications are, and Senator Yeats referred to this, that the decision of the Central Bank last February to moderate the rate of credit expansion sufficiently to meet the reasonable needs this year of the public and private sectors is probably now having an effect.  The emphasis in that decision was to provide credit for projects designed to improve productive capacity and to increase our export potential.</P>
    <P>The annual report of the Central <Col N="1054" /> Bank, which was published recently, indicates how credit policy has been and will be operated to the national advantage in terms of production and employment.  The continuation of the fluctuating interest rates and the high level of interest are in themselves a problem.  It is a source of concern to us.  It must be recognised that in this regard the matters referred to were not immune to international movements and interest rates.</P>
    <P>High interest rates are part of the price that must be paid for inflation. It is doubtful if significantly low rates can be expected as long as inflation here and in other countries continues at the present level.  It is naturally one of the problems which causes concern to the Government and to all those who are obliged to apply or seek credit for development or one type or another.  The fact that interest rates have fluctuated at very frequent intervals and quite sharply is only an in-dictation or, indeed, a manifestation of the particular problem.</P>
    <P>In this country we cannot isolate ourselves from that.  There is no all-powerful solution or all-embracing remedy that any one can apply.  We are part of the sterling area.  We are now bound up with the European Economic Community and there is no way out of sharing in the disadvantages as well as the advantages of these arrangements.  On the other hand, it is correct to say, and it is important that the country as a whole should understand, that our external reserve position is strong.  While the reserves have fallen somewhat in the last few months, this is in line with the normal seasonal trend.  It is not anticipated for the year as a whole that there will much change.  The international monetary scene continues to be set by a number of uncertainties and difficulties arising from economic and financial problems.</P>
    <P>This is one of the reasons why interest rates have to be varied rapidly. These have generated massive movements of funds across the exchange market with consequent further destabilising effects.  At the same time, we are lucky in that the one relationship of our pound with the pound sterling is <Col N="1055" /> providing us with a stable exchange rate environment for the greater part of our trade and payments.  Efforts to find a solution to the many international monetary problems have, for some time now, been under the aegis of the committee of twenty.  The Minister for Finance has recently attended with other Finance Ministers the meeting in Washington where discussions and proposals to deal with, or at least minimise, the worst effects of this situation were decided upon.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate a number of Senators raised individual points on the Bill.  I will endeavour to deal with some of them.  Others may arise more specifically on individual sections. Senators Quinlan and Higgins expressed some criticism of the narrowness of the scope of section 21 of the Bill, which provides for tax relief for payments to universities for research into specified projects, particularly the fact that it was limited to industrial relations and marketing.  The reason for mentioning these two is that there are concrete proposals by industrial concerns to make payments towards the endowment of chairs for the purpose of research into and the teaching of these subjects in one of the universities.  If proposals by traders to put up money for the endowment of chairs in other subjects are put forward, the Minister can approve these for the purpose of the section and tax relief will follow.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister has undertaken to consider this question if concrete proposals for payments to such bodies are made.  Senator Quinlan, at the same time, welcomed, as did Senator Higgins, the proposals so far as the claw-back in respect of children's allowances are concerned. It is important to clarify one aspect of it.  Senator Lenihan said those over £2,500 lose.  This is not correct.  Nobody loses.  What happens is that those with net incomes above £2,500 do not gain.  The purpose of this was to ensure that the social welfare increases would go only to those with net incomes below £2,500.</P>
    <P>I think it is significant that some 359,000 families will be given increased <Col N="1056" /> allowances and, of these, only about 40,000 families will have the increased benefit taken back.  This particular method of claw-back is not new.  It was brought in originally in 1969 to take back increases in the allowances given at that time.  On that occasion the claw-back applied to all income-tax payers regardless of size of income.  There was no differentiation in favour of those with lower incomes. The claw-back in this case applies to a limited number and only to those with net incomes above the figure I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The debate also raised the question of giving relief in respect of cars used by workers going to and from work. The existing rules provide for relief in respect of expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of employment. This would cover the use of a car in the course of exercising the employment but would not cover the expense of getting to and from work.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that if any exemption were to be made in a case like this, relief should also be given to persons who use any other form of transport, CIE or some other form and, indeed, some remarks were made by Senator Browne about the fact that workers were not assisted.  At the present time the CIE subsidy is running at over £12 million a year.  I remember on the last occasion I had to do with this, the subsidy ran at an average of about £1½ million a year and then went up to £2 million.  People thought then it was the end of the world.  It is now running at six times that.  In those circumstances any question of increasing the amount of the subsidy naturally must cause concern and must be looked at very carefully.</P>
    <P>As far as death duties are concerned &mdash; there has been a good deal of discussion about this &mdash; it was made quite clear that estate duties would be abolished but replaced by an alternative form of taxation.  I do not think anybody is really impressed by the concern expressed by some Senators in this regard.  I listened with great care to Fianna Fáil Senators on this matter just as I remember that the Fianna Fáil campaign in the course of the <Col N="1057" /> recent election produced a promise at the last moment to abolish rates.  Senators will remember that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On dwelling houses. I was coming to that.  I have here a White Paper published last November. A White Paper is normally the culmination of a long period of gestation by everybody concerned before it is produced. It indicates what is always described as careful study and anxious consideration.  This was published in November last.  On page 10 it said:</P>
      <P>The Government have come to the conclusion that only the local rates satisfies the criteria referred to above...</P>
      <P>These are a number of criteria including the headings, the rating system, the need for local taxation.</P>
      <P>... and that the real issue is not the abolition of the rating system (with all the consequences this would involve for local financial independence and, indeed, for the taxpayer) but the reform of the system so as to eliminate its undoubted defects.</P>
      <P>That was in November, when the going was getting rough in the course of the general election.</P>
      <P>I listened to Senator Lenihan talk here about promises discrediting democracy.  No one has greater experience than Fianna Fáil of making broken promises.  In the middle of the election the then Taoiseach held a Press conference and I quote:</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, last night, countered the Coalition's criticism of the Government's proposals to abolish rates on all dwellings and spend £30 million on social welfare. The basic difference between the Government's proposals and the Coalition is that our proposals are practical and realistic and will be put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a promise, signed days before polling day, to abolish rates on houses in direct contrast with the published White Paper, even if it had a blue cover, that was issued in the previous November.  There was then <Col N="1058" /> no talk of an election &mdash; it was not even on the horizon.  That was a firm commitment published by the Government after full consideration.  It went on:</P>
    <P>The specific steps proposed to reform the rating system are set out in the following chapters ...</P>
    <P>Not one chapter but a half book of them to reform the rating system. There was a promise made that everyone knew could not be fulfilled, a promise that was new to Fianna Fáil policy.  The only other thing that discredited democracy more in this country were the events of a little over three years ago which I need not recall. They did more damage to democracy in this country than anything said during the general election by anybody on behalf of the two parties that comprise this Government.  That is not the full story.  On the same night that happened, the Taoiseach went to Kilkenny and the way it is put in <i>The Irish Press</i> is: &ldquo;Lynch Hint on Death Duties.&rdquo;  This is a nod being as good as a wink to a voter so close to elections. It stated:</P>
    <P>Mr. Lynch is to have talks on Monday ...</P>
    <P>Monday was two days before polling, which was on the Wednesday.</P>
    <P>We are not making a mere election promise.  We really will do this thoroughly and sincerely.</P>
    <P>After that, the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Gibbons, said he was glad to hear the Taoiseach refer to death duties and went on:</P>
    <P>I know the anxieties that farmers have on this and if the Taoiseach says he is going to examine it that is fine.</P>
    <P>Prior to that, after the Minister had welcomed the Taoiseach, the Taoiseach said that he was the finest Minister for Agriculture the country had ever had.  We saw recognition of that last week.  The new way of dealing with people in Fianna Fáil is if you do not want to promote them or demote them, you put them on to a committee and they do not know whether they have been promoted or demoted.</P>
    <P>We are committed to bringing in a <Col N="1059" /> White Paper on this matter, to examine all the problems and to see how a more acceptable system could be introduced. I think it is worth mentioning that eight years ago the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance ended the system under which up to that time many of the persons who would become liable for death duties took out insurance policies.  Up to that time the insurance policy was not aggregable with the rest of the estate.  Under the Finance Act, 1965, for the first time, it was aggregable with the rest of the estate, and, instead of being used to offset or lighten the burden, it increased the total assets of the person involved.</P>
    <P>We have made a start in this Finance Bill to ease that.  On this occasion, for the first time, an insurance policy of £7,500 is available to ease the problem. We do not say that this has met all our aims but this is the first time the parties publicly committed themselves, after examining it, to an undertaking to do it.  It secured response all round, including this very dramatic response of the then Government of the time. I believe that people recognise that we are moving as fast as it is possible to do so.  It is not possible to do everything in one budget.  I believe that the steps that have been taken are moves in the right direction, they are moves to ease some of the problems, and the particular changes already made so far as a widow and three children are concerned relieve an estate completely up to £42,000 and there are certain other easements in other categories.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the problem of mining, which has been raised by a number of Senators.  Here again, I think the public memory may be short but one would not expect the memories of Senators to be quite as short.  Mining is a highly speculative business.  Many years ago this country provided assistance in a number of ways but mainly by an Exchequer subsidy to a State mining company. I am sure Senators remember that the principal company involved operated at Avoca in Wicklow.  Because of the speculative nature of mining, the difficulty of finding ore and segregating one type of ore from another, the <Col N="1060" /> fluctuation in the world price of the minerals and so on, all impacted on the operation.  Periodically, there had to be, not merely an annual Estimate, but very often Supplementary Estimates in the Dáil to keep the mine open.</P>
    <P>In 1956 the Government of which I was a member, under the guidance of the late Gerard Sweetman, introduced for the first time tax concessions, and the late William Norton, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, introduced other legislation, so that incentives are provided such as tax remissions in respect of exports.  As a result of that, for the first time this country experienced a mining boom. It is in the light of those circumstances that the people are now concerned at the fact that substantial profits appear to be made.  I think it is important to realise that, first of all, 70 per cent of all the minerals are vested in the State and all the other minerals can if necessary be acquired by the State.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, operating from hindsight, in this case, I believe, a hindsight that does not take into account all the factors.  Up to 1956 there was no mineral exploration here except a few existing coal mining operations and the case of Avoca. Since then, as a result of these two major changes, one introduced by the late Gerard Sweetman and the other by the late William Norton, there was a massive expansion in development of exploration.  In the main, this has been carried out entirely by Irishmen. The most successful operation is conducted by an Irishman and his associates who went abroad and learned the technique and came back here to apply it, and expand employment.</P>
    <P>As a result of the very substantial expansion in mining development an inter-Departmental committee have sat and reported and certain changes may be contemplated.  It is well to recall that were it not for those legislative changes there would be virtually no mineral development.  If some firms appear to have made substantial profits, they have also provided good employment and attracted to this country capital from abroad that is needed.  I <Col N="1061" /> know that the Seanad would welcome that approach.  This is a matter that will be considered and the interDepartmental committee reports are already being examined to see what changes are necessary.</P>
    <P>I know that Senators have been sitting here for a considerable length of time.  The other Stages of this Bill will have to be completed this evening. I have no desire to delay the Seanad any longer than is necessary except to say that, if there are any specific points I have overlooked, I will endeavour, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, who will be dealing with the other Stages, to get individual replies to Senators who raised them so that Senators will not feel their comments have been overlooked.  In reply to a general debate it is not possible to deal individually with all the queries raised, some of which may arise on later Stages of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 2 relates to a matter to which I referred last night on the Second Reading.  It is concerned with the amendment of section 138 of the Income Tax Act of 1967, an Act passed six years ago when a certain level existed with regard to the <Col N="1062" /> pound sterling and what it could buy. We now have a situation where, six years afterwards, an amendment is introduced which is only a niggardly throwaway towards income taxpayers; it is an amendment to raise from £74 to £104 the earned income allowance in regard to a wife's earnings.  It is painful even to talk about this and more painful that the Minister for Finance, in introducing his budget, should claim this as a concession.  It is the only single concession, in small print, to income taxpayers.  It is a very niggardly, to put it mildly, concession from the point of view of the fall in the value of money over that period. If one were to work out the precise figure at which this should operate, having regard to the fall in the value of money since 1967, one should be talking in terms of a figure of around £250 instead of £104.  I am not now talking off the top of my head in this respect.  In a recent survey done by the Economic and Social Research Institute, impartially conducted by Dr. Brendan Walshe, it was calculated that, in this area, a figure of £208 to £312 a year would be a reasonable figure as far as working wives are concerned having regard to the fall in the value of money.</P>

      <P>At the present point in time having regard to the fact that, in 1967, a figure of £74 was fixed; so, at this stage, having regard to the fall in the value of money since 1967, we should be thinking in terms of a figure over £208, a figure in the region of £200 and £300.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about section 2 of the Finance Bill, 1973. What is involved in this meagre concession to income taxpayers does not even acknowledge the fall in the value of money but merely makes a throw-away gesture by raising from £74 to £104 the earned income allowances as far as married women are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in this or, indeed, <Col N="1063" /> in any other section in the Bill, to indicate any recognition or knowledge of the fact that the people who count in this country are the working people and those who invest their savings. These are the people who need help if this community is to make progress. If we are going to have economic development here there must be some recognition and help as far as they are concerned.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions have recognised this and have made a submission to the Minister along the lines on which I am speaking. This is the only section that gives even meagre recognition to the category that makes this community tick.</P>
    <P>There is no point in having a budget and a Finance Bill concerned with spreading jam thinly on the bread with an odd give-away here and an odd give-away there.  What any Government should be concerned about, especially a Government elected and there, presumably, for their full term of office, planning to make the economy expand, not just this year, but next year, and over their full term in office, which they hopefully may expect to occupy.  It is not enough to have giveaways two weeks before a Presidential election.</P>
    <P>A Government genuinely concerned about the economy and future development of the country would concentrate totally on various income tax remissions in the areas of earned income relief and personal allowance.  There is no point in trying to tackle the bucking bronco of inflation by doing nothing in these particular areas.  All we have set out in this particular subsection is a meagre increase, nothing like the increase that would be justified in regard to the fall in the value of money between 1967 and 1973.  This meagre increase is the only concession in this Bill to the huge income tax paying public.  The income tax paying public were at one time called the middle classes.  Income tax catches every class in the community now.  If incentives are to be given to encourage people to work harder, to work overtime, to invest their savings in the expansion and development of our community, they must be in this area.</P>
    <P>Any Government concerned about <Col N="1064" /> the future economic and social development of the country should be concerned about encouraging and giving incentives to those who provide the basic motivation in the community.  All we have in this budget for those who work and invest their earnings is this meagre throw-away which does not even acknowledge a fifth of the rate necessary in regard to working wives. There is nothing else in regard to earned income allowance, nothing else in regard to personal allowance.  Indeed, there is a negative attitude adopted in regard to people with a net income over £2,500.  I shall refer to that later.  This is the only concession by this Government to the people who count in the community as far as work and progress is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Taoiseach, I find it difficult to be moved by the insincerity of the words of Senator Lenihan.  The increase represents an increase of over 30 per cent on the 1967 figure.  He says here that in order to meet the increase in the cost of living since 1967, an increase which took place during six years of the administration of which he was a member, the increase ought to be of the order of 250 per cent.  The Senator wants an increase of £74 to £176.  I am doing rough mathematics and taking rough figures.  If I am correct in my assessment he wants an increase of the order of 250 per cent. In all our allegations against the Fianna Fáil Party, we took some care in making them and we never suggested for one moment that there had been an increase of the order of 250 per cent in the cost of living since 1967.  That dispels the whole basis of the suggestion of Senator Lenihan. We are proposing an increase from £74 to £104.  This, for the first time brings the married allowance and the wife's earned income relief to £598, which is double the amount of the single allowance. That is a gesture worth making and is something more than a gesture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something which costs half a million pounds this year and £850,000 in a full year.  This in a <Col N="1065" /> year in which we have increased social welfare allowances by £39 million. These benefits, both in relation to the earned income relief and the children's allowance, go in the main to the working wife who works because her social circumstances and inadequate family income require that she go out to work to supplement the unsatisfactory and inadequate earnings of her husband.</P>
      <P>Of course, this allowance is of no consequence to the wife of the wealthy man who can employ a maid and domestic servants to look after the children and the family in the house while she goes out to work and her professional or well-to-do husband is working as well.  That is why Senator Lenihan considers it as insignificant. It is of some marginal significance to the working wife&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the factory worker who goes out to supplement the inadequate family earnings.  If Senator Lenihan was aware of the problems affecting industry, particularly in the urban areas, he would know that a large number of our factories are working under capacity because wives are discouraged from working because of inadequate income tax allowances applicable to the earnings of wives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have made significant improvements in the family income, in the disposable income, of families in this country on a scale never equalled in the history of this State.  As well as that, we have given this concession to the working wife.  We consider that it is a worthy one and that the basis of the attacks made upon us is without foundation.  The cost of giving income tax reliefs at the lower level, because the Government in power for 16 years did not give adequate relief at the lower level, amounts to £7 million for every £20 of relief that is given.  That £20 is the income relieved, working out at about a net relief of between £6 and £7 for earned income.  The cost of doing that is £7 million.  We are now giving relief to a group in the community, most of whom work through nothing in this budget &mdash; the working <Col N="1066" /> economic necessity and hardship in their family area, and we feel quite justified in doing that.  This is, we hope, but a small beginning of a great reform in the whole tax code which we propose to carry out in the period which I note Senator Lenihan anticipated and that is the life span of the present Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's phraseology.  It is a gesture of course.  It is totally marginal.  This is precisely my point.  The idle flinging around of millions amuses me.  He talks about something that could be done positively in this area which would cost £7 million when, in fact, by Government decision in order to meet election promises we have £16.75 million removed from the VAT net and we have £12.7 million brought in as a burden on the Exchequer in order to meet another promise in regard to health charges and rates.  So, in order to meet haphazard election commitments we have straight away got nearly £30 million between the removal of health charges from the rates to the Exchequer and the removal of VAT on foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>Surely within the ambit of that £30 million odd there was ample scope straight away for very immediate and urgent reforms in the income tax code, immediate and urgent reforms in regard to substantially increasing the earned income allowance, substantially increasing the personal allowance so as to guarantee an incentive to people who want to work and who want to invest. I do not think the Minister is in the land of the living.  The situation has rapidly been reached in regard to income tax that it is a totally nugatory exercise for anyone to work overtime any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are becoming conscious of this and we are very rapidly developing into a situation where it will be a community of do nothing in regard to the operative section of the community, a situation where there is no incentive to work, no incentive to expand, no incentive to invest.  I am repeating myself here but I believe very sincerely and positively that if this country is to make progress those are the people who are going to make this country.  It is precisely those people who have got <Col N="1067" /> and investing people of our community.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister talking about being circumscribed from the budget point of view when he knows that the only thing that circumscribed the Government and has circumscribed the Minister in regard to his particular budget was the fact that there were election commitments unnecessarily made.  There was no need to make them.  I said last night that in my view they added enormously to the corrupting of our democracy and these particular election commitments circumscribed the Minister for Finance and it is around his neck and around the necks of the Government that this particular thing hangs.  This was not part of our policy, it was part of their policy and by reason of their policy, and by reason of the adoption of it in this particular Finance Bill, very desirable reforms in the income tax area have been prevented from being undertaken by reason of the fact that a rates burden of £12.7 million had to be shifted in regard to health charges to the Exchequer and over £16 million had to be moved in regard to food.  I appreciate that the £16 million odd is being channelled in another inflationary direction in the non-food VAT area. That is another day's work and we will have a debate on that when it comes up in the section.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter on this section is that this niggardly amount towards working wives is not nearly enough.  The Minister knows it is not nearly enough and not alone is that not nearly enough but not nearly enough is being done in the Bill as a whole towards this particular section of the community.  I take this opportunity to speak on this matter because this section represents the only concession in a Bill of over 100 sections to the income tax paying people of this country. It is useless for the Minister to come in here and say the money was not available to do this and that, that it would cost £X million to radically increase the personal allowance or £X million to radically increase the earned income allowance.  I know that.  We all know that.  In a year, when the Minister for Finance faced a situation where he had practically £30 million to <Col N="1068" /> distribute in this direction were he not circumscribed and hung up on election promises in regard to the removal of health charges from rates and the abolition of VAT on food, the Minister had £30 million with which to play, to work on, with which to develop.</P>
    <P>Practical reforms are needed in the whole area of income tax.  The Minister should acknowledge that.  These facts form the basis of the document submitted by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to the Minister, a document which pointed out that a large number of our people, part-time working farmers, and those at every level of pay, are now paying income tax. Therefore, income tax is not only a matter of concern for the middle classes; it affects all classes.  Most small farmers are dependent on some wage earner in their own household who again is being crucified by income tax and for whom nothing is being done in this Finance Bill other than the the meagre pittance embodied in this section.</P>

      <P>I do not think I will be called on to deliver a Second Stage reply to a Second Stage speech on the third section of this Bill on Committee Stage.  I should just like to say that during a period of 16 years in Government the previous administration made three nugatory, niggardly, insignificant gestures on the income tax front and now they have the effrontery to make an attack on us in a year in which, as I have already emphasised, we have made the greatest contribution to family incomes ever, not only under the social welfare code but also in the fields to which I am grateful the Senator has drawn attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £12,500,000 that the Exchequer has now absorbed as a burden on the Exchequer is in relief of the ratepayer who in the main is the family ratepayer. That is a further assistance given to families and to the heads of families.  The other aspect is in relation to the removal of VAT from food which is the largest item of consumption in every family budget.  We make no apology for abolishing, for the first time in ten years, tax from food.  This section speaks for itself.  It is in relief <Col N="1069" /> of the wife who finds it necessary to work.  It is a step in the right direction. Because we have not run 100 miles in the first nine weeks of office we have this demonstration of indignation on the part of those who have totally neglected the problems of the taxpayer during their own 16 years of office.</P>

      <P>I am astonished, although I should not be astonished at anything the present Minister for Finance might state.  However, even by his normal standards, I find rather astonishing his claim that during the past 16 years there have been but nugatory gestures by Fianna Fáil in relation to income tax allowances.  Can he not remember that only about 12 months ago no less than £11 million was provided by Fianna Fáil in the annual budget in relief of the income tax payers?  I have already mentioned this on the Second Reading in the Minister's absence, but I now remind him of it so as to encourage him to do still better in his next budget.  The Fianna Fáil Government gave an extra £50 on the allowances for single people making it £299. They gave £50 relief for widows, £70 for a married couple, and £20 for child allowance, the total cost being £11 million.  If he calls this nugatory and all the other adjectives he used, it gives me great encouragement as to what his all-embracing reforms are to be.  We can look forward to a great future.</P>

      <P>I cannot let the Minister <Col N="1070" /> off the hook as it is not only a question of nine weeks.  I spent seven years in a Government debating budgets and Finance Bills and an automatic matter at every discussion prior to the presentation of a budget was what could we do for the income tax payer within the limits of what was available.  We appreciated that there was a situation where a limited number of people from the non-agri-cultural sector were paying income tax, that this was a growing sector and that these were the people who mattered in the community.</P>
      <P>Year in, year out &mdash; I have not the precise figures but Senator Yeats has mentioned last year's figures &mdash; there was a concession or a number of concessions in the whole area of income tax, particularly in the area of personal allowance and earned income. This was always a major consideration. At every Government meeting prior to the budget there would be an assessment made of what the Exchequer could bring in and on the basis of that assessment there was great attention devoted to what could be done in this direction.  The Minister need not plead the question of nine weeks; that is nonsense.  This could be done in a matter of weeks if the will were there, but the will could not be there as practically £30 million was willed out of the way by reason of the Government seeking to corrupt the voting public and as a result of that they regarded themselves as committed to the total strangulation of the VAT system by removing it from food and adding to inflation by putting it on non-food items and, secondly, because of the transfer of the health charges from the rates to the Exchequer.  Straight away the Government had £30 million less to play with.  That is the way it works out and the Minister now knows this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point coming into this House and telling people who know their business that this could not be done in nine weeks.  This could have been done at once if the will had been there.  Obviously nothing else is incorporated in this Finance Bill related to the income tax payers and no thought could have been given to <Col N="1071" /> it because the Government had strangled themselves in advance by pre-election promises.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last section we were discussing, to quote the Minister's words, &ldquo;a marginal gesture towards working wives&rdquo; which is the only marginal improvement so far as income tax payers are concerned.  We are now discussing not an improvement but a minus so far as income tax payers are concerned.  Here we have possibly the most nefarious section in the Bill.  It concerns the question of family allowances which are an all important factor in cushioning people with large families against increases in the cost of living.  In this inflationary age, induced to some extent by the Minister's VAT proposals in another area, we have a situation where incomes in excess of a net £2,500 are being excluded from the children's allowance provisions.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to defend this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prime requirement in the present budget and in our present times must be to substantially increase family incomes. The Minister may think the family allowance increases written into the budget and the Finance Bill are good but I do not think they are good enough.  If there is any area in which the Minister and the Government can cushion people against increases in the cost of living this is the area in which it should be done.  Instead of having an army of inspectors to enforce completely mythical price control, which cannot be enforced, instead of having Ministers introducing price control measures and then having to agree to increases in prices which they had a month before set, instead of having the Government in a situation where, with regard to increases in CIE fares and rates, the National Prices Commission announce a certain level of increases and the Government have to give a greater increase, instead of going into all this fruitless area of price control <Col N="1072" /> and price supervision with a massive bureaucracy involved, all to no effect as we have seen, why not be practical about it and substantially increase family allowances?</P>
    <P>I agree there are increases in family allowances in the budget but I do not regard them as nearly sufficient. Family allowances should be increased in a straight, clean manner without any army of bureaucrats to supervise price control.  Instead we have an example here in section 3 where there is a negative attitude adopted by the Minister and the Government in regard to people with an income in excess of £2,500 a year.  When the next pay agreement comes the net will be spread even wider and a greater number of people will be drawn into this category.  I cannot understand the Minister's thinking in this matter because, on the ordinary basic canons of social justice, how can it be justified that on one side you can have a family of ten children with an income of £2,600 a year and on the other side you can have a family of two children with an income of £2,400 a year?  One category is included while the other is not.  Why introduce this matter in any event?</P>
    <P>I appreciate, and this comes back to the point I made on the last section, that the Minister by reason of election promises was circumscribed and that the election promises hung around his neck.  By reason of that he had to claw back £1 million.  A million pounds, as the Minister quoted in the Dáil, is the figure involved in the claw-back provision, as it is called.  In order to claw back in tax terms, <i>vis-a-vis</i> children's allowances for people over £2,500 a year net, the Minister for the sake of £1 million &mdash; where he could have had £50 million to distribute were it not for election promises &mdash; has introduced this nefarious section leading to the type of social injustice I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a suggestion to the Minister.  We in the Seanad can only suggest it by way of recommendation. It has already been suggested to him in the Dáil.  I cannot understand why some attempt has not been made by him or by the Department <Col N="1073" /> of Finance to do it.  If this has to be done and if, having regard to the electoral commitments made by the present Government prior to the election, they are circumscribed in regard to current expenditure and they had to get £1 million at the expense of people over £2,500 a year net and they have to discriminate against people with large families over that level as against people with small families under that level, why not adopt a simple grading scheme in regard to children?  Why have any level at all?  If we have to have a level why not grade upwards having regard to the number of children so that parents with a large family with an income up to £3,500 or £4,000 a year might qualify and have it graded downwards and upwards in that manner?  Were the brains of the Department of Finance applied to that particular aspect?  Was there any attention given to it?  If the Minister wanted to claw back £1 million why not attempt that and thereby have some rudimentary element of social justice emerging from the decision which had to be made by reason of the pre-election commitments of the Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Senator Lenihan in his condemnation of this.  As I said on the Second Stage last night, were it not for the fact that there are children in this nation there would not be any Parliament, there would not be any schools and there would not be any hope for the nation in any way whatever.  We have to realise that any economies we may try to make down at the infant level will eventually react on us and the nation will have to pay very dearly for them later on.  I wonder do many people realise the hardships that parents with families of ten, 12 or 14 children endure.  It is quite easy for people to set criteria and to draw different standards between incomes but children need food and have to be fed.  This is retrograde thinking.  It is something that should be rectified.  I would prefer to see a graded system, as Senator Lenihan has suggested.  I feel that it is wrong, especially on a fundamental issue such as this, that we are niggardly in our approach to giving <Col N="1074" /> relief to those people who are blessed with having large families.  They are the wealth of the nation but they are costly to sustain.  We in Parliament should recognise the problems of those parents.</P>

      <P>If there is validity in the arguments advanced by Senators Lenihan and Dolan, then they have twice the validity in attacking the Fianna Fáil children's allowance claw-back.  In the statement, to which the Taoiseach referred in his reply to the Second Stage, issued by the Fianna Fáil Party five days before the last general election, Fianna Fáil acknowledged that the time had come for selectivity in the payment of children's allowances. Accordingly, their proposal was that children's allowances would be paid to only 170,000 families.  That was the Fianna Fáil proposal which was contained in <i>The Irish Press</i> published on the Friday before the last general election. Fianna Fáil said they would pay increases in children's allowances to only 170,000 families.</P>
      <P>We have given children's allowance increases to 319,000 families which is nearly twice the Fianna Fáil number. Therefore, I do not think I am being unreasonable in questioning the sincerity of those who attack our plan. We confer benefit on eight out of every nine children in the State because they will get the full children's allowance increases.  Even wealthy parents will lose nothing but, in fact, will have a marginal gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did we choose the income tax system to deal with this increase rather than the Fianna Fáil proposal? The answer is that the Fianna Fáil selectivity proposal would have required that every family would have to apply annually to the Department of Social Welfare and produce evidence of income and qualified children.  Children if they once qualified would continue to be eligible until they reached the age limit but income would have to be proved annually on yet another certificate. God knows we already have enough means tests.  We have something like 16 welfare means tests in this country <Col N="1075" /> and Fianna Fáil propose yet another in order to disqualify nearly half of the people now entitled to children's allowance.</P>
    <P>We could not consider that would be justified.  First of all, it would impose an unnecessary burden on families and, secondly, it would also involve that army of bureaucrats that Senator Lenihan pretends to dislike. We would need to have many hundreds, to say the least, if not indeed a thousand or more additional civil servants in the Department of Social Welfare to handle children's allowances' income certificates, which would have to be assessed every year. That is the only other way in which it could be done.  When Senator Lenihan asks whether brains were applied to this I want to assure him they were.  It is because brains were applied that they show just how impossible in administration and how unduly costly would have been the Fianna Fáil proposal.</P>
    <P>Under the income tax code an income taxpayer's income is recorded. His income is known and it has to be returned for income tax purposes. Each person is given such allowances as he is entitled to under the income tax code in respect of mortgage interest payments, medical insurance premiums, bank overdraft interest and superannuation contributions.  All these are known, catalogued and computerised, in the offices of the Revenue Commissioners.  That being so, there was a readily accessible, efficient way of dealing with this matter.  It also had the humane aspect which I mentioned and that is that we are going to give the allowances to about 150,000 more families than Fianna Fáil had proposed.  We feel our proposal was well justified.</P>
    <P>I would briefly put a few questions to Senator Lenihan if he wants to answer them.  Does he agree or disagree with the Fianna Fáil statement before the last general election that certificates should be introduced for children's allowances?  I suspect he does agree.  If he does, at what point would he introduce them?  Would he introduce them at the point which <Col N="1076" /> was proposed at which only 170,000 families would get benefit or would he prefer &mdash; and I gather from his speech he does prefer &mdash; that they be introduced at a point at which 319,000 families would get it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appears to be unduly obsessed with the election guarantees and statements.  I said on the Second Stage last night that part of the present Government's trouble is that they made very rash commitments in regard to the whole area of estate duty, in regard to the removal of VAT from food and in regard to the removal of health charges.  This is why the Government are so niggardly in regard to relief towards income taxpayers.  That £30 million is being thrown away by reason of rash election promises.</P>
      <P>I am not talking about the general election.  I am talking about the section of the Finance Bill that is before us.  That is section 3 of the Finance Bill, 1973.  I would ask at this stage, though I am certain it will be a fruitless request, that some brains be applied&mdash;they should have been applied when the matter was first raised in the Dáil &mdash; towards introducing a graded scale whereby basic social injustice would not exist, injustice such as results from a situation where people with large families on one side of the £2,500 are cut off and do not benefit from the children's allowances proposals in the Finance Bill and people with small families on the lower side of the £2,500 benefit. It is as basic as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about family incomes and the importance of families, the people working and raising families in the community, the people who are making a real contribution towards society.  This is so basic and rudimentary that I would have thought the Minister would appreciate <Col N="1077" /> what I am getting at and leave aside his obsession with election manifestos. He should feel a bit more secure now.  The election is over. There is no point in talking in terms of election manifestos.  We are talking in terms of a situation where the consumer price index in regard to food has risen eight times between the election and May compared with three times since February, 1972 and May, 1972.  We are living in a situation where the cost of living in regard to food alone stood at 131.6 points in February, 1972, and increased to 134.6 points in May, 1972.  This year the figure rose from 153.4 to 161.4 in the same period, and is probably still rising.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a new situation altogether.  The Minister should get it into his head that we are not fighting an election campaign but are talking about the people of the country who will be affected by this Finance Bill.  We are talking about a situation where the Minister has written in here that a £2,500 net income is the cut off point as far as children's allowances are concerned.  We are discussing a Finance Bill in which no concession is given to the income tax payer other than the niggardly concession to married working wives.  We are now faced in this section with not just a zero but a minus as far as the income tax payers and general income earning public are concerned who are in this category of over £2,500 a year, a category that will be massively increased if a national pay agreement in the months ahead is based on anything like the sort of escalating inflation that the present Government are contributing to.</P>
    <P>The Minister should stop talking about election manifestos and get down to the Finance Bill.  I ask the Minister to apply his brains and those of his Department to this matter and I would suggest again: why not a graded scheme, going to any level one likes and even far ahead of £2,500 a year, but at least a scheme based on the number of children per family instead of the existing scheme where there is a crude cut-off after £2,500 a year?  Why not have something of that kind which <Col N="1078" /> would take into account the basic social justice involved in looking after larger families?  It is as crude as that. I am pointing it out in black and white terms that somebody on one side of the £2,500 with six, eight, ten or 12 in the family is cut out and people on the other side with one, two or three children are in.  There could be nine more mouths to feed and because they are on one side of the barrier they are out.  A graded scheme surely should not have been beyond the wit of the Minister and the Department of Finance to devise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with what Senator Lenihan has been saying.  The method adopted for having this cut-off at £2,500 is an extraordinarily crude, rough and ready one.  It seems that on this occasion and a number of others the Government took the easy way out. Instead of thinking it through properly they adopted a rough and ready figure like this.  As Senator Lenihan has pointed out, someone with a very large family in or around the £3,000 figure is clearly not anything like as well off as parents with maybe only a couple of children at around £2,500.  Yet he gets none of these benefits and the others do.  It really seems a very strange way of doing it.</P>
      <P>There is one very small matter which the Minister might be able to elucidate. He just said that the income tax payer does not lose the whole of the increase in children's allowances but that there was a marginal amount left.  In the Dáil the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The reality of the situation is that of all the families receiving children's allowances only 40,000 will have to hand them back and not <i>in toto.</i> They will still be left a small amount of the increase.</P>
      <P>That is all very well but when one reads the explanatory memorandum to the Bill in the third paragraph one finds at the end:</P>
      <P>As the full amount of the increase is taken back by the reduction in allowances for income tax purposes, the reduction will not apply for surtax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> Which is correct, the memorandum or the Minister?  What is the position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, £15 is the amount of the additional children's allowances this year.  The maximum refund will be £14.70 so there is a gain of 30p per child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has, not for the first time perhaps, been less than candid when he said in the other House that after all they were not being taken <i>in toto</i>, that they had a bit left.  I think whatever his intention may have been the impression was certainly created that quite a bit more than 30p a householder was left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, in some cases the refund would not be as great particularly when you get into the marginal area, but there is marginal relief there.  Nobody will be any the worse off.  I think it is important, when suggestions were being made that taxpayers were being mulcted, to make it perfectly clear that nobody, even the surtax payer, will have any additional sum taken from him.  What is happening is that the social welfare increase is going only to the people who are in the lower income group.  I believe that that is a sustainable social policy for which we need make no apology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister explain why this change is being made.  It appears that this, I do not know if you could call it a concession but at any rate state of affairs in relation to trusts in favour of children, under which when the person became entitled to the capital sum he would have to claim personal allowances dating back for a number of years, is being ended now.  I wonder why is it so.  Was there some kind of abuse which arose?  Is it retrospective?  In other words, are trusts which were made last year or the year before last <Col N="1080" /> under the impression that this concession would still be in existence to be effected and will the child now not get the full benefit that was expected when the trust was set up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I can understand these legitimate fears of Senator Yeats and I should like to explain the purpose of this section briefly. The matter was raised in this House last year by Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  It is designed to deal with the problem in which extremely wealthy people can afford to assign under a trust certain income which is accumulated for the benefit of minors during their minority.  Because of this, the person creating the trust is saved tax on that money which is alienated to another and yet the minor when he comes of age can then apply for repayment of some of the income tax.  The trust will pay the tax all right but when the infant arrives at the majority age he can then apply for a refund.  This has enabled quite wealthy people to avoid payment of tax on money which they have assigned for the benefit of their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be arguable socially that it would be all right if everybody could do it, but when it is a device which is only available to the quite wealthy who have surplus income I think there is no moral justification for it.  On a legal basis, the Income Tax Act, 1967, section 154, deals with the cases of persons for whose benefit any income is accumulated under the terms of any will or settlement contingently on his attaining a specified age, or marrying. The section provides that, after the happening of the contingency, the person may within six years from the end of the tax year in which the contingency happens, make a claim for a repayment in respect of income tax which was paid by the trustees in respect of the income which arose during the period of accumulation.  The amount repayable is the amount which would have been repaid to the person concerned if the income had been his as of vested right during the years of accumulation by reference to his personal allowances and reliefs for those years.  It might also be of interest to <Col N="1081" /> know that this particular device was noted in the British Parliament in 1969 and it was closed in the British Finance Act, 1969.  The then Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he proposed to repeal the existing provisions, which we are now doing.  He said:</P>
    <P>This is an anomaly which even the most single-minded devotee of tax loopholes would find it difficult to defend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined to agree with the Minister that there is no particular reason why one should have undue sympathy with the people involved.  One wishes oneself had the kind of money that appears to be involved in this type of transaction.  I do not think he answered my second question as to whether it is retrospective.</P>

      <P>This is not really a matter for us but it puzzles me because I was told that this particularly relates to trade union pensions.  I think the Minister has given them what they have asked for.  It seems a little mean that since no change has been made for six years since 1967 all they are asking for is an increase from £350 to £450.  One wonders why somebody at one stage was not a little more generous with their pension schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a valid point but it will be appreciated that the increase now given is comparable to or perhaps slightly greater than the increase in the cost of living since 1967. The amounts paid by trade unions have tended to be on the low side but that is because there are limitations on their funds and their subscriptions.  One has to look at this in the historical sense.  There are other much better superannuation and benefits in provident schemes available outside what is available within trade unions themselves. If the trade union benefit was the only benefit now available to the people, this of course would be quite <Col N="1083" /> a ridiculous sum but there are now many better benefits obtainable elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Why are these particular groups taken out?  It seems a bit airy-fairy to confine a concession of this kind just to human rights groups under the UN and the Council of Europe.  There are many other bodies who should, from the point of view of tax concessions, be included in this category of charities.  Let us take, for example, Gorta, which is a national organisation under the FAO.  Why should Gorta not be regarded as a body suitable for this sort of treatment? This may be tied up with some conventions we have signed or to which we are committed, but it seems anomalous that we should pick out what I would regard as a very small field of voluntary activity related to international agencies while there are many other fields offering aid with which we are associated.  A similar concession should be given to Gorta.  I am rather puzzled and I should like an explanation from the Minister as to why this concession should be confined to the one area of human rights under conventions of both the Council of Europe and the UN.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">

      <P>I should like to raise a further point on this.  I also think it very odd indeed that these anomalous, mysterious bodies, some of which I have never heard of, should be mentioned. My argument is added to very considerably by a couple of lines in the introductory speech of the Taoiseach on the Second Reading.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country has, I regret, been somewhat lethargic in its adoption and its promotion of the observance of international conventions relating to fundamental human rights and freedoms.  In order to stimulate more public awareness of and <Col N="1084" /> direct involvement in this very important task the Bill made a special two-fold provision for tax relief.</P>
    <P>He goes on to describe sections 15 and 22.  We appear to be in a situation in which the Government are giving a tax concession to certain organisations in order that they can press upon the Government the need to sign certain conventions.  Would it not be much simpler for the Government to sign the conventions to start with and forget about the tax concessions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will.  I am sorry if Senator Lenihan does not like what I am saying.  I am trying to reply courteously to Senator Yeats.  The point has been made as to why we should not do more.  We would be happy to do more for other worthy organisations, but we thought it was timely that we should seek in some way to give encouragement to those organisations which do not get much money. We thought it might be some enticement to philanthropic people to consider some of these organisations if this tax concession were available. Unfortunately, we have a very sorry record in relation to signing and ratifying, respecting and putting into practice several international conventions concerning fundamental rights and human freedoms, not because we have individually or collectively any disinclination to do it but we simply have not done it in a formal way.  We would like to see that situation corrected. The reason why we chose to give this benefit only to organisations who had consultative status with the United Nations or the Council of Europe was because we wanted to ensure that spurious organisations claiming to serve fundamental rights and human freedoms would not get <Col N="1085" /> this benefit.  We do, unfortunately, know of some organisations who claim to be defending human rights and who, if they got their way, would trample upon the rights of most people.  Organisations do not get consultative status with either the UN or the Council of Europe unless they have passed very severe tests applied by these organisations.</P>
      <P>I was asked in the Dáil if I would name some specific organisations.  I expressed unwillingness to do so and it is preferable that I should not.  First of all, I am not certain of the exhaustive list of organisations who have such consultative status and there may well be organisations, including the one mentioned by Senator Lenihan, who could apply for, and qualify for, consultative status with these organisations.  If and when they do, and make their application to the Revenue Commissioners, then they will get the necessary concession. This benefit, as Senators are probably aware, is already available to people who covenant money to universities or colleges for the carrying on of research and income under covenants to schools for the teaching of the natural sciences.  This is a small extension of that.  Perhaps over the years we can extend this kind of concession, but one must realise that sometimes to extend these concessions opens a floodgate which might prove unduly costly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from what the Minister said, there is no contention in this matter.  I just mentioned Gorta off the top of my head; I am sure there are other organisations that would fit into the same philanthropic category.  The only thing that concerned me was that we were narrowing the area of tax concession in this desirable philanthropic area by confining it merely to the human rights area within both the UN and the Council of Europe.  I agree with the Minister that there are a lot of spurious organisations that carry this label and the Revenue Commissioners would find it difficult to decide between the few legitimate and the many illegitimate organisations in this category. An organisation like Gorta <Col N="1086" /> occurred to me straight away as an organisation under the FAO which is an agency of the United Nations and which is concerned with very legitimate practical help towards needy people when need arises.  This is a very practical area of help where the label of human rights is not involved. It has become a label in many areas. Am I right in interpreting the Minister as saying that organisations which may not necessarily carry a human rights label as such, on a literal interpretation of the United Nations or Council of Europe Conventions, such organisations may apply for this type of exemption to the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They would, first of all, have to get consultative status with the international bodies.  They would not necessarily have to recite fundamental human rights in their title in order to qualify for consultative status.  As long as an organisation is able to prove bona fide that it is pursuing certain UN objectives, it can get consultative status.  It would be a matter for proof in each case and each case would have to be dealt with on its merits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>But why confine ourselves in this very desirable area?  I am looking for the thinking behind the section.  Why confine ourselves to what the UN or the Council of Europe decide in regard to human rights validity or otherwise?  Can we not decide on such desirable national philanthropic groups without tying ourselves to some human rights convention or charter which in many cases is a lot of nonsense? There is no point in claiming extraordinary credit for signing some of these conventions.  Why can we not decide on what is desirable and philanthropic within the compass of our own sovereignty and treat such organisations as the Minister proposes under this section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator put a specific question to me so I must, therefore, answer it.  I am not prepared to accept that international conventions are a lot of waffle.  It is sad that they have been so regarded by so many people here.</P>

They are matters of truths which, unfortunately, people do not take seriously and particularly under stress. That is one of the sad things about life. I do not regard this as the end of the concessions which ought to be given to organisations of this particular kind. We are making a start this year.  We think we are making it in the right direction.  We will see how it works.  If we consider that this is unduly restrictive and that organisations which are legitimately pursuing these aims have some administrative difficulty in getting consultative status with the UN and the Council of Europe, we will take another look at it.  It may well be that we would consider other ends of a merciful and humanitarian kind, but we believe in walking before we run.</P>

      <P>This is welcome of course.  I know there has been tremendous and rightful agitation and concern about thalidomide children.  I am glad that this matter has been met here under section 19 but I feel this is an area of social progress that should be furthered.  There are other people suffering to the same or a greater degree than thalidomide children and <Col N="1088" /> I should like to think that they also come in for consideration in this regard. I do not know what machinery one would establish to keep this matter under review but it is a very desirable area.  It is an area you cannot widen too much &mdash; I can see the problems of any Minister for Finance here &mdash; but now that we have accepted this as a matter that should be dealt with in regard to thalidomide cases we should not ignore other cases of even greater severity which arise and which should merit the same attention.  What machinery should be established to do this or to ensure this can be done is another day's work, but I think this matter should be kept under constant review and attention should be continually devoted to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section which will ensure that children in Ireland who are victims of thalidomide will be put precisely in the same position as children in Germany who will be receiving payments from the same fund.  It is provided under Federal German law that children in receipt of capital or income from the fund will not have their incomes subjected to tax. I might also point out this section also ensures that a father is not to be deprived of the income tax allowance in respect of a child who has income from this German fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To deal with the other point raised by Senator Lenihan, he himself was good enough to provide the answer for me.  We, of course, all have the natural inclination to go to the assistance of people who are handicapped.  Most people tend to want to use the income tax system to provide that assistance. Probably it is not the best way either to recognise or to give assistance to handicapped people.  It may well be better to provide the assistance to identifiable cases rather than opening the flood gates to claims under the fiscal code which may be very difficult either to prove or disprove.  That is one of the great difficulties involved here. How do you, for instance, under the fiscal code deal with a malingerer?  I say that without reference to any particular welfare code.  The Revenue Commissioners are not qualified to deal with cases of either mental or physical <Col N="1089" /> handicap.  It is better to deal with such cases through the ordinary welfare code and the system of family health rather than dealing with it through the fiscal system.</P>
    <P>We are bringing in this provision for the unfortunate thalidomide children of whom we believe there may be up to 150 in the country. Most of them, if there is income tax involved, will be relieved.  This will ensure that they will be in no way disadvantaged compared with their fellow victims in Germany.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that it would be altogether impractical to help all handicapped people by means of the income tax system but he should consider looking at this from the point of view of those who have been injured, say, in road accidents and get an award in court which may be a very large sum of money.  If the victim should be paralysed, perhaps the money is invested for him.  He has to live on the interest on that money, but I understand that money is assessed for income tax purposes.  These cases seem to me to be precisely on the same footing as thalidomide cases.  They are easy to keep track of because they are court awards.  The Minister should consider very seriously the possibility of adding this category of people to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a slight difference.  In road accident cases, where damages are paid in court, the court in assessing damages take into account the victim's liability for income tax on the award.  Just as in calculating the person's likely income if injuries were not sustained they take into account what the person's net income would be after deduction of anticipated tax.  The two categories are not quite on par because of that fact.  It is only right that the wrongdoer should be made liable for the income tax liability of the victim. Were we to introduce a law which said that such damages or compensation would not be liable to income tax the beneficiary would not be the victim but the wrongdoer or that person's insurance company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the point which the Minister has just made, the position about income tax on losses which are suffered by a person injured in an accident is going through a type of transition period in the courts.  The position at the moment, as I understand it, is that the courts will allow the loss of wages to date, makes allowance for the fact that income tax would have been paid and allow the award to be somewhat smaller because of that.  They do not allow it for the future for the reason that if a person is totally disabled he will have to invest the money which he gets and he would, in fact, have to pay income tax on it. Even though they may say that this man would have earned £2,000 a year for the next 20 years and he would have to pay income tax on it, the courts take the view that that should not be taken into account because the amount will be invested and income tax will be payable on the income from the investment.  To that extent Senator Yeats is right in saying that possibly the Minister should look at this kind of situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain the rationale behind the choice of subjects which are singled out here for income tax relief. Two areas are mentioned, the area of industrial relations and the area of <Col N="1091" /> marketing.  There is a third clause which states &ldquo;any other subject which is approved for the purposes of this section by the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The subjects chosen deal with productivity, or the sort of entrepreneurial area of our national life.  It makes a distinction between fundamental and applied research in universities. In the third case it is confined to universities where, quite clearly, such research could be as valuably carried out in technological colleges and various institutes.  Does this mean that the Government are only concerned with helping those areas which are, in the crude materialistic sense, productive or would clause (c) admit a subject which, in the first place, would involve pure research, say, into the areas concerned &mdash; industrial, marketing or commercial &mdash; or would it also admit research into matters which are not strictly productive such as knowledge?  It may be a remote possibility that some industrial organisation or commercial combine would endow research in metaphysics, in literature or in poetry or, more relevantly, in languages but it would be unfortunate if this were not possible under clause (c).  Singling out these two materialistic entrepreneurial areas of research indicates a materialistic bias behind the thinking of those who framed the legislation.  I should like to hear the Minister's comment on clause (c).  What kind of area of research might possibly be approved? I am not suggesting they should endow a chair of polemics or a lectureship for student agitation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will recall that the Taoiseach, in replying to the Second Stage, dealt with this point.  Perhaps the Senator was absent at the time.  The reason why the two specific disciplines of industrial relations and marketing are mentioned in the Bill is that specific proposals have already been made to found chairs in these two disciplines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (c) could be used to cover the several worthy objectives which the Senator referred to but the power is reserved to the Minister for <Col N="1092" /> Finance to consider these proposals if and when they are made.  There is no intention of confining this benefit to universities.  If concrete proposals are put forward where substantial sums of money would be covenanted to or made available for other institutions of learning and research, we would not hesitate to take the necessary legislative action to bring them in.  We are hopeful that we have not just turned on the green light for universities in relation to this matter this year but, perhaps, people will do some serious thinking about it and we may have worthwhile proposals for consideration in future years. There will not be any great loss by not making the provision in this Bill for any such proposals as usually it takes at least a year or two to formulate them and to make the financial resources available.  I would encourage Senators to incite philanthropists to step forward and we can deal with these cases when they arise.</P>

This matter has been abused to the extent of taking out to dinner and providing holiday facilities for one's friends and rivals in the same line of business not for the purpose of generating trade but to have a high social life at the expense of the taxpayer.

It is a penalty which is only imposed after court proceedings are taken against a defaulter and the court is satisfied that the person has been guilty of default.  In a case where a person has inadvertently or, perhaps, on medical grounds omitted to make returns they would not be caught.  It is only used by the Revenue Commissioners when they are are satisfied that there is wilful default or negligence.</P>

      <P>I do not think it was necessary to impose this tax at all. It was part of the only little comfort that the less privileged of our people had.  While we may be gathering in revenue, we are depriving them of a certain amount of enjoyment.  Because of the five-day week nowadays and the amount of leisure time people have at their disposal, that type of legitimate enjoyment should be encouraged rather than discouraged.</P>

      <P>I am only dealing with the extra taxation.  The net yield from this addition is £4.68 million.  I do not know whether the Senator will be encouraged or discouraged by the knowledge that the consumption appears to be rising rather than declining since the budget.  There has, in fact, been quite a significant increase in tobacco consumption in recent years despite the efforts of the State to discourage people from it for health reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be various lines of thought on this.  At one end of it through the medium of television we are encouraging people to indulge in tobacco and here, in the Dáil and Seanad, we are trying to prevent them by adding on extra taxation.  My contention is, especially in regard to plug tobacco and a particular type of cigarettes, that they are an essential part of life at present. It is wrong to continually add on tax to cigarettes and tobacco in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that in rural areas <Col N="1096" /> pensioners and elderly people enjoy a smoke.  Even in other countries they enjoy smoking, too.  The Indians enjoyed their pipe of peace.  A contented community is very important. Weighing them down with taxation on commodities is unjust.  They do not go to the races or go on foreign holidays.  Many of our rural people enjoy their pipe of plug tobacco.  Each year it has become the tradition to increase the taxes on tobacco.  It is time that a halt was called to it.  We have lots of talk about cigarette smoking causing cancer, and doctors agree and disagree about it.  It would be much better if we, at some stage, got away from those so-called traditional avenues of taxation and let the people enjoy themselves.  After all, we are in this world to enjoy ourselves in a reasonably healthy manner.  The rural man or the small income man is entitled to enjoy his cigarette or his pipe of tobacco.  Extra taxation should not be imposed on the less fortunate and the lower paid income group year after year.  The higher income group smoke cigars.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to get into a theological argument with Senator Dolan on the Finance Bill but I would have thought we were in this world not for enjoyment but to win enjoyment in the next.  If I were assured that one would obtain universal peace in Ireland by the removal of tax from tobacco, I would certainly remove it.  But I do not think there is any social, political, or moral evidence that peace would be obtained by the removal of tax from tobacco.  I said earlier that I have an open mind.  If any conclusive evidence of this can be produced, I will certainly yield.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;no.&rdquo; I am trying to get to the figures.  Certainly in percentage they are less than <Col N="1097" /> has often been imposed.  When I get the figures I will produce them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why it is necessary to use percentages. We all know you can play around with figures to suit each side.  The facts are that non-tipped cigarettes have been increased by three new pence a packet.  We have had budgets in the past that were described by the Minister's party, when in opposition, as &ldquo;cruel budgets&rdquo; but which carried increases of only a few pence on the packet of cigarettes.  An increase of three new pence, which in old money is equivalent to 7½d, is &mdash; I speak subject to correction on this, and no doubt I will be if I am wrong &mdash; the greatest increase ever imposed by any Minister for Finance in any budget in the history of this State.</P>
      <P>A few minutes ago the Minister stated that even with this increase the cigarette consumption appears to be on the increase.  There was a time cigarettes were considered a luxury. Today cigarettes could be, for many of us, an absolute necessity.  Whether cigarette smoking is good for us or bad for us should not be a consideration in this budget.  In this section the Minister is imposing the greatest increase ever in the history of the State on this necessity of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I inadvertently said that the figure was not greater than any imposed in the last 20 years.  I was thinking of the total increase in duty on beer, spirits and tobacco when I said that.  The total figure is a lot less.  In relation to cigarettes the increase is, all right, three pence this year, but in relation to the amount of money now being spent on cigarettes, and the total price, the increase is not significantly greater than has been imposed in the past.  We live in a different day and age to ten or 20 years ago and I think percentages do matter because they indicate what people are prepared to spend on a commodity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To quote the words of the immortal Deputy Haughey, he said on one occasion that the old reliables always <Col N="1098" /> come up smiling no matter what you impose upon them.  A Minister for Finance naturally succumbs to the temptation to use them.  It appears that the old reliables, even in relation to tobacco, are still smiling after the budget this year and in fact the consumption is on the increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are rapidly reaching the saturation point.  Tobacco has become much too dear.  The question of cigarette smoking from the medical viewpoint is another matter. The Minister could get over that by removing the tax on ordinary pipe tobacco and encouraging the people to smoke a pipe rather than cigarettes. I would not like to see the youth of this country prevented from enjoying a smoke if they felt like it.  It would be much better than have them going on drugs.  These are problems which we have with the youth at the present.  I would not encourage people to start smoking.  But in regard to those who are addicted to it and those who got a certain amount of enjoyment out of smoking all through life, it would be wrong in their old age to try to force them to abandon such practices and try convert them overnight.  The Minister should seriously consider this matter especially in regard to plug tobacco and pipe smokers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to enlighten me &mdash; I am an amateur as far as tobacco and smoking are concerned &mdash; as to what these extra ingredients might be.  What are they composed of?  Where are they made? Where are they obtained and why are they included in tobacco for export? To where do we export the tobacco?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the present law, that is the Tobacco Act, 1842, a tobacco manufacturer may not use any material other than tobacco and water in the manufacture of cigarettes.  The purpose of this restriction is to prevent the adulteration of cigarettes at the expense of the revenue.  Recently a proposal was made for the establishment of a factory in Ireland to manufacture cigarettes for export consisting of a blend of tobacco and a synthetic tobacco.  The purpose of this section is to enable this industry to get under way, but the product will be for export only.  Therefore, it has not any revenue significance as far as we are concerned, but it has got the possibility of developing in Ireland a new cigarette.  As time goes on and experience is obtained in relation to the attitude of smokers to the new cigarette and to the extent of the knowledge relating to its health hazards or possibilities, then the matter can be examined so far as the home market is concerned.  It means we have immediately available to us what could be a significant new industrial enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just made the inquiry because I was interested to know what material would be included in this.  It was news to me to know that we are going to enter into the cigarette export market.  What I am interested in, apart from the revenue, is whether it could be that we are endeavouring to try something out on the dog.  Are we sure that this type of operation will not be <Col N="1100" /> injurious to the health of the people, irrespective of where they live?  In a matter that would affect the health of the people of any nation I do not think we should contribute to it in any way if it involved any danger whatever, even if it meant some employment for our people.  I should not like to see anybody in this country engaged in such an activity.  I am not saying that it might have that effect but if it should we should be clear on it before we give our blessing to it.</P>

      <P>I am glad to say that I have the same reservations, being a person concerned with human rights and fundamental freedoms, as might be recognised from other sections in this Bill.  I am most anxious that we would not try out anything on the rest of mankind that we would not be prepared to risk ourselves.  Investigations were made into the health consequence and there is no reason to believe or to anticipate that there are any greater health hazards in relation to the use of the particular synthetic fibre which will be used than already exists in relation to tobacco plants and, indeed, the possibilities are that it may be very much better.</P>
      <P>The proposal of the manufacturers in question at the moment is only to engage in the export market.  They have not made any proposal to use the product here and, therefore, for the time being we are not making any new approaches in the matter. The exemption will allow cigarettes to be manufactured for export and if and when the proposal comes to make the commodity available on the Irish market we can have a look at it in that situation.</P>

I should like to know if he has any information regarding this type of cigarette being used in any other civilised country and what effects it has had on the consumer.  Was it through kindness that these people came in here, or do they intend to use us to try it out on the rest of mankind?  I should like to be perfectly clear on it because I should not like to see the <Col N="1101" /> good name of our country defiled in any way.  It may be a genuine, sincere effort.  If it is, I welcome it wholeheartedly but I should like to know if the Minister has any information on it.</P>

      <P>First of all, I speak as a convert from the habit of smoking and most of my travels have been in the non-smoking period, so I have not yet tested the commodity myself. Secondly, it is a totally new experiment and I am not aware that it is yet being marketed commercially anywhere.  The proposals of the manufacturers are to manufacture here and to export to Britain where it will shortly be available on a commercial basis.  Seeing that there are, on the neighbouring island, much larger samples of people from different walks of life, I think their intention is to carry out a consumer research of the operation.  If the market takes to it, then we could be well on the threshold of a considerable industrial development here.  Why they chose Ireland, I do not know but, of course, we have tax incentives and grants and other facilities to encourage industrial investment in Ireland and this is one of the consequences of it.  It could not get off the ground unless we were to amend the law in this respect and that is what we are doing.</P>

      <P>The Imposition of Duties, Excise Duties, Firearms Certificates Order, 1972: this order increases the excise duty payable on firearms certificates.  There is the Statutory Instrument 220 of 1972, the Imposition of Duties, Customs and Excise Duties and Form of Tariff Order, 1972.  The effect of that was really to bring the customs requirements in this country into conformity with those of the EEC.  It came into operation on 1st January last.  The Imposition of Duties, Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff Order, 1973, had a similar effect in relation to the EEC on certain kinds of paper, building materials, of asbestos, cement, hinges, for motor vehicles <i>et cetera.</i><Col N="1103" /> There was another Imposition of Duties Customs and Excise Duties and Form of Tariff Order in 1973, which extended the scheme of tariff preferences for developing countries. The Imposition of Duties No. 203 Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff Order, 1973, also adopted EEC common customs tariff nomenclature and removed the duties on newsprint and on motor vehicles, fan belts of Northern Ireland origin and made a certain number of consequential changes.  The Imposition of Duties No. 204, Customs Duties and the Form of Customs Tariff Order, 1973, provided that the rates of customs duty be applied to certain goods of Northern Ireland or UK origin; and the Statutory Instruments No. 83 Order of 1973 dealt with beer, spirits, tobacco, hydrocarbon oils and wine. It removed certain minor protective elements on the customs duties of beer, spirits and recognised medical preparations, tobacco and hydrocarbon oils in the case of imports from other than EEC countries.  The reason why it was done was that the cost of collection was greater than the revenue would yield.</P>

      <P>In this section it is proposed to increase the exemption limits from £7,500 to £10,000.  Most of us would agree that the main factor contributing to the defeat of Fianna Fáil in the last election and the success of the National Coalition Government was a clear, firm and categorical promise by the Coalition parties, as they then were, to wipe out death duties.  It is, therefore, disappointing <Col N="1104" /> for many people who believed the Coalition parties' promise was an honest one to learn that the limit has been increased by only £2,500.  In recent years the value of land has escalated, particularly with the advent of the EEC, so that this provision will give no extra help.</P>
      <P>A year ago land which would have been valued at £7,500 would be valued at £10,000 today.

      <P>This section is a first step towards fulfilment of the Government's intention to replace estate duty with taxation confined to the really wealthy and property passing at a death outside the immediate family and in the interim to provide relief for the cases of greatest hardship. The effect of this particular relief this year is to relieve 530 people from estate duties.  It is estimated that the number of estate duty cases this year will be about 3,000.  This relief alone, <Col N="1105" /> without taking into account other reliefs provided for widows and dependent children and in respect of insurance policies, is going to help 530 of those 3,000 cases.  That is a very substantial step to take.</P>
      <P>In reply to the Senator's other query as to when the estate duties will be replaced by an alternative system, all I can say is that the preparation of a White Paper dealing with this matter is now well advanced.  This White Paper is being published in response to a specific request received from interested parties that the Government would indicate in advance of legislation what their proposals were.  Any mature person knows that any question of taxation of wealth &mdash; and that is what estate duties are &mdash; is a matter that has to be very carefully approached so that if we endeavour to achieve a more socially just form of taxation we will not in the course of doing it err in any case at all.</P>
      <P>That is why we are preparing our White Paper.  As soon as this White Paper is published we will be anxious to meet all interested parties to discuss with them their reaction to the Government's proposals.  We have already indicated in my budget statement in the other House that the speed with which we can act to replace the existing system with an alternative form of tax confined to wealthy people will depend upon the co-operation we receive from interested parties.  Knowing how anxious people are to achieve this reform I feel certain that co-operation will be forthcoming.  I, therefore, confidently expect that we will not have very long to wait before this desirable social improvement is brought about.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to deal overmuch with the shamelessness of the disregard of the election promise with regard to death duties.  It was possibly the most corrupting and shameless piece of chicanery in democracy in this country in our time.  Last night I mentioned in my speech on the Second Reading of the Bill the specific nature of the promise&mdash;&ldquo;we will abolish death duties&rdquo;&mdash;incorporated <Col N="1106" /> in the 14-point plan.  It is painful to have to read over it.  I leave it to the President of the Irish Farmers' Association to deal with the matter adequately. He has already dealt with it. The Minister refrained from even giving the President of the Irish Farmers' Association the courtesy of a reply.  I leave it to the public and particularly farming public to judge the shamelessness of the rejection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not intend to enter into that particular arena at all. What I am concerned about is the arena in which the 14-point plan as announced and in which a very specific commitment was made in words which cannot be dismissed in any ambivalent fashion.  These words quite clearly set out that as far as the unjust burden of estate duties are concerned, such as property passing to widows and their children, the Government will abolish these duties.  There was no question of considering the matter, sending the matter on for committee consideration or asking that a White Paper be introduced. It was stated that the Government would abolish estate duties on property passing to widows and their children and replace them with another form of taxation.  This statement was issued on 8th February, 1973.  I do not intend to refer any more to this question. I believe the President of the Irish Farmers' Association will act appropriately on behalf of the Irish farmers. I am certain the Irish farmers will remember this particular matter in the secrecy of the polling station on the next occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that total rejection of a total commitment we have the niggardly nature of the increase.  What amazes me is the brazen effrontery behind the Minister for Finance's thinking <Col N="1107" /> and the Government's thinking. They should have known at the time of the making of the commitment that the abolition of death duties just could not be done by a wave of the hand. There are very specific international commitments, particularly in regard to Great Britain, in this matter.  The Minister is well aware of this.  There were front bench finance spokesmen with research facilities costing £15,000 per year from 1967.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>£10,000.  The Minister and his colleagues were aware in February of 1973 that these duties could not be abolished, to use the crude black and white phrase adopted. Leaving aside that aspect, and allowing for the fact that the Government found themselves in a mess, unable to meet a specific commitment, consider the brazen effrontery and contempt of public opinion involved in raising the limit from £7,500 to £10,000 in a year when land values and property values have doubled.  A mere mechanical gesture, which would have been adopted by any Government; a facist, a communist, or any other type of government, would raise the minimum level in the ordinary course of events in accordance with the fall in the value of land and property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is elementary and to regard this as meeting a commitment of that nature is an outrageous insult to the intelligence of public opinion.  The Minister is well aware that £7,500 to £10,000 is not a change; it is the <i>status quo</i>.  Indeed, even recognition of the <i>status quo</i> should have lead to a higher levelling-up than £7,500 to £10,000. We allow for the rejection of electoral commitments, the insult to the public intelligence involved in raising the limit from £7,500 to £10,000, but I cannot understand, if the Minister and the Government wish to do this why they do not raise substantially the artificial valuation of land that is assessed by the Estate Duty Office under the Revenue Commissioners and why, through that mechanism, the Minister for Finance cannot find an immediate way of relieving substantially death duties.  I should like <Col N="1108" /> to offer that suggestion to the Minister and hear his views on it.  This can be done quite simply by an amendment of the existing section and this method would obviate all difficulties in the matter and give the Minister for Finance an immediate and practical way of giving relief to landholders</P>

      <P>Senator Lenihan is a great tempter and when I hear him using phrases which possibly only he could use in this connection such as &ldquo;outrageous insult&rdquo;, &ldquo;brazen hypocrisy&rdquo;, &ldquo;shameless disregard of election promises&rdquo;, &ldquo;rejection of electoral commitments&rdquo;, he tempts me to rise and say a few words in reply.</P>
      <P>We have just been listening to a man who belonged to a party which formed the Government for 16 years continuously and who was himself a member of the Government for about half of that 16 years.  What effort was ever made by that Government to tackle the question of death duties?  I regard it as certainly an unintentional but a great tribute to the ability of the present Government that Senator Lenihan and his colleagues in the opposite benches should indulge in this type of criticism because it shows what they feel they are entitled to expect from a National Coalition Government after five-and-a-half months in office as compared with what they know they could not and did not get from a Fianna Fáil Government after 16 successive years in office.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind Members of the House of exactly what was stated in the declaration of intent by the National Coalition Parties during the general election campaign and I assert there is no iota of departure from the commitment given to the electorate.  I do not believe any elector expected the full implementation of this declaration of intent in less than six months from a new Government. There is no point in anyone misleading himself on that score.  The declaration made by the National Coalition parties in regard to this matter read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to relieving the heavy and unjust burden on ordinary house purchasers and farmers, the <Col N="1109" /> National Coalition Government will abolish estate duties on property passing on death to widows and their children and replace them...</P>
    <P>This is important as it is part of the commitment</P>
    <P>and replace them with taxation confined to the really wealthy and to property passing on death outside the immediate family.</P>
    <P>Will anyone reading that objectively and with a fair mind say there was a commitment to abolish death duties and do nothing else?  There was not; there was a commitment to abolish estate duties and to replace them with a new form of taxation.  There are no two ways about this and there is not the slightest retreat from it in any utterance by the Minister for Finance, to the Taoiseach or any other member of the Government.  There is no retreat from that in section 53 of the Finance Bill before us.  In relation to this section, in his Second Reading speech in this House the Taoiseach dealt perfectly honestly and straightforwardly with the position when he stated:</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is concerned with death duties and contains the interim reliefs in the field of estate duty which are designed to alleviate the greatest hardship of the system pending its replacement by a new system of capital taxation....</P>
    <P>He may have been too optimistic in this in regard to some Senators:</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that the abolition of estate duty, to which the Government are totally committed, could not be done without making provision for an alternative form of capital taxation.  Quite apart from the revenue involved, which is substantial, a balanced system of taxation requires that large holdings of wealth should be taxed, in addition to whatever other forms of taxation apply to income and expenditure.</P>
    <P>What is being done now in section 53 of the Bill is only part of the story. It is only part of the progress the Minister for Finance is making in <Col N="1110" /> relation to this area of death duties and estate duty.  We are dealing with the section which is increasing the ceiling from £7,500 to £10,000.  In addition the abatement for widows is being increased from £2,000 to £4,000 and for children from £1,000 to £2,000. As the Taoiseach spelled out in the Second Reading, insurance policies up to £7,500 are no longer to be aggregable for estate duty purposes.  This is no small step for a Minister for Finance less than six months in office.  It is a giant stride compared with the best Fianna Fáil did during their 16 years in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins has been doing his best to prop up a bad case.  It is a mistake for him or any Member of the Coalition to read the undertaking they gave during the general election campaign with regard to the abolition of estate duty.  The impression they are now attempting to give is that all they ever stated was that some day they would abolish death duties in respect of property passing to a widow or children and would replace it with some kind of wealth tax.  As Senator O'Higgins kindly reminded us, that is not what they stated at the general election: what they then stated was that they would abolish death duties on property passing to a widow and children and replace it by some form of wealth taxation of the &ldquo;really wealthy.&rdquo;  The &ldquo;really wealthy&rdquo; is the operative phrase.</P>
      <P>I suggest that Senator O'Higgins should bend his mind to this question. Is a man with 100 acres of good land and rearing a family on that farm to be classified as &ldquo;really wealthy&rdquo;?  It is a matter of practical day to day life that not more than 1 per cent of Irish farmers could in any interpretation of the expression be classified as &ldquo;really wealthy&rdquo;.  The Members of the Coalition parties told the farmers categorically that death duties were to be abolished on farms passing to a widow or children and that they would not be replaced by any other form of taxation. That is not what they are stating now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They say it is unreasonable of us to ask them to carry out this promise so soon.  We are not the only people doing <Col N="1111" /> this.  The President of the Irish Farmers Association recently wrote a letter to the Minister for Finance in which he complained about the outrageous comments made on his integrity by the Minister in the Dáil some weeks earlier.  In this letter he stated in reference to a letter he wrote to the Taoiseach before the Presidential Election and I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of July 23rd:</P>
    <P>In my letter to An Taoiseach I drew his attention to the pre-election promise of the Coalition Government to abolish estate duty.  I went on to say.  There is dismay among the farming community that this promise has so far not been honoured, and while we have been promised a White Paper on taxation, there is no indication as to when it will be published or when estate duty will be removed.  These commitments, solemnly given by the Coalition parties before the (General) Election, clearly influenced the outcome of same....</P>
    <P>...This was, and still is, a burning issue, especially among the farming community.  No topic has been so tested in recent times as has the removal of estate duty.  Thousands and thousands of people attended meetings all over the country specifically arranged to discuss this subject.</P>
    <P>So it is not only those on this side of the House who are raising the issue.  It is a matter of great interest to farmers and one which the Irish Farmers' Association feel strongly about. Senator O'Higgins should not suggest that all they stated was that some time in the unspecified future estate duty will be replaced by another form of wealth tax.  That is not what was stated.  The term &ldquo;really wealthy&rdquo; does not cover more than 1 per cent of the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The points so ably made by Senator Lenihan must have nettled Senator O'Higgins.  Naturally he would like to take his party and his colleagues in the Coalition Government off the hook in this matter. On every pole and gate pier these 14 points were posted and they will be <Col N="1112" /> a sad reminder as the years go on.  It is of no benefit to tell farmers that estate duties will be abolished in the distant future or that they will be replaced by another form of taxation. This effort of raising from £7,500 to £10,000 the exemption for estate duties means nothing because the value of money has depreciated while the price of land has increased.  Those with knowledge of land realise that £10,000 is not an excessive price for a medium-sized farm with a residence in any part of the country.</P>
      <P>There are many intelligent men in the Government but many of them are far removed from rural Ireland. If they were living on the land they would know that during the last three or four years, and especially since our entry into the EEC, the price of land has sky-rocketted.  We know from reports circulated and from inducements given to farmers to expand, that the farmers are the real wealth of the nation.  There will be a great future for the farming community and for farm produce in the EEC if we are geared to avail of it but we cannot be geared to avail of the higher prices in the EEC unless we can use our farms in an intelligent way in a modern world.  This is 1973 and not the Stone Age.  The amount of money involved in running a modern farm valued at, say, £10,000 is very high. The farmer who seeks a loan will not get the same credit facilities as people in other walks of life.  In many instances the farm is not really owned by the man who occupies it.  It could be in the names of his grandparents and has never changed down the years.  A son has the use of it during his lifetime and when he dies someone else takes over.  It can never be realised in money terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in acting the hypocrite and expecting a widow with a large family or expecting the ordinary farmer to believe we are granting them some concession by raising this limit from £7,500 to £10,000.  How many here realise that a good tractor costs more than £2,000 and that modern farming equipment costs a colossal amount of money?  I am not being critical of any member of the <Col N="1113" /> Government and I appreciate the Minister is very capable but that will not prevent me from doing my best to ensure that he or his party will not get off the hook lightly regarding the promises that were made during the election campaign.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BobAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers of Ireland are very worried over death duties.  There is no doubt in anybody's mind here that the Coalition Government in the last election promised that they would do away with death duties. It was definitely stated in my county that not alone would they amend death duty legislation but they would do away with death duties entirely.</P>
      <P>Whether we have a Fianna Fáil Government or a Coalition Government, the farmers of Ireland want this death duties obstacle removed.  They have fought for hundreds of years to hold on to their land.  I know of young farmers whose parents have died during the last three months and who will be forced to sell their land to pay the death duties.  It is wrong that any Government should allow this injustice to continue.  People over the past 40 years or 50 years have slaved on their lands and fought over it, but now their own Government are trying to take it away from them.  If parents die and the death duties on the farm are not paid over five years, the farm can be sold to pay off those duties.</P>
      <P>The land of Ireland is the wealth of Ireland and anything we can do to work the land as it should be worked should be undertaken immediately.  To avoid death duties our young farmers are inclined to sell their farms and get out.  The farmers of Ireland respect their holdings as they have gone through much hardship to hold on to them.  I do not mind what Government are in power but it is essential that those unjust death duties should be done away with completely.  If revenue is necessary it should be got from some other source.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to minimise the importance of this worry to anybody, including farmers, but it is time we got this whole question <Col N="1114" /> into proper perspective.  Four per cent of all the estate duty paid in this country came from farmers.  The average number of farmers who go to their eternal reward annually is 6,500 and of that 6,500 the average number who pay estate duty&mdash;I am bearing in mind the latest figures in valuations, stock and so forth&mdash;is less than 100.  As loud as the cry has been, as much protest as there has been, as much as we appreciate the anxiety which is being generated&mdash;some of it without foundation&mdash;the realities indicate that of any section in the community the farming community is the least affected.</P>
      <P>The reliefs given in this year's budget will have the effect of relieving about 25 per cent of the estate duty payers.  That includes farmers, who in fact will be relieved to an even greater extent because of the artificial valuation.  The artificial valuation is most significant.  This is the reason why farmers represent such a small proportion of the number of people who are liable for estate duty.  The artificial valuation will be of greater significance in the future than in the past because far more farmers have borrowed money from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, from the banks and from other agencies to buy land, to improve their buildings and to stock their farms.  Where a person has borrowed money they get an artificial valuation, which means that the market value of their land is not taken into account but only £25 to every £1 valuation.  There is nobody here or anywhere else who can tell me that £25 represents the market value of £1 of rateable valuation today.  It is a great deal more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying any of this to diminish the commitment of this Government to replace estate duties with a more equitable form of tax.  The great drawback of estate duty&mdash;we identified it in our policy statements and this is our view&mdash;is that it falls on a family in one lump at a time of great distress, frequently when the breadwinner, the person who accumulated the wealth through his sweat, labour and a lifetime of endeavour, is no longer with them.  There are, of course, provisions <Col N="1115" /> in the existing law whereby persons may pay estate duty&mdash;for instance farmers, because this applies to land&mdash; over a period of eight years.  The interesting thing is that the number of farmers who elect to pay estate duty over a period of eight years is only about one in eight.  Only a minority elect to pay over a period of eight years and this is indicative of the fact that the amount which they are required to pay in most cases is within their current capacity to pay.</P>
    <P>A second reason why estate duty is inequitable is that the really rich can avoid payment of estate duties because a millionaire may alienate or give away part of his estate to his next-of-kin or to anybody he likes more than five years before death and thereby avoid anybody having to pay estate duty on that money.  It is the really wealthy who are not at present being caught, because estate duty is our only form of capital taxation.  A millionaire can alienate £900,000 of his money by giving it away to his next-of-kin and still live happily, contented and secure for the rest of his days on £100,000.  Such a person escapes under our present system.  There are a multitude of reasons&mdash;far beyond the hardship to the farming community, which I am not minimising&mdash;why we need to have a more equitable form of tax.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to Senator Dolan that I am not far removed from the country, as he knows.  Half of the blood in my veins comes from Cavan, so I appreciate entirely what he says. When I talk about the proportion of farmers who are paying estate duty, most of the farmers I have in mind would not be from Cavan.  There would not be many small holdings in counties like Cavan or counties in the West of Ireland who would have to bear estate duty.  I do not think we are doing a service to them to be generating unnecessary fears.  Senator Lenihan may want to play on the words &ldquo;generating fears&rdquo; but more fears have been stimulated than are justified in practice.  Estate duty is a burden, but it is not confined to any one section of the community.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude on this note. The Irish Farmers' Association, <Col N="1116" /> through their representative, Mr. T. J. Maher, has recently acknowledged, and I have printed his acknowledgement, that it would be wrong to abolish estate duty unless you brought in at the same time an alternative form of capital taxation.  If you did not do that, you would encourage speculation in farm land.  We are not going to allow that situation to develop no matter what attacks may be made upon us.</P>
    <P>We are the people who, like the Opposition, are in the political arena. We realise that they are perfectly free to take whatever passing advantage they can out of the existing situation by saying that we did not build Rome in a day.  We did not build Rome in a day nor did we let Rome collapse in a day.  We believe we would be doing a serious disservice, particularly to the farming community, if we were to abolish estate duty without providing an alternative to it which would ensure that we would not have dangerous speculation, which in the long run would be more harmful to the farming community and to everybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BobAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one question.  Could he reduce the five years?  This is where the real hardship lies.  If a farmer has a family reared and is anxious to give up his place to avoid death duties, he could do so today and be dead in two or three years' time.  Why not reduce the period to six months or one year? Five years is too long to wait.  A young man with a young family is expected to give up at 40 years of age.  At age 50 or 60 he would be more prepared to give it up.</P>

      <P>Continuing the point I was making, was it not open at all stages to the Minister and the Government to adopt this procedure in a straightforward and immediate manner to facilitate the farming community and meet the commitment which the farming community thought had been made to them?  They hoped for a substantial extension of the limit of the value of an estate for determining the applicability of the artificial value of agricultural land.  The raising of the £7,500 minimum limit to £10,000 did not meet the situation in any way.  Through this means there was an immediate way to meet the situation and honour a commitment, at some cost to the Exchequer such as is involved in every commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, the formula for artificial valuation is one that is not readily understood. It works with very significant <Col N="1118" /> advantage to farmers, and for that reason only a small percentage of them pay estate duty.  I should like to give a sample, as I do not wish to give particulars which might identify a particular estate.  This is a case involving an estate the acreage of which was about 240 acres with a rateable valuation on the land of £200 and on buildings £36.  That estate was valued for estate duty purposes at £1,925 and was accordingly exempt from payment of estate duty.  Within one year that farm was sold on the market for £110,000.</P>
      <P>That is a sample of the kind of advantage which accrues to farmers by reason of this artificial valuation. We have increased the area of the applicability of artificial valuation by 50 per cent this year, at a time when a large percentage of farmers, and particularly those who would come within the estate duty bracket, are borrowing money.  More power to them, as this is the best way they have of increasing their productivity and gaining an advantage for themselves and for the country out of the benefits which the EEC can make available to them.</P>
      <P>But because they have this indebtedness for stock and farm improvement they can immediately get the immense advantage of this artificial valuation.  All debts, and this includes debts of a personal nature not related to the farm, are set off in connection with this artificial assessment which is made for farmers.  I must be careful with the figures.  All farmers will get a reduction, as there are certain exemptions for everybody, but up to 40 per cent will escape estate duty who would previously have been liable.  For the reasons I gave in the sample, artificial valuation must be dealt with carefully.  It would be wrong if the artificial assessment could be made available to an extremely wealthy farmer who had other estate as well and who as a consequence would avoid payment of estate duty. We have done something very significant here.  Only when it is applied to actual positions and it is seen at what values the property sells that the extent of the concession is realised.</P>

If they wanted to honour it totally &mdash;agreed at some cost to the Exchequer&mdash;they could increase beyond £3,000 the level for determining the applicability of the artificial value of agricultural land and by so doing reach a situation which would bring about the exemption of agricultural land from death duties.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge what the Minister has stated is accurate.  But the point I am making is that if the Government were seriously interested in honouring their commitments this was the proper way of doing so.  It could have been done simply under this section without any charade in regard to raising the minimum level from £7,500 to £10,000, which applies to property generally, whereas from the reading of this in the 14-point plan, and the way it motivated people, it was primarily in the agricultural area.</P>
      <P>It was through the agency of the Irish Farmers' Association and other rural organisations that this matter was highlighted.  I realise that for Exchequer reasons the Minister refrained from doing this.  But there was no difficulty in regard to facilitating every owner of agricultural land through the mechanism of the artificial value of agricultural land by extending this provision by a substantial amount to embrace practically every agricultural holding. There is no need for a White Paper, commission or investigation into the matter.  It would have been clean administration and clean government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not think that is a fair interpretation to put on what I said.  I said that the number of farmers affected by estate duty is very, very few.  If 6,500 farmers died per <Col N="1120" /> annum and less than 100 of them are liable for estate duty, I do not think it is unreasonable for me to say that comparatively few farmers run the risk of payment of estate duty.  The situation for Irish farmers could be made very much worse if the Government had adopted that which Senator Lenihan suggested.  If we were to say that agricultural land was not to be considered, if we were to give artificial valuation <i>in toto</i>, what would happen?  People with vast amounts of money would have exemption from death duty by buying agricultural land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties is that we are now in the EEC, for which Senator Lenihan campaigned so well and so successfully.  It is now not open to impose restrictions of the kind which Senator Lenihan has suggested, particularly, for instance, on foreigners. You could not do it on a national basis such as we appear to be able to do.  <i>Simpliciter</i> the ideal solution would seem to be to exempt farmers on agricultural land but this would lead to the very speculation which Mr. Maher of the Irish Farmers' Association has recognised as a real danger unless at the same time as you abolish estate duty you set up some other form of capital taxation.  If we had cleaned the slate of liability in relation to agricultural land, it would have immediately generated massive speculation in farm land.  That speculation would already be on the go.  We have made reasonable progress to relieve those whom we believe would be most seriously affected, to relieve quite a significant number of farmers this year at current prices and not on historical values.  We hope that it will not be necessary to bring in some of the other excellent suggestions which have been made.  Those suggestions would be valid if you are going to retain the system but if you are going to replace the system with something which will relate to payments by reasonable instalments by the very wealthy during their lifetime rather than by imposing a sum on the not so wealthy in the course of a lifetime, then I think we have <Col N="1121" /> done the right thing to provide substantial reliefs this year pending an overhaul of the whole system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Really, everything the Minister says goes to show the extraordinary lack of wisdom in the original comments to abolish death duties.  No matter what one does one finds other problems.  I take it that the Minister discovered all those problems since he took office but they gaily made these promises up and down the country which on any reasonable assumption were just crazy.  This was something that could not be done as they have now found out.</P>
      <P>What puzzles me particularly is the Minister's reference to the &ldquo;really wealthy&rdquo;.  I suppose the &ldquo;really wealthy&rdquo; to some means people who have more money than they have. On any reasonable use of the English language, the &ldquo;really wealthy&rdquo; ought to mean those who have an unusual amount of wealth.  I take it that the Minister would accept that a very large number of Irish estates in respect of which death duties are now paid could not be described as belonging to &ldquo;really wealthy&rdquo; deceased persons.  What he has been saying is that death duties will be replaced, that an equivalent amount will be brought in by the new wealth tax on the &ldquo;really wealthy&rdquo;.  Does this mean that these mysterious people&mdash;the &ldquo;really wealthy&rdquo;&mdash;whoever they are will have to pay, perhaps, twice as much in this new tax than would be payable on their estates on their decease?  I do not see how else it can be done.  If everyone who is not really wealthy is exempted from the wealth tax a very high proportion of estates that are now liable to death duty will be altogether exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be appropriate for me to anticipate what might be in the White Paper at this stage.  When I tell the House that over the last ten years there have been estates where the estate duty payable ranged from £½ million to £3 million they will appreciate that it would be wrong to abolish <Col N="1122" /> a system of tax which collects revenue of that kind because nobody is called upon to pay estate duty of £½ million to £3 million unless his estate is vastly in excess of that figure.  These are the problems that we have to look at.</P>
      <P>Regarding the difficulties&mdash;as the House knows I am a lawyer by profession and so I am not a stranger to the operation of estate duty and in assisting families in relation to the administration of their estates, both when they were living and dealing with the estates of other people when they were dead.  The unfortunate difficulty we are in as a Government is not that we are unaware of the administration of what we know about but that the statistical information in this country regarding wealth, its location, the way it is used, the way it is transferred is, unfortunately, most inadequate.  In some way it is a reflection on those who have been in control for so long.  We are working very hard on the White Paper.  This is one of the reasons why we are thinking it is very important to study the matter carefully so that the matter can be adequately considered by everybody and that a fair system of taxation on wealth can be introduced&mdash; a system which will catch the &ldquo;really wealthy&rdquo;.  That is a phrase that Senator Yeats thinks is imprecise, but I think he knows what we mean nonetheless. We want a system that will catch the &ldquo;really wealthy&rdquo; and we will ensure that they will not be able to avoid due payment of their taxes which they certainly are able to do under the existing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept what Senator Aylward says about the hardship that arises when a person is not wise enough to dispose of his property more than five years prior to death.  None of us knows when we will expire.  It is one of the great uncertainties that we have to live with. It is worthy of note that it was only three years until 1965 and we were not responsible for that extension to five years.  It is seven years in England.  The argument in favour of having a limit at all is to avoid a situation which can arise where the &ldquo;really wealthy&rdquo; can dispose of their property without hardship to themselves and avoid payment of duty.  It is a very exhaustive and <Col N="1123" /> interesting problem and I would hope, when we issue the White Paper, many of these problems can be adequately discussed.</P>

The various provisions here may not result in any net increase; indeed it could be a net loss to the revenue.  There is a different basis: at present the stamp duty is payable on the total capital but in future stamp duty will be payable only on issued capital.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which provides rather curiously that a business which provides its own catering has to pay VAT.  From the Minister's statement in the other House it would appear that if VAT were not imposed in these circumstances the business would compete unfairly with commercial caterers.  I can see the point between unfair competition with commercial caterers but it seems odd that this useful doctrine of free enterprise should be carried to the extreme that thousands of workers who eat their main meal of the day in factory and office canteens have to pay more in order to allow this doctrine of free enterprise to have full rein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is irrational to remind me that VAT should be charged on food in this kind of situation.  After all, this is food in the full sense of the word.  This is not luxury meals in luxury hotels. This is plain ordinary dinner that a worker would have in his factory or office canteen, yet VAT is being imposed on him.  If the worker had an identical meal at home.  VAT would not be charged.  I accept that the commercial caterer is being charged, but the reason may be that it would be impossible to distinguish between the luxury hotel and the snack bar and that therefore he has to be charged that though he is selling food, the commercial caterer has to be charged.  But <Col N="1125" /> where there is a distinct type of activity run by the firm itself I should have thought it would have been better to leave it free of VAT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate all the arguments advanced by Senator Yeats because they troubled me, too. The difficulty is to know where to draw the line.  Senator Yeats obviously has cases in mind where the cost of the meal may be determined by the number of gentlemen in formal clothes who are standing around with napkins on their arms.  On the other hand, you reach the situation in which commercial caterers who are legitimately pursuing a business would be seriously at a disadvantage if, because of the difficulty in distinguishing them from the other premises, they were to be charged this tax.  If firms dismissed them and engaged people to do the job themselves they would not pay the tax.</P>
      <P>On the question of endeavouring to establish equity between everybody engaged in the food trade and servicing the catering industry, we decided this was the most equitable way in which to do it.  As I pointed out in the other House, the net effect of this probably will mean for any worker of the kind Senator Yeats has in mind about three-quarters of 1p per day. That is a lot less than the cost of bus fares if he or she were to decide to go home for lunch in order to avoid VAT on food as distinct from that consumed in the canteen.  It does not add significantly to the burden of people who are lucky enough to consume their food in canteens at their place of work.  In most cases such food is already subsidised by the employers so that the full weight of this is unlikely to fall, if at all, on the worker.  There are many places of employment nowadays where more than a bowl of soup and a few sandwiches are given out.  In some places meals which would do credit to places which cannot be named, for the reasons Senator Yeats has in mind, are supplied daily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be just that such should be exempt from tax simply because people eating more modestly <Col N="1126" /> elsewhere would be caught by it&mdash;we have tried to establish equity&mdash;but this is a system which will ensure that genuine employees engaged in the catering industry will not be at a disadvantage. It we did not do this we would have all kinds of schemes operated which would work to the disadvantage of workers engaged in the catering industry.  That would be unfair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's point but he mentioned that the tax actually levied on the worker for an ordinary meal would be in the neighbourhood of three-quarters of 1p per meal.  If that is so I cannot see floods of professional caterers being put out of jobs in order that the company could do it at a cost of three-quarters of 1p cheaper per meal.  It is such a small amount it would not have much affect.  I am not particularly impressed either by the luxury of the meals the Minister has said are served in some of these companies.  Under his own provision for zero rating all foods, he zero rates the hamburger and also the sirloin steak or even, as has been mentioned, caviar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that the three-quarters of 1p of which I am talking is the difference between 5.26 per cent which now applies to such meals and 6.75 per cent which will now be imposed.  It is only a question of 1.5 which is being added on which is involved here.  The total involved in a meal, say, of 50p&mdash; which would be a fair price for a meal provided in such places&mdash;would be about 3p per meal.  In many cases that would represent probably the margin of profit to the catering firm which would be supplying such meals&mdash;it might be a little more or a little less. That is the margin of it and that, multiplied by the thousands of meals per day which an outside caterer would be providing, could amount to quite a sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The clearest way to establish equity is not to provide that food that is consumed outside the home would be exempt.  You run into all kinds of difficulties. The commercial caterer will in many cases be preparing food beforehand. <Col N="1127" /> Prepared food which is precooked is not being exempted.  Such food has a certain element of service done to it.  You come up against a multitude of difficulties in trying to establish equity.  The course we have taken is the one which ensures that the least disadvantage is done to anybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the Minister's last statement.  It now appears that the loss to the worker is not three farthings but is about three pennies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that but we are now zero rating food.  If his meals in a canteen were zero rated he would pay about three pence per meal less than if the full 6.75 per cent were put on it.  But not at all&mdash;in fact, can one say three farthings under the decimal system or does one say three-quarters of a penny?  An interesting semantic point.  However, if we say three quarters of a penny it is not three quarters of a penny that is involved.  The point is not whether he would pay more than he is now paying; the point is whether he is to be zero rated or to pay 6.75 per cent so it is as much as three pence per meal, that is 15 pence per week. Nobody will go bankrupt as a result but it is considerably more than the three-quarters of a penny that seems to be involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated he is worried about this situation&mdash;as we are&mdash;but that the more he looked into it the more difficulties arose.  Of course, these are difficulties that have arisen because of the zero rating of food.  It strengthens the arguments against doing it in the first place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong to continue on the lines Senator Yeats is taking.  He appears to be unaware that a considerable number of people are employed in industrial catering and that workers obtain first class food under industrial catering.  It would be <Col N="1128" /> wrong to place industrial caterers at a disadvantage.  There have been attempts on the part of some firms to cater for their own establishments and when this happens they try to do it cheaply and ignore the expertise which is important. Workers are entitled to good food and service just as much as those who can go into a hotel or restaurant.  I hold that, as regards what is suggested here, the cost to the worker would be infinitesimal because in the main, in industrial catering, food is subsidised by the employer.</P>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor had not the approach which Senator Yeats is advocating.  He was not prepared to help the industrial caterer other than to impose VAT on them.  If this section is agreed to it will not be a great imposition on the worker or recipient of the food.  It is not proper to have factory workers leaving their work and helping to prepare the meals.  This should be discouraged and we should give full recognition to industrial catering.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to a point I agree with Senator Mullen.  It is probably right that companies who do their own catering tend to do it on the cheap and he is almost certainly right in stating that professionals do a better job.  Where I disagree with him is that I hold a slightly socialist view which the Senator might disapprove of and that is that the worker should not be taxed in the interests of private enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which one might say changes the price of every commodity sold in every shop throughout the country, some downwards and most upwards.  In spite of the Minister's suggestion in the course of his budget speech that the lower rates were being increased less than the higher rates on the basis that the more essential commodities were to <Col N="1129" /> be increased less than the so-called less basic or luxury goods, why did he do the exact opposite?  In respect of the lowest rate of VAT which was 5.26 and is now 6.75 he has put that up by 28.3 per cent.  In other words, for every £100 the State receives in tax out of that former VAT it now receives 28.3 per cent more.  The next slightly less essential commodities go up from 16.37 to 19.5 per cent which is a rise of something under 20 per cent and the third class from 30.26 to 36.75 per cent, the so-called luxury goods such as radios and television sets which everyone now looks upon as essentials, which is a rise of 21.4 per cent.  The more essential the goods the higher rate of increased taxation the State will receive.  I am interested to know the reasoning behind this or is it because people have to buy more then more money can be got in by a larger increase in taxation?</P>
      <P>One regrets the VAT on books under the 6.75 per cent level.  Originally, turnover tax and VAT were imposed on books by the Fianna Fáil Government but it is one of the less defensible things which they did in their day and is something the present Government opposed tooth and nail in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Instead of zero rating books and ceasing thereby to tax education the tax on books is now higher than it ever was.  There is also the question of newspapers.  It is considered immoral even to suggest that a journalist conceivably might have political views; nonetheless, it is curious that, whereas every newspaper a year or so ago contained portentous leading articles about the appalling dangers to the future of the newspaper world in the imposition of VAT, VAT is now being increased as well as all their other costs and we have not heard a word from them about it now.  On the basis that journalists have no political views it seems they have ceased suddenly to be able to look after their economic interests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to echo what Senator Yeats said about books. It seems to be a staggering exclusion from what seems to be a reasonably sensible and humane Bill.  I do not share the views of the Opposition that <Col N="1130" /> the removal of VAT from food is primitive or aboriginal or whatever adjectives they choose to affix to it. This seems to be a central, fundamental, very important and humane measure but &ldquo;not by bread alone doth man live&rdquo; and, in view of a number of factors, it is amazing that this Bill imposes VAT on books and newspapers.</P>
      <P>The previous Government introduced a dashing and interesting item in their budget in the tax relief they granted to writers and artists.  One of the results of that was that, not only were the Irish artists and writers advantaged but it worked to the advantage of many people who came here from abroad.</P>
      <P>The affects of VAT on books are considerable.  The average secondary school student will need at least £30 per year to buy books and, over five years, that will amount to £150.  In five years' time it will be a great deal more.  At university level the amount a student is expected to pay for books is quite staggering.  There are 50 books on the reading list of our English department for first year honours.  For three subjects that would be 150.  At a conservative estimate a university student in one year could spend as much as £100 on books.  If you multiply the VAT involved in that over four years that is a great deal of money.</P>
      <P>The old cliché that has been bandied around that this is a tax on knowledge is pretty true.  A Government who justifiably pride themselves on their intelligence and brains, and high intellectual calibre, and great concern for the intellectual quality of life and art, and so on, should not have ignored the possibility of a tax relief in this educational area.  It appears to be a very serious and, to me, an inexplicable omission.  I should like the Minister to explain it.  Did they even think of it?</P>
      <P>It is as essential for the mind as food is for the body and for the health of society.  The whole area of education is utterly dependent on books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It affects other areas such as libraries.  These are very important if we are to have a contented and enlightened <Col N="1131" /> electorate and population generally.  The lending libraries are spending a lot of money on tax which they should be spending on books.  I would not be as perfunctory or dismissive as Senator Yeats felt it necessary to be on the matters of newspapers. For the functioning of democracy, newspapers are necessary.  It is not a myth that newspapers are going to the wall every day.  The numbers have been reduced drastically in England over the past ten years.  We have four dailies and it is possible that we may have only three in a few years' time.  VAT should be removed from these.  I am thinking in terms of a healthy democracy which this Government claim to be urgently concerned with rescuing, augmenting, preserving and maintaining.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if this is due to a lack of thinking or to an oversight, or is it felt that books and the whole area they cover of our intellectual life so unimportant that it should not have been considered for this kind of reduction or alleviation in tax.  I would very strenuously urge on the Minister and the Government to bear this important item in mind when next year's budget is being prepared.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with Senator Yeats and Senator Martin in appealing to the Minister to reconsider imposing VAT on books. It is a retrograde step, placing a tax on knowledge.  In Northern Ireland and Britain books are free to all school children at all levels of education. Here the price of books has rocketed and parents are well aware of this.  Even in national schools at which children must compulsorily attend, the parents are forced to buy the books.  There is a very limited free book scheme and it is at the discretion of the teacher who has to indicate who, in his opinion, would be entitled to receive a free book. I appeal strongly to the Minister to remove this tax on education and knowledge.</P>

      <P>I concur with the Senator who have advocated the removal of this tax on facilities for <Col N="1132" /> education.  From one point of view, we go out of our way to provide finances to ensure we will cherish all the children of the nation equally.  We have provided transport to take the children to national and secondary schools and yet we still retain an archaic tax which puts some avenues of knowledge and certain books out of their reach.  Instead of looking at television, as is the case in most homes at present, it would be much better if children cultivated the habit of reading. In doing so they would be helping to educate themselves and they would broaden their outlook.</P>
      <P>I also agree with Senator Martin's views on newspapers and periodicals. The day of censorship is past.  Television can supercede censorship boards. There are many provincial newspapers in the rural areas and they pay trade union wages in my area at any rate and employ a good number of people. This is an industry in an area where industries are very scarce.  I would not support anything which might put these people out of business or encourage large combines to take over our news media and deprive us of the enjoyment of having our own local newspapers.</P>

      <P>This is the cruellest and most avaricious section in the entire Finance Bill, a section which should be remembered by the people for many years, a section which affects the lives of the ordinary working people, and particularly the poorer people.  In their 14-point plan the Coalition parties undertook to introduce immediately strict price control and then went on to deal with social reform the elimination of poverty and the ending of social injustice.  &ldquo;It is conservatively estimated,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;that under Fianna Fáil a quarter of our people lived in poverty.&rdquo;  I would readily admit, as, indeed, any Senator who leads a reasonably active political life and is in contact with the poorer sections of the community would admit, that under Fianna Fáil possibly a quarter of our people did, regrettably, live in poverty but I feel that as a result of this section of the Bill the number of Irish people living in poverty will increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> In his speech yesterday the Taoiseach stated that the granting of the large social welfare increases more than compensated the less well-off for the rise in the cost of living.  He said the removal of food from the scope of VAT was a further step of major social significance and then went on to say, later on, that the proposed increases were relatively moderate when compared with increases in other budgets.  We should examine the increases, as proposed in this section, and see how they affect the less well-off. We have already dealt with tobacco, beer and spirits which are not provided for in this section but which are considered to be necessaries of life today.</P>
    <P>This section proposes to increase taxes at the rate of 28 per cent, some dropping to 20 per cent but, on average, running around a 25 per cent increase.  These increases will be applied to clothing, footwear, household furniture, hardware, detergents, building materials, non-oral medicines which are used for the disabled and the sick, medical appliances which include wheelchairs, hearing-aids and false teeth.  Does anyone seriously suggest that clothing and footwear should not be considered as necessaries of life?  Would anyone seriously suggest that a 28 per cent increase in taxation on those commodities will not have a serious effect on the average Irish working family?  I cannot understand the Taoiseach's claim yesterday that the removal of food from the scope of VAT would bring about a 5 per cent reduction in the price of food.  I believe, by this very section, impositions have been placed on the manufacturing and distributive trades to such an extent that it will be impossible to reduce the price of food by that amount.</P>
    <P>Apart from the major cities in this country, most businesses in rural Ireland are family-run concerns employing anything from three to 20 people.  Let us consider what effect section 80 of the Finance Bill will have on concerns of this nature.  Petrol is being increased, the tax on vehicles is being increased, the price of vehicles is being increased and even the driver's licence is being increased.  This must <Col N="1134" /> bring about a serious increase in transportation costs.  When one considers the astronomical increase in the price of the social welfare stamp, as far as the employer is concerned, introduced since this Government took office, one must wonder how a 5 per cent reduction in food can be brought about.</P>
    <P>The increased cost of maintaining a family must, naturally, be taken into consideration when the next national wage agreement is being drawn up. Allowances will have to be made for these increases.  I suspect that when that agreement is reached, as I hope it will be reached, the Government will then try to suggest that the failure to reduce the price of food, as promised prior to the election and since, was not and would not be their responsibility but was brought about as a result of the workers looking for too much money. The cost of producing food, on the farms of this country, will naturally be affected as well.  As a result we have a situation that the average working man in Ireland with four or five children and earning approximately £25 a week may never again be able to change his car because cars are becoming too dear to buy and tax and petrol are very costly.  Therefore, he will have to walk. The tax imposition on footwear could mean all of us being back to bare feet in the not too distant future.  There is an increase also in postal and telephone charges.  While this section may not make the rich richer in Ireland, it will make the poor poorer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must congratulate Senator McGlinchey on what I presume is a dress rehearsal for next year's Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  He could not honestly expect the Seanad to take seriously what he has being saying. Supposing we accept all his strictures against imposing tax on what he regards as the necessaries of life and his heart bled for everything from books to wheelchairs although he omitted the plaster that the Leader of the Opposition in the other House wanted for his finger, is it not four times worse to impose a tax four times higher?  That is what Fianna Fáil did. Their tax upon these necessaries of life was 5.26 per cent and we are increasing that by 1.5 per cent.  Therefore, <Col N="1135" /> if all his strictures have any value they apply four times stronger to the very tax that he supported with his votes in other days.  That dismisses what he has to say on that score.  I have said in the other House and I will say here that I wish members of Fianna Fáil would get their thinking in agreement on this.  The Leader of the Opposition in the other House said that when changes were being made on VAT this year they should have been brought into line with what operated in Northern Ireland instead of having different systems.  For the first time in ten years in this State food will not have a tax imposed on it.  We consider that to be a good social advance which will make the poorer somewhat better off.  Food is not taxed in Northern Ireland so our action in this regard is one step forward.  But the other common rate which Deputy Lynch wanted to introduce here was the rate of 10 per cent which applies on clothing and footwear and on other items which were causing concern to so many Senators opposite.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>We do not believe in imposing a 10 per cent tax on footwear and clothing.  We do not believe in imposing a tax on food.  We have said that in each year during the last ten years and, at the first opportunity, we are doing something about it.  Are we justified in doing it?  We believe we are.  We believe we are justified in making all the changes, including increasing marginally the tax on other items, so as to ensure that there is no loss of revenue.  The interesting thing is that in so doing we are reducing the cost of living by a ½ per cent. We are doing this because food is the largest item in the ordinary family budget.  The items to which we are transferring the revenue loss by removing it from food are the less essential items which are not bought by many people and which are outside the basket of goods which is taken into account in calculating the cost of living because they are unusual and exceptional items which are not within the ambit of the ordinary family purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGlinchey suggested that <Col N="1136" /> the increases in VAT on motor cars and other additional excise duties on these vehicles would result in people having to walk to the extent that they would wear out the soles of their shoes and go bare-footed once again.  It is not bad stuff, perhaps, for chapel gates where one ought endeavour to speak the truth having regard for the holy ground upon which one is looking if not standing.  What are the realities?  The realities are that if a man gave up his car and started walking it would cost him more in shoe leather than the additional cost that has been imposed by this budget on total motoring costs which is less than 1 per cent of the total cost of motoring. There has not been a year during the last 20 years in which the cost of motoring has not increased by far more than 1 per cent and everybody in this House and all over the country knows that.  Whatever increases are being imposed in respect of motor cars will be used entirely for the improvement of roads.  There is far more than 1 per cent of the cost of operating a motor car which is represented by inadequate use by loss of use, to inability to use the car on roads which are already far below the standards required and which as a consequence result in congestion.</P>
    <P>I think it is time that this debate was brought down to realities and not to the highly emotive remarks which have been made on this aspect of VAT.  The VAT changes will result in a reduction in living costs and particularly for the less well off sections of the community.  They will gain more than a half of 1 per cent. The poorer will gain more because much more of their budget goes into the purchase of food.</P>
    <P>I was unhappy about the increase of 1.5 pence VAT on books and newspapers. Man does not live by information alone and if I have to choose between food and information I would zero rate food because if a man does not have his belly full he is unlikely to have any desire to acquire knowledge.  We are not the only country that has tax on these items and I think it is very much to the credit of the newspaper world and book world here that they have not <Col N="1137" /> raised a song and dance on this matter.  They have certainly expressed a request to me and to others that these items would be zero rated but if they were to be zero rated it would cost a few million pounds which I think could not be justified.  Certainly, the kind of text books that Senator Brosnahan referred to I would like to see zero rated.  I know this matter was considered by our predecessors and they had the difficulty which we also had of trying to distinguish between one kind of book and another.  There are some forms of the printed word on sale in this country that could well carry a tax of 50 per cent if it would discourage people from buying them. One only has to go into any newsagency to see books which we would be better off not having in the country.  However, the fiscal laws are not the means of dealing with that matter.  If the problem illustrated by Senator Brosnahan comes to be dealt with, as I believe it ought to be, it would be a matter for the Department of Education to endeavour to devise a scheme which would cover it but that would certainly not be by zero rating all books and all printed works in order that relief can be given in relation to school text books.</P>
    <P>Senator Martin mentioned that as much as £30 a year could be spent on secondary school textbooks.  That is true.  Let us look at the cost of feeding the child.  The cost of maintaining the child would be a minimum of £8 per week throughout the year.  In relation to schoolbooks there is a taxation item in relation to VAT of 1.5 per cent but on food there is a saving of 5 per cent by this budget.  This is an indication of the kind of relief which is being given here.  If we can get a saving of £21 per child in VAT in respect of their maintenance it will go a long way towards assisting in the purchase of books. This one sample alone shows the social justification of removing tax from food and shifting it to other items which might be called luxuries.  I do not suggest they are, but they are not as significant in the ordinary individual and family budget as is food.  We, therefore, consider that we have been entirely justified socially on this.  This is not an election gimmick.  This is <Col N="1138" /> something which we declared ten years ago and we have stuck rigidly to it.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that we have moved in the nick of time.  There were suggestions before that the European Community would not approve of any item being zero-rated, but it is now clear that as long as an item is zero-rated before the end of this year it may remain so, and particularly so when, as in this case, there are very good social reasons for doing it.  Our inflation has been the worst in Europe, principally due to the fact that food has become inflated at a rate far faster than anything else.  We have had in relation to food inflation at least the monetary benefit of much higher incomes for our food producers, so we have that social advantage arising out of it.</P>
    <P>We had a rise of 20 per cent in food costs&mdash;and this happened on account of our predecessors, but I am not making a political point on that&mdash;but surely when there has been such a massive rise in food costs which has caused such serious concern, even if we had never thought about it over the last ten years, we would now be justified in saying: &ldquo;Let us do something to try to pull this rate back in respect of food.&rdquo;  This case which we made for the abolition of VAT on food has been accepted by the community, who know well that there are good social, economic and fiscal reasons for making this change.  We have done it with a net advantage to the consumer and we cannot see that there is any reasonable argument that can be put up against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may go along with the Minister to the extent that we should look at this matter in a dispassionate manner.  We had a very full debate on the Second Stage, on which this particular section naturally loomed very largely.  I should like to bring the Minister out of his state of euphoria and down to brass tacks.  We are talking about inflation.  Inflation is the major problem facing all the democracies at the moment, particularly this country.  This is our particular problem.  He is not going to solve inflation by the adjustments which have been made to VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adjustments made to VAT here <Col N="1139" /> are going to add to inflation.  I am going to give one very specific example of this, and the Minister can go back and discuss this matter with his advisers afterwards.  I am sure he has already discussed it with them.  There was much thought given to the original rating under value-added tax as proposed by the previous Government. The notion was, as the Minister is well aware, that, in order to prevent this sort of inflation that inevitably and unfortunately happened arising out of decimalisation, the rating would be such as not to depart from the tax system that obtained prior to value-added tax.  The figures were drawn up on the basis that there would be no or a minimum departure from the existing tax situation.  It served two purposes. Traders could switch to the new value-added tax with a minimum of administrative disruption.  Secondly, there would be no built-in inflation by switching to new figures.</P>
    <P>What we have here now is a straight-away built-in inflation in raising the 5.26 per cent category to 6.75 per cent which gives scope within a range of 2½ per cent for inflation right across the whole range of commercial trading.  The very same applies in regard to raising the 16.37 per cent to 19.05 per cent.  We have scope of over 3 per cent there for inflationary activity, simply rising prices right across the whole range of commercial activity.  On the highest level we have a 6½ per cent rise from 30.26 per cent to 36.75 per cent.  This gives scope for commercial price-raising and inflation right across that whole range.  It was in order to prevent this sort of thing happening that the Minister for Finance, his Department and the Government fixed the original rates exactly approximating to the rates of tax that obtained in this particular area of taxation prior to the introduction of VAT.</P>
    <P>They are the facts and the Minister is well aware of them.  Furthermore, in regard to the money being diverted from VAT on foodstuffs and oral medicines, the amount of £16.75 million with an addition of £5 million in a full year, approximately giving a <Col N="1140" /> figure of about £22 million odd, is being injected into these other areas where you will have very high expenditure by reason of what I called last night the elastic nature of the consumption involved.  We are not living in a primitive economy any more.  We are living in an expanding economy where the standard of living is rising rapidly, where the purchase of consumer goods is rising rapidly and where, particularly if there is a new pay agreement, there will be a further volume of expenditure injected into the economy.  Where is that money going to be spent?  The expenditure on food is static.  £X is what anybody can spend on food.  But it is precisely in the areas where there has been a substantial increase in VAT, where we will have a growing number of people coming into expenditure on these particular items to a greater extent than at the present time, and where the Exchequer is seeking to draw off more money and thereby add to inflation, that inflation gathers momentum.  Footwear, clothing, liquor, tobacco, petrol, fuel, electricity are all areas that will mushroom and expand in consumption in an inflationary situation.</P>
    <P>In the category which has been raised to 19.5 per cent, with the natural policy of encouraging house-building, which is expanding to a greater degree, this brings us straightaway into hardware, electrical goods, furniture and furnishings.  This is basic expenditure by anybody buying a house and again adds to the inflationary spiral.  I am speaking now as an economist and not a politician and it is wrong economics to think that by simply concentrating on foodstuffs alone one can curb inflation.  The real inflationary areas are the areas that have been fuelled and encouraged to further and greater mushrooming inflation by reason of the Minister raising the rates in the particular nonfood areas which I have just mentioned. This is not politics.  We will see the reality of what I am saying this time next year when the national wage agreement comes to be negotiated.</P>
    <P>People who are in all of these areas are not going to talk in terms of their <Col N="1141" /> food expenditure.  The expenditure out of their pockets will derive, to a growing extent, as we become a greater consumer society, from the areas that are now being substantially increased.</P>
    <P>These are basic facts of modern life. As I said here last night, there is no point in going back to a Stone Age debate on food subsidies such as we had here in the 1950s.  I thought that was completely settled in 1957 but here we are going back to it again and ignoring the reality of the great range of consumer goods outside foodstuffs which are becoming the big expenditure factor for everyone as the standard of living goes up.  This is very basic economics and is a factor that will be brought home to the Government by this time next year.</P>
    <P>I would grant the social justice of the matter in regard to foodstuffs if I thought it was going to be effective.  I would grant that, theoretically, there might be merit in seeking to add to the expense in the areas I have mentioned, which have been added to by conscious Government decision, if the 5.26 per cent elimination of VAT on foodstuffs will result in a 5 per cent cut in the price of foodstuffs.  That is entirely a theoretical calculation.  The Minister for Finance and his advisers should be aware of that already, but if they are not they will know it by this time next year.  This is the last occasion the Oireachtas will have to debate this matter.  I am as certain as we are here today, and as certain as we will be here or in some other part of the Assembly this time next year, that we will see the disastrous nature of this decision this time next year.</P>

      <P>I am talking in terms of points.  It rose nearly three times more between February and May of this year compared to February and May last year.  This is the type of galloping inflation of food prices which the Minister and the Government have gladly connived at.  The facts of life are that by giving due notice to the various commercial interests in food production, distribution and sale they have ensured that by September 3rd there will be no reduction in food prices as far as the consumer is concerned. That matter, I can assure the Minister, has already been well attended to by the various commercial interests involved in food production and food sale.</P>
      <P>The Minister can rest assured that no amount of price control apparatus will cut 5 per cent off the retail price of foodstuffs.  The net result as far as the Exchequer is concerned, is inflation. I indict this Government for deliberately encouraging a policy of inflation that has resulted in £21.75 million being diverted to encourage inflation. The result is that, instead of that £21.75 million bringing about a definite reduction in the cost of food, it will go towards causing further inflation in other areas.  Inflation of food prices will proceed apace and the various commercial interests involved in food production will benefit by reason of the Government's decision.  No amount of food inspectors, no amount of price inspectors, no amount of guardsmen around every supermarket in the country will be able to control the price of foodstuffs.  The whole effort will be totally in vain and the only result to the Exchequer and the country will be inflation.  It is around the Government's neck that we will hang the label of inflation between now and this time next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very brief remark to make.  The Minister, in replying to the suggestions that were made in regard to books, made what seemed a very valid case in saying that it is very hard to define the kind of book that should be exempted from value-added tax.  The problem does not seem to me to be quite as insuperable as he suggested.  I say this <Col N="1143" /> in the spirit of trying to offer a suggestion and of trying to offer help in the matter.  The Minister agreed that it would be very nice if such an important and useful aspect of democracy as newspapers could be exempted but said that if you exempted them you would include in that exemption a great deal of tripe and morally reprehensible stuff coming in from all over the world.  It does not seem to be impossible to define a newspaper and to distinguish, say, <i>The Irish Times, The Irish Press</i> or the <i>Irish Independent</i> from <i>Playboy</i> or <i>Penthouse.</i> It should be possible to arrive at a definition which would make that distinction.</P>
      <P>With regard to textbooks, I think it is still possible to say that any book which is prescribed or approved by the Department of Education in the primary or secondary level should be exempt from value-added tax or that any book which is prescribed or recommended by a university department in the pursuance of a university course should be exempt from value-added tax.  This would be a start.  I would be horrified if <i>Playboy</i> was to be exempted from VAT.  Anyway, I understand it is not allowed into the country.  For a start, I do not see why that simple definition could not be made.  If that was done I do not think it would result in an enormous cost to the Exchequer.  It would be a considerable saving for the students and their parents.  I am convinced by the Minister's case with regard to food as distinct from books, but I think those definitions could be tried.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the rather odd section which exempts sales of live horses and greyhounds from VAT.  The Minister's explanation for this, as delivered in the other House, is that since greyhounds and live horses are imported and exported to take part in <Col N="1144" /> races, and this causes complications with regard to VAT, the simplest thing is to leave them out altogether.  I may appear to be a kind of simple soul in making this suggestion but it should not be beyond the wit of man, in this case the Department of Finance, to simplify export-import regulations. What seems to happen is that somebody says our regulations are so complicated that they cause endless trouble and as it is impossible to simplify them let us drop VAT altogether on horses and dogs.  That seems to be an appalling bureaucratic admission of defeat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one way of looking at it, but the other way of looking at it is that we are, in fact, simplifying the bureaucratic machine. We could maintain it by imposing the tax at point of entry and refund it at the time of re-export.  The most simple thing to do is not to collect the tax at all and then there will not have to be a refund; otherwise there would have to be two sets of forms and two payments resulting in the issuing of receipts on the double.  It is not an admission of defeat.  It is simply a recognition of the futility of collection and repayment, as this is what happens where livestock are so frequently imported and re-exported for racing and bloodstock purposes, <i>et cetera.</i></P>

      <P>Perhaps I am being over simple, but it is well known not only in Ireland but in other countries that if, for example, you are leaving the country in possession of a valuable camera or a musical instrument you acquire what I believe is known in the trade as a pink form and you show it to the customs officers on your way out and he puts an official stamp on it.  All you need do when reentering the country is to brandish that form to the customs and they let you in.  I should have thought that some relatively simple process such as that could be done with horses and dogs.</P>

It is safer and more simple to do away with it altogether than to require attendants to deal with these matters.  A customs officer would have to be assigned specifically to the inspection of these forms.  As the money will be refunded in most cases, there is no point in collecting it.</P>

The Senator made a point about caviar, but this is not generally consumed in this country so there is no measure of social injustice in caviar, which might be classified as a fish food, being exempt.

      <P>This is fairly well defined.  It concerns the difference between bread and cake and the amount of the sugar and fruit content of an item when it goes above a certain figure, and puts it into the confectionery category.  If it is below that it is in the &ldquo;bread&rdquo; category.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might explain the precise nature of my problem. My real problem arises at line 42 which states:</P>
      <P>other than food packaged for sale as a unit (not being a unit designated as containing only food specifically for babies) containing two or more slices, segments, sections or other similar pieces....</P>
      <P>As an ordinary layman that sounds like sliced bread, but I take it this is not because if so it would be taxed.  If it is not sliced bread, what on earth is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should state that the definition contained in the Bill was suggested by the Irish Bakery and Confectionery Trades Association, who may deem themselves to be qualified to speak with some knowledge of the matter.  It is a definition which includes all bread save that which is of the confectionery kind because of the fruit and sugar content or items such as crisp breads which are of a biscuit nature.  Baby rusks will be zero rated but other items, such as biscuits, are regarded as being confectionery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is quite simple, but that is not the answer. Starting at line 42, we have a reference to this commodity which is &ldquo;food packaged for sale as a unit&rdquo; and then refers to food containing two or more slices, segments, sections or other similar pieces.  That is not sliced bread. What is it?</P>

      <P>I appreciate all these difficulties of definition.  They enter into the whole VAT field but there is a quotation in the Bill, in section 80, in which the Revenue Commissioners have power to adjudicate in which category a particular item should be.  This, I might say, is being done at the request of the trade to avoid the kind of difficulties that have arisen in the past where argument has arisen after commodities have been put on the market as to whether they should be at one particular rate or the other.  This power is one from which there is a right of appeal if there is any dispute.  It has the great advantage that if the commodity is put on the market an adjudication may take place as to which category it may be in.  If there is an area of doubt as to whether a piece of bread is confectionery or a loaf it can be decided at that stage.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise a point on the Schedule.  I am not raising a point about the meaning of the Schedule.  I would hesitate to do anything so foolish.  Even by the standards of Finance Bills the drafting of this Schedule is quite something.  I am referring to the Tenth Schedule which arises under section 90.  What puzzles me is how anyone who has the misfortune to deal with the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, will know what is in the Act after the additions and <Col N="1149" /> emendations in this Schedule.  For the edification of Senators I will read the bit relating to section 11, second paragraph from the bottom.  This is how this wonderful effusion of the bureaucratic mind reads:</P>
      <P>In section 11, in subsection (1) (d), &ldquo;, other than consideration to which paragraph (b) applies,&rdquo; shall be inserted after &ldquo;consideration&rdquo;, &ldquo;, (v) or (xvi)&rdquo; shall be substituted for &ldquo;or (v)&rdquo; and &ldquo;and (xii) to (xv)&rdquo; shall be inserted after &ldquo;(viii)&rdquo;; in subsection (2), &ldquo;for the time being specified in subsection (1) (c)&rdquo; shall be submitted for &ldquo;of 30.26 per cent.&rdquo; and &ldquo;for the time being specified in subsection (1) (a) on&rdquo; shall be substituted for &ldquo;of 5.26 per cent. of&rdquo;; and in subsection 3, &ldquo;paragraph (xvi) of the Second Schedule and paragraph (xxxii) of Part I of the Third Schedule,&rdquo; shall be inserted after &ldquo;10 (8) (c),&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which imposes an enormous variety of additional duties on vehicles of all kinds. We have 10 per cent more on cars and very considerable increases on the admittedly small sums payable on foot of agricultural tractors.  As has already been pointed out, it is one of these things which is constantly raising the cost of motoring.  I am puzzled again by the wording of this Bill, particularly subsection (6) of this section, which seems to say that the additional proceeds of these increased duties will be disregarded in any determination of a sum to be issued out of the Central Fund under section 2 (1) of the Roads Acts, 1920.  The Minister, however, has said that all the additional duties have been paid to the Road Fund, so I take it that my interpretation of the subsection is not correct.  It means something different?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Senator that the additional moneys are going to the improvement of our road system.  I should like to point out that this is one of the lowest rates of increase in road tax in recent times. In 1966 there was an increase of 25 per cent; in 1970 there was an increase of 25 per cent; we are proposing here an increase of 10 per cent.  Having regard to differences in money values since then, the total <Col N="1151" /> cost of motoring and the cost of providing facilities for motoring is a very modest increase indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister explain in relatively simple terms what subsection (6) means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of that is to provide that this money will be paid into the Exchequer and that the grants from the Exchequer this year for the Road Fund are much greater than the particular sum we had collected, because the Road Fund operating under the existing revenue is inadequate to meet the capital cost at present required for road works. Purely as a bookkeeping operation, it is being kept in the Exchequer.  The Exchequer is paying out more than what has been collected here into the Road Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>At least I have interpreted the subsection correctly.  It does in effect provide that it is not paid into the Road Fund.  However, the Minister says that under some other head a larger sum is being paid in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one section which makes one feel the extent of the impositions on car owners more than one normally might.  The Minister has pointed out that the 10 per cent increase, by taxation standards, is not that high.  What will be inclined to annoy motorists is the sneaky little bits that come in under various headings like this one.  One finds, all of a sudden, when one buys a new car, which is an expensive enough operation as it is, that another £5 will be demanded as a completely new tax.  In other places it will also be found that the cost of the driving licence has been doubled.  All kinds of little impositions of this kind, which do not amount to much, and I have no doubt that the Minister will be able to say that they only amount to £1.25 per <Col N="1152" /> motorist per year, are calculated to infuriate motorists even more than they normally would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope motorists would not be infuriated.  They might be consoled to know that seven other European countries impose a charge for first registration.  We are moving in line with other countries who have found this a justifiable charge to make. There is a great deal more clerical work involved in first registration than in renewal.  It is not unfair to make a charge for this work.</P>
      <P>I have another approach to this.  I know the money is not being taken in and going directly to the particular object I have in mind, but I have long argued that there should be a charge imposed at the time of manufacture of the motor car which would be comparable to the cost of the necessary destruction of that motor car when it comes to the end of its life span so as to prevent ruination and damage to the environment.  The £5 imposed, apart from being justified as a registration charge to cover clerical work at the time of original registration, is also a fee which it is justifiable to collect for the benefit of society having regard to the immense damage which is being done to our environment by derelict cars that are abandoned and not properly destroyed.</P>
      <P>As the Senator knows, in Dublin at the moment, Dublin Corporation is so concerned with this problem that they will remove derelict cars free of charge. If people have a car they want to dispose of the Corporation now removes it free of charge to the individual owner of the car, but society is, nonetheless, paying the cost of its removal.  I think, as the Exchequer is so substantially subsidising the road fund now, it is justifiable that we should collect a fee at the commencement of a car's life which might compensate, at least in some part, for the destruction of the old jalopy when it comes to the end of its days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister and, indeed, the House, that I will not make another speech on the general merits, or lack of them, in this Bill.  I want to make a point about section 52 which I was prevented from making by being absent at a meeting in another part of the House.  It relates to the imposition of duties of which there are seven listed in this Bill.  Although it is legally correct I do not think it is a correct way of dealing with this matter. We have been accustomed in this House, and in the other House, to having these orders come before us in the form of a Schedule to Bills, dealing with these matters only.</P>
      <P>The Bills have traditionally come to us with a memorandum listing clearly what each of these orders sets out to do.  The Minister has come in specially to deal with that Bill, making an opening speech saying what the reasons were that impelled the Government to make the various orders, they have then been discussed in the House, not usually at great length, and disposed of in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this instance, they come in the middle of this very large, complex, and important Bill.  There is nothing whatever in the memorandum about them except that they are there.  Both in the other House, and here, the opening speech of the Minister, in one case, and the Taoiseach in the other, said nothing whatever about them.  I do not think that this is, from a Parliamentary point of view, correct.  The safeguards which were obviously intended to be provided in the 1957 Act were that they would come up for discussion in the two Houses and it would be known <Col N="1154" /> to Members of each House what was being done.  If it is done in this manner the safeguard utterly disappears.  I know that it is open to a Deputy, or a Senator, who get a Bill like this to have a look at section 52 or the equivalent section, to go down to the Library and get all the orders out and have a look at them.  However, we all know that in practice, Senators and Deputies do not do this.  They are busy people and very often do not even notice that they are there.  I would ask the Minister not to bring them in in this form again but to return to the normal practice which was a much better way from a parliamentary point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of what Senator Yeats says.  Perhaps he was not present when I did detail them to some extent in the House today on Committee Stage.  They were principally in relation to the adoption of the EEC common customs tariff.  I also mentioned that the majority of them were the responsibility of a previous administration.  I know that Government, and Parliament, are on-going institutions but that is no adequate answer.  I will bear in mind what the Senator has said.  I can accept the difficulty which Members have in endeavouring to understand legislation, particularly when it is produced in this global form.  If it has been done in the past in a better way, I will give an assurance that I will see to it that the better way is complied with in future.</P>
