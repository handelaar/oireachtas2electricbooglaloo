      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 16 and 6 on the Order Paper.  It is proposed to take No. 6 at 6 p.m. and, if necessary, to interrupt the business of the House to take it at that time.  If the business ordered before No. 6 is concluded before 6 p.m., we will have a break until 6 p.m. If, as does not seem very <Col N="686" /> likely at the moment, the Finance Bill is received today, it is proposed to take it after item No. 6.  I cannot at this stage give an indication of the business for the remainder of the week, but in fairness to Senators I should say that the possibility of having to sit on Saturday should not be ruled out at this stage.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like, speaking for our group, to put on the record the incompetence on the part of the Government in arranging the business in this highly haphazard manner.  At a stage when business is being pushed through before the Recess we find ourselves in a situation where we will be sitting for less than one hour this morning having&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a whole day's vacuum until 6.30 p.m.  Then we are being threatened with a weekend sitting. As far as we are concerned we are not going to succumb to any procedural blackmail of that kind.  Much of the trouble in this and the other House has been caused by gross Government incompetence in that we had a ludicrous situation in the Dáil this morning, where the Taoiseach had to intervene to withdraw a Bill which had been drafted, to put it mildly, in a crazy manner&mdash;a Bill which was sought to be bulldozed through by the Minister for Finance.  He had to be rescued by his own Leader on the basis that every single amendment proposed by him was bady drafted and could not stand up.  On that basis the Government had to withdraw their amendments to their Bill, which was incompetently drafted in the first instance because it ignored the Opposition, something so fundamental to the working of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we cannot get either the Allowance Bill or the Finance Bill.  At most we have only one hour's work this morning.  We are being compelled to adjourn all day and threatened with weekend sittings.  On this side of the House we will be very slow in facilitating people in this kind of operation. <Col N="687" /> I am the most reasonable person in the world.  Our attitude since coming into this House in the new Seanad has shown that this group are willing to facilitate the Government in every way possible, but we will not rescue them from their own total incompetence.</P>
    <P>Again, I would ask the media to spell out this attitude out loud and clearly, which they refused to do on previous occasions, that time and again this Government are showing themselves to be composed of people of total and gross ineptitude and incompetence in every and deep meaning of those words.  The only legislation worthwhile which has been passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas since the new Oireachtas came into being has been legislation which we, as a Government, decided upon prior to the last general election.  Any new initiative on their part has been marred by total ineptitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could reply to the points which were raised by Senator Lenihan's statement, made apparently for the benefit of the media, as he spelled out himself.  It is well known to Senators on all sides of the House that so far as this House is concerned we depend largely for the business to be ordered here on the flow of business coming from the other House.  If a party in the other House set themselves on a course of filibustering in order to grind the business in the other House to a halt that has its effect here.  I am not going to speak for the benefit of the media, as apparently Senator Lenihan felt it proper to do, on the Order of Business in this House.  I merely invite Senators to follow what has been happening in the other House during the last few days and form their own judgment as to where the responsibility lies for the fact that the business in this House has not been able to be ordered and to run smoothly.</P>

      <P>I ask the Senators to follow that and draw their own conclusions.  As far as I am concerned, I do not want to see anything bulldozed through this House.  I would have a very easy mind if the Seanad were to decide that they would prefer not to deal with the Parliamentary Allowances Bill this side of the Recess.  I have an open mind on the matter.  If that is the general feeling, I see no reason why the Members of this House should be held up in their business or arrangements because of filibustering tactics by Fianna Fáil in the other House.</P>

    <Title>Private Business. - Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill, 1973: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>In a judgment delivered on 16th July the Supreme Court declared section 44 (2) (a) of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, to be invalid as being repugnant to the Constitution. The provision in question is an extremely important one; without it, Part V of the 1968 Act, which introduced the offences of driving, attempting to drive or being in charge of a vehicle while the blood-alcohol level exceeds a specified limit, cannot be operated effectively.  Although proceedings can still be taken for the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; offences of driving, <i>et cetera,</i> while under the influence of drink, it is highly desirable that legislation should be enacted at the earliest possible date to enable the institution of prosecutions for the offences created by the 1968 Act to be resumed.  The main purpose of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill, 1973, is, therefore, to substitute a new paragraph for the paragraph in section 44 of the 1968 Act which has been declared to be unconstitutional. In addition, the Bill provides for certain necessary amendments of Part V of the 1968 Act.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill, which relates to interpretation, and section 8, which provides for short title and collective citation, do not call for special comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> Sections 2 to 6, by amending a number of sections of the 1968 Act, will remove the restriction by which a requisition to an arrested person to provide a blood or urine specimen may be made only by the member of the Garda Síochána who is in charge of the Garda station when the person is brought there.  Difficulties have arisen in relation to the existing provisions because of changes in Garda organisation and working hours following the implementation of the Conroy report. Moreover, changes in these provisions are desirable to facilitate the introduction of the Special Traffic Corps.  I am satisfied that the best course is to make the amendments proposed in sections 2 to 6 and thereby enable any member of the Garda Síochána to carry out the necessary procedures.</P>
    <P>Section 7 amends section 44 of the 1968 Act to take account of the Supreme Court decision and to improve the existing provisions relating to evidence.  In subsection (2) (a), it will now be provided that a certificate from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety as to a person's blood-alcohol level will be &ldquo;sufficient evidence until the contrary is shown&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;conclusive evidence&rdquo;.  It was the use of the word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; that led the Supreme Court to declare the existing provision invalid.  In subsection (2) (b), a minor change in wording is being made, on the advice of the Attorney General's Office, to improve the evidential value of the certificate referred to in the subsection.  The new subsection (3) is designed to remove the possibility that the prosecution may be called on to prove in each case, by production of current medical registers <i>et cetera,</i> that the doctor who took the blood or urine specimen is a &ldquo;registered medical practitioner&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the amendments proposed in the Bill are necessary in order that the provisions of Part V of the 1968 Act may serve the purpose for which they were designed.  Senators will be aware of the importance of these provisions and of the part they can play in reducing the number of deaths and injuries on our roads.  I am sure, therefore, that they will appreciate the necessity to have all Stages of the <Col N="690" /> Bill dealt with as a matter of urgency; indeed I hope that it will be possible to take all Stages of the Bill today. Moreover, because of the need to restore the provisions of the 1968 Act to full effect at the earliest possible date, the Government have decided that the prior concurrence of Seanad Éireann should be sought, pursuant to Article 25.2.2 of the Constitution, in a request to the President to sign the Bill as soon as may be after it is presented to him.  Accordingly, an appropriate motion has been put down on the Order Paper of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I might mention that, if the Bill is enacted, some consequential amendments will be necessary in the regulations made under Part V of the 1968 Act.  The drafting of the necessary amending regulations is in hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is welcome and necessary but at the same time it carries some salutary lessons particularly in regard to Government Departments introducing legislation.  I was a member of the Government when the 1968 Act was being discussed and at that time the Department of Justice had very strong views <i>vis-á-vis</i> local government on this precise amendment which is now necessary. At that time, as Minister for Justice, we warned the Minister for Local Government and his Department that this was a very hazardous area from the constitutional point of view.</P>
      <P>It is important that all Government Departments and the Government generally in bringing in legislation should bear in mind the constitutional position and the realities of the law and not make such a blatant intrusion into the whole system of law and of the Constitution as this particular provision in regard to conclusive evidence now proves to be.  It was a blatant intrusion into the ordinary legal system that provides for courts where matters must be proved and at the same time are open to rebuttal.  The notion of a certificate being conclusive evidence in regard to blood alcohol level was from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; blatantly unconstitutional, blatantly invalid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> Nobody here questions the validity of the objective involved in bringing in the blood alcohol level test.  It is an all-important social need in order to control the evil of drunken driving. But there is no point in pursuing desirable objectives and at the same time steamrolling the law and the Constitution in order to achieve them.  As a result of a Supreme Court decision we are now remedying a defect that was so totally obvious at the time of the introduction of the Bill five years ago. As I said the point was made at the time to the Department of Local Government that this type of measure, which one gets from time to time in other Bills from other Departments, is usually because of a fault in administration where it is felt that matters can be bulldozed through without any regard to the law or the Constitution. This can only lead people into trouble, because we have a system of open courts and a Constitution and law.</P>
    <P>The other main matter being introduced in the Bill is also highly desirable. An ingenious lawyer first made the point and, as a result, a number of prosecutions have been dismissed throughout the country on the basis that it was a garda other than the garda in charge of the station who organised the blood test.  The fact that only the garda in charge of the station could do this meant in effect that the ordinary day-to-day administration of justice in regard to drunken driving offences was frustrated to a very high degree.  Only one garda at a station could deal with any number of drunken driving defendants who might be apprehended and brought into the station.  In that way the law was frustrated.</P>
    <P>Of course, this was not the original intention of the section; but on a close reading of it, as originally drafted, an ingenious lawyer discovered this.  It was followed up in a number of cases and there have been wholesale dismissals as a result.  The amendment to the section now makes it quite clear that any garda in the station can, once the defendant is brought in, direct the blood test <Col N="692" /> which must be carried out by a medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>The fact that up to now only one garda, that is the garda in charge of the station, could arrange the blood test and give evidence in regard to it gave rise to a number of cases being dismissed and put an undue onus on the Garda Síochána.  It meant that in any particular station one would have to have for almost 24 hours a garda in charge of the station specifically for these particular cases.  This was a futile and frustrating system of police administration and in order to remedy that the opportunity is being taken here to bring in this additional amendment, an amendment welcomed by everyone interested in the practical administration of justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>Who was responsible for the drafting of the legislation in the 1968 Bill?  We were castigated just now because of the drafting of a Bill now being debated in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The point which occurs to me in relation to Senator Butler's intervention is that we now have an efficient Opposition, something which apparently did not exist in 1968.  We endeavour to find out these flaws in Bills before they are enacted.</P>
      <P>On the general question of this Bill, it clearly is a non-political matter and there is no point being contentious about it.  One must welcome the Bill. Since we are discussing drafting matters I should like to congratulate the Minister, or his advisers, or both, on the manner in which it is set out. It is a pleasure to see.  We have the various sections laid out with section 3 providing for the substitution of one word for another and so on.  In 99 times out of 100 that would be that, but in this case we also have the words &ldquo;...accordingly the said subsection shall have effect as set out in the Table to this section&rdquo;.  There is a convenient Table setting out the section as it will now read, and this makes life much easier for all concerned. I wish more of these Bills coming before us were put in this form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first reaction on seeing this Bill was to regret that something had not <Col N="693" /> been done about the totally unrealistic level at which the blood alcohol level was fixed in the 1968 Bill. On further consideration I realised that in an urgent Bill of this kind clearly one could not expect such a fundamental matter to be dealt with.  However, in this country we have the highest permitted level in these blood alcohol tests of any in the world.  I do not think any other country comes anywhere near our level.  In all the continental countries of Europe a man is considered to be blind drunk by the time he reaches the level at which we permit people to drive.</P>
    <P>I should like to know that some consideration is being given to this matter in the Department of Local Government.  I would be interested to know, for example, what their view is about the universally prevailing medical view that at the level stipulated by us a man is simply not fit to drive a car.  It is utterly unrealistic to be setting a figure of this kind.  Anyone you catch is literally blind drunk and should be put off the road indefinitely. But the point is that people apparently are permitted to drive at levels of 90, 100, 105 and 110 who should not be driving.  Once they take the test and come below this mythical figure of 120 are they considered to be good, law-abiding members of the community? I would be interested to know whether the Department have given any consideration to this matter, whether they have medical evidence of their own which conflicts with the universal evidence which seems to be accepted in all countries and whether in some future Bill some more realistic figure may be inserted.  In saying that, I am being completely consistent in this matter as I made the same point when the original Bill was going through the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it is evidence of how quickly the Parliament can correct something that has been found to be unconstitutional in the courts.  I am glad we are able to do so before the Summer Recess.  I should like to ask one question arising out of the Bill.  It does not <Col N="694" /> deal at all with the persons who were convicted on the basis of the report found to be unconstitutional because it was regarded as conclusive proof of the condition of the particular accused. I am not quite sure whether this could be dealt with in the text of this Bill, but there is a problem in relation to the people who have had their licences endorsed because of what has now been found to be unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>The second point I wish to make&mdash; I note Senator Alexis FitzGerald is absent and I am sure he would like to make it&mdash;is that we wish to congratulate the draftsman on the fact that the Bill contains these tables setting out what the law is, thereby, making it a great deal easier for anybody working with this Act to know exactly in what way the 1968 Act was amended.  This is essential in a Bill of this nature which is introduced in an emergency situation in order to remedy a constitutional defect.  It would be very difficult for any legal practitioner if it was in the old style merely by reference to the 1968 Act.  It is immensely helpful and clear to have the table setting out exactly what the position now is. I welcome the Bill and I welcome the way in which it has been drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make two points on the Bill.  The first has been referred to by Senator Robinson, that is the question of what is going to happen to those people who have been convicted under the section of the 1968 Act which has now been found to be unconstitutional.  It does not affect so much people who have been fined, but it does affect very severely those people who have had their licences removed under this section. What is the Minister going to do about them and what will their position be now that the Act has been found to be unconstitutional because of the word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my second point I wish to support Senator Yeats in his assertion that the level at which the test is now fixed is far too high.  The alcohol level of the blood permitted in Ireland is the highest of any European country, as Senator Yeats pointed out.  We have to face up to the fact <Col N="695" /> that we have two problems in this country.  We have a well-known alcoholism problem and we have a well-known drunken driving problem. We, in the Legislature, should support any moves to tackle these problems firmly.  The percentage of road accidents in this country which can be traced directly to the driver being drunk is extremely high.  It is up to us to put teeth into the legislation and to ensure that we start to get a grip on this very serious problem. I would make a plea that the level at which the test is now fixed should be reduced to something which is closer to the norm accepted in the other countries which have this type of regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill.  I was a bit perturbed when I listened to Senator Lenihan.  He pointed out that when the 1968 Act was introduced the Department of Local Government were warned that that section could be declared to be unconstitutional.  It is bad enough to make a mistake in ignorance but to be warned beforehand and continue on the same road is worse still.  We are now in the position that people who have lost their licences over the last five years could also have lost their jobs because of it.</P>
      <P>As Senator West has pointed out, too many people are drinking heavily. As a result, the lives of citizens are in danger.  It has been discovered that we have failed to bring in legislation under which people could be properly charged because of a section which is repugnant to the Constitution.  That is a serious matter.  I welcome this amending Bill and I sincerely hope that the present Department will not make the same mistake as the Department made in 1968.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with those who expressed appreciation of the way in which the amendment was set out in this Bill.  It is going a <Col N="696" /> certain distance in the direction which I have, many times in the past, asked Government draftsmen to proceed in, that is, where possible instead of merely introducing an amendment of a Bill to introduce the original Bill in a consolidated form containing the amendment in question.  There are many branches of the law in which the relevant matter goes back through a number of Acts and it might be very difficult for people.  This particular Act merely goes back to two former Acts, the Road Traffic Acts of 1961 and 1968.  This would have been an ideal case where those two Acts could have been consolidated with the amendments which have been brought in under this Bill.  I appreciate there was a certain amount of urgency in this case and the urgency was justified because of the importance of the matter concerned.  However, I would, while expressing appreciation for the way in which this Bill was set out, once again ask the Minister, and I direct my views to the Government draftsman, that when possible there should be in the future a practice of introducing consolidated Bills where former Acts and the amendments proposed would be brought out in the consolidated Bill and where everybody having to consult the finished Act would know exactly what the law was on the matter concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the amendments before us in this Bill it is a tragedy that at this point of time we have need for such legislation.  It is a poor reflection on our motorists and on the drinking habits of the Irish people in general.  Drunken driving is a curse of this modern age.  More and more people now own cars and therefore the risks that people have to take on the road are much greater.  I would ask the Department of Local Government to make an all-out effort by using all means at their disposal, every section of the media, in an effort to encourage people who use our roads today to give up drink.  It would be much better if we were regarded as the most sober community in Europe, but unfortunately we are not.  I would give the Department all my support in their efforts to induce people who drive cars on our roads <Col N="697" /> today to discontinue drinking.  I support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Begley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for the very courteous way in which they received the Bill.  I should also like to thank Senator Lenihan because I think that he started it off in the right direction.  I fully agree with what Senator Lenihan said and I think the points he made as far as the Garda are concerned are very good.  Any garda can now direct the test.  Everybody will agree that this is something that should have been tidied up long ago.  Senators Yeats and West made the point about the 80 milligrams.  That is the figure in the EEC countries.  When we agreed on 125 milligrams in this country that figure was recommended by a Commission, and they were supposed to be the experts.  However, the Minister said recently in the other House that he would take another look at that.</P>
      <P>Senators Robinson and West raised the point about persons convicted. The Department must wait for the Supreme Court judgment on that and, as Senator Robinson knows, that will take some time.  Strictly speaking however this is a matter for the Department of Justice and the Attorney General.  The action, if any, to be taken has not yet been decided.  At this stage therefore all the Minister can say is that the implications of the Supreme Court judgment are being considered.  It should be added that no one is in jail because of being convicted of any of the offences in question and that it is open to anyone, if he is aggrieved, to seek a remedy in the courts.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides for certain changes in connection with our exports of dairy products that have followed from our accession to the EEC and the adoption of the Community's agricultural system.  Up to 1st February last most of our exports of dairy produce were handled by An Bord Bainne under what was in effect a statutory export monopoly.  The board was established in 1961 by the Dairy Produce Marketing Act, 1961, and over the period since then it has been responsible for the development of our dairy produce exports.  It has performed this task with considerable success and its Kerrygold brand has gained a first-class reputation for Irish dairy produce on world markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the board had in effect a statutory export monopoly. Under EEC regulations, however, other persons could not be prohibited from exporting dairy produce, and so the fundamental basis of the statutory <Col N="699" /> board had to be abandoned.  To provide for the altered situation the dairy industry was encouraged by my predecessor in office and myself to get together and organise on co-operative lines to carry on the marketing functions previously carried on by the statutory board.</P>
    <P>The dairy industry has responded by setting up a co-operative body&mdash;An Bord Bainne Co-operative Ltd. &mdash;and since 1st February this society has been engaged in the export marketing of much of our dairy products.  A small number of co-operative societies have not yet committed themselves fully to the new society but I am hopeful that their reservations will be withdrawn and that the societies concerned will join with the great majority of Irish co-operative societies.  It is only by operating as one large centralised exporting unit that we can make the most of the opportunities that EEC membership has opened for us in the dairy products sector.  Only such a unit can command the necessary expertise and carry out promotional and marketing operations on the scale which is now required in international trading.  Also such a large unit is best able to arrange for the development and production of new products, which is so essential if our farmers are to get the maximum return for their milk.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 of the Bill before the House the new co-operative society is being helped to make a good start. This section transfers the assets and liabilities of the statutory Bord Bainne to the new society.  The assets were built up entirely from the former levy on milk supplied to creameries.  No Exchequer money is involved.  Until the accounts of the statutory board have been finalised, it is not possible to indicate precisely the net value of the assets but it is estimated at not less that £2½ million.  This sum is represented mainly by a majority holding in a British subsidiary, by an office block here in Dublin and by some cash.</P>
    <P>The assets are really the property of Irish creamery suppliers and so it is only proper that they should be used <Col N="700" /> to benefit milk producers generally. It is accordingly provided in section 4 that the assets transferred shall be used for the orderly marketing and distribution of dairy products for the benefit of the dairy industry.  As a safeguard for producers it is provided that if the society wish to dispose of or use the assets for purposes other than those specified in this section the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries must be obtained.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the dissolution of the statutory board.  At the moment it is not possible to give a precise date for this as it will depend on such matters as the finalising and auditing of the board's accounts.</P>
    <P>In section 6 provision is made for a State guarantee in respect of borrowings of up to £20 million by the new society.  This is necessary as centralised exporting of dairy products involves the borrowing of very large sums to finance the purchase of dairy products from creameries and processing firms.  Such borrowings by the statutory board have reached nearly £40 million at times and it is likely that the borrowing requirements of the new society will be even greater. Under the 1961 Act a guarantee in respect of borrowings of up to £5 million by the statutory board could be given by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  To help the new society to build up the same reputation, confidence and borrowing power which the old board had, the Government have decided to guarantee borrowings by the society up to the total of £20 million which I have mentioned.  This guarantee will be available up to the end of 1977, after which time the society should be able to borrow without State assistance.  A statement giving particulars of any guarantees given under this section will have to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas each year.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 9 provide for the staff of the statutory board.  They ensure for the staff the same terms that previously applied to them, and make detailed provision for their superannuation rights.  The society and the staff have agreed to the transfer arrangements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> In section 8 it is provided that 1973 shall not be a nomination year for the purposes of the Dairy Produce Marketing Act, 1961, under which Board Bainne was originally established. The term of office of the existing board members expires on 30th September but in view of the impending dissolution of the board there would be little point in implementing the elaborate procedure for electing new board members.  Because of this it is proposed by section 8 to prolong the term of office of the existing members until the board is dissolved.</P>
    <P>Under the 1961 Act the amount of the Exchequer grant to An Bord Bainne in any financial year must not exceed two-thirds of the board's export losses and subsidies.  The remaining third was met out of the levy on creamery milk suppliers.  At the end of 1971 with a view to gearing ourselves for entry into the EEC the milk price support arrangements were re-structured.  The milk price and quality allowances formerly paid direct to the creameries were incorporated in the board's export prices and as a result there was a substantial increase in the board's export losses and subsidies.  This however merely reflected a change in the method of paying Exchequer support.  The small amounts arising in the period between December, 1971, and 31st March, 1972, were dealt with on the former two-thirds/one-third basis but for the period from April, 1972, onwards it is necessary to remove the two-thirds limit on the proportion of the board's losses and subsidies which may be met by the Exchequer.  This is provided for in section 10 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>For the first time the dairy industry now has the opportunity to exploit its full potential.  It is important that the marketing side of the industry should be in a position to make the most of the opportunities that are available. This Bill helps the industry along the right road and I confidently recommend its terms to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill to the House and in doing so I should like to make a few short comments.  First of all the Bill, as <Col N="702" /> the Minister has already pointed out, is necessary because of our entry into the European Economic Community and because of regulations which the old board would not comply with in these circumstances.  A new co-operative board has to be formed to comply with EEC regulations.</P>
      <P>The growth of the dairy industry has been substantial within the last few years and there is a considerably greater quantity of milk products to be marketed.  Because of this a board involving all the interests of the dairy industry to a greater extent than ever before is an absolute essential.</P>
      <P>Previously we were relying on the British market to sell the greater proportion of our dairy products.  Now we will be getting our products, in so far as we can, into the European market and because of this the new board will have their work cut out for them to establish their brand on that market.  Milk production has leapt forward within the last year or two and I believe will continue to increase within the coming six, seven or eight years.  The result of this is that there is a great need for an active and very virile marketing arm with a clearly identified product brand, such as we have already in the &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; brand, and that this brand would be firmly established in the markets in Europe, as well as those in the Third World.  It is an absolute essential for our dairy farmers and for the processing portion of the industry as well.</P>
      <P>I would hope also that the new board will be fully representative of all the dairying interests in the country and that those processors who are still hesitant about coming into the new set-up will eventually do so in their own time.  We all know the difficulties of establishing a brand in the market place.  We must say that the old Board Bainne was eminently successful in establishing the &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; brand in Great Britain and indeed in many other markets throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his statement has suggested that the new board will be responsible for new product development. I believe this to be a very important <Col N="703" /> aspect of the new board's functions.  Because the present pricing system for our dairy products in Europe is based on an intervention price for butter and skim milk powder, at this moment if one asks what dairy products a processor should make from his milk intake the simple answer is that he should make butter and skim milk powder only.  Not alone is he guaranteed a price for his product if he does this but he is also guaranteed a market.  The intervention system is such that if he cannot sell in the open market his product will be brought up by the Community.</P>
    <P>The price of all other dairy products, as far as I know, is related to the butterfat price for milk.  It is thought by some authorities here that this mitigates against getting the best price possible for the farmer.  At the moment, as far as I am aware, milk which is processed into cheese is worth a halfpenny a gallon less than milk which is processed into skim milk powder.  I am open to correction on that but I believe that is the case.</P>
    <P>The present pricing system for milk in Europe is merely, in my view, compounding the difficulties of the butter and skim milk &ldquo;mountains&rdquo;, and of the butter mountain in particular.  There is very little incentive for those who have not already diversified into other milk products to do so.  Because of this I feel that possibly in the future the intervention price and buying should be related to a much wider range of dairy products.  This would help to divert a great deal of milk into, say, cheese manufacture and more milk powder manufacture and thus help to alleviate the position in regard to the butter &ldquo;mountain&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Milk producers generally have responded very well to the price impetus which the Common Market has given us for our dairy products.  Our export figures in 1972 were approximately £53 million worth of dairy products.  I believe that in 1973 we will possibly export as much as £100 million worth of dairy products, and from projections for the 1980's, beginning in 1980, it would appear there would be a total <Col N="704" /> export of approximately £200 million worth of dairy products at that time. If this is the case our farmers have shown great confidence in their industry. We all hope that this confidence will be justified by events in the future. They have invested very heavily in dairy cattle and dairy machinery and most of the money they have invested in this is borrowed capital.</P>
    <P>If the predictions which have been made in regard to the production of milk are correct the new board will have its work cut out to sell all these products to the best advantage in the European markets as well as in the world markets.  We all wish them well in their efforts and hope that our brand will be as firmly established in Europe as it has been in Great Britain in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill but I do not agree entirely with some of the statements made by the Minister, in particular his statement regarding the monopoly of sales by one organisation. I believe in competition and within the EEC this is what is required. I shall refer to that later.  In welcoming the Bill may I say I have personal knowledge of the workings of An Bord Bainne which has now been replaced by An Bord Bainne Co-operative Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Bainne was set up in 1961.  At that time we had difficulty with our exports abroad and it was necessary that a board be set up to explore the world markets to enable us to get the best benefit for all of our products. Were it not for An Bord Bainne we would have had very lean times during the years prior to our entry into the EEC when our dairy products were on quota in the British market.  Many nations throughout the world were importing dairy products.  Before Bord Bainne was set up we had not the ability to explore those markets.  When the board was set up the job was carried out efficiently by the people involved and we were able to export to countries even in the Far East.  The prices we obtained were not substantial but they helped to balance our payments and relieve us of a mountain of butter that was building up even in this country.  I extend my congratulation <Col N="705" /> to the board for all they have done.  The farmers owe a debt of gratitude to An Bord Bainne.</P>
    <P>In 1961, the year An Bord Bainne was established, 305 million gallons of milk was supplied to creameries.  In 1971, ten years after, 530 million gallons was supplied.  This year it is expected that 600 million gallons of milk will be supplied to creameries. The consumption of dairy products did not increase very substantially.  The increase in the production of milk which had to be converted into dairy products had to be sold elsewhere. There was an increase from 1961 to 1971 of 225 million gallons and this had to be exported.  The value of our dairy products in 1971 was £48 million. In 1972 it rose to £59 million.  It is estimated that the value of the 1973 figure will be substantially increased due to the substantial increase in prices for our dairy products abroad.</P>
    <P>By 1980, as Senator O'Callaghan has stated, it is estimated that our dairy products will be worth £200 million. This is a substantial income to this nation.  The farmers should be encouraged to produce more milk.  The breakdown of our produce exported by An Bord Bainne in 1971 is something we should look at.  It is very interesting from the point of view of the type of product we did produce and the type of product we should produce for the coming years.  In 1972 we exported 37,000 tons of butter, 27,500 tons of cheese, 27,000 tons of skim powder, 10,700 tons of whole milk powder, 52,000 tons of chocolate crumb, 5,600 tons of cream, 800 tons of casein and 7,000 tons of other dairy products. That was the job Bord Bainne had to do.  They deserve our congratulations for doing it.  The value of those exports was £59 million.  It was a great help to this nation that we could obtain through dairy products £59 million.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom Irish butter was getting the premium price of £455 to £465 a ton for sweet cream &ldquo;Kerry-gold&rdquo; butter and £477 a ton for lactic butter whereas the Danes, the Dutch and the New Zealanders were obtaining £416 to £476 a ton.  The price for Irish cheddar cheese on the British <Col N="706" /> market was £500 a ton whereas once again the Dutch, the Danes and the New Zealanders were receiving £470 to £500 a ton.  There was a difference in the type of cheddar cheese we were exporting.  Our cheddar cheese contained a higher butter fat.  Nonetheless the compensation we were receiving was higher than those countries would have obtained if their cheese had the same butter fat content as ours.</P>
    <P>With mountains of butter rising every now and then within the EEC it is up to us to seek alternative purchasing agencies.  The only way to do this was to form some kind of marketing board.  Ireland is a country of small creameries and such small creameries could not export dairy products.  Most of the small creameries were only making butter.  As Senator O'Callaghan has said, perhaps it would pay us all better if we were only making butter and skim milk powder now.  It is a matter the Minister should look at.</P>
    <P>Ours being a country of small creameries it was necessary to set up some type of marketing organisation.  What better organisation could we set up than the type of organisation represented by An Bord Bainne?  That board had the personnel, the people who had obtained the markets for us previously and who knew the contacts.  The transfer from Bord Bainne to Bord Bainne Co-operative Limited was the correct action.  Those who will make up the new board should be the people who made up the board of Bord Bainne.  These people knew what they are up against.  They would be able to get the maximum benefit for us.</P>
    <P>The bigger creameries may be able to sell against world competition. Bigger creameries are made up of all sections of the farming community, from the farmer right up to the top executive negotiating in the EEC.  They were the people who got for us the type of product we have.  Bigger creameries can and will create the competition we need to earn the best price for our products and in turn the farmer will get the best price for his milk which produces these products.</P>
    <P>Bord Bainne, as the Minister stated, has a commanding share of Adams Foods in England and I congratulate <Col N="707" /> the bord on that purchase. They have obtained for us through that purchase access to the British market.  We can display our products on the British markets now.  We will be able to gain substantially from this access.</P>
    <P>While New Zealand exports to the UK will be declining from now until 1980, we must be in a position to fill the gap created by that decline.  We must be able to sell the same products as new Zealand as well as our own products.  The UK is a big market.  We need all the expertise we can get to get into this market.  We must also have competition in our market also.  The only problem will be if we have superflous competition. The way the creamery industry is developing at the moment we will not be troubled by superfluous competition.</P>
    <P>When the Bill had passed through the Dáil many of the directors of Bord Bainne asked the executive to have confidence in An Bord Bainne Co-operative in the future.  I also ask the executive of that board to have confidence in An Bord Bainne Co-operative whether it is in a monopoly situation or whether it is in competition with the bigger creameries.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan mentioned the transfer of butter fat from cheese to butter.  He mentioned that it pays more to make butter than cheese. This is a fact.  Enormous amounts of butter are being produced within the EEC.  Some notice must be taken of the fact that cheese is a product which contains from 30 per cent up to 50 per cent butter fat.  It is a way of selling butter fat.  Cheese is a product which is nutritious in every way. Creameries which are producing cheese at present are losing money substantially.  I know one creamery which over a period of four or five months have lost over £100,000 in the production of cheese.  Now that the Minister is present&mdash;I have already spoken to him on this matter &mdash;maybe something will be done.  I know the matter properly belongs to the Department of Industry and Commerce, but with his influence something may be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the others in welcoming this Bill.  At the outset I wish to pay a very well-deserved tribute to Bord Bainne.  In the 12 years of its existence it has more than justified all the high hopes which were expressed for the board when it was launched in 1961.  No greater tribute can be paid to the board than to say that in that short period it has moved our dairy products in the British market into the position where they are commanding a premium&mdash;a premium on butter and, as outlined by previous speakers, a premium on cheese also.  That is a very satisfactory position and a great deal of credit is due to the imaginative approach to marketing which was taken and the launching of the brand name &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; which succeeded in making a very big impact on the British public.  Everyone connected with the board deserves the highest praise and compliments for what they have done, especially the present chief executive, Mr. McGough, who has contributed so much during his tenure of the office.  We can face the future, then, with confidence.</P>
      <P>It is a happy augury that what in a sense is being forced on us through the EEC regulations or through the procedure of free competition succeeds in changing a statutory board to a co-operative one.  This is a step in the right direction and one we are ready to undertake.  It is a step where the industry must take more responsibility for the job than prevailed heretofore when it was a statutory board and governed by that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that this transfer to the co-operative system will at last succeed in sparking the co-operative movement. We have a proud history in the matter of the co-operative movement. It was the thinking of Sir Horace Plunket and Father Tom Finlay which at the start of the century launched the co-operative movement. The idea was taken up by Denmark and New Zealand and they quickly surpassed our use of it.  There are reasons why we did not develop fast enough due to our markets and our general history at the time.  They <Col N="709" /> have taken the co-operative movement to the type of joint international trading combines which are dealing with Danish, Dutch and other products. Now we are arriving on the scene with this.</P>
    <P>In our approach to this I hope we shall be able to infuse a dash of Father Tom Finlay's thinking: that the end result of co-operation is the betterment of the people concerned in the industry and of their fellow citizens. I hope the idealism of the early founders will serve to guide the new co-operative movement and that this will more than counterbalance the rather rugged cut-throat business methods which are unfortunately a feature of many of the joint co-operatives in other countries.  We should take a balanced approach; and I appeal to the giants of the co-operative movement, such as the creamery combines, to play their part fully in this new development.  There may be some short-term gain for standing aside but the national interest in the long run will be best served if the larger creamery units accept it as a national duty to play their part and to help the weaker section of the co-operative movement to expand and develop as part of An Bord Bainne Co-operative Limited.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker stated that some creameries have lost by producing cheese over the past few months.  I agree, and as far as it lies within the power of the Government some effort should be made to compensate to some extent for that.  Be that as it may, in such circumstances cremeries geared for the production of cheese, if they look to the long term prospect of the dairying industry, will see they must stay in production. They cannot afford to lose the market they have so carefully fostered and developed over the past decade and they will need those markets and the premiums to be got in those markets over and above the production of easier products such as butter.  These premiums will be there to be got in the years ahead.  If there is a loss to be taken this year I am confident that that will be more than made up in <Col N="710" /> the years ahead when a more rational policy, which will make for better utilisation of our milk, will gradually emerge.</P>
    <P>Cheese is far more labour-intensive than butter, and while the switch over from cheese to butter this year might have been economic for the creamery unit concerned, for the nation it meant the throwing of several thousands of workers in the creameries out of employment.  In this era of free competition we must endeavour to ensure that the national interest is kept to the fore; and while I do not think the Government, under new EEC regulations are in a position to compel, they can exhort, and this applies to all sections of the community who can exert a moral pressure in this supposedly free-for-all EEC system.  We must put the national interest first.  Our first job and the greatest contribution we can make to the welfare of Europe is to put our own house in order and to develop our own community and its resources.  I hope this new co-operative will, from the outset, take Father Finlay's and Sir Horace Plunkett's philosophy as their guide and that they and the Minister will strive for this.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to have a look at the legislation for the co-operative organisation.  Some slight amendment on voting procedures was made two years ago.  That ensured in a minor way that only those who were genuinely part of the industry had a real say in it.  Take the case of the village publican with one cow; his voice was reduced to the level of one cow.  The time is long overdue for a good look at the legislation under which this operates.</P>
    <P>The assets of Bord Bainne are being transferred even though they have substantial capital of £2½ million.  That is worth an annual income of £200,000 per year approximately to this new body.  There is no immediate wish to run down the capital involved.  Not too much can be done with £200,000 a year, yet I should like to think that the priorities could be extended somewhat. The Act states this can be used for the orderly marketing and distribution of the product.  There is a step before marketing: the orderly production, <Col N="711" /> marketing and distribution.  We must start from production and that is probably our weakest point at present in that we still have not succeeded in organising a 40-hour week for the dairying industry.  I do not mean that literally, but we have not made it possible for those working in the dairying industry to have time off, holidays and relief service to take over when they are sick.</P>
    <P>An absolute essential for the real development of the dairying industry is the development of a really efficient relief service for farmers.  This could be attached to the local co-operative centre and could include milking units. In that way a farmer could ring up and arrange to get the milking unit down to his farm to do the milking for him for a day, a week, a month, or even to contract it out for a year if necessary. If we introduce such a system it will mean that workers in the dairying industry will no longer feel tied for seven days a week to the job, that they can have time off whenever they want it.  They can pay for the service and they will be willing to pay for it.</P>
    <P>That is something that I had hoped the Government in the past would have taken a much more positive lead in by giving some financial inducement in the early years to get the service going. After a very short time such a service should be more than self-financing.  I doubt if the Government can now enter that field under EEC conditions.  I believe the impetus will now have to come from the co-operative movement itself.  Perhaps Bord Bainne Co-operative Limited could take a lead in this and provide some financial incentive to get the scheme under way.  Can the Government in any way co-operate in getting such an overdue and worthwhile system going?  From a national point of view it would result in some very good and permanent employment for our people.  That is still our first priority.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the guarantee of Bord Bainne Co-operative Limited&mdash;the Government guarantee has been increased from £5 to £20 million &mdash;is to be ceased 1977.  That does not <Col N="712" /> do very much more than make up for the devaluation that has occurred since 1961.  If it is possible, it should be left open-ended.  It is a pity to tie it to just four years hence.  I welcome what has been done and I hope that this will be the spur for which the co-operative movement has been waiting.</P>
    <P>In the past the central organisation of the co-operative movement, the IAOS, had little power and less money. I wonder if in the future the financial angle of it will be capable of being subvented in some way through the dealings of Bord Bainne Co-operative Limited.  It is essential that such a board undertakes its functions correctly and that it should be prepared to invest in research into orderly marketing of products and so on.  It is quite a common feature of co-operatives elsewhere that they are alive to the advantages of research and they invest fairly heavily in that field.  I hope that this co-operative will do likewise.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to resist the present ill-advised effort that is being made to try to bring agricultural research under the one umbrella of all research in this country.  There is an effort to tie-in the spending on agricultural research and to make it subservient to or dependent on the Science Council. I think that would be the height of folly, because research as carried out in agriculture is 95 per cent development. It is not the type of research pioneering into the unknown that is properly labelled as research in other fields.  The personnel of the Science Council would not be sympathetic to that type of approach.  I appeal to the Minister to use his influence to see that that does not happen. I welcome what has been done. We look forward to a continuation of the pioneering spirt of Bord Bainne Co-operative Limited in this great work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  We are all aware that it has been necessary to insert the word &ldquo;co-operative&rdquo; after the title of the old Bord Bainne, which was first established in 1961.  I should like to bring Senator's minds back to a period prior <Col N="713" /> to 1961 when this country was importing dairy products.  Great changes have taken place in that short period. We have now become a powerful competitor in Europe and in Britain in the sale and disposal of our agricultural products.  Great tribute should be paid to Bord Bainne for their success and their achievements in the last 12 years.</P>
      <P>I remember that when Bord Bainne was established many people had grave misgivings and doubts with regard to the ability of this board to market our dairy products, to succeed in establishing new markets for our farmers or to succeed in getting our farmers to produce more dairy products.  Many people at that time felt that the establishment of Bord Bainne was just another way of creating &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo; but I am glad to say that it has exceeded the expectations of many and its achievements are now accepted by every section of the community. Bord Bainne's efforts would have been useless had it not been for the fact that the farming community responded to the call to produce more and more dairy products over the years.  We must pay tribute to them for their efforts to produce such products in recent years when it was not profitable for them to do so.  Now it has become a profitable enterprise and our farmers have responded to the call to increase their production.</P>
      <P>We now fully realise that this new board must meet the challenge of the future.  They must endeavour to secure more and more markets for the greater amount of produce which will be available from Irish farms.  Every effort must be made to give this board our full support.  We must ensure that every possible outlet is availed of and that no surplus products are left on our hands in the future.  We had mountains of butter in cold storage in this country some years ago but I am glad that is not the situation now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dairy farmers are conscious of the role that they are playing as producers of this great product and of their efforts to build up the economy of this country.  For that reason I welcome the changes made necessary by our membership of the EEC.  I give <Col N="714" /> this new board my full support and I wish them every success in their efforts in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. My thinking on the advances that are likely to accrue from it follows the lines expressed by Senator Quinlan. The organisation, success and advance of dairying in this country, is entirely due to the co-operative movement.  I come from an area which is to a considerable extent within the ambit of one of the most successful co-operative's in the country, that is, the Killeshandra Co-operative.  With Senator Keegan, I feel that Bord Bainne, through their association with the manager of that co-operative, Mr. O'Neill, has done a lot of good in that area, and I express thanks to Mr. O'Neill for that.  For his contribution in the management and advance of Bord Bainne the nation stands in considerable debt.</P>
      <P>Technical organisation is a very important factor in the marketing and the efficiency of the dairying industry, from the level of the collection of milk to its transport and manufacture into butter and cheese in the creameries.  The distance, the mode of conveyance and the efficiency in the creamery have a considerable effect on the national advantages that our dairy expert and industrial services represent with resulant effect on the national income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether or not the farmer with the three, four or six cows in North Longford, in Leitrim, Roscommon or Cavan can look forward to the same income as the man with the 150 cows in Cork, Tipperary or Limerick&mdash; that is the real basis on which this industry is to be judged.  In the part of the country where milk production has been introduced, in counties like Meath, Westmeath and South Longford, which are essentially grade A areas, the Government over the last number of years have been offering incentives to farmers to get out of milk.  Recently those incentives have been increased.  We get a bigger grant if we get out of it and stay out of it for a certain length of time.  On a national examination of this we must feel there is a conflict of interests somewhere.  The success of the <Col N="715" /> dairying industry, which was referred to by Senator Keegan, and the grasping of opportunities by the dairying farmers&mdash;all this does not appear to fit in with the need that seems to exist to get people out of milk production.</P>
    <P>In the past the smaller farmer, and to some extent the bigger farmer, had been producing milk from a breed of cow that was capable of producing a good cross breed: the Irish Dairy Shorthorn.  We had a very successful export trade of Herefords or Aberdeen Angus in the past, but that apparently is now disappearing.  If we had the foundation stock of a very well developed Irish shorthorn dairy cow producing that type of breed it would be much easier to feed than the other breeds we have in the country&mdash;for instance, the Friesian, which is a very good milk-producing animal.  However, one could nearly say that three Shorthorns could be fed on the same amount that it would take to feed two Friesians.  I should like the Minister to know that this foundation stock, the Irish Dairy Shorthorn, is fast disappearing in this country.</P>
    <P>An effort was made a year or two ago to have a record taken of the extent to which it is disappearing and incentives were offered to people to produce from that dairy stock a succession of animals to ensure it would be retained. Look now at the whole picture of dairying in this country.  We have an incentive to produce milk, we have an incentive to leave milk production; we have an incentive to change our breeds; we have, at the same time, fear that certain very essential breeds are disappearing.</P>
    <P>Senator Ouinlan referred to the establishment of a 40-hour week in the dairying industry.  I can assure him that such is not known in places like North Longford, Leitrim or Roscommon or in the western counties.  What these people hope to attain is an 80-or 90-hour week.  I hope that when the Minister comes to apply standards he will apply them in such a way that the family producer of milk and his wife who work all those long hours will see some advance in their income, <Col N="716" /> resulting in a better and a happier home.  That is what we must have: people who live on the land being kept on the land.</P>
    <P>We must reach the stage when as many dairy farmers will be on the land as were on it ten, 15 or 20 years ago and that they will be getting a better living resulting in a happier home. While I appreciate fully that it is through the co-operative system this can be done, we must not lose sight of the standards of living of the family people engaged in dairying.  I wish the Minister every success with this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill and join with the others who have paid a well-deserved tribute to the members of Bord Bainne for the excellent work they did since they were established in 1961.  The figures quoted by Senators have shown the tremendous expansion that has taken place in our agricultural production since then.  The policy pursued by the various Ministers was certainly responsible and the encouragement given to farmers helped considerably.</P>
      <P>One of the most important factors in bringing about that increase was the heifer scheme introduced some years ago, which helped to increase the cattle population.  If we had not the cows, naturally we would not have all these milk products; and you do not get them except by long-term planning.</P>
      <P>I want to agree wholeheartedly with what Senator Kilbride has said regarding the Killeshandra area, where I live myself.  I want to join with him in paying a well-deserved tribute to the chairman of Bord Bainne and Mr. O'Neill, whom he mentioned there.  I might mention incidentally that Mr. O'Neill has been manager in Killeshandra since 1947.  We are in a traditional milk area and our creamery has been exporting since 1898.  It could not have lasted in a competitive market such as we then had without being able to produce a very efficient product.  Indeed, the standard and quality of our butter was so good that our creamery has won the Reed Cup on many occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key to good salesmanship is clean excellent production.  It reflects great credit on the local farmers, who <Col N="717" /> supply this clean milk, and on the efficiency of the staff that we have this reputation.  Without boasting, I may say that in our county we have won the Tidy Towns Competition on many occasions and we have also won the trophy for the tidiest county in Ireland. As I said, we also scored many times as far as best butter production is concerned.</P>
    <P>So that this trend will continue and expand the Minister will want to look into this position in future and indeed get into consultation with his other Cabinet colleagues regarding the rapid expansion of the regional water scheme.  Such a scheme is certainly tied up with the efficiency which goes with producing milk and clean, top class dairy products of various kinds.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister also examine the question of diversification, apart from going into cheese and milk powder which is already being catered for.  Up in the North-West we have an excellent factory which was established in 1961 for the export of milk powder.  This has been a tremendous asset to this area and over 300 are employed there.  Again it is true to say that without the contacts which we have had&mdash;and I mention here especially Mr. Lawless of McCormack's Milk Powder&mdash;and without the effort put into it by Bord Bainne, it would be impossible to sell in the now highly-competitive market situation abroad.</P>
    <P>Practically all our economy in this country is in one way or another tied to the farming industry.  While farming to some may be a satisfying life, it is a very difficult occupation for people in 1973.  Very many people are now leaving the land; indeed very many young farmers often find it difficult to get eligible marriage partners to live a life on the land with them.  Consequently the rural population has been dwindling and the only method now whereby we can counteract it is by giving to those living in rural Ireland amenities and opportunities equal to those now enjoyed by the people living in urban and city areas.</P>
    <P>Education must play a major part in this.  It is very important that the <Col N="718" /> role of the farmer's wife and her status should be looked upon as equal to that of those in any other profession or position in this country.  As it is at present, it is deemed by many a very hard life.  I came from Killeshandra this morning and before 7 o'clock the cows all around that area had been gathered in for milking. That means that these people had to be out since 6 o'clock this morning. They will have to do the same again in the evening and on Saturdays and Sundays.  Some Senators will agree that there is no 40-hour week and no set hours.  This should be remembered that those who are now clamouring to tax the farmers because they seem to be enjoying some well-deserved, hard-earned bit of extra remuneration and because they have succeeded in ekeing out a meagre existence for themselves and their families.  Many of the small farmers I know just barely succeed in doing this.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister to speed up if at all possible the rationalisation of smaller creameries in areas where those creameries are not in a position to pay people an economic price for their milk.  The difference between the prices paid is sometimes rather alarming.  While I appreciate that smaller creameries may not be able to pay a price similar to those paid by their more efficient neighbours, at the same time that is no satisfaction to the family producing milk in an area hemmed in by the Border on one side and probably by mountains on the other.</P>
    <P>This rationalisation should be done immediately.  Up in the north-west of Cavan and Leitrim, in particular, it is very much needed.  Here, the land and the soils present a very difficult obstacle for people who keep cattle, especially in the winter period; and a much below average price for the milk produced does not help.  Apart from these few observations, I welcome the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamWhyte" hpid="Mr. Whyte Mr. Whyte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Whyte</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the other Senators, welcome this Bill.  It is necessary at this time because of the new EEC regulations.  I, too, would like to compliment the old board. They did a good job in difficult times after they were established.  The situation which obtained when they were established was the worst it could possibly be.  We did not have any arrangements at all for the marketing of our dairy produce.  They had to build from the ground up.  They succeeded far better than many of us thought.  Some Senators have already remarked that people said it was just another arrangement to establish a further board to make jobs for the boys.  It did not turn out to be so, and they deserve to be complimented.</P>
      <P>This new board has a huge job to do.  They are coming in at a time when there are markets for our dairy produce, markets which were not there in the past.  They are coming in at a time when we are not as well geared to use those markets as we ought because over the past number of years we have had a stock low policy.  Today it is feasible, and supposedly patriotic, to produce milk and dairy produce.</P>
      <P>For some political reasons we are expected to tone down production. Anybody engaged in agriculture knows that this is not possible.  It is a long-term job that needs long-term planning over a number of years.  Unfortunately in the past this has not been the position in agriculture.  I often thought that agriculture ought to have been taken outside the field of politics altogether and that an independent board should plan for agriculture.  This has not happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would hope that from now on we would have a more enlightened view on those matters.  Let us remember that this country by and large depends to a great extent upon agricultural produce.  It might be said that dairy produce is a by-product of other things and may become more so in the future. We may have a surplus of dairy produce. Nonetheless, without dairy <Col N="720" /> duce you cannot have beef and other things that spring from that.  This country produces only half of what it could produce in the nature of dairy produce, beef and meats of all sorts.</P>
    <P>The people engaged in agriculture up to now have been living at a mere subsistence level.  The people who are still engaged in agriculture may accept that for the rest of their time, but young people coming into agriculture will no longer accept the conditions that have existed up to now.  One Senator remarked this morning that many of the cows have to be collected before 8 a.m. and the farmers will still be working until 8 p.m.  This is a 12-hour day. People cannot be expected to accept this.  In addition, farmers work a seven-day week.  If we are to keep people in this industry then they need reasonable pay, reasonable hours and reasonable facilities for off-time.  If people are given such conditions then the industry will be efficient.  It must do as good a job as is possible for the nation.</P>
    <P>I accept the view expressed by a Senator that we need competition.  But competition within the country may not be the best way of doing things. We are a small country exporting to a world market.  We have huge competitors also exporting to that market. We have to ensure that our produce is up to the highest possible standard. We have to ensure that our products are marketed in the best possible way without any waste or duplication.  To do that we all need to work together.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister when he said he would like to see all of the co-ops supporting this new board.  We have got to do that.  Even doing that, we are still a small unit within the European context.  Competition is necessary; but we have to ensure that our dairy produce leaving this country, whether through this new board or Government-inspected, is up to the very highest standard.  Produce which is acceptable on the world market now may well be out-of-date in a year or two.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that a huge amount of money be available for dairy research in this country.  This will be a recurring process.  The money necessary for this must come from the <Col N="721" /> dairy industry itself.  This is all the more reason why this new board which it is proposed to set up ought to be in a position to retain a certain amount, however, this is to be arranged, in order to ensure that we continue to be in the forefront of the markets of Europe and the world.</P>
    <P>We have the growing volume of produce in this country.  We could produce twice as much as we are doing at present.  I believe we will do this because farmers in general have confidence in their industry. Very much of the profits that have been made in agriculture over the last two or three years have not gone to ease the lot of the farmer, very often they have not gone towards improving his living conditions, which need to be improved very considerably. Most of that extra money has gone back into agriculture.  The production from those extra moneys will not be seen for a year or two.  It is almost a certainty that a huge volume of produce will be coming on the market over the next few years and it is essential that this board should have proper markets for this produce and be in a position to continue to develop those markets.  That problem is best handled by a co-operative board with the full support of all the co-operatives.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of the dairy industry which one could discuss here today, but it is perhaps better not to stay too long on that. Nonetheless, farmers will have to realise that we are now in the age of specialisation.  It is very likely that much of our agricultural produce here will be switched into particular lines. It looks as if dairying will be one of those.</P>
    <P>Senators have already asked what is the future of the smaller farmer, the man with four or five cows.  The future for the man in that job alone is not very bright.  We must remember that very many farmers have a small number of cows and they are also dabbling in other types of agriculture.  They will probably come to realise that in their own interests, and probably in the national interest, they should specialise in one particular line.  It may well be <Col N="722" /> dairying.  We have a long way to go there.  The markets are there now. There is confidence in the industry. There is no reason why we should not continue to expand.</P>
    <P>If we are to do that we will need the full co-operation of other boards in the country.  The ESB spring to mind at once.  I will not dwell on this but the amount of current available at farm level is very important to the agricultural industry.  It may well be said that farmers installed the current ten, 15 or 20 years ago and they may not have done as good as job as was necessary then.  They did not envisage the huge amount of current now needed.  Nonetheless, the ESB are probably at fault because they have not made the necessary current available to the farmers.  They will have to do this in the future because it is very important to the industry.  Without that increase the industry cannot carry on in an efficient way.</P>
    <P>Farmers ought to be in a position to have their farm workers properly trained.  There should be opportunities to acquire the skills that are necessary and which will be even more necessary in the future.  Our policy with regard to agricultural education is rather lacking.  A few scholarships are available at county committee level.  If people do not measure up to the high standard required there are no facilities for them to obtain further education on agricultural lines.  This is deplorable.  Everybody going into agriculture now ought to have a very high standard of education and a high degree of technical skill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It was necessary at this time.  A huge amount of money will be necessary.  When I see those figures of the guarantees available to us in the future I feel that more moneys will be necessary.  It will be necessary for the farmers, through this board and through the other co-ops, to push a lot more money into agriculture.  The markets are there.  The opportunities are there.  We have the will from our present Government to ensure that all those favourable opportunities will be availed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to <Col N="723" /> apologise to the Seanad for having to leave the House to take part in a Division in the Dáil.  I wish to thank the Members of the House for their support for this Bill and for their appreciation of the need and desirability for such a measure.  From the contributions made, it is quite obvious that there is a very full appreciation of the importance of the dairy industry and of the opportunities available in present circumstances for further expansion and development in this industry generally.</P>
      <P>I will try in the course of replying to answer the various comments made by the speakers.  I agree generally with the ideas and comments expressed in the course of this debate.  It was remarkable throughout the debate that speaker after speaker complimented Bord Bainne on the wonderful job they had done over the years and expressed high expectations of the work they were likely to do for the industry in the future.  I share that confidence and I should like to add my tribute to the work that Bord Bainne have done for the dairy industry.  The only real disagreement I have&mdash;and I am sorry to have to disagree with my own colleague&mdash;is with the view which Senator Butler put forward on centralised selling and which he holds quite strongly.</P>
      <P>I find it extremely difficult to understand Senator Butler's approach to this matter and how he sees that competition could be healthy and desirable in this particular aspect of the industry.  It will be shown before very long that individual units of the industry, perhaps, could have a short-term advantage by selling in a particular market, but that is something which I do not think will survive. Large-scale selling will show its advantages as time goes on.  We will have a 100 per cent selling, I hope, through this centralised agency which we are setting up and supporting on a co-operative basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that I was extremely disappointed recently to discover that, without any necessity whatever, two processing firms had put very substantial quantities of skim powder into intervention.  One of these was a <Col N="724" /> co-operative and the other was a private enterprise firm.  I emphasise that there was no necessity for putting these quantities of skim milk into intervention.  I also want to emphasise that it does us nothing but harm on the Continent and in the EEC generally to put surplus products of this kind into intervention. It is a wonderful thing for a Minister for Agriculture to go over to the Council of Ministers and say that whoever is building up the mountain of butter or milk powder in Europe it is not Ireland.  When we are fighting for better prices for these products next Spring, it will be invaluable for us to be able to make this claim.</P>
    <P>It is all the more disappointing to see these products going into intervention now when we know it is not necessary and can be avoided.  We know that there are outlets for these products.  When all the anticipation is that the price of skim milk powder will increase substantially in future, it is very regrettable that this action should be taken.  I would hope that people like Senator Butler and other Senators who are very closely connected with the industry would use their influence to dissuade these particular concerns from selling to intervention and would appeal to them to come into this centralised marketing agency and give Bord Bainne their very full support.</P>
    <P>It was obvious from the debate generally that there was a very full appreciation of the importance of the dairy industry in the economy as a whole.  Senator Butler in particular gave detailed figures for output and income and for participation in the industry.  One point which he did not refer to was the value of calves produced because of the dairy industry. When we add the value of the milk output to the value of the calves it comes to about £160 million.  This sum is equal to one-third of the total farm output.  We are speaking, then, of a very substantial industry, of a growth area which will get very much bigger in future.  Milk output is increasing at the rate of 70 million or 80 million gallons per annum.  Some of the <Col N="725" /> speakers emphasised that this growth would need an immense amount of investment.  The estimated investment which would be required for the expansion expected between now and 1980 is no less than £300 million.  This is an enormous sum of money, but it is necessary if the producers in this country are to equip themselves properly to be competitive in the European scene. I look forward to a continued expansion of milk output.</P>
    <P>Senator Kilbride was wondering whether we should be inducing people to take advantage of the various European schemes and incentives which are presented in order to get people to change from milk production.  My advice is very strongly in favour of keeping people in milk production and expanding its growth further.  This is the surest way, particularly for small farmers, to pull themselves up by their own shoestrings.  There is nothing paying as well at the moment as milk production.  People who are reasonably well-equipped and who can reach a certain size in the industry are getting substantial incomes.  I have been extremely impressed recently on a tour of the South of Ireland to see the strides being made in modernising milk production. I hope that those efforts will continue.</P>
    <P>Somebody spoke about a 40-hour week.  Senator Kilbride said there was no 40-hour week in Longford.  I hope there will be a 40-hour week in Longford. If we are to keep our young people in farming we must take the drudgery out of the job.  There are all the signs that that is the line being pursued by the more progressive milk producers in the country at present. They are making their farming an attractive business.  Arrangements are being made in areas where the job is being well done and where the workload is being properly organised for weekend and holiday relief.  It is a development I should like to see expanding.</P>
    <P>The question of skim milk and butter production was raised.  Senator O'Callaghan said that these were the obvious and best-paying products. There was a temptation, however, to stay in these products.  I agree with <Col N="726" /> him, but I hope it is a temptation which will be resisted.  The fact that cheese as a product is not paying well at the moment is no reason for people either to change from cheese production or to reduce it.  It is agreed by all that cheese was one of the advantage products prior to our entry into EEC.  The present position has arisen by overstocking of the British market by cheeses from third countries prior to entry.  The effect from that still exists, but I hope it will rapidly disappear.  I hope cheese will again be a very high-priced product.</P>
    <P>There is an immense amount of work to be done in new product research and in broadening the product range generally.  We must as far as possible keep away from surplus products because of the danger that the common agricultural policy might be in danger if we were producing surpluses and disregarding the fact of these surpluses.  We must get milk by every and any means into the highest-priced products, whatever they are.</P>
    <P>There must be considerable research into the market for milk products and the range of products possible to new product production and marketing. We must hope for and expect a much greater investment not just by the State or by the market place but by those in the industry.  Farmers must realise that if they want security in the future for their products they must put a substantial amount of money into research in new products and into marketing.  I hope they will be convinced of this and will be induced to act accordingly.  Reference was made to the fact that a lot of the money put into cheese and the industry generally was borrowed capital.  I hope we are quickly getting out of that situation where we must depend on borrowed capital.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that there is no increase in home sales.  We should not be overconcerned about this, particularly in relation to butter sales, because we are leading Europe in the consumption of butter.  We could be consuming more cheese; that is the only disappointment. One of the highest-priced products in France, for instance, <Col N="727" /> is cheese.  A considerable amount of milk goes into this high-priced cheese in France.  It is a fairly perishable cheese, and if we were to produce the same cheese we would have certain difficulties about getting it on to the market fast enough, but that is part of the research we feel is necessary.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the success of our export sales and to the important part that Bord Bainne played in all this success.  This comes back to the point that we must rely more and more on Bord Bainne and on their experience in selling milk and milk products throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan asked why have guarantees to cease in 1977?  I do not think they have to cease in 1977, but the need for continuing these guarantees will be non-existent after 1977.  It is a question of building up confidence in the co-operative being set up.  Bord Bainne as we knew them in the past, where the Government were guaranteeing only £5 million, were able to borrow quite substantial sums and carry on their business.  There should not be any need after 1977 for this guarantee; but, if there is, no Irish Government will fail to provide support.</P>
    <P>Everything possible is being done to get more co-operation and more of the industry into the co-operative movement.  This is something upon which I have concentrated a good deal of effort since coming into office.  I expect that before long the entire industry will be in the hands of cooperatives. Farmers, in other words, will be doing their own business; and the sooner we arrive at that position the better for all concerned.  The Government, as such, should not be in direct production.  We should get out of that position as soon as possible. The farmers are well able to look after themselves.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned with great regret the disappearance of the Shorthorn cow.  We should not have any such regrets.  People should keep the breeds they feel are best suited to the industry and should concentrate on these.  Income matters more than sentiment <Col N="728" /> in relation to any industry, and the agricultural industry is no exception.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan made reference to legislation in relation to the co-operative movement.  I should like to say in reply that the necessary legislation is under active consideration and will be put forward as soon as possible.  There will be no delay in this matter as the Government fully appreciate the need for this legislation.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>

It provides for the confirmation of a new agreement with respect to veterinary surgeons concluded with the United Kingdom Government on 1st December, 1972.  This new veterinary surgeons' agreement, which is set out in the Schedule to the present order, is a consolidating measure.

Register of Veterinary Surgeons and to become members of the Royal College <Col N="729" /> of Veterinary Surgeons; (ii) Irish representation on the Council of the Royal College; (iii) facilities for that council to visit and report upon the courses, <i>et cetera,</i> leading to our veterinary degrees; and (iv) arrangements for the investigation of allegations of professional misconduct by persons registered in both the Irish Veterinary Register and the UK Register.</P>
    <P>There were full consultations with the Veterinary Council, the statutory governing body of the veterinary profession, when the provisions of the new agreement were being drafted and the agreement was concluded with its concurrence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That a Select Committee be appointed to consider every Statutory Instrument laid or laid in draft before Seanad Éireann, in pursuance of a statutory requirement with a view to determining whether the special attention of Seanad Éireann should be drawn to it on any of the following grounds:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  that it imposes a charge on the public revenues or contains provisions requiring payments to be made to the Exchequer or any Government Department or to any local or public authority in consideration of any licence or consent, or of any services to be rendered or prescribes the amount of any such charge or payments;</P>
      <P>(ii)  that it appears to make some unusual or unexpected use of the powers conferred by the Statute under which it is made;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> (iii) that it purports to have retrospective effect where the parent Statute confers no express authority so to provide;</P>
    <P>(iv)  that there appears to have been unjustifiable delay either in the laying of it before Seanad Éireann or in its publication;</P>
    <P>(v) that for any special reason its form or purport calls for elucidation;</P>
    <P>(vi)  that its drafting appears to be defective; or</P>
    <P>on any other ground which does not impinge on its merits or on the policy behind it.</P>
    <P>(2)  That the Select Committee consist of nine members of whom three shall form a quorum.</P>
    <P>(3)  That the Select Committee have power to report from time to time and to require any Government Department or other instrument making authority concerned to submit a memorandum explaining any Statutory Instrument which may be under their consideration or to depute a representative to appear before them as a witness for the purpose of explaining any such Statutory Instrument.</P>
    <P>(4)  That it be the duty of the Committee before reporting that the special attention of Seanad Éireann should be drawn to any Statutory Instrument to afford to any Government Department or other instrument making authority concerned therewith an opportunity of furnishing orally or in writing such explanations as the Department or authority may think fit and the Select Committee have power to report to Seanad Éireann from time to time, any memoranda submitted or other evidence given to them in explanation of any Statutory Instrument.</P>
    <P>This is a Committee which is set up by the Seanad on each occasion when there is a new Seanad.  I have pleasure in moving this motion because it is very important that the Seanad continues to provide the technical scrutiny of statutory instruments made under an Act of Parliament and laid before the <Col N="731" /> Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am pleased to move this motion before the House rises in order that this important work can be carried out during the summer, so that the instruments can be processed in this way and so that the Committee can meet on the first occasion after the recess and have a number of statutory instruments to consider.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the wording of the motion because it is slightly modified from the wording which was contained in previous motions.  The committee is &ldquo;appointed to consider every statutory instrument laid or laid in draft before Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and then can draw the attention of the Seanad to the instruments on any of the following grounds, which are very precise:</P>
    <P>(i)  that it imposes a charge on the public revenues or contains provisions requiring payments to be made to the Exchequer or any Government Department or to any local or public authority in consideration of any licence or consent, or of any services to be rendered or prescribes the amount of any such charge or payments;</P>
    <P>(ii)  that it appears to make some unusual or unexpected use of the powers conferred by the Statute under which it is made;</P>
    <P>(iii)  that it purports to have retrospective effect where the parent Statute confers no express authority so to provide;</P>
    <P>(iv) that there appears to have been unjustifiable delay either in the laying of it before Seanad Éireann or in its publication;</P>
    <P>(v)  that for any special reason its form or purport calls for elucidation;.</P>
    <P>The sixth ground is a new ground although it is a matter with which the Seanad Committee on Statutory Instruments has been dealing.</P>
    <P>(vi)  that its drafting appears to be defective;...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> This is based on the experience of both the officials who have worked with the Committee and my own experience, as a member of the previous Committee.  A great deal of the work of the Committee involves examination of defective drafting.  This had to be fitted in under the other precise headings.  It is certainly within the terms of reference of this Committee that it looks at any aspect of statutory instruments other than the merits.  It seemed to be clearer to add a precise subheading to the effect that we would look at the drafting if it appeared to be defective.</P>
    <P>The next line is also a new reference. Again, to make the Committee's functioning more efficient it would look at &ldquo;any other ground which does not impinge on its merits or on the policy behind it&rdquo;.  This is a catch-all provision that the Committee either looks at the very precise grounds contained in subparagraphs (i) to (vi) or has this general provision on any other ground which does not impinge on its merits or on the policy behind the instrument. The question of the merits and the policy behind it are, of course, matters for the Houses of Parliament when the parent Act is being debated.  The other parts of the motion in relation to the membership and to the right to report are the standard procedures.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some comment on the role of the Committee on Statutory Instruments.  I think this Committee is highly necessary when so much power is given to Ministers to make orders and instruments under the parent Acts.  It is one of the quiet, solid Committees which does not get very much credit, which rarely has its report debated on the floor of the House but which does have an impact. On that point, I think it would be valuable to reconsider the nature of this Committee or, alternatively, to consider setting up a new Joint Committee to consider the merits as well of statutory instruments and to have power to make amendments.</P>
    <P>This would be an innovation and a departure from the present scope of the Seanad Committee on Statutory Instruments. But we have, in fact, just created a precedent in setting up the <Col N="733" /> Committee on European Secondary Legislation.  This Committee has a much broader role than we have allowed for examination of our secondary legislation.  It would be valuable to view the Committee on European Secondary Legislation in practice and to consider the possibility of constituting a Joint Committee of both Houses which could go into the merits and look in a fuller way at the statutory instruments.</P>
    <P>There is a very large number of statutory instruments each year. They have a very significant impact on every aspect of Irish life and there is an increasing tendency for the parent Act to be merely the framework and for very many of the important provisions to be contained in statutory instruments.  It is not sufficient to look only at the technical aspects although this is a very important function.  The Seanad Committee performs an important task here and it is the appropriate House of the Oireachtas to do this because we have more time to serve on this Committee and the House would have more time to consider the reports of the Committee.  I would hope that some of these reports will be discussed on the floor of the House during the coming session.</P>
    <P>The final point I should like to make in relation to this Committee &mdash;it is in the nature of an exhortation &mdash;is that the staffing position be improved. On the last Committee on Statutory Instruments the official who was working with the Committee was doing his personal best to fulfil the tasks of the Committee but he had very many other calls on his time. The Committee, therefore, did not sit with sufficient regularity or have sufficient back-up clerical service which it needs in order to perform a proper role.  In moving this motion I should like to ask that consideration be given to providing a full-time official to this Committee in order that they may perform their functions effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1973, is complementary to the Expediency Motion establishing the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities I propose, with your permission, a Chathaoirleach, and with the agreement of the House, that the composition, functions and powers of the Joint Committee be discussed in conjunction with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to apologise to the House for the fact that I was unable to be present here yesterday when the Expediency Motion establishing the Joint Committee was taken.  It was necessary to take the motion without debate early in the week to allow sufficient time for the relevant parliamentary arrangements to be completed before the Dáil and Seanad rose for the Summer recess.  The Government thought it desirable that the Committee be established before the Recess so <Col N="735" /> that it would have the opportunity to meet during that period to consider its requirements and working procedures. In discussing the Joint Committee and the Bill together I hope that the House will have the opportunity to make known its views on the Joint Committee which it was precluded from doing earlier in the week because of pressure on parliamentary time and my absence abroad on European Community business.</P>
    <P>The necessary parliamentary procedures for the establishment of the Joint Committee are being completed. The procedure involves both Houses passing motions establishing the Select Committees which together form the Joint Committee and the Committee of Selection of each House appointing Members to these Committees.  The way would then be open for the Joint Committee to meet.  I wish it every success.</P>
    <P>Before moving on to the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1973, I should like to deal in some detail with the composition, powers and functions of the Committee.</P>
    <P>During the debates on the European Communities (Confirmation of Regulations) Bill, 1973, and on the First Report on Developments in the European Communities Senators stressed the need to have greater participation and involvement by Members of the Oireachtas in relation both to the formulation of Government policy on matters arising before the Council of Ministers and to the way in which the secondary legislation of the Communities is implemented here.  Senators were also concerned that Community legislation should be subject to some form of permanent parliamentary scrutiny and views were expressed about the necessity of making available information on Community legislation and draft Community legislation to Members of both Houses who are delegates to the European Parliament. It was in response to these concerns that the Government decided on the composition, powers and functions of the Joint Committee as provided for in the Expediency Motion and the Amendment Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> The Committee will consist of the ten delegates to the European Parliament and 16 other persons&mdash;ten from the Dáil and six from the Seanad.  It was thought essential to include <i>ex officio</i> the delegates to the European Parliament because of the very special expertise which they can bring to bear on the tasks before the Committee and because of the opportunity which working on the Committee will offer them to brief themselves thoroughly on proposals for Community action, on the implications of these proposals for Ireland and on Government policy.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that it was originally intended that the Committee should consist of a total of 20 Members.  However, in response to the views expressed in this House the Government decided to increase the membership to 26.  There are three main reasons for having a large Committee: Firstly, because the delegates to the European Parliament may find it difficult to attend meetings of the Committee regularly, thus reducing the Committee's effective membership&mdash;Members of both Houses have expressed this opinion; secondly, because it is desirable that the Committee be sufficiently large to enable it to form sub-committees if it so wishes; and, thirdly, because the work of the Committee will be heavy. The powers which it has are extensive and the volume of legislation and draft legislation emanating from the European Communities and with which it will have to deal is very large.</P>
    <P>In regard to the party composition of the Committee the view of the Government was that it should reflect the composition of both Houses and that the representation of the parties and the independents on the Committee should be in the same ratio as their representation in the Oireachtas.  On this reckoning the Government would be entitled to one more Member than they in fact have. However, the Government was willing to bring up the Opposition strength on the Committee by one and correspondingly to reduce their own representation by one.  The Government also felt that the Independent <Col N="737" /> Members of the Oireachtas, who have a valuable contribution to make and who are often excluded from participating in work of this nature, should be represented.</P>
    <P>I should like now to turn to the powers and functions of the Committee. The Committee has authority to examine and report to the Houses of the Oireachtas at three different stages in the process of adoption of legislation by the Communities and of its implementation here.</P>
    <P>At the first stage the Committee can examine draft Acts of the Council&mdash; that is, regulations, directives, decisions, recommendations and opinions&mdash;and report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on what in its view the attitude to be adopted by Ireland in their regard should be.  These views would necessarily be taken into account by the Government in making up its own mind on what policy it should pursue. The Government however could not be bound to follow the Committee's views; it remains responsible for its own decisions.</P>
    <P>At the second stage the Committee can examine the acts of the Council and of the Commission with a view to considering how best the obligations involved for Ireland might be implemented here.  This will enable the expertise of the Oireachtas, through the Joint Committee, to be brought to bear on the measures which the Government might take in the implementation of Community legislation.</P>
    <P>At the third stage the Committee can examine and report on ministerial regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972, and on instruments made under other statutes in order to implement our Community obligations.</P>
    <P>This third power is an important one and is reinforced by the provisions of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1973.  The Bill provides that the Committee should have power to recommend to the Houses of the Oireachtas that any ministerial regulation made under the European Communities Act, 1972, be annulled and, if a resolution annulling a regulation is passed by both Houses, <Col N="738" /> the regulation ceases to have statutory effect.  This annulment procedure replaces the confirmatory provisions contained in section 4 of the European Communities Act, 1972.  It is the Government's view that the annulment procedure is a more important method of effective and democratic parliamentary control and more in keeping with the authority of the Oireachtas than the confirmatory procedure contained in the original Act.  It will allow the House, through its Committee, an opportunity for the kind of detailed examination of ministerial regulations which was difficult under the Confirmatory Bill and it gives the power to the Oireachtas to annul those ministerial regulations which it finds unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in the Amendment Bill for recall of the Dáil and/or Seanad during Adjournment on request of at least one third of their Members in each case.  A similar recall provision was contained in the European Communities Act, 1972, in relation to the Dáil but it was necessary to extend the provision to the Seanad in this case because of the requirement that both Houses must pass a resolution annulling a regulation.  Such a recall would not, of course, apply in relation to regulations in respect of which a resolution for annulment had been tabled and defeated in either House.</P>
    <P>Finally it is provided that the new section should not apply either to regulations already confirmed in the European Communities (Confirmation of Regulations) Act, 1973, or to regulations which have already lapsed before the Bill passes.  It will, nevertheless, be open to the Committee, should they so wish, to examine and report on those regulations which have already been confirmed.  Such a report, however, may not take the form of the annulment procedure.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps add here that I realise that the Confirmatory Bill provided a guide and easy reference to the regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972.  Because this will no longer be available I will ensure that a list of the regulations will be provided in the Reports on <Col N="739" /> Developments in the European Communities which the Government is required to present to the Houses of the Oireachtas twice yearly in accordance with section 5 of the European Communities Act, 1972, which is, of course, not affected by the amending legislation.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee is an important new departure for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It will allow the Houses to involve themselves in the formulation of Community policy and in its implementation here.  The secretariat of the Committee will have the fullest co-operation of Government Departments in ensuring that the Committee is fully informed of all relevant developments.  Ministers will also be willing to appear before the Committee at mutually convenient times to discuss matters arising directly from secondary legislation.</P>
    <P>In offering for the consideration of the House this Amendment Bill and in establishing the Joint Committee I am concerned to see in what we do here that our commitment to parliamentary democracy is a genuine and compelling one, both at the national and community level.  It must not be overlooked, in my opinion, that progress in the direction of increasing the powers and influence of the European Parliament should be associated with progress in the direction of increasing the powers and influence of the national parliaments in Community affairs.  It is the Government's view that a substantial modification of the present institutional arrangements of the Communities, involving the introduction of effective democratic control by a directly-elected European Parliament, is an essential prerequisite for the establishment of a full economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that the House, in what Senators have to say on this subject, will add a strengthening note to what our delegates to the European Parliament may say in that forum and to what Ministers, including myself, will also have to say in the future in regard to the further democratisation of the European institutions.</P>

      <P>The Minister <Col N="740" /> has referred to the Expediency Motion which was passed in relation to the Joint Committee.  I understand that to set the thing properly in motion it is also necessary for each House to pass a substantive motion in addition to the Expediency Motion which expressed our view that this should be done.  It is now necessary for us to do it.  I think I am correct in saying that the Dáil did that today and I would suggest that at the conclusion of the discussion on this measure possibly the Seanad might do it also so as to implement the desire to have the Committee in operation during the recess to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  I will be very brief because this Bill and the motion, which we passed yesterday on the basis of this Bill being debated in full here, is in accordance with the views expressed by myself and other Senators on the previous debate on the EEC.  It is fundamental that we should have a Committee of this kind to supervise the operation of directives and regulations under the Treaty of Rome as administered by the EEC through the Council of Ministers and the Commission.</P>
      <P>This, of course, is not the whole answer.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs made the point earlier in the Dáil that this merely concerns our own supervision of such regulations and directives and that the more important matter is the overall parliamentary supervision which we hope will develop within the Community as far as the European Parliament itself is concerned.</P>
      <P>That must be the prime target in so far as democratisation is concerned. However, in so far as it is possible for us here to supervise such regulations and directives, a Committee of the kind suggested is the answer.</P>
      <P>I shall not quarrel with the numbers. There has been discussion between the Minister and the various other groups about the numbers.  We are all agreed on what the numbers should be.  Basically this is a non-contentious field in which all Members on the Committee, irrespective of whichever group they may represent, will be concerned about Ireland's interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> Despite all the talk about European co-operation, national interests still have a part to play and will continue to have a part to play.  It is in this area that all parties and groups can come together in ensuring that whatever directives or regulations are adopted they are in conformity with the Treaty of Rome, with Community decisions and are, as far as possible, in Ireland's interests.  I welcome the annulment procedure.  This is an improvement on what was originally suggested.  It is an excellent advance in the direction of democracy.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise one point before I conclude.  It is harping back to a point I mentioned before.  It is a point basic to administration.  This Committee must be staffed properly. It must have a secretariat.  It must have a back-up administration.  It cannot just be a mere cypher, a Committee in name only.  One of the great weaknesses heretofore in our system of parliamentary supervision, not just in this area but in other areas, has been that we have committees which are not really committees.  Today, more than ever before, in the businesslike environment in which people have to move, it is all important to have any committee of this or any other kind, particularly in the parliamentary environment, staffed with a proper secretariat.  This is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to argue out with the Minister for Finance within the Government.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in the course of the debate on the Devlin Report that there is no point in talking about administrative reforms, however desirable they may be, unless there is this basic parliamentary reform system running parallel with administrative reforms.  Parliamentary reform means nothing if it merely means setting up a committee, providing a secretary for that committee and allowing it to meet in a casual, haphazard manner.  There is a lot to it than that.  There is also the whole research back-up for it, furnishing it with information and all the research material that should be available to the parliamentarians concerned.  Parliamentarians, by reason of the very <Col N="742" /> nature of the work in which they have to engage, be they Deputies or Senators, do not have the time for the sort of research involved.</P>
    <P>This applies across the board to all committees within Parliament.  It will apply more particularly to this one. If we do not have complete back-up information, supported by an official of the Minister and a Secretariat, then the whole thing will be just meaningless.  That is the one aspect I should like to press on the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I am certain he is fully aware of it himself, will make that point of view known and make sure that is pressed home to the fullest advantage.</P>
    <P>My experience is that often within the administration this type of control is not welcome.  It is very important that this type of supervision be made welcome and that the Committee be properly staffed and properly equipped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I also should like to welcome this Bill which is in every respect a very considerable improvement on the previous arrangements for dealing with these matters.  I hope that the arrangements now being enacted will work well and I think there is every prospect that they will.  The main single difficulty I find in the Bill and the terms of reference of the Committee is one that I raised before and I do not think I impressed the Minister very much with the view I held.  I imagine he probably still holds to his opinion.  I feel that the method of annulment, while in basic terms is very satisfactory, is a cumbrous way of dealing with legislation of this kind. There is no provision for amendment, and it is very unlikely indeed that any sizeable section of the Committee would wish to annul any of these regulations or other measures.  I can imagine a very large number of cases in which there might be considerable support for the idea that one or more paragraphs or sections could usefully be amended.  There is no provision at all for doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems an extremely cumbrous situation that a Committee might, for example, have to report that one particular <Col N="743" /> section, perhaps dealing with a criminal penalty or something of that kind, ought to be amended and that therefore they proposed that the thing should be annulled and a whole new order brought in and worded in a different way.  I am not at all clear why the Minister has apparently felt it undesirable to introduce a principle that these orders could be brought to the Committee once they were drafted but before they were actually issued and that the Committee could then recommend amendments which the Minister could accept or not as he wished and finally issue the order.</P>
    <P>As regards the Committee itself, it clearly has a vitally important task. We have not had a Committee of this kind before in this country.  It is set up to deal with a unique situation arising out of our membership of the European Economic Communities.  It is a Committee of great importance which will find it very difficult indeed to do everything that lies before it.  The sovereignty of the Oireachtas is clearly and inevitably being constantly undermined by the constant output of legislation from the EEC.  The Committee will have the task of safeguarding as far as possible our democratic rights until such time as the European Parliament itself has full powers.  It will be necessary to deal with the situation once we have such matters as economic and monetary unity.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is fully aware, the staffing of this Committee is all-important. It is not simply a matter of having a sufficient number of staff, but the quality must clearly be of the very highest.  There must be no question of anyone being able to service this Committee. The work will be very difficult and complex.  The first couple of months of the Committee's existence will be all-important for the whole future development of its work.  On the quality and extent of the staff will depend the entire smooth working of this Committee.</P>
    <P>It will be a very difficult venture. Other countries have tried and they failed to come anywhere near keeping up with the huge mass of legislation stemming from the Commission and <Col N="744" /> the Council.  I do not know whether we will succeed, but at any rate we must come as near to full success as we can.  We are not going to get anywhere near that, or even get started, unless we have a really good and highly-skilled staff which are also adequate in numbers.  The Minister, I am sure, will be more than anxious to help us in this respect.</P>
    <P>I hope it will be made quite clear that any staff that are needed to help out in the Library must be provided, because obviously it is not sufficient for the Library to acquire the vast amount of documentation which comes from the EEC.  It must be properly indexed and there should be staff there who know exactly what they have and what it contains.  Very much wider facilities than exist at present will be needed.</P>
    <P>There are one or two details of the draft resolution which we passed a couple of days ago about the Committee to which I should like to refer. In particular, there is one omission&mdash; at least I think it is an omission&mdash;which I did not raise at the time the resolution was going through because, clearly, the time element was very important and we just passed it without discussion.  However, I think it is a flaw which ought to be remedied at an early time if possible.  This relates to the tasks of the Committee to examine drafts prepared by the Commission, and so on.  Regulations, directives, decisions, recommendations, and opinions of the Council are to be examined.  One would think there were enough provisions to cover any contingency, but there is not, because I have this very large and important document here.  They are proposals from the Commission of the European Communities to the Council regarding a Council resolution on a Community environmental action programme.  That is a resolution, not a decision, directive, regulation, recommendation or even an opinion.  It seems to me that on a strict interpretation of the wording of this resolution the Committee would not be empowered to deal with this report.</P>

It is a decision and comes under the Committee, at the very end, in the last few pages.  But the rest of the document, alas, is a resolution. I take it, therefore, that the Committee would be unable to discuss this very important document.  I gather, in fact, that the Council, in a sudden and amazing excess of speed, have already adopted this.  Perhaps because it is so vague, nobody's corns were stood on. Nonetheless, it does seem to be an omission, though a very understandable omission, because when I first saw the resolution I could not have imagined that anything else was needed which was not covered by its provisions.</P>
      <P>I wish to make another point but I will not go into it in any great detail because we have had two pretty exhaustive debates on this whole topic in the last month or so.  The Minister mentioned in his speech today that he proposed to provide a list twice each year of the regulations which will be formally contained in the Bills.  A list of regulations will be added into the report, which comes out twice yearly.  I would suggest that along with these he might add any sections of statutes, such as, for example, Part 2 of the Finance Bill relating to stamp duties and so on, which had been put into statutes by our Government on foot of directives of the Council.  It would be useful to have those added in also.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, I have nothing more to say except to thank the Minister again for his very flexible approach to these matters.  What we have ended up with as a result of our various discussions is certainly a great improvement on the material we had at the beginning.</P>

      <P>I, too, should like to give a very warm welcome to this Bill amending the European Communities Act.  I do so because it might have been a temptation to leave matters as they were and not to come back to both Houses of Parliament <Col N="746" /> with an amendment.  When I mentioned this to friends of mine in England recently, they viewed it as an utterly astonishing procedure.  They felt that their European Communities Act would never, never be amended. It is a very flexible and welcome approach, particularly because the underlying basis of the amendment is to give a more significant role to the Oireachtas.  It is now up to the Oireachtas to avail of this increased role in relation to the whole process of European integration.</P>
      <P>Before coming on to the narrower subject, both of the amending Bill and also of the Committee on European Secondary Legislation, I should like to say&mdash;and I know this view is shared by the Minister&mdash;that this is only a very small part of what must be an increasing attempt to make the European structure more democratic.  I am at the moment involved in a working party set up by the European Parliament on this subject of the role which national parliaments play in the process of making Europe more democratic, responsible and responsive to the citizens.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that people are increasingly aware that the national parliaments have a very significant role to play.  Their involvement is absolutely necessary because Europe is not away from us.  We are very much part of Europe.  Yet the more that this is realised, the more it is also evident that this is only a very small part of an increasingly urgent problem&mdash;the problem of ensuring that the development of the European Community is along democratic lines, responsive to people living in the area.  This matter is no longer a talking problem, no longer an academic problem.  It is the most urgent problem facing the citizens of this country and the other eight countries of the European Community; and it is a very depressing outlook for anybody who is concerned about participation and democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outlook is bleak unless there is a very real change of attitude, particularly in the Council of Ministers.  This can only come if there is sufficient pressure from the national parliaments, the peoples of the countries, pushing <Col N="747" /> the Governments to go forward more positively in creating an institutional structure for Europe.  This problem is not far away from us.  We are in danger of creating for our children a system which is centralised and unresponsive, where they will have decisions taken affecting every aspect of their lives and no way of having their real interests accounted for in a sufficiently democratic way to involve them in the process.  I very much welcome this Irish contribution towards making Europe more democratic.  It is a real challenge for the Oireachtas, and it is one we will take up.</P>
    <P>I support the important point made by Senator Yeats that, although it is an improvement to have an annulment procedure under this amending Act, there is no reason why this should not have been a procedure to provide for recommendations of amendments. Here there is a distinction which can be made between the Seanad Committee on Statutory Instruments and the European Committee.  That Committee deals only with technical aspects and has only power to recommend for one of the procedural reasons that the instrument be drawn to the attention of the Seanad, and the Seanad can either pass or annul it.</P>
    <P>In that sense this European Committee will be looking into the merits as well as the form of the secondary legislation.  It would be much more flexible if the Committee could recommend that an amendment be made.  As Senator Yeats stated, it might be quite a small part of the particular regulation which is regarded as in some way not acceptable and it would be cumbersome and time-consuming for the recommendation to be to annul that instrument and for a new regulation to be brought in in due course.  It would be much more flexible if we had, as well as the power to annul, also the power to recommend amendments. This may have to be postponed until it is seen how the Committee work in operation and could be the subject of a further amendment in due course of the provisions in the amending Bill.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Senator Yeats regarding the wording of the terms of <Col N="748" /> reference of this Committee, which is too restrictive.  The terms of reference do not extend to the general programmes of the Community.  The point he made that very important documents such as the proposals for regional policy, social and environmental policy, which would be outside the strict terms of reference of this Committee, could be met by the simple insertion in subparagraph (1) of paragraph (1) where it reads:</P>
    <P>Such drafts prepared by the Commission of the European Communities and submitted to the Council of those Communities of regulations, directives, decisions, recommendations, opinions and general programmes.</P>
    <P>This would cover programmes such as the environmental policy programme. It would mean that the Committee would not be artificially unable to consider what are the very important social policies.  It would also mean that this Committee would not become dated, because it is undoubtedly the increasing tendency in the whole European legislative process to have a more programmed approach.  We will see more programmed documents over a span of two to four years coming from the European Communities. Merely to consider the concrete draft resolutions arising out of these would be a very narrow and artificial approach, and we would be constantly confusing the two different points in the Committee.  For the Committee to perform their task it will be essential to be able to refer to and consider the general programmes which contain in them the potential draft resolutions, decisions, recommendations, <i>et cetera,</i> which the Council will eventually issue.  Therefore, I support the suggestion that we amend this motion and include general programmes in the consideration of the Committee.</P>
    <P>In his Second Reading speech, the Minister referred to this function of the Committee to consider in the first stage draft acts of the Council&mdash;regulations, directives, decisions, recommendations and appeals&mdash;and report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on what the attitude to be adopted by <Col N="749" /> Ireland in their regard should be.  One of the most important draft documents are these general programmes.  It is here we need at the earliest opportunity the expertise of Deputies and Senators who are given better information, who have more time in which to draw the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas and of the country in general to what attitude should be adopted by Ireland in their regard. This would not be trying to usurp the function of the Houses of the Oireachtas. It would be to improve the function of the Houses which would then be better informed and their attention would be drawn at an earlier stage to these general programmes.</P>
    <P>Apart from the actual functioning of this Committee on European Affairs, which is a very welcome and striking innovation in our parliamentary system, too little attention is being paid to trying to involve the Oireachtas as a whole in the European process.  Some practical suggestions have been made in this area which have not as yet met with response.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he has specifically considered them.  There are suggestions such as, for example, having a particular day during the week in which the questions asked of the various Ministers would relate to European affairs. The advantage of this would be the possibility of a much more coherent approach to what Ireland's various Ministers were doing in Council of Ministers in Europe.  It would give an opportunity to have much more direct accountability to the Oireachtas about what has been decided in the Council of Ministers by following up with supplementary questions.  It would also allow for cross-reference, and it would allow people who were referring to the record to look at the answer to questions from particular Ministers and to have together the answers on European questions.  This would be valuable and prevent these questions being lost in the general internal domestic matters where it is rather difficult to find the particular answer and where there is not evident an overall approach by the Government in relation to these questions.</P>
    <P>Another practical suggestion for <Col N="750" /> involving all Deputies and Senators would be to supply a list of the draft regulations, decisions, <i>et cetera</i> coming from the Communities.  This would involve some paper-work.  I already referred to it at an earlier stage as being the standard practice now in the House of Lords and the House of Commons.  It enables Deputies and Senators who have a particular interest, be it in agriculture, in transport, or in companies, to note in the list sent out to them each week that there is a Community draft regulation on this and to fill in the form stating they would like to see the text of that.  They might then draw it either to the attention of he European Committee or they might act on it in some other way.  This is necessary in order to prevent the danger of a élitist committee who do everything that relates to Europe and does not involve the general Members of the Oireachtas.  It is necessary not to make this Committee a substitute for real involvement in the European process. The one way of doing this would be to encourage Deputies and Senators to act on their initiative by calling for specific regulations which interest them.  I appreciate this would involve a certain amount of paper-work but it would involve Deputies and Senators much more concretely in the whole process, which is part of making the national Parliament increasingly relevant.</P>
    <P>A third practical point on the involvement of the general Deputies and Senators is the question of whether this Committee will be open to any Senators or Deputies who are interested.  In other words will they have access to it, whether this will involve access to listening to the discussions, or whether it will go further and allow any Deputy or Senator who is particularly interested in a point to intervene?  This may be something the Committee itself must decide, but I think the more open the Committee is the more valuable the role it can play in scrutinising European draft proposals.</P>
    <P>On a more practical level I agree with both Senators Lenihan and Yeats that the staffing of this Committee is going to determine how effective it will be.  I should like to <Col N="751" /> see more precise terms used even on the floor of the House as to what staffing there will be.  It seems there should be a commitment to a specific staff of at least three full-time officials.  It should be clear that these officials will be responsible to the chairman of the Committee and that they could not be drawn on for other functions in the House, but that they will be available to this Committee full-time and that they will have all the necessary back-up service that the Senators and Deputies on the Committee require.</P>
    <P>My final point on this general question is in relation to the Library of the Oireachtas.  I do not think we are making sufficient use of the Library and that it has sufficiently been directed towards the literature coming in from the European Communities. I had intended to check whether the Library has become a European documentation centre or whether it has applied to become a European documentation centre.  If not, this will be a very essential part of building up an expert source of European materials from the very beginning of the Communities, so that both the Members of this Committee, who I am sure will make a very substantial call on the Library facilities, and also Senators and Deputies in general could know what the progress has been in a particular area, right through from the beginning of the Communities and could avail of the documentation which is there.</P>
    <P>The European materials should in so far as possible be kept together and accessible to Senators and Deputies to encourage them to become accustomed to seeking out, finding and using these materials more easily.  This would help to provide the information and the familiarity with the particular proposals, and with the particular form which the legislative process takes at the European level, to allow the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas to play a significant role in scrutinising what is happening.</P>
    <P>I conclude with a warm welcome again for this Bill.  It is an indication <Col N="752" /> of a very real attempt to involve the Oireachtas here in the European process. It is a Bill that was by no means one that we could take for granted and, therefore, it is a positive contribution to this process of integration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome the provisions of the Bill. It is further evidence of the capacity of our Minister for Foreign Affairs to find new solutions for new problems. It is evidence not only of his own ability to go to Europe and use the European Economic Community for the good of all the people of Ireland but also of his ability to take the interests of the Irish Parliament and Irish people with him.  There is also evidence here that Deputy FitzGerald is prepared to take advice from his colleagues in Parliament.</P>
      <P>The most ardent supporters of the European movement in this country &mdash;those of us who fought very hard to convince our people that it would be right for Ireland to join the European Community&mdash;had a niggling fear that this Community could become something far removed from the democratic institutions we were so accustomed to in our country.  As time went on, those fears were not allayed in any way.  The majority of us here still get the impression that the average people of Ireland, and the average parliamentarian, are not as familiar with European affairs as they ought to be.  It is difficult for all of us to keep abreast of European affairs at all times but the setting up of this Committee will make a worthy contribution towards ensuring that both Houses of the Oireachtas are kept in touch with what is taking place in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Members mentioned, and it is very true, that it will be nice to have Independents and people from both sides of the House participating in the work of this Committee.  Some Members mentioned that national affairs were most important, and the well-being of individual nations in Europe is very important.  Therefore, I expect this Committee to keep an eye on how matters taking place in Europe are likely to affect our own <Col N="753" /> country.  Furthermore, this Committee will have an obligation to remember that we are part of the European Community and that we cannot think only of what effects matters will have on Ireland alone.  The average Irish citizen looks first to Ireland and our own Parliament, but beyond our own country he sees the European Economic Community which imposes some restrictions on us and from which we can derive certain benefits if we play the game as we ought to. The average Irishman does not see Europe as a new community, as something which is evolving and developing and to which we belong. This Committee can help the Irish Parliament to enter into the spirit of the new Europe we all hope is starting to develop.  This Parliament should then be able to encourage the Irish people to enter wholeheartedly into the spirit of that Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this measure very warmly.  I should also like to endorse what Senator McCartin has said about it. I speak as somebody who did not approve in the first place of going into the EEC.  I thought it was a disastrous course, and I am not convinced yet that it was not a disastrous course.  I was worried particularly about such matters as sovereignty and about the threat to democracy that was involved in it, and also about the immense power which certain structures of capitalism within Europe might ultimately gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the first day of the meeting of the Seanad I was really shocked and consternated by being presented with about 16 measures to vote on and which were ill-documented.  Indeed, there was a very brilliant critique mounted on these set of measures by Senator Robinson and Senator Noel Browne.  I listened to the debate and eventually voted on them.  There was no option.  It seemed to me on that day that the deathknell of democracy and sovereignty in Ireland had been sounded.  I was not sufficiently sophisticated or <i>au fait</i> with the procedures of Parliament myself to say much about it then, but this measure which we are discussing today, and which I have <Col N="754" /> welcomed, goes some distance towards allaying the fears of those of us who feel most pessimistic about the whole question of our sovereignty, the importance and the relevance of our Parliament.  These phrases have come up in the speeches of the previous speakers.</P>
    <P>This Committee, if it can be seen as a first step rather than as some kind of terminal measure, could give us a considerable amount of hope.  It has to be agreed that there has been an unusually prompt response to the feelings of the Seanad, if not of the Dáil, to bring this Committee forward, to constitute it so democratically, and I should certainly like to align myself with Senator Lenihan and with nearly everybody else who has spoken.  This Committee has to be given a good deal of scope and a good deal of teeth.  Senator Robinson's suggestion that its scope should be widened with regard to programmes and policies is a very serious and important suggestion and I should like to give my total support to that.</P>
    <P>It seems, too, that the annulment procedure is far better than the confirmatory procedure and it seems that a Committee such as this could do something to bring the enormously costly and ponderous machinery of the two Houses of the Irish Parliament to bear on that apparently very remote entity, the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Another encouraging thing has been the insistence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and a very strenuous insistence lately, on the importance of direct election to the European Parliament and his reservations about the powers of the Council of Ministers which he has very strenuously prosecuted in Brussels and elsewhere.  This is why I think that what Senator McCartin said is very important, if we can see the Community as being a fluid situation one which we can, if we flex our muscles sufficiently, continue to influence and perhaps even to change, even a pessimist like myself might have some hope for the future of our own particular national integrity within this enormous new complex.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I should like to say that this Committee seems to be a good <Col N="755" /> idea but that their force should be endlessly and increasingly augmented by new measures of this kind.  The importance of our own democracy should be brought constantly to bear on the whole European situation so that it may ultimately become a community. I do not think that it is a community now, or anything like a community.  It is going wrong in many directions.  Its emphases are extremely materialistic, I think.  It is encouraging to see the impact that already our Minister for Foreign Affairs has made on it and consequently I should like to welcome this and hope that it will be the beginning of a whole series of dynamic measures to make the EEC into a really human community, one in which the identity of our own country, which has been so hard won, will not be totally submerged.  Finally, I should like to welcome the Bill and hope that it will be the beginning of a long road in the same direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at the outset&mdash;I say it with some diffidence from this particular position&mdash; I seem to be the only one speaking, though I am from this spot in the House, who has reservations with regard to a particular procedure suggested in this Bill.  I join with the Senators who have commended and applauded the Minister for his general approach to the establishment of the Committee and for the speed with which he has come back to us here. I think all of us will share his concern, and I know it is a genuine concern, that Parliament should be actively involved in the matters which come before us in relation to our membership of the European Community. The Minister's suggestion that the Committee should be a committee of 26 which would include the Irish Members of the European Parliament is an excellent one.  The composition of the Committee as suggested by the Minister is certainly satisfactory and would have the approval of all Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I think the objects for which the Committee have been established <Col N="756" /> are all objects which are vitally necessary if the Irish Parliament is to be actively involved in these matters. There is validity in the point which was raised in the first instance by Senator Yeats and then by Senator Robinson with regard to the scope of the Committee in relation to expressing an opinion and examining general programmes.  I approve of all of these things.  The Minister has done an extremely good day's work in coming in with the Bill and I was glad to get the information from Senator Lenihan that he feels he should co-operate in getting this Committee established and under way.  I agree with the views which he and other Senators have expressed in relation to the staffing of the Committee.</P>
    <P>Now I can come to the point of disagreement. It is not so much disagreement as reservation, because it is merely a question of a point of view.  It is this: which is the better procedure to involve Parliament fully in these activities, whether it should be the annulment procedure which is now proposed to us in this Bill or the confirmatory procedure which was initially included in our legislation?  Purely from the point of view of the parliamentarian, speaking as a Member of Parliament, trying to look at it objectively, it would seem to me that the confimatory procedure is the better procedure for involving the ordinary Member of Parliament.</P>
    <P>That procedure requires regulations which were made to come before Parliament and every Member of Parliament, whether he was a Member of this Committee or not, would be thereby given an opportunity to express his views with regard to it.  I have not got section 4 of the Act before me at the moment and I do not recall precisely what was in it but at least that requirement was there and it was a requirement which would enable all Members of the Parliament, Government, Opposition or Independent, to express their views if they wanted to with regard to these matters.  That is being altered on the basis that the annulment procedure is a more effective method of involving parliament.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his opening <Col N="757" /> remarks that it is the Government's view the annulment procedure is a more important method of effective democratic parliamentary control and more in keeping with the authority of the Oireachtas than the confirmatory procedure contained in the original Act.  That is certainly a valid point of view and I appear to be in the minority, because the Minister for Foreign Affairs has clearly the support not merely of the Government but also of Senator Lenihan and others on the far side for that point of view.  Maybe it is the correct point of view.  This is something that will prove itself or the reverse when in practice.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me on the face of it that the confirmatory procedure is one which would give a greater opportunity for involvement to individual Members.  Certainly if I were speaking on the opposite benches I would feel that from the point of view of an Opposition Senator or Deputy the confirmatiory procedure would be more attractive.  From a Government point of view it would seem to me that the annulment procedure is the attractive one.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify this point for me&mdash;as I said, I have not got section 4 of the original Act before me&mdash;am I correct in assuming that the position now is to be that these orders can only be annulled provided the initiative is taken by the Committee? If that is so it seems to me to be a pity because it seems to me that this procedure is then depriving five-tenths of the Members of this House and a greater proportion of the other House of the Oireachtas of the opportunity of taking annulment action, no matter how strongly they may feel on it.  If the position is that the initiative for annulment must come through the channel of the Committee, then Members of the Oireachtas who are not members of this Committee would not have the same powers and authority to move in the matter as members of the Committee.</P>
    <P>I know there is an answer to that and it may be an adequate answer. It probably is an adequate answer so far as the political parties are concerned in that the composition of this <Col N="758" /> Committee is to be based on the representation of parties and groups. Obviously if my party or Senator Lenihan's party feel so strongly with regard to a particular order that annulment efforts should be made in regard to it, they will have their representatives on the Committee who would be able to fight that case and advance it as far as they can.  But there are in this House in particular Members who are not aligned to any of the political parties and unless they should be members of this Committee, if my interpretation of the position is correct&mdash;the Minister will keep me right on it&mdash;they are to be deprived of the opportunity of operating this particular procedure.</P>
    <P>I appear to be a complete minority with regard to my views on this and it may be that my views on it will be proved to be wrong.  It may be that in practice the efficiency of this Committee will be assisted by having their procedure one of annulment rather than one of confirmation and that the efficiency of the Committee will be furthered in that way.  It seems to me that it is only by experience that we will know.  Purely as a parliamentarian, I have preference for the other procedure.  As a parliamentarian who is also a democrat, needless to say I submit to the views of the majority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill, which is very much in accordance with the recommendations and views which were expressed in this House when we discussed the EEC some time ago.  I should like in particular to welcome the fact that the Committee have been increased to 26.  This was very necessary.  By being increased to 26 the Committee will not merely be 30 per cent better but will be 100 per cent better because the original number would not allow for the amount of work that has to be done and the fact that we will always be short of a certain number on the Committee at any given time.  I am very glad that the Minister decided to accept the recommendations which were made to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by <Col N="759" /> Senator O'Higgins as to whether regulations should be subject to confirmation or to annulment, I think there are arguments on both sides but on balance I am inclined to agree with the provision in the Bill because the annulment procedure for one thing is capable of being used very much quicker.  If we had the position as in the original Act it would only be possible to refuse to confirm a regulation once every six months whereas if the Committee as now established comes across a regulation which they disapprove of, they can initiate annulment proceedings straight away.  From that point of view it provides for more speedy action in regard to a regulation which the Committee find unacceptable for one reason or another.  For that reason, on balance&mdash; there are arguments for both sides&mdash;the annulment procedure is the more desirable.</P>
    <P>There is also the question raised by a few Senators in relation to whether the Committee should be able to amend regulations.  There is a lot to be said for giving some kind of power to amend regulations.  This is something which in due course the Committee will find the lack of and in due course they will probably make recommendations that this should be changed.  But in this regard it is almost inevitable that in the course of time the Committee will, as they evolve and do their work, find that they need new powers or different kinds of powers and it is almost inevitable that within a matter of 12 months or so the Committee will be putting forward proposals to amend the Act to give it new powers and this is something which will in due course be done.</P>
    <P>This is a new kind of Committee dealing with a new situation and it is almost inevitable that as time goes on and as the Committee evolves they will find it necessary to ask for new powers and different kinds of powers and that the original Act will have to be amended again.  It is a very good indication of the flexibility of the Minister and the flexibility of the Government that they have already amended the Act once and I have no doubt that if the necessity arises they will amend it again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> The only other thing I should like to say is to express the hope that there has not been some disenchantment with this Bill, with this Committee, on the part of the Government in the course of the last week because I noticed that when the Minister was speaking in the Dáil last week he said that Ministers would be happy to appear before this Committee at any time but when he was introducing the Bill here this evening he said that Ministers would merely be willing to appear before the Committee.  I hope there is no significance in the fact that the attitude of the Minister has changed in that respect in the course of the last month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a shorter time on the political scene than Senator M.J. O'Higgins.  However, even in that short time I have had a sufficiency of being in a minority situation, so I do not intend to join with him in that position in the House at the present time.  As I listened to Senator McCartin speaking about those of us who went out and fought so hard to bring this country into the European Economic Community I could not help thinking what a watershed it was in Irish life for us to go into Europe.</P>
      <P>Not so very long ago in this and the other House one would have expected to hear the phrase &ldquo;those of us who went out and fought to make this an independent, free State.&rdquo;  Instead, we are now listening to young men talking about those who fought to bring us into Europe. It is perhaps a sign of the changing times and the difference that our being a member of the Community means not just to this country but to the activities of our Parliament generally. That is what we are witnessing being set up here today.  I welcome it as bringing in an exciting new dimension into parliamentary activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure that the creation of a Committee such as this will in a very short space of time bring about the setting up of similar Committees which may examine and report on other spheres of legislation <Col N="761" /> and activity generally.  For too long we have been inclined to criticise the Committee procedure in this and the other House and to suggest reforms of the parliamentary process.  This seems to me to be the first real worthwhile attempt to introduce a Committee system on modern businesslike lines into the parliamentary process here.  For that reason if for no other it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I agree with virtually everything Senator Robinson has to say about the setting up of the Committee.  I am a little surprised at her suggestion that the Bill is perhaps not involving enough Members of Parliament in the activities of the Committee.  Anyone who has ever served on a committee knows that the larger the size of the committee the less effective they are likely to be.  I imagine she has come across this.  When we realise that there are to be 26 Members out of a total Oireachtas membership of 200 that is more than one-tenth of the Members of the Oireachtas being involved in a definite way in the Committee apart from the office holders at Cabinet and Parliamentary Secretary rank.  It is quite a high proportion of the Members of each of the Houses.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan made an important point.  The manner in which this Committee is being set up this evening is surely not the be-all and end-all of how they are to exist and operate.  We are very much feeling our way in our approach to the field of European legislation.  He quite rightly pointed out that this Committee will be coming back very quickly looking for amendments to their powers, seeking extensions of their field of activities in certain directions and perhaps saying that in other spheres the Committee should be re-modelled.  To do that effectively the calls which have been made for the setting up of an efficient secretariat are vitally important, not only to serve the Committee but because there is an urgent need to provide a competent and efficient secretariat for our Members of the European Parliament itself in their activities and their duties at parliamentary level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> I had reason to speak elsewhere this week about the fact that public men have for too long in this country sold themselves short and not provided themselves either with the facilities or the remuneration to carry on their activities properly as public representatives. Might I venture to suggest, with the greatest of respect, that the public men phrase could even in this instance extend to public women?  Senator Robinson suggested the setting up of a staff of at least three people to act as a team of expert advisers, a secretariat, a research group and all the other attendant specialist services that a Committee such as this would need.  A team of three to serve the activities of a Committee such as this is too small.</P>
    <P>If we start from that base, as any of us who have been involved in any sort of public activities know, it will be very difficult to get the Committee geared up to the level at which you would like to see them operate.  All of us know the great difficulties which Members of this and the other House have in finding adequate information on any topic on which we wish to speak.  There are no research facilities available to the Members of this or the other House.  The lack of those facilities is badly felt.  It is essential to have a modern service on these lines.  If the creation of this Committee and the setting up of a secretariat can bring about a proper research group which will advise on European matters, so too will that bring about the creation of a reference area and study facilities in other fields of legislation which is important if we wish to operate as a modern, effective Parliament.  I believe three people to serve the committee on the vast field about which we have been speaking this evening are far too few.</P>
    <P>One of the first things which a Committee such as this may come back seeking is the establishment of a chairman as an office holder who would not just be an unpaid chairman but a chairman doing a job and heading a team who were advising the Committee who were in turn advising Parliament on the vast complexities of European legislation.</P>
    <P>I agree with those Senators who <Col N="763" /> have suggested that the actual operation of the Committee should be on informal lines rather than having attached to it the constraining trappings and Standing Orders of Parliament itself.  If the Committee are to get off the ground and get any real work done there will have to be from the start a fair amount of informality and a fair amount of work and time put into their operation by the Members appointed to it.</P>
    <P>I agree also that not only should those members who are actually part of the Committee be involved in their activities but so too should any Member of Parliament who has a particular interest in any sphere in relation to which the activities of the Council or of the European Parliament seem to be coming to bear. They should be able as of right to go in and speak at the meetings of the Committee, make their views known and add their contribution in whatever specialist way to the formulating of a decision on the part of the Committee.</P>
    <P>Not only is it vital that the Committee should have been set up but it is important from the point of view of this Parliament because the idea could very easily grow within the next few years either that the Oireachtas was completely irrelevant in the European context, or that the European image was a remote one far removed from this country and that the small Irish voice could not be heard in this impersonal administrative machine operating from a far distance.  Both of these concepts would be tragic if they gained credence.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on us as Members of this or the other House and not just on our representatives in Europe or on our Minister for Foreign Affairs, whoever he happens to be at the time&mdash;may I say to the present Minister that he has done a great deal to try to prevent both of these images from gaining credence?&mdash;to endeavour to bring the activities of the Council, the European Parliament and our own Parliament closer together, to explain these activities and relate them better to Irish life.  In that way the people <Col N="764" /> will realise, on a personal rather than on an impersonal level, the great important new challenge in which they are involved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of this Committee and I hope it will have a real part to play both in the activities of this Parliament and the European Parliament.</P>

      <P>I should like, first of all, to thank the House for the warmth of its reception and the words of appreciation expressed on both sides of the House.  I deeply appreciate the fact that the Opposition side of the House have given this measure support. What we are doing is amending legislation which was brought in by the previous Government.  The Opposition could have decided to take the line that what had been done by them in Government was necessarily right and should not be changed.  They have not taken this attitude.  They are willing, as we are, to look again at a matter of this kind.  That is why we have had a very non-political and constructive debate, with, of course, the dissenting voice of the Leader of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to his remarks, which merit consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Bill itself there were a couple of points made before we come to the Committee.  There is a suggestion that there should be a power to amend rather than a power simply to annul. I am sorry if this point was made previously because if it was made, and somebody suggested it had been made, I missed it.  I am not, therefore, thoroughly briefed on it.  My own feeling is that it must surely be unusual, and possibly dangerous, for any Parliament to have power to amend regulations which are made by a Government because the regulations are made in a particular way for particular purposes.  An amendment to a regulation by a Parliament which could <Col N="765" /> not take into account all the technical considerations involved in the drafting of a regulation in that way, and perhaps all the consequential effects of changes, could give rise to considerable difficulties. It seems to me that the two areas of legislation, parliamentary legislation and secondary legislation, need to be kept separately.  I say that simply as a first instinctive reaction.  I hope it is not too much of an Establishment reaction.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, however, that the annulment procedure is only a way of telling the Government that we want something to be amended.  If the Government feel that a regulation is necessary&mdash;these are all regulations which will be necessitated by membership&mdash; they must, if it is annulled, introduce it in amended form.  The Government then have the expertise and special knowledge at their disposal to ensure that the form of the amendment is one which achieves the result desired by the House and that it does not create problems through inconsistency and incompatibility between the amended regulation and other regulations. Indeed, the Government have this special responsibility to ensure that the regulation is one which is in conformity with the directive of the Community which they are supposed to implement.  There the Government have an absolute responsibility, I am not sure that the Government would be constitutionally entitled in their relationship with the Community to hand over a particular prerogative to Parliament&mdash;I would have some doubts about that&mdash;in view of the obligation that the Government, as such, have taken <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Community.  I am not a constitutional lawyer and I may be wrong in that matter.  I see signs of dissent from Senator Robinson, which always worry me in matters of this kind, so I will not pursue that line any further.</P>
    <P>I suppose it would be possible also for the Committee to recommend an amendment to the Government.  I do not think one needs to lay this down as a legal procedure but if the Committee rather than annulling something thought that something should be amended, it could, I presume, pass a resolution recommending that.  The <Col N="766" /> mention of a resolution brings me to a reference to what Senator Yeats said. I must say I was taken aback when he read out a reference to a resolution of the Council of Ministers.  As a member of the Council of Ministers for some months past, I was unaware of the fact that we could pass resolutions.  I am glad to know that.  I shall consider what resolutions I may propose at future meetings but I have to tell Senator Yeats on this question of a resolution that it has been held in 90 and 91/63, Commission v. Luxembourg and Belgium, Rec X 1217, [1965] CMLR 335 that a resolution of the Council was held to have no binding force, since it was a statement of intent and no more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why they agreed so quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt, but that being the case, while there is more to the point than simply the Senator's reference to a resolution, a resolution as such, not having any binding force is not something which you could seek to annul anyway nor can it bind this country to adopt any Act, order or regulation which the Committee could have power to annul.  Although, at first sight the use of the word resolution in the context of the Council of Ministers would seem to import a new element into the situation I do not think that it actually does.  That is not to say that there is not a point to be made.  I am not suggesting that the wording of what we have passed already, the Expediency Motion, is necessarily perfect or indeed even adequate.  I take the points made in the House.  It had been my understanding that despite the fact that, technically, the wording confines itself to specific things like drafts of acts, regulations, directives, decisions, recommendations and opinions of the Council, this would leave open to the Committee&mdash;this is still my understanding&mdash;to consider other provisions such as a programme, for example, of medium-term planning or something like that, that this too could be considered by the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am still of the opinion, though I <Col N="767" /> am open to correction that although not explicitly referred to here, the Committee can take cognisance of any such documents and make recommendations about them.  What it cannot do is seek to annul them, because if they are not law in Ireland there is nothing to annul.  If the Committee, when it meets and begins work, finds that it is under any constitutional disability and that it is advised that it has not got the capacity to consider any document emanating from the Community which it wants to consider and make recommendations on, then the Government will be happy to move the necessary amendments to the motion in both Houses.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that I will do it now, today, because, first of all, I am not certain that there is a need and, secondly, I am not entirely sure how I might be received in the other House if I descended on them in the midst of their cares, seeking to wind up the end of the Session, and asked them to amend a motion they passed just yesterday. This might be temerarious on my part.  It could even lead to dissention between the two Houses.  As I do not think this is actually necessary I am not proposing to make the change but I suggest that the Committee test its powers very early on.</P>
    <P>The document Senator Yeats mentioned is one which could be brought before the Committee.  If there is any suggestion or if the Committee is technically advised that it has not got the necessary power to consider and make recommendations on that, then at the earliest possible opportunity during the next session the motion can be amended to meet the point.  It would be contrary to the wishes of the Government that the Committee should in any way have its hands tied here.  There are draft proposals of various kinds which come forward and programmes on which the views of the House would be extremely useful and it would be absurd if the Committee could not consider them.  That problem can be overcome and we will see if any change is necessary as we go along.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> Regarding the point raised by Senator O'Higgins, one has to weigh up the relative advantages of the two systems.  It is true that under this system Deputies not on the Committee will not have an actual direct voice in initiating the annulment process. Once it is initiated they would have an opportunity to speak in either House, as appropriate, on the matter. This is a better procedure than the other one, as the six month review process was one which was cumbersome and did not enable attention to be directed adequately and in good time to particular proposals.</P>
    <P>What has been lost here in the change we are making is more than outweighed by the gain.  I recognise, however, there could be two opinions on this and it is useful that this dissenting view should have been put to the House so that we should not be too complacent about the steps we are now taking.  I should like to point out to Senator O'Higgins that the two Houses will have other opportunities of considering the EEC developments, including the regulations, <i>et cetera,</i> as there will be six-monthly reports to be debated in both Houses.  Although the six-monthly confirmatory legislation has been done away with by this Bill the six-monthly reports are not and there will be debates every six months at which any Deputy could raise any matter arising out of any regulation if he wishes to do so.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the Government that on other occasions Ministers would, as appropriate, report to the two Houses on developments in the Community.  The extent and frequency of ministerial appearances will depend a good deal upon the demand for them.  Ministers, like <i>prima donnas,</i> are sensitive in these matters.  If nobody seems to want them they are unlikely to press their attentions on the Houses; but if in either House there is a demand for Ministers to appear and discuss these matters, I am sure Ministers will be willing to respond.  If nobody looks for us we may not get around to appearing frequently on these matters.  It is a matter for the two Houses to indicate the extent to which they would wish Ministers to <Col N="769" /> report on major issues that may come up in the course of the parliamentary session other than at the times when there are regular debates on the six-monthly reports.</P>
    <P>On the question of the staff of the Committee Senator Robinson stated there should be at least three.  She was chided by Senator Boland for setting her sights too low.  I was asked to press on this matter for adequate staff for the Committee.  The House will appreciate that this is not my function directly. The division of functions is such that the Committee should decide what staff it wants and press through the Committee of Procedure and Privileges the Minister for Finance to make adequate provision.  I have given my views to the Minister for Finance and the Government on the subject and have found great sympathy.  It is not primarily a matter for me at this stage once the Committee is set up.  I hope the Committee will ensure that it is adequately staffed and that it will review its staff position not too long after the establishment of the Committee to make sure it is remedying defects and that they will be overcome. I believe the Minister for Finance will be sympathetic and I will give, informally or otherwise, any help I can.  It has been suggested that the staff should be responsible to the Committee chairman and not capable of being allocated elsewhere but should be available full time to the Committee.  I presume this is the intention, but again it is a matter between the Committee of Procedure and Privileges and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I have not any direct responsibility for the Library.  My understanding is that it is a European documentation centre but it is not a deposit Library for Community documents, the only one of which in Ireland would be the National Library.  At least it is geographically convenient in its present location and long may it remain there. Whatever documents are not in the European documentation centre and in the deposit library would be at least geographically accessible to Members. It is important that the library facilities, both in terms of material available and staff, should be adequate and <Col N="770" /> the idea of setting the material aside in the particular areas seems to be a good one.  I am very conscious, as an ordinary Deputy, of the inadequacy of space in the Library and the fact that much important material has to be stored a long distance away and is not as readily accessible as it should be. We should all press for better accommodation. I do not know from the limited space available within the precincts of the House how the problem can be resolved.  I should think that any pressure we can put on for better library facilities will be in the general interest and I would join, as an ordinary Deputy, in any pressure of that kind.  The Library has been neglected for far too long.</P>

      <P>I was a member of the Library Committee at one time and I was very conscious of that.  The point was made by Senator Robinson and Senator Boland about the Committee being accessible to other Deputies and Senators.  This is important, but it is a matter for the Committee and the House cannot dictate to the Committee on this matter.  I trust the Committee will be open and will afford opportunities to other Members to attend its sessions.  Whether it will be appropriate or not for the Members to be able to speak is something on which I am not competent to speak. It is a matter for the Committee to consider its wishes and what may be proper in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked that a list of draft Acts, <i>et cetera,</i> should be available to Deputies and Senators, that is, draft proposals of the kind the Committee should take cognisance of, including draft programmes, resolutions as well as draft Acts.  That seems a worthwhile suggestion.  My Department will examine it and try to make this service available to any Deputy or Senator who asks for it.  We might write to every Deputy and Senator and ask him or her if they wish to be included in the list.  There may be some who do not want to be and we do not want to proliferate documentation endlessly.  Anybody who seeks it when invited to do so will get the <Col N="771" /> service.  That is a reasonable basis to put it on.</P>
    <P>I have been asked that in the six-monthly report not only the regulations passed in pursuance of obligations under the EEC Act would be listed but also parts of statutes which are implemented and which have been passed with a view to implementing obligations.  That seems a reasonable suggestion and a necessary one and we will try to ensure that is done.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion for a special Question Time in the Dáil dealing with EEC matters.  That is a matter for the other House in its own jurisdiction. I, as a Member of that House, have some doubts about it because this would raise an issue as to whether any given question related to the EEC or not should belong in the special Question Time.  We have enough trouble at present trying to allocate questions to Ministers where there are doubts as to jurisdiction without getting involved in any other aspect.  The suggestion will be noted and considered in the other House.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised as to whether there is a distinction between happy Ministers and willing Ministers. No such distinction was intended and I did not feel they were becoming less happy as we got nearer the point of having to actually deal with these matters so Senators can take it the two words were intended to mean the same thing though I accept they are capable of different interpretations.</P>
    <P>Senator McCartin made the point about the duty of the Committee not merely to be looking narrowly at things in the national interest but to be more broadly European and to bring people with us in what we are trying to do.  I take this point, which is extremely important.  It is something which applies to all of us, including the Government.  If in the European institutions, or indeed in these Houses &mdash;whose deliberations, obviously, are reflected back to Europe and are taken account of there&mdash;we seem only to be interested in what we can get out of it and what benefits there are for this country, economic, social and otherwise, <Col N="772" /> it is clear to me, and was my belief before I became a Minister, and is even more so now after four or five months as a Minister, that in that event we would not succeed in securing the benefits we would look for.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that we as a relatively poor country, as the least advanced country in the Community, will under many headings be in receipt of benefits.  We are the great beneficiaries from agricultural policy. In proportion to our size no country benefits to anything like the same degree. The first effect of this benefit has already been shown dramatically. There will be by the end of this year a two-thirds increase in farm incomes in two years.  Not all of it is attributable directly to Community membership&mdash; some of the special features of beef prices&mdash;but much of it derives from that source.  That means many, many tens of millions of pounds in quite a short period.</P>
    <P>We would also hope to benefit significantly from the regional policy. That is at issue at the moment and it is something which I am concerned about.  We will benefit, too, from the social policy.  Under any of these headings the payments we make in will tend to be very much less than the payments made out to us.  There is a clear recognition of this in Europe.  People are very well aware&mdash;especially the countries that are doing the paying&mdash;that under all these headings we are receiving something.</P>
    <P>Our job is to make sure that we get the benefits that are necessary from the Community point of view in order to make the Community work by bringing this country's living standards up so that we are not a drag on the Community and so that the regional imbalances are removed.  If we are seeking that, seeking our rights and seeking the implementation by the Community of the things it is their duty to implement for our benefit and if we do nothing else but that, we will become very much a sore thumb very quickly. Indeed, because of the fact there are so many benefits for us and the transfers are so large and so numerous in proportion to our size, it is particularly important that we should be contributing <Col N="773" /> actively and positively to the development of the European Community and its institutions.</P>
    <P>It is going to take a very big input of contribution for us to get away with, in the eyes of the Governments and the ordinary people of the various countries who pay out the money, our entitlement and to be able to press, without causing great irritations, for the things we are entitled to.  If we face in the near future a battle on regional policy&mdash;I do not exclude this&mdash;our ability to command the sympathy and support necessary to get our entitlement there will depend on whether we have been able to get across within the Community and its institutions that we are contributing something and that we are worthwhile members to have, otherwise, irritations could grow and this could come against us very much in the final outcome.</P>
    <P>Senator McCartin, therefore, even from the narrow point of view of national self-interest, is right.  There is indeed a broader concept than that because we are trying to build something worthwhile in Western Europe to which we have, in any event, a moral duty to make a contribution quite apart from the more materialistic consideration I have just adduced.  Senator McCartin made a very important point indeed.</P>
    <P>I hope this Committee will not construe their obligations narrowly.  I hope they will press the Government to make further progress with other like-minded Governments in the democratisation of European institutions.  I hope they will not delude themselves into thinking that the existence of this Committee and the functions which we have given to them, which are all that can be given, in any way satisfies the necessary criteria of a democratic system within the Community as a whole.  I hope the Committee will see it as part of their duty to examine the inadequacies of, for example, the Commission's proposals&mdash;they are inadequate in the view of the Government&mdash;for improving the working of the Community institutions and making them more democratic.  I hope they will be critical of these and will be putting forward proposals of <Col N="774" /> a constructive character which will strengthen the hands of the Government in their work to democratise institutions.</P>
    <P>On the point of the power of the European Parliament, I do not think it is impossible to attach too much importance to it.  Even for the functions now being carried out by the Community institutions at this stage of development, and we are only part of the way along the road, the European Parliament's powers are grossly inadequate to secure adequate democratic controls.  There have been obvious cases of this.  The whole question of the inadequacy of the audit procedure and the public accounting procedure in the Community is something which I tried to do something about shortly after having been appointed Minister. There are many other examples of it, too.</P>
    <P>The Community have, moreover, the ambition to go much further and to create an economic and monetary union.  I often doubt whether the significance of a monetary union is understood not just in this country but in Europe as a whole.  Frankly, sometimes in listening to some of my colleagues in the Council of Ministers talking about it I am not too sure that there is evident in their approach a full understanding of the full implications of it.</P>
    <P>A monetary union, as defined in the proposals, seems to involve fixed parities between currencies, a total interdependence between the Community countries.  That is something which would involve such a degree of decision making in key economic matters at the centre that it could not be tolerated if the institutions of the Community were not democratically controlled.  Our position has to be that we support this movement towards economic and monetary union.  It is in the material interests of this country that we should do so because of the close links with agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>We should support it also because we believe that this is the road along which we have to go but only on condition that it is accompanied by and closely paralleled by an adequate development of the democratic institutions. <Col N="775" /> Here we have a contribution to make and here we will find like-minded people in other countries.  I can assure the House that it is my preoccupation to work with other Governments who share our views, to try to convert those Governments that do not and to make it clear that we simply could not tolerate, and would not be permitted by our Parliament or people to tolerate, a development to the full monetary union unless there was full democratic control.</P>
    <P>In the work which we as a Government have to do on this we need the support and pressure of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Our hand will be strengthened in so far as the Oireachtas try to put pressure on us in the matter and tell us that the Oireachtas are not happy, that we should go further if we have not achieved these changes.  Here there can be a very fruitful interaction between the Committee, the Oireachtas and the Government working towards a similar end, each fulfilling their own function.  At times there will be tension, and so there should be.  At times the Committee and the House may feel that we are not making enough progress, that we are conceding too much in one area and not achieving enough in another area.  The criticisms of that kind which will be made will be helpful to us, and although we may not always welcome them at the time they will be in the national interest and will help to ensure that our common objectives will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I noted, as Senator Boland did, the significance of Senator McCartin's remarks of having, as he said, fought for Europe in the referendum in this country and the fact that that is a claim of great significance, not to be underestimated.  In that respect, I know there are Senators here who will interpret this story in a different way or may take a different view of it to the view I took of it.  I remember 11 years ago, when there was a delegation to this country of journalists from Europe, just before we thought we were joining the Community and I as chairman of the Irish Council of the European Movement, had the job of briefing <Col N="776" /> them.  I briefed them on how European we were in Ireland.  I suppose in some ways I was chancing my arm to some degree as we had not had a referendum and I did not know that the result would be as good as it was ten years later.  When I finished a journalist came over to me&mdash;it was the late Mr. A.P. Ryan of <i>The Times</i>&mdash;and said: &ldquo;You know the first time I came to Ireland your father briefed me in the Shelbourne Hotel&rdquo;&mdash;it had to be done very secretly, for obvious reasons; it was the Black-and-Tan period&mdash;&ldquo;about why Ireland had to be independent and now I come back and you are telling me how Ireland has to now merge part of its independence in a wider institution&rdquo;. He felt that was an interesting turn of events in the course of his period as a journalist.  I know there are Senators here who will take that in a different sense and who regard it as Senator Browne does&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This must be done democratically at this level and at European level.  We have made a step forward today at this level.  I hope we will continue to press ahead at the European level and that the whole Government will agree to the kind of merging of decision-making which is contemplated unless there is a parallel achievement of democratic control within the institution of the Community.</P>

    <Title>Private Business. - European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1973: Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This section concerns the amendment of the regulations.  I take the Minister's point that secondary legislation as such does not lend itself to amendment.  I quite agree. Thinking back now to the 22 EEC regulations that we enacted a month or so ago in this House, there were a number of those that were secondary legislation in the true sense of the word, detailed, highly technical matters, not of fundamental importance but with very little policy content.  I quite see that no amendment would lie there.  Indeed, I cannot think that <Col N="778" /> any Committee would either want to amend them or indeed to nullify them.</P>
      <P>There were, on the other hand, a number of other regulations which, strictly speaking, were not secondary legislation but which were precisely the type of thing that over the years we have discussed over and over again in this House.  For example, regulations interesting people who sell eggs and so on, with provision for criminal penalties, for giving people licences to sell eggs, withdrawing the licences and all this kind of thing.  We have had complete statutes before this House dealing with these things. These are not in any normal sense of the word secondary legislation and thereby I think they do lend themselves far more to amendment.</P>
      <P>The second point is a very minor matter of the other resolution.  Again, I take the Minister's point that a resolution is clearly not a binding thing but then, on the other hand, let us consider the functions of the Committee. It is to deal with regulations, directives and decisions.  Clearly, all those are binding in one form or another.  Why they cannot call them by all the same name I cannot imagine.  Then there are recommendations and opinions.  I hesitate to translate the gobbledegook of the EEC.  It may be that in EEC terms a recommendation and opinion is also binding, but somehow I doubt it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Offhand, it seems to me that a resolution could conveniently sit in along with a recommendation and an opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the question of these general debates.  I had intended when I spoke on the Second Reading to deal with this question.  Senator Robinson suggested that the Committee might consider these big broad issues such as regional policy.  I am inclined to be against that.  These are not matters of secondary legislation and the Committee has been called, I think rightly, the Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  I think these general policy debates on social affairs, <Col N="779" /> regional policy and all these matters should be in either the Seanad or the Dáil.  They are strictly policy, political matters.  It would be very valuable if we could have debates in one House or the other.  Possibly the Seanad would have more time and perhaps more inclination.  Debates of this kind would be very valuable, but I am not sure that they would be useful for the Committee.  They would clog the work of the Committee and they have enough to do as it is.  I think perhaps it is not really a function of the Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Yeats has left me a little high and dry.  I was with him up to a point, but I am now wondering what exactly he wants the Committee to do and not to do.  He wanted them to be able to consider a resolution which is not binding, but he does not want them to consider a programme which is not binding.  It is hard for me to see the line of demarcation.</P>
      <P>It seems to me it would be unfortunate if the Committee felt themselves prohibited from considering any document published as a draft by the Commission and expressing their views to the Dáil or the Seanad and through them to the Government.  That is not to say that there will not be cases where the matters will not be so important as to require a Dáil or Seanad debate. That debate should take place on the basis of the Committee's report or, independently, there should be a report to the Committee.  I do not think we want to say that the Dáil or Seanad can never discuss anything of the kind.</P>
      <P>It will be very difficult to draw a hard and fast line and say that &ldquo;This is for the Committee&rdquo; and &ldquo;That is for the Dáil and Seanad&rdquo;.  There would be an overlap, and that is a good thing because there is no harm in having a little bit of flexibility.  I would prefer to be clear that the Committee could consider any draft document put forward by the Commission which could in its eventual implementation in some form affect this country, without prejudice to the right of Dáil and Seanad to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> I take Senator Yeats's point that some of the regulations which were included in the original list for the first six months were ones which were a very close equivalent to a statute to be passed by these Houses.  The answer to that, I think, is in that case they should not have been regulations. What we have done here is to introduce in the second stage of the Committee's work, when they see the directive, the procedure to recommend to the Dáil or Seanad that that directive should be implemented not by regulation but by statute.</P>
    <P>It may well be that that is the answer.  If there is something which might normally be covered by statute, and so unlike the kind of unamendable regulations which the Senator spoke about in reference to other items in the list, then the Committee should so recommend to the Dáil and Seanad and the Government should try to have regard to such a recommendation, unless the Government had very strong reasons for the contrary.  I think that is where the line should be drawn.  Perhaps it was mistakenly drawn in the first six months, whether by this Government or the previous Government I do not know.  We have an opportunity now to ensure that the line will be better drawn in future and that what are passed as regulations are matters which really are not suitable for amendment.  Anything which is capable of amendment should then be passed as a statute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I must thank the Minister for his last remark which has at last, at this very late stage, cleared my mind as to one particular aspect of the Committee's functions which I never really understood&mdash;the precise meaning of his suggestion which he made some weeks ago that the Committee could recommend to the Government what particular form of action they could take.  It has now at least become clear to me what should have been clear to me much earlier: that the main thing would be, if it is purely a technical matter, that the Committee would, one would hope, recommend that it should be done by regulation; but in other cases, when more fundamental policy considerations arose, the Committee <Col N="781" /> should certainly recommend to the Government that it be done by statute.</P>
      <P>On this question of draft resolutions and so on, the distinction I was making was that frequently we have these documents, usually of a fairly massive nature, stemming from the Commission on social affairs and so on.  They do not contain any particular draft, directive, regulation or decision for the Council, but are a statement of provisions for the Commission's policy. On the other hand, we have a document such as this on the environment which contains at the very start what is called the draft Council resolution on a Community environmental programme. Then we have the usual verbiage to &ldquo;Having regards&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Whereas&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Whereof&rdquo; and so on, and we get down to brass tacks at the end of the page: that the Council adopts the aims and principles of a Community environmental policy defined in the first part of this programme, approves the guidelines of the projects making up the programme for improving the environment and so on, and then we have the rest of what they have approved and adopted <i>et cetera.</i> Here is a specific statement.  Whether it is binding or not, it is a draft Council decision based on the whole of this document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not appreciated the niceties of the verbiage.  There is nonetheless a clear distinction, even in the non-binding resolutions, between this kind of thing and the document which does not bear any such draft relating to the Council's approval, adoption and so forth of the kind this contains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is clear that there would be a sort of twilight zone between one form of activity and another.  I am happy to hear that no objection has been taken to the Committee discussing these other matters because certainly the title of the Committee, the Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, and the rather narrowly defined functions of the Committee would have suggested that it could not discuss these things, but it would seem from at least the Minister's viewpoint that <Col N="782" /> the Committee as far as he is concerned can discuss anything they wish, which I suppose is the most satisfactory outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I find a certain difficulty in following part of the submission made by Senator Yeats in that he seems to be in a sense contradicting himself.  He has been referring to the resolution on the environmental policy and saying that this would be appropriate for the European Committee, with which I thoroughly agree, but then saying that other matters such as the regional or social policy should be excluded.  But they would, in fact, be in the same form as that.  I really fail to understand that, and I would prefer the attitude adopted by the Minister that it would be artificial and unreal to exclude from the European Committee the possibility of looking at the draft programmes and alerting the Houses of Parliament if necessary.  But this does not at all exclude the opportunity that the Houses of the Oireachtas would have both when Ministers reported specially to them and also during the bi-annual debate on the report of developments in the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There might be a further possibility of giving an opportunity to the Houses of Parliament to consider the regulations.  This arises on section 1 and arises from the fact that it has not been stated explicitly to what extent this Committee will report regularly to the Houses of the Oireachtas. I note under section 1 that if the Committee recommends annulment then obviously time must be given, this must be discussed and if this is passed by a majority the particular regulation will be annulled.  If the House reports without a specific recommendation for annulment and has interesting things to say on the regu lations and on the draft proposals it has considered will the custom be followed of allowing time in the House for a debate?  This would take the place of the six-monthly Confirmation of Regulations Bill which, as Senator O'Higgins pointed out, allows for time being given for a debate of the contents of these regulations.  It was a weaker mechanism for the Oireachtas, but it <Col N="783" /> provides for this regular time being given by the Houses of the Oireachtas for debate.  If we could ensure that the European Committee would report regularly, whether or not it was specifically recommending the annulment of a regulation, and that time was given to consider this report it would meet the need for that particular control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, it is up to the Committee to decide how often they report; that is left to the committee.  What the Dáil does with its reports is a different matter.  I will make one point here.  Criticism has been made of the earlier narrowness of the wording and that it casts doubt on the ability of the Committee to consider and report on matters which do not fall into the type of description of regulations, directives, decisions, recommendations and opinions.  What may turn out to be the case is the Committee can consider anything they like but when it comes to reporting they could be limited to these.  This may necessitate an amendment to the motion, but that is a matter which we can consider again when the Committee have a chance to look at it.</P>
      <P>On the question of giving time for debate, Senators should recall that we do intend to have still the twice-yearly debate on the report.  This was combined this year, and would perhaps continue to be combined, with the six-monthly debate on the Bill.  There is not really any saving of time there. Obviously, some of the Committee's reports could be considered in conjunction with the six-monthly debate. If, on the other hand, there was a Committee report coming during the six months on a matter of some importance, the House would probably want to have a debate on it and the Government would be sympathetic to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, in this as in other matters, the ability of the Government to permit debates of this kind fairly freely at the instance of the House or the Opposition would depend upon an improvement in the procedures of the Dáil and Seanad, and perhaps particularly of the Dáil, to speed things up.  Reforms <Col N="784" /> which will be proposed in due course and which might reduce the amount of time taken at present on some items, such as transferring them to committees, would release time for debate.  Anything I am saying about the willingness of the Government to permit debate is dependent, naturally, on our finding some way to reduce the clogging of the machinery of both Houses at present by perhaps excessive concentration on Committee debates, some of which would be better carried on in a Special Committee. But that is something which both Houses have to come back to in the new Session when the Government put forward their proposals for reform of procedures.</P>
    <P>The final point I should like to make in reply to what has been said so far is that on the question of recommendation there is an ambiguity in the word in this sense that, as I thought, the Coal and Steel Community recommendations are binding &mdash;they are the equivalent of the EEC directives&mdash;whereas EEC recommendations are not binding.  So you use the word &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo; here implying it is binding.  It is correct so far as the Coal and Steel Community go, and the word was necessary. I think, however, that the word &ldquo;opinions&rdquo; introduced here does introduce an element which is not binding.  If we had been trying to limit it to the things that were binding, we should not have put in &ldquo;opinions,&rdquo; and if we were trying to extend it more widely to consider programmes we should have put in &ldquo;programmes.&rdquo; Therefore, I think the motion is in this respect somewhat defective and probably will have to be amended.</P>

      <P>The Committee will not report more or less continuously; it will report at pretty regular periods.  What I had in mind was that obviously you will have serving on this Committee people who in considering a particular regulation and in discussing policy &mdash; which Senator Yeats, for example, is reluctant to discuss &mdash; will be offering different points of view.  If we are to have an involvement with the Community it would help greatly if the proceedings of the Committee were published rather quickly so that they would become a matter of public scrutiny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This suggestion was made either here or in the other House at an earlier stage and I would be very much in favour of it; but it is a matter for the Committee, when appointed, to make their own arrangements as to whether they want their debates to be public, whether they are to be reported and how they are to be reported.  This is something we have to leave to the Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to be tedious about this but, before people allow their names to go forward, there is another matter concerning the Committee. The point was made concerning parliamentarians in general in the other House by a Member that we might have a declaration of interest by parliamentarians with respect to anybody who may serve on this Committee. I suggest that it would be very useful procedure if Members who would be willing to serve on the Committee would declare their interests publicly so that the Committee would be above any suggestion at any time of lending itself to favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter on which I could not speak.  I am not sure if it is within the competence of the Minister at all.  Of course, the normal <Col N="786" /> obligation applying to every Member that if any matter is debated in which he has an interest and he speaks he must declare his interest will of course apply in the Committee as well as in the House.  The Senator may be thinking of a general declaration of interest, like a general confession, before people would join.  That would be a matter for the Committee to work out.  Perhaps it is used as a more general principle, perhaps a good one, but perhaps something too general to be debated on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Also, I must make the point that I think generally confessions of interest are very difficult because it may be at times difficult for people to remember in a non-specific situation what their interests are.  I once had to try listing the things I am a member of &mdash; even in relation to being in Government I thought I should list the things of which I am a member in case there is a conflict &mdash; and I found I had forgotten several of them.  I may still have forgotten one.  In the process of discussing a particular matter you will immediately have present in your mind any vested interest you might have in it at that point in time.  So perhaps generally confessions of interest may be a bit difficult for absent-minded people like academics anyway.</P>

      <P>I earlier gave notice that I was accepting as a proper subject for debate on the Adjournment the question raised by Senator West concerning the dumping of chemicals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter to clarify the position about the dumping of Danish chemicals in the Atlantic.  I wish to share the 20 minutes at my disposal with Senator Browne.  I also give notice of the fact that Senator Browne and I intend to withdraw Motion No. 17 from the Order paper as a consequence.</P>
      <P>The whole position seems to indicate a great lack of information.  Since this is a very important issue and one which we will face no doubt on other occasions we ought to take steps at an early stage to see that we are dealing with the specific situation before others slip past us and receive either negligible treatment or no publicity in the Press, or that chemicals are dumped and waste is disposed of before we know where we are.  We have also some problems of pollution in the air over the country and in the water which surrounds this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dangers of dumping of these chemicals are obvious.  First of all, there is the danger to the fishing grounds both to the spawning fish in the area and then to the fishermen as the chemicals drift inshore to the actual fully-grown fish.  A diagram in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today indicates quite clearly that the Gulf Stream is going to tend to bring the chemicals towards our shores and towards the <Col N="791" /> shores of the Scandinavian countries, in particular Norway.  The Gulf Stream, flowing more or less due North at the point at which the chemicals are being dumped, will at this time of year bring them slowly but surely on to our shores.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the composition of the chemicals.  There seems to be no indication of what these chemicals are made.  We just have blanket assertions from the Danes that the chemicals are not sufficiently toxic to have a dangerous effect.  Also there is the question of quantity. What is the tonnage and what exactly is the quantity of the chemicals to be dumped in the Atlantic at this particular point?</P>
    <P>There is another problem here.  A report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today talks about a single dumping of 2,400 tons in one operation, but the possibility of a permit being issued to dump 25,000 tons of chemicals per year in the Atlantic.  That is equivalent to ten single dumpings.  The magnitude of the problem makes the mind boggle, particularly when one realises what five barrels of pesticide did for the Rhine on one occasion.  Five barrels of pesticide killed every fish for hundreds of miles in the Rhine.</P>
    <P>The point I should like to stress is that there is a complete lack of information on this proposed dumping. We do not have the composition of the chemicals.  We have a statement from the Danish Ministry of the Environment saying that it carried out tests on the effects of waste on small flat fish but admitted it could say nothing about the long-term effects on marine life.  There is no real information there.  We have a blanket statement that our own Government are satisfied that the proposed dumping will not have any damaging effects on fisheries off the Irish coast.  That is stated in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today.  What information at the Government's disposal allows them to make a statement of this type?  In today's papers there is also a reference to the Oslo Convention. According to <i>The Irish Press</i> the Government declined to give an <Col N="792" /> assurance that dumping would be supervised and it is understood &mdash; by whom it is not clear &mdash; that because the operation is being carried out in accordance with the Oslo Convention, which laid down maximum limits for dumping at sea, there could be no Irish presence.  Another danger is that the Government can hide behind an international convention and therefore take no action.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated on other occasions, I think we should take international conventions with a grain of salt.  If necessary we should have an Irish presence at the site and ignore these conventions.  The only time that could hit us would be if we were dumping chemicals off the Atlantic coast.  These international conventions are traditionally used by governments as an excuse for inaction when they wish to do nothing on a particular problem on which action should be taken.  We have got a situation in which a large quantity of unknown chemicals is being dumped in the South Atlantic when the Gulf Stream will tend to make these chemicals drift in our direction, a situation in which responsible bodies, such as oceanographers and marine biologists in University College, Galway, and An Taisce have protested, and in which every right-thinking person should protest because of the lack of information.  Yet the Government can appear to make blanket statements and take a blanket attitude on this issue and say there is going to be no damage to Irish fish, Irish fishing grounds and no possibility of pollution on our coast.</P>
    <P>What is important is what information is at the Government's disposal that they can make a blanket statement and a straightforward assertion that we can suffer no damage and that there is no danger.  What information do they have which we do not have which allows them to make this assertion and which appears to indicate that they are giving <i>carte blanche</i> to the Danes on this issue? Whatever the quantity of chemicals and whatever the composition, we should join with the UK, France, Spain and Norway and make an <Col N="793" /> official protest to the Danes and nip in the bud this dumping of waste in the Atlantic.  If we do not do this now, it will continue to grow and the consequences must be clear to everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It has occurred to some Members of the Dáil, and I am glad that we have been given an opportunity in the Seanad of expressing the great concern of many people at this decision to permit the dumping of these pollutants in the Atlantic off our coast.  It would appear that the Government are so preoccupied with their unavailing and unsuccessful attempts to control prices that they have not got time to consider the grave implications of this matter and to act as their predecessors acted. Frequently we find ourselves in the distressing position of being told, if we protest about anything, that the other Government were just as bad. In this instance the other Government were better because they protested successfully on a Dutch incident of this kind.  It is difficult to see why this Government do not protest.</P>
      <P>One of the sad reflections which I make from time to time is of the occasions when my colleague in my one-time constituency, the present Minister, Deputy FitzGerald, and other colleagues, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, Deputy Keating and so on, at the drop of a hat were prepared to protest on different issues &mdash; perhaps not the drop of a hat but certainly the drop of an atomic bomb.  They would come out and protest and march.  Now that they have power they do not seem to be prepared to do anything at all.  Power seems to be the great healer of youthful ambitions and enthusiasms.  We find now that when they have power to do something about these matters they are silent.  This matter is particularly grave.  I believe a boat is leaving New Ross for Denmark tonight.  It will load up in Denmark and then come down and dump its toxic substances in the Atlantic off our western coasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me the most impressive authority on this matter is certainly not myself, or, I would suggest respectfully, the <Col N="794" /> Government, or the Minister's advisers. I would be inclined to believe that Professor Barry, mentioned by Senator West, and all his staff in this excellent Marine Biology Department on the western seaboard are all gravely disturbed by this happening.  It has been suggested that this will be a safe dump.  Professor Barry points out that because we have no monitoring device whatever on the western seaboard nobody has the right to make that claim with any authority.  If anybody could make that claim it would be the people in Galway in the Marine Biology Department.  Professor Barry cannot make that claim.  Therefore, nobody else has a right to do so.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the dumping will be in the form of thick sludge which will sink down to 15,000 feet. Professor Barry makes the point that this is most unlikely.  It can quite easily move either North to us or East across to the Spanish coast.  I was amused by the cynical indifference of the Minister for Finance who said it is all right, it will go off to Spain.  Only a few Spaniards, a few Wogs, will be poisoned, so why should we worry? We are all right Jack.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the people in Galway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the great European comradeship of which we have heard so much.  It is just as bad for the Frenchman, the Englishman, Spaniard as the Irishman &mdash; they are all concerned. They are all equally a concern of ours.  If the bell tolls for Don Juan, it tolls for us.  We are all concerned about these things.  If we have any say in the matter at all then we should do everything we can in order to stop this act being carried out.  It is obviously the first of many such acts, as Senator West has pointed out.  We should see that it stops now.  There can be no safety in an operation of this kind in present circumstances.  It is a reasonable assumption, as Professor Barry says, that some of this pollutant can be carried nowhere else but North to us or across to Spain.  Secondly, it is possible that even if it were dumped in containers, while the container idea is reasonably successful, containers have <Col N="795" /> been known to break.  In these circumstances the pollutant can be carried up on to the West coast.</P>
      <P>We have on the west coast a unique feature and that is that, I believe with Japan, we have the only unpolluted coastline in which it is possible to introduce this new development of pisciculture in the great deep unpolluted fjords on the western seaboard of our country.  There is no doubt whatever that there is a grave risk that if this operation is unsuccessful then this unpolluted, unique asset which we have on the western seaboard may be ended.  I understand that they have told us they tried these pollutants out on plaice.  I am given to understand that this is not a test for all of the marine life on the western seaboard.  The fact that a pollutant might not affect plaice does not mean that you can extrapolate this to the whole of marine life on the western seaboard.  Unless all of these pollutants are tested against all possible forms of marine life on the western seaboard you cannot say that this will be a successful operation.</P>
      <P>There is no reason in the world why we should take a commercial firm's undertaking that this dumping will be safe for Ireland.  What in the name of God do they know about the marine life on our Western seaboard that Professor Barry does not know? Are they better authorities?  Are they more reliable?  Is he an unreliable authority?  Are the Marine Biology Section staff people on whom you cannot depend?  Are their fears ungrounded? If they are not ungrounded what grounds do you go on?  What grounds has the Minister to refute the charges which are made by Professor Barry and the Marine Biology Department on the western seaboard? What authority has the Minister or his civil servants except the authority they get from Professor Barry and his very talented staff on the West coast?  Surely they will not take the Danish authorities before our own authorities who are particularly skilled in this particular case?  They happen to be quite outstanding in their knowledge of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> The Oslo Agreement was mentioned. I cannot find the Oslo Agreement but I found the Stockholm Agreement, 1972.  I do not know if we are parties to it.  There are 57 countries who are parties to it, and if we are not parties to it we should be.  It was an agreement entered into in order to prevent this kind of marine pollution in situations such as ours. Under that agreement it was decided that there were various substances which should not be dumped at all. Senator West asked if the Minister knows how many of these substances are included in the proposed dump, those substances which are forbidden under the Stockholm Agreement.</P>
    <P>Under the Stockholm Agreement various things like pesticides, mercury, arsenic, poison gases and so on are referred to.  These are not to be dumped unless they are in the first instance rendered innocuous.  If they are not to be rendered innocuous why are they being dumped in this form? If they are being dumped in this form is it so that they are being dumped in contravention of the Stockholm Convention, to which if we are not a party we should be?  It was agreed that a special permit would have to be granted for the dumping of pollutants of this kind.  If this permit was given to create a chemical septic tank in the Atlantic it is in blatant breach of the Convention, because it was entered into on the understanding it was at last accepted that there is a limit to the amount of pollution that can be discharged.  If pollution was at a dangerously high level this International Convention of nearly 60 nations was to bring it to a halt.</P>
    <P>If we were to allow this dumping in the Atlantic it was understood that the dumping would all be recorded and monitored.  I understand from Professor Barry and his staff that it cannot be monitored.  Why are we in default of this convention?  Why are we allowing this to happen?  The Minister is in no position to give an undertaking that the dumping can be monitored because I understand there is no monitoring service on the West coast which can carry out any survey. For 11 weeks on our coast the Danish <Col N="797" /> fishermen picketed the boat that is to do this dumping, until they were forbidden to dump this on the Danish coast.  Why in the name of God are we allowing this to happen off our coasts?  I am ashamed to hear of the Danish Government, of whom I have the highest regard, allowing this antisocial act off our coasts when they know their own people did not allow it.  Above all, why is the Minister &mdash; a man for whom I have great personal respect and who over the years has protested repeatedly and effectively in matters such as this &mdash; allowing this to happen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The dumping of any waste or toxic products in the sea is a matter for concern.  Statements made in this House should not suggest that we are unconcerned about this; as a country which is surrounded by the ocean it is obviously of particular concern to us.  However, we must look unemotionally and factually at the actual situation and see what courses of action are open to us.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that details of the chemicals concerned have not been published.  There is no reason why they should not be; there is no secret about them.  My worry is whether time will permit me to say all I wish to say on this matter.</P>
      <P>If the House will permit I will read out what is involved.  There are two different lots:</P>

    <P>This may be summed up as follows:</P>
    <P>About two-thirds of the material consist of inorganic salts of the nature of common salt and similar harmless chemicals.  There are small quantities of acids.  The other third consist of organic, that is, carbon compounds most of which are harmless. A very small proportion of organic matter might be harmful in high concentrations close in-shore but will rapidly break down in contact with sea water.  The main effect of this organic matter will be to temporarily reduce the oxygen content of the sea water into which it is <Col N="799" /> discharged, but the reduction in dissolved oxygen will be soon remedied by dispersion and re-aeration.</P>

The contacts we have made with some of the countries concerned and we have tried to contact all of them, have indicated that they find nothing to protest about and regard this dumping as being within the Oslo Convention and as offering no danger to their coasts, which are more directly threatened by any such dumping than ours are.  Therefore, we cannot join in an official protest with people who do not want to protest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other case mentioned, in regard to which the previous Government took steps &mdash; the Dutch chemicals &mdash; concerned chemicals which were toxic and should not have been dumped under the Oslo Convention.  The same is true of the chemicals dumped in the Rhine. There are about 0.6 tons of cyanide which, we are informed, may be highly poisonous at the time of discharge but <Col N="801" /> which decomposes rapidly, and the concentration of such material will soon fall to a harmless level under the influence of dispersion and re-aeration of the sea water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>They are permitted to be dumped with special care being taken under Annex II of the Oslo Convention.  The special care includes, I presume, that they should not be dumped in shallow water but only in very deep water running down three miles to a level where they can do no harm.</P>
      <P>I note what has been said about Professor Barry's comments on the matter.  He is a distinguished oceanographer. On the question of the chemicals, he is not himself a chemist and did not have access to the information I have just given the House.  I think it would have been better if this information had been made available more quickly.  When he sees this information he may or may not modify his opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not consult him? You run the authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of authorities involved here.  The first authority is somebody who understands chemicals.  Secondly, the question arises, in so far as the chemicals are dangerous and regarded as such under the Oslo Convention, of what conditions of care are required in dumping them in which part of the sea. The latter part of Professor Barry's views will be very valuable here.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I have given the House all the facts available to me. There is no ground for protest because one cannot protest when action is taken which is within the terms of the Oslo Convention.  If any country went outside it, then of course one would protest.  The previous Government protested very effectively in such a case. A protest would not be appropriate when a Government have gone to some trouble to make sure they were acting in accordance with the convention concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we should look into the <Col N="802" /> matter further.  It may well be that these conventions have some defects or inadequacies.  I do not know.  In view of our particular interest in the matter we should look into that and if we find that the convention is in some way inadequate we should take steps to try to improve it in future international legislation so that we can get the matter under control.</P>
    <P>On the evidence available to us there is no danger from this material being dumped in this way.  The Government will certainly examine the matter further, will keep in touch with any developments in the situation and will try to ensure that if there is any evidence that the present convention is inadequate steps will be taken to make it adequate and to ensure the fullest protection of our coast and the Atlantic waters generally from any kind of pollution which could be dangerous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I should like the Minister to clarify.  In his speech he said &ldquo;The information at my disposal concerning the depth to which these chemicals would sink&rdquo; and went on to say what would happen to them in so far as they are exposed.  Does this information come from the Danish Government or is it from our own experts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The information is from our own sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Professor Barry says something completely contrary to this.  Presumably the Minister can produce an Irish expert who gives the information which he has given us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The only information from the Danish Government is on the question of the chemicals and where they are going to dump them. The information as to the effect and the assessment of whether it is damaging is an assessment made by our own people.  I should like to make that clear.  But if there is a dispute betwen experts we must investigate it further and be satisfied that the advice we have is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Professor Barry says it was not just the 15,000 feet.  There is a stream at about 200 meters and <Col N="803" /> that stream could carry it either north to us or west across to Spain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
