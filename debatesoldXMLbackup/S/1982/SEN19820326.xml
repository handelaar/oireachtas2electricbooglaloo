Section 2 (2) of the Act provides that the appointment of a person to be the Ombudsman shall be made by the President upon resolution passed by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Eireann recommending the appointment of the person.

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On the order of Business, it has been suggested by the Leader <Col N="353" /> of the House that we should take items Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  The Social Welfare Bill is a measure on which I think a great deal of agreement will be found since if a graphologist examined the manuscript version of the Bill he would find that the origins of virtually all the sections of the Bill lie before the time of the present Government entering office.  Also, item No. 3 is not one on which there would be contention.  The House having come together, and Senators having been drawn in from many parts of the country where they would rather be at work endeavouring to ensure their return to this Chamber, this is really a scant programme to have put before us.  I understand the probability is that we will have to be brought together again in regard to a Rent Restrictions Bill.</P>
      <P>It might be appropriate that the Seanad should take up today, briefly, some of the resolutions on the Order Paper and discuss them.  There are some which may fall because Senators who put their names to them are no longer with us. There are others which it might be inappropriate to discuss because there has been a change of Government.  But there are other motions here which we could quite readily discuss, such as Motions Nos. 10, 12, 14, 16 and 17.  My name is to Motion No. 17.  This is an urgent matter to discuss because it calls on the Government to continue something which they may well be tempted to discontinue before we meet again or before a new Seanad is formed.  So I move that item No. 17 be added to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Dooge in requesting Senator Ryan to include Motion No. 17 because it concerns a matter to which this House had given a specific commitment.  Indeed, the previous Taoiseach honoured this House by his presence to initiate this review. Whereas the debate concerned the various elements of the Constitution which should or should not be changed, the whole House accepted the principle that a review was necessary.  The very fact of a message from the President that he has <Col N="354" /> refused to sign the Rent Restrictions Bill indicates how important a constitutional review is.  It is a matter of grave urgency that it should continue.  When the findings of the review come before both Houses of the Oireachtas we can then discuss what should or should not be included in a possible referendum.</P>
      <P>We welcome the announcement recently that a pro-life amendment is being accepted as a necessary constitutional change.  Many of us would agree with that and welcome it, but there are other items that need review as a matter of great urgency.  Certainly No. 11 should be discussed, because this is a matter which will probably run into some kind of constitutional problem.  It would be a matter of urgency for us in the Labour Party that No. 11 be taken as soon as possible, today or whatever other day the Seanad meets.</P>
      <P>Certainly the inclusion of No. 15 in the Order of Business would be agreed by many of us on this side of the House, and it has been signed by our colleagues on the other side of the House.  We would like to see GAA grounds exempt from rates because they provide a social amenity. We would have no objection to that being taken and agreed.</P>
      <P>I am sure Senator Robinson will talk about item No. 16 as a matter that needs to be included in any Order of Business if this House is to resemble an institution which is serious about dealing with the problems in our country.  There are many problems that would benefit from a constitutional review.  I formally second the motion that we add to the Order of Business. We have no objections to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in that order but I second the motion that we add these further items to the Order of Business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Items Nos. 11, 15 and 17 and Senator Robinson probably wants No. 16 as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Dooge's point that many of us were, perhaps, torn away from the campaign and that to justify our existence here we <Col N="355" /> should transact more business than Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  It would be good for our frayed nerves to be gainfully employed.</P>
      <P>I do not see the point of Senator Ferris's suggestion that several motions be added to the Order of Business.  We must be realistic about this.  I support the suggestion that No. 17 be added to the Order of Business because this is one of the last sitting which this Seanad will have and the item in question comes under the heading of continuity of business in that as an Independent in an entirely non-party spirit I would like to have a brief discussion according to the terms of the motion.  It would not take very long.  I do not think people want to cover the same ground as we did when we discussed the constitutional review.</P>
      <P>I might anticipate an objection.  It has been suggested that this is a lame duck Seanad, that we are in our dying days and that somehow our mandate to discuss these matters is somewhat weakened.  I have thought about this suggestion and I cannot see that we are any less valid as a Chamber than we were seven months ago.  I would support Senator Dooge's suggestion that item No. 17 be added.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the proposed amendment to add item No. 17 to the Order of Business.  I would agree with Senator Murphy that it is more realistic to accept that only one of the motions on the agenda could be taken today but I would agree that there is time to take it and that there is urgency in looking for a continuation of this review of the Constitution because we are getting some very conflicting statements in relation to the amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only commitment we have got to amending the Constitution is in an area where it is not, I would argue, necessary to amend the Constitution.  We have not been told what the form of that amendment would be but it is not one which appears to be clearly necessary.  There are a number of other crucial areas, for example, the prohibition on divorce, the provisions whereby children who are born in wedlock are ineligible for adoption even if they have been abandoned <Col N="356" /> by their parents and are growing up in institutions and, as Senator Ferris said, the provisions relating to the protection of property.  I do not on the Order of Business want to go into detail on these.</P>
    <P>I want to make clear that I originally opposed the reference of the review of the Constitution to a legal committee under the aegis of the Attorney General because I felt at that time, and to some extent still feel, that it is politicians who need to be discussing this and who need to be facing the difficult issues and doing it on the basis of an understanding of the Constitution and then we would have a more realistic debate.  I believe that this review is very necessary when the only commitment this incoming Government will make is to amend the Constitution where amendment is not necessary.  They have not specified how or what the text would be but it clearly shows the need for this review.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree that the business today is anything less than important.  It is a very important Bill.  It was necessary to meet for a very important Bill.  The fact that the debate on it may not take too long is not relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of discussing any one of these serious motions that have been proposed, it would be inappropriate to discuss them today.  Motion No. 17 in particular, has been suggested. This is a very important motion and I am sure that Senator Dooge and the seconder would want it to be given very serious consideration.  Because of the fact that many Members of the House are somewhat preoccupied at present, I doubt very much if it would receive the serious consideration today that the proposer and seconder would want it to have.  In these circumstances, I would not agree <Col N="357" /> that it would be appropriate to have it or any of the other motions discussed today.</P>
    <P>There is the other difficulty that I have had no notice that it was proposed to take this motion or any of the others mentioned and it would be quite impossible to have a Minister here to deal with a motion at such short notice.  I would be against taking any of these motions today.  It is correct to say that probably we will be meeting again in approximately a week's time.  If the Whips get together we could agree to take some motion at the next sitting.  That is the best way of dealing with the various proposals that have been put before us.</P>

As the proposer I will be making the opening speech; I will be talking about the desirability of continuation, not the merits of the case.  This should not take very long.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of lack of notice and the question of a Minister not being present, Senator Eoin Ryan and I have been colleagues for a long time and he knows my mind on this: it is now, and has always been the case that the Seanad will never be master truly of its own business until it goes ahead with motions even if Ministers are not present.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1982: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives effect to the undertakings given by Fianna Fáil in the recent general election in regard to social welfare increases.  The Bill was passed by the Dáil on Tuesday last, two days before the budget and it now comes before the Seanad one day after the budget.  I am sure Senators will have realised this is the first time ever in which a Social Welfare Bill has come before them so promptly. Members of the House will, however, be familiar with the political circumstances <Col N="360" /> which have given rise to this situation. The increased payments come into operation from Wednesday next, 31 March, which is only a few days away.  The legislation providing for the increases must be enacted by then and it is for this reason that I have had to move so quickly.  I am sure that I can rely on the co-operation of all Members of the House in giving this deserving measure speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
      <P>A number of harsher measures provided for in the January budget drawn up by the former Minister for Finance, such as the removal of the food subsidies and the imposition of VAT on footwear and clothing, were not acceptable to this Government because of their impact on the less well off sections of the community.  I am pleased however to include in the Bill the social welfare increases proposed in the January budget and to include also some additional items for which I have got the sanction of the Government and to which I will refer later.  Fianna Fáil Governments have always been conscious of the need to provide a satisfactory level of welfare services even in times of economic recession and to develop these services and bring about worthwhile improvements in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rates of payment generally are being increased by 25 per cent, apart from children's allowances in which case the increase is substantially greater.  It is clear that the increased payments will be of considerably more benefit to those receiving them than the same level of benefits would have been if they had been awarded in the context of increased prices for food, clothing and footwear which would have resulted from the proposals of the previous Government to remove food subsidies and put VAT on clothing and footwear.  The present Government's decision to eliminate the harshest effects of the budget proposed by the former Government by maintaining food subsidies at existing levels and cancelling the proposed new 18 per cent VAT on clothing and footwear will be a substantial relief especially for those who <Col N="361" /> are dependent on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the effect of the increases on individual payments.  Section 2 of the Bill provides for the increases in social insurance payments. The personal rate of contributory old age and retirement pensions for persons under age 80 is being increased by £8.05 to £40.25 while pensioners aged 80 years or over will get £43.05.  The addition to the pension for an adult dependant is being raised to £25.70 where the adult dependant is under pensionable age and to £30.05 where the adult dependant is aged 66 or over.  Accordingly, a married couple both over pensionable age will get £70.30 as compared with £56.25 at present and, if the pensioner is aged 80, the new rate will be £73.10 as against £58.50 at present.  The new rates for a married couple represent well over 50 per cent of average industrial earnings.</P>
    <P>The new personal rate of widow's contributory pension which also applies to deserted wife's benefit will be £36.25 for a person under pensionable age, £36.95 for a person aged between 66 and 80 and £39.45 for a person aged 80 years or over. An invalidity pensioner aged under 66 will get an increase of £7.10 bringing the personal rate to £35.50, while the rate for a person aged 66 or over will be raised by £7.25 to £36.20.  The addition to pension for an adult dependant is being increased to £23.05 for a pensioner under age 66 and to £23.50 for a pensioner aged 66 or over.  The personal rate of disability and unemployment benefit is increased from £25.30 to £31.65 and a married couple will receive £52.15 as against £41.70 at present.  Maternity allowance is also being increased to £31.65.  The maximum rate of death grant goes from £75 to £100.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also provides for increased occupational injuries benefits in line with the general increases in social insurance payments.</P>
    <P>Increases in social assistance payments and in the rates of children's allowances are provided in section 3 of the Bill.  The standard rate of non-contributory old age pension is being raised by £6.90 to £34.45 for persons aged under 80 years.  It will <Col N="362" /> go up to £36.95 for persons aged 80 or over.  The maximum rate of payment in respect of an adult dependant under 66 years of age is being increased by £3.45 to £17.30 bringing the overall maximum payment for a married couple to £51.75 and, where the pensioner is 80 years of age or over, to £54.25.  The allowance payable in respect of a prescribed relative looking after an incapacitated pensioner is being raised to £19.30.  The additional allowance payable to pensioners living alone is being increased to £2.70.</P>
    <P>The maximum weekly personal rate of widow's non-contributory pension is being increased from £27.05 to £33.80 where the widow is under age 66, from £27.55 to £34.45 where the widow is aged between 66 and 80 and from £29.55 to £36.95 where the widow is aged 80 or over.  The improvements in widows' pensions will automatically apply to the social assistance allowance for deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives.  Increases in the prescribed relative allowance and living alone allowance for persons over age 66, in line with those payable with non-contributory old age pensions, are also provided.  The social assistance allowance payable to single women aged between 58 and 66 is being increased by 25 per cent bringing the maximum rate of the allowance to £29.50.</P>
    <P>Unemployment assistance personal rates go up to £26.25 in urban areas and £25.45 elsewhere.  The rates for adult dependants are being increased to £18.95 and £18.50 respectively, so that the rate for a married couple will be £45.20 in an urban area and £43.95 elsewhere.  Small-holders with land under £20 valuation in certain disadvantaged areas whose means for unemployment assistance purposes are assessed notionally by reference to land valuation will also have their special rates of unemployment assistance increased by 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Recipients of supplementary welfare allowances will also get the benefit of a 25 per cent increase bringing the maximum rate of supplementary allowance for a married couple to £43.95 per week with additional payments for children.</P>
    <P>The increases for dependent children <Col N="363" /> of social welfare beneficiaries have been calculated in such a way that, taking account also of the increases in the general scheme of children's allowances, an increase of 25 per cent is provided in payments for children.</P>
    <P>The increase in children's allowance rates is also provided in section 3.  The present rates of allowance of £6 for the first child and £9 for each additional child are increased to £11.25 for each of the first five children and £17.50 for each subsequent child.  This will effectively mean an increase of some 45 per cent in those payments in the nine month period from April to December 1982.  On this occasion the increases in children's allowance will have effect from April instead of July but for administrative reasons the current rates will continue to apply until July when arrears from April will be paid. Additional orders will be included with the normal July children's allowances book issue to enable the increases due for the months of April&mdash;June to be paid retrospectively.  This will be done in conjunction with the July renewal of allowance books.</P>
    <P>The reduced rates of social assistance pensions and allowances payable where the weekly means exceed a certain amount are also, of course, being increased.  The application, in previous years, of uniform percentage increases to all reduced rates of pension resulted in a scale of means and pensions under which weekly pensions were reduced at one stage by £1.40 for every increase of £1 in means.  The reduction for each £1 increase in means is now £1.20 and this Bill provides in section 4 for the removal of this anomaly so as to ensure that reductions in pensions will be made in steps commensurate with increases in means. The abolition of this anomaly, at a cost of some £760,000, together with the increase in the rate of pension would have the effect of greatly stretching the scales of means and pensions to an extent that would make them far too cumbersome and complicated.  To avoid this, section 4 also provides that the steps of means in the tables will be increased from £1 to £2.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> Section 6 eases the means test for certain single parents by enabling them to increase their earnings without suffering a reduction in social assistance payments as a result.  At present the means test includes a provision, in the case of applicants with children, to disregard any earnings of the applicants up to £104 a year for each child.  The provision which I am now making is to increase the &ldquo;disregard&rdquo; to £312 a year for each child in the case of applicants for widow's non-contributory pension, deserted wife's allowance, social assistance allowance for unmarried mothers and prisoner's wife's allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for a particularly desirable extension of the prescribed relative allowance scheme to invalidity pensioners under age 66.  This allowance is at present payable as an increase of pension to incapacitated pensioners who need full-time care and attention and who are over 66 years of age.  An exception is made in the case of blind persons who may receive the allowance under that age.  Section 7 provides that the age limitation will also be abolished in the case of invalidity pensioners thus extending the allowance to those pensioners no matter what their age.</P>
    <P>Section 8 will remove an anomaly in the unemployment assistance scheme.  In order to qualify for unemployment assistance under existing legislation married women living apart from their husbands must have a child dependant, even though their position is analogous to that of a single woman who is subject to no such condition.  The removal of this anomaly will benefit a number of cases which have arisen.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention briefly two additional measures which I am introducing from April but which do not require to be provided for in legislation.  I am extending the free telephone rental scheme, which at present applies mainly to social welfare pensioners aged over 66, to eligible blind pensioners under 66.  I am also extending the free travel scheme to residents of the State who are in receipt of Northern Ireland or British invalidity pensions and who are under 66 years of age.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> Allowances payable under the Health Acts, such as disabled persons' maintenance allowance, infectious diseases maintenance allowances and blind welfare allowances are also being increased from April broadly in line with the increases in social welfare payments. For example, the maximum personal weekly rate of disabled persons maintenance allowance is being increased from £26.05 to £32.55, the rate for an adult dependant from £14.80 to £18.50 so that the rate for a married couple will be £51.05.</P>
    <P>In addition to what was provided for in the January budget I am pleased to be able to say that the Government have also decided to increase the domiciliary care allowance for handicapped children from £45 to £55 per month.  Also the mobility allowance which is payable to disabled persons will be increased from £200 to £250.  Finally, the capitation allowances which are payable to voluntary organisations for the vocational training of disabled persons will be increased.  Apart from recouping those organisations for their increased costs these additional payments will enable them to increase the allowances which they pay to their trainees.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the improvements which are coming into effect from April. As I said earlier, these measures, when taken together with the Government's decision to maintain food subsidies and remove the proposed 18 per cent VAT on footwear and clothing will significantly improve the situation of social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>In recent years recipients of long-term social welfare benefits have received double payments at Christmas.  On such occasions, however, on which temporary increases of this nature have been provided it has been necessary to introduce legislation.  Since it is already possible by regulation to provide for permanent increases in rates of payment it is anomalous that temporary increases, such as these double payments, cannot be provided in the same way.  I am accordingly providing in section 9 that the power to vary rates of payment by regulation will be extended to cover such temporary <Col N="366" /> increases.  This provision will give greater flexibility in relation to the time of year at which such increases can be provided in the future.  For instance this year I will be making a double payment for the child dependants of social welfare beneficiaries in September and December.  Statutory provision for these payments can be made by means of a regulation under this section.  It is particularly important to be able to do this in the case of the September payments because the Dáil and Seanad are unlikely to be sitting at that time.</P>
    <P>The only other provision made in the Bill is to amend a number of minor printing errors in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, which have come to light since its enactment.</P>
    <P>The overall cost in 1982 of the rates increases and other changes being provided for in this Bill is £230 million and this will bring overall expenditure on social welfare to approximately £1,565 million.  The cost to the Exchequer in 1982 of the increased expenditure will be approximately £128 million.  Some £102 million will be met by increases in social insurance contributions which are provided for in section 5 of the Bill together with the raising from £8,500 to £9,500 of the ceiling of earnings on which contributions are levied.  The raising of the ceiling will also lead to corresponding increases in the amount of pay-related benefit to employees.</P>
    <P>The increases in social insurance contributions allow for an Exchequer contribution of 25 per cent to the social insurance fund towards expenditure in 1982. The increase is 1.75 per cent for the employer and 1.75 per cent for the employee.  This brings the standard contribution for social insurance from 13.3 per cent to 16.8 per cent of which the employer will bear 11.3 per cent and the employee 5.5 per cent.  This is the same increase in PRSI rates as was proposed by the previous Government.  Proportionate increases are being provided in the rates of voluntary contributions. Reduced rates of contributions are payable under regulations in respect of certain employments, for example, pensionable public service employees and certain <Col N="367" /> share fishermen and outworkers.  These are not covered for all the benefits of the social insurance system and increases due in those rates will be made by regulation. The contribution increases will be effective from 6 April 1982.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures which I have just outlined will bring about a real improvement in the situation of social welfare recipients particularly when account is taken of the more sensitive budget strategy of this Government.  It is my intention to maintain the process of improvement.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to take the opportunity to mention briefly some areas which I consider to be in need of attention.  The social welfare code is a complex one.  In my previous term of office I was responsible for the enactment of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act which was a major contribution to the simplification of the system by bringing many complex legislative provisions together in the one Act.  It was always my intention to continue the review of various aspects of the social welfare code with a view to further rationalisation and removal of anomalies.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation of the means scales as provided for in section 4 of this Bill is an example.  It may be only a small step but the beneficiaries concerned will get an additional £760,000 as a result.  Details of the new means scales are being published in booklet form.  An example will help to illustrate the point.  Under existing provisions the maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension of £27.55 is payable to a pensioner with means assessed at £6 per week.  If his means were £8 per week his pension would be reduced by £2.40 to £25.15. Under the provisions in this Bill a pensioner in a similar situation would have his pension reduced from the new maximum of £34.45 to £32.45, a reduction of £2 only, whereas previously the reduction would have been £2.40.</P>
    <P>I am also looking at the consolidation of the very complex code of regulations which forms part of the social welfare system.  This is an area in which I am <Col N="368" /> satisfied that more worthwhile progress could be made.</P>
    <P>I also intend to review the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to ensure that everything possible is done to improve its operation and ensure that it fulfils its original objectives.  This scheme has been in operation for almost five years and is now in need of major review and improvement.  It is the one scheme which deals at the closest quarters with financial need at the most critical level. Of all the social welfare schemes it is the one which must operate most quickly and flexibly to meet needs as they arise.</P>
    <P>My immediate task, however, is to have this Bill put through as quickly as possible so as to allow for the implementation of the improvements which it contains. The first of these improvements in payments takes effect from 31 March so the matter is urgent.  I commend the Bill to Seanad Eireann and ask Senators to give it speedy and favourable consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Social Welfare Bills are rarely the subject of contentious debate in this House or in the other House.  On this occasion we have a Bill, the substance and the detail of which are common ground between this Government and the previous Government.  This is a healthy thing.  While we all share the general objective of easing the burden on the social welfare classes, it is a good thing that we are of one mind as to what are the most urgent things to be done in this regard and the things which are possible to be done at present.  There are some features here which are very welcome. We have had increases of 25 per cent in social welfare benefits before, but these were mainly confined to the basic rates.  Here we have increases in the supplementary benefits as well.  This is a good thing and I hope it will be a feature of all social welfare legislation in the future.  We have agreement on the easing of the means test and on the removal of certain anomalies.  These are the main provisions the Bill contains, besides the pay-related contributions and certain other minor improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that there remain many other <Col N="369" /> anomalies in our social welfare system. There are also instances in which the social welfare system is abused and this can be particularly true in certain cases in regard to pay-related benefits.  These anomalies and abuses certainly must be tackled.  Today we have before us, as the Minister has said, at short notice and as a matter of urgency, a Bill with the particularly narrow scope of giving effect to the social welfare provisions not just of the budget of this week but of the budget of last January also.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has agreed, we still have a great deal of work to do to remove anomalies, but this is work for another day.  Last year we had a Consolidation Bill.  Later in that year we had two Social Welfare Bills.  We now have another Social Welfare Bill, and may well have a Social Welfare (No.2) Bill in 1982.  I hope some Minister will be back here to deal with some of the very urgent problems we have.</P>
    <P>There is one point I should like to refer to in this regard, that is, that, having had a Consolidation Bill in 1981, we find ourselves, less than a year later, already building up legislation by reference.  If we look at section 2 of this Bill it is difficult to refer back from that section to the Consolidation Act which is the principal Act.  I would commend to the Minister that he give earnest consideration to a point that has been raised many times in this House.  It was raised many times by Senator Eoin Ryan, Leader of the Seanad, that is that there are certain types of legislation in respect of which we should not consider ourselves bound by the centuries old tradition that we have Consolidation Bills or Amendment Bills only.  There is no reason why we could not take the Consolidation Act of last year and, when we make the amendments, we insert these, so that we then have a single Social Welfare Act which contains all the information.</P>
    <P>Perhaps some of my colleagues may feel that if we do this with Bills we make them all too readily understandable to the layman.  Our learned friends in this House may think that that is not an appropriate thing.  But for the practising politician, for the member of the public <Col N="370" /> who wishes to understand what is the situation, this is something that should be done.  While I am urging that the Minister should come back as soon as possible with a Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill to remove the many remaining anomalies, I suggest that when he does he give serious consideration to this question of being able to produce a Bill which will be a merging of the Consolidation Bill of 1981 and the new Bill which removes these anomalies.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be profitable for us this afternoon to discuss, as it were, our favourite anomaly in regard to the social welfare code.  Everybody probably has a favourite anomaly because there are so many of them.  It might well be a matter that we could discuss by motion in the Seanad in the course of the next few months.  If we did bring forward a motion of this type it might be helpful to the Minister in the preparation of legislation which he indicated to us he has in mind towards the end of his introductory speech.</P>
    <P>Therefore I shall confine myself to what is in the Bill and raise just a few points.  They may be so simple that the Minister can give me an immediate answer and, if not, they can be pursued further on Committee Stage.  When I look at section 2 I wonder why it is necessary to deal with the basic rate of payments in subsection (1), while it takes us another ten subsections to deal with the supplementary benefits.  I would pose the question to the Minister: would he not be giving us a cleaner Bill, a more understandable Bill, if it were to be drafted with a single subsection which amends the Schedule?  As far as I can see all we are concerned with here are the amendments of Schedules.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 5 I have a point I should like to raise.  We normally express gratitude to Ministers for providing us with an Explanatory Memorandum and I thank him for the one he has given us here.  But I am afraid I found it misleading. I should like to ask the Minister if, towards the end of page 2, under the heading of Widow's (Contributory) Pension, the memorandum is correct, or if there is a misprint there.  It seems to me <Col N="371" /> that the group between the ages 66 to 79 are completely omitted.  The explanatory memorandum has given us a table with two categories only whereas, as far as I am aware &mdash; and the Bill tends to confirm me in this opinion &mdash; there are three age categories in this regard.  One finds a discrepancy also in regard to pay-related benefit in section 5 of the Bill where the new employer's contribution is given as 11.3 per cent and, on page 4 of the explanatory memorandum, as 11.6 per cent.  I mention these points because perhaps there are some differences in what has been spoken about in the explanatory memorandum and in the Bill.  If so it is not clear on the face of either of them what are these differences.  I should be glad if the Minister could clarify this point.</P>
    <P>The only other point I wish to raise is on section 9, not in regard to its substance, with which I agree, but in regard to the way it is expressed, that is that this allows for temporary increases.  Having put in temporary increase, I should like to ask the Minister why he maintains, in his new subsection (1) of section 308 of the Principal Act the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo;, when subsection (2) of section 308 of the Principal Act tells us that decreases are not possible.  I should like to know why we need to have the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo;, why we could not refer to increases, the two things concerned being temporary increases and permanent increases. These are some minor points I should like the Minister to clarify.</P>
    <P>Naturally I welcome the Bill.  The Minister has said that the Bill comes to us at a time which is different.  It went to the Dáil immediately before the budget and to us after the budget, whereas, in the past, it has been the practice for these Bills to come well after the budget.  This leads me to say to the Minister that I know there may well be a temptation for the new Government to turn their backs on many of the things spoken of by their predecessors.  But I would urge the Minister and his colleagues to give serious consideration to the White Paper discussion document produced by the previous Minister for Finance in regard to the <Col N="372" /> restructuring of the manner of the handling of our financial business.  Rather than looking at what is happening now as an anomaly, after which we should revert to the former situation of everything emerging on budget day, the Government should not dismiss what has been said in that regard.</P>
    <P>Finally I should say that I not only welcome the Bill, but welcome the Minister to this House and shall welcome him heartily when he comes along again for a discussion of what are the views of Senators in regard to the anomalies in the code, and, of course, welcome him most heartily when he returns with a Bill to clear up most of those anomalies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I also welcome the Minister's return to this House as Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>As Senator Dooge said, this Bill will be welcomed by both sides of the House but it is only fair to point out that there are additional benefits proposed in this Bill beyond what was originally proposed by the former Coalition Government.  As the Senator pointed out, all of us have our own special hobby-horse with regard to social welfare and he suggested that perhaps we would leave our hobbyhorses behind us for some time.  At the same time I should like to refer to two or three points in the Bill that I welcome as a politician at local and national level and to refer in particular to benefits that will help women and children.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increases in children's allowances as announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget and by the Minister here.  These increases will not come into operation until July for administrative reasons, but they will be backdated to April.  This is most welcome. Under previous Governments people have had to wait for months for benefits; they will still have to wait but now they will get payment in bulk retrospectively.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement with regard to unemployment assistance for separated married women.  Discrimination against women in the social welfare code has been the subject of much agitation and debate in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> There is an active campaigning group at the moment who, quite correctly, have identified areas of discrimination and have set out to remedy them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still discriminatory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to continue without interruption.  I regard this measure by the Minister as an important step forward in easing anomalies and eventually in abolishing them entirely which we will have have to do in any event by 1984 under EEC legislation. I know that we had the commitment of the Minister to take all necessary measures to eliminate them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increase in the domiciliary care allowance for handicapped children from £45 to £55 per month.  This is an issue in every area of the country.  To give this help is a practical manifestation of a caring Government and a caring society.  In his statement the Minister said he was especially perturbed about the operation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  He stated:</P>
      <P>It is the one scheme which deals at the closest quarters with financial need at the most critical level.  Of all the social welfare schemes it is the one which must operate most quickly and flexibly to meet needs as they arise.</P>
      <P>All politicians have come across these cases.  They have been brought to our doors at all hours of the day and night by people desperately in need.  The supplementary allowance scheme has been identified as one that needs to be looked at again to ensure greater speed and flexibility in its operation.</P>
      <P>This Bill is most welcome.  It shows the commitment of the Government towards the equitable distribution of resources to meet the needs of all sections of the population. I welcome the Bill and I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with the two previous speakers in welcoming the Minister to the House and to congratulate him on his reappointment to what is a very important social ministry.  When the <Col N="374" /> Minister's predecessor attended in this House to present to us improvements in Christmas payments she was requested by all sides to ensure that the Department of Social Welfare would have a human face in dealing with people.  Under the present Minister's guiding hand in the past there were problems in the Department, particularly regarding payment of what were the entitlements of people.  No longer should social welfare recipients be regarded as parasites by society.  Sister Stanislaus is on record as saying that people in the lower income groups or those who have no income are entitled as of right to benefits because many of them have contributed during their years of employment and because of their present circumstances are entitled to them as of right.  These people should not have to make representations to the Department through Deputies, Senators or local representatives but should receive their payments promptly and efficiently.  I am sure the Minister will agree that on his re-entry to the Department he found improvements as a result of pressure we put on his predecessor to ensure that the Department would function efficiently. In his speech the Minister mentioned various improvements which we welcome. They were initiated by the previous Government and I am glad they have been continued by this Government.  All of us welcome the increases across the board for social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are anomolies, particularly with regard to the prescribed relative allowance. To benefit under this scheme a person must give up gainful employment to look after a relative.  No compensation by the State is equal to what a prescribed relative will lose as a result of giving up work to look after an elderly person.  The cost to the State of keeping a person in hospital, whether geriatric, psychiatric or other institution, is colossal.  The Department should take this into consideration. I would also point out that some people are not able to obtain gainful employment because of a commitment to look after their parents or old relatives.  The home help scheme precludes direct relatives, particularly married daughters, from benefiting.  There is no point in saying <Col N="375" /> the scheme will be abused.  Most people are anxious if at all possible to look after old relatives rather than put them into an institution and they should be helped to do this.  I am a member of a health board and this problem keeps cropping up.  People who look after elderly relatives save the State an enormous amount of money and should be given every help and encouragement.</P>
    <P>You have mentioned many of the good things you are doing in this Bill but I am disappointed you have not continued to reduce the qualifying age for old age pensions and supplementary welfare allowances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair does not wish to interrupt the Senator but must point out that he should refer to the Minister by title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies.  I am disappointed that the qualifying age has not been reduced progressively.  It was regarded as a very welcome step when the qualifying age was first reduced.  For four consecutive years it was reduced but it is still at 66 years.  I hope there will be a commitment by the Minister to continue this process.</P>
      <P>The Minister claimed credit for the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act.  This was an Act that threw up quite a few anomalies such as that which came to light in the case of Clover Meats in Waterford.  In that regard I would like to compliment all the politicians of all the parties &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and Sinn Fein The Workers Party &mdash; for bringing this anomaly to the attention of the Government.  In that case people were precluded from drawing what would normally be their entitlement.  I must compliment the firm involved for having come to the rescue of the Government in ensuring that they paid the workers, but the Government now have to bring in some kind of amending order to repay the company.  Any legislation that needs that kind of tricking about with is bad legislation and it is a pity that the anomaly in question was allowed to remain when the legislation was being consolidated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> Another anomaly about which I hear quite a lot of complaints is the fact that PAYE is taken off people's wages when it includes the proportion of PRSI &mdash; in other words, the PAYE worker who is paying more than his fair share to the running of the State is now faced with the dilemma of paying PAYE on the PRSI element of his pay packet.  This is something which will have to be looked at.  It may be that when the PRSI legislation was being enacted, this was taken into account, but many workers cannot understand why they pay tax on some money they never get.  That situation should end as quickly as possible; otherwise people in the PAYE bracket will be totally discontented with the implementation of legislation which is discriminatory towards them.</P>
    <P>We are glad to hear from the Minister that he intends to have as a norm a double payment for special categories of people particularly at Christmas and indeed in the months preceding Christmas.  I am loath to give a Minister powers to do many things without coming back to the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; and we have seen quite a lot of that in our time.  However, I would welcome in this particular area the right of the Minister without reference to the Houses of Parliament to make a double payment to people in the social welfare bracket.  They deserve this and they should not have to wait for any of us as legislators to ensure that their special needs are taken into consideration. That would be a welcome feature in any Bill and I commend the Minister for including that power to himself.</P>
    <P>I welcome in general terms the introduction of this Social Welfare Bill, 1982. There are some anomalies in it but we are in the invidious situation today of not being able to put down amendments to the Bill.  But there are anomalies and no doubt other Members of the House will bring these to the attention of the Minister so that at a future date in a future Social Welfare Bill he will take account of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to congratulate Deputy Michael Woods on being appointed again as Minister for <Col N="377" /> Health and Minister for Social Welfare. When the provisions of this Bill become effective the social welfare expenditure facing us over the year ahead will, as the Minister said, exceed £1,500 million.  I want to make a few general remarks on one major component of that enormous figure and on how that component might be reduced.  I am referring, of course, to the provision that has to be made under present conditions for unemployment.</P>
      <P>Of the £1,500 million I understand that we will be laying out, from the Exchequer and from the Social Insurance Fund, about £350 million in compensation to those out of work.  Even making a liberal allowance for a hard core of unfortunate persons who are unfit for work, there must still be some £250 million going to persons, and predominantly to men, who are well able to work but for whom we fail to organise it.  I have on several occasions expressed disappointment that this should be the position in a country where on all sides there is useful work crying out to be done, work of community benefit in repairing and improving roads, removing eyesores and so on.  I was reminded of this recently when I experienced the disgraceful condition of the roads in and about two towns &mdash; Ballina and Charlestown &mdash; which happen to be very near a famous airport development project in the west.  When I spoke on the Appropriation Act motion on 20 January last, I described this situation, that is, compensating for involuntary idleness when acute community needs abound, as a reflection on our organisational capacity.  I suggested that units of infrastructural work should be identified and specified which would be open to competitive contract by workers' co-operatives as well as by private enterprise and on which those who would be otherwise unemployed could be engaged, even for periods at a time, at standard rates of pay, thus reducing the number on the live register.  I would like to see new and more efficient ways adopted of tackling our infrastructural deficiencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I again express the hope that, with the ready co-operation of local authorities, the Youth Employment Agency will undertake practical initiatives of this <Col N="378" /> kind?  We cannot afford to be smugly satisfied about the increased compensation offered from time to time to the unemployed when many of them could be working in dignity for society's and their own benefit if we managed our affairs better.  Apart from being liberal about increases in social welfare benefits, our efforts must go towards reducing at least the component of unemployment relief in our social welfare outlay.</P>
    <P>Since unemployment is our major social ill it is understandable that we should concentrate on job creation as a policy objective.  I will not repeat the fairly comprehensive comments I made on this topic on 20 January last.  While we can, as I have suggested earlier, do something to provide useful work directly &mdash; and I would not object in any way to the specific increases for housing and roads in yesterday's budget &mdash; I would emphasise the serious risk inherent in any general policy of going for employment at all costs.  A direct frontal assault is not the right way.  What we need are self-sustaining jobs which add to the national production. Creating jobs in the public sector which taxpayers have to support is not the answer.  We have relied too much on this already.  Between 1965 and 1981, for instance, while total employment increased by 72,000, public sector employment increased by 108,000, employment in private sector industry and services by 89,000 and agricultural employment declined by 125,000.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Government reaffirmed yesterday its intention to have an effective plan to increase output and employment. That sort of plan, in the sense of a coherent and widely agreed set of policies to operate over a period of years is, of course, essential.  These policies must be concerned with reducing inflation, improving productivity, protecting and enlarging competitiveness, increasing productive investment, getting better returns from it, moving up scale in product design and added value.  These, I would emphasise, are the essential, if indirect, ingredients of a successful policy of job creation and it is the lack of them <Col N="379" /> at present that is such a source of worry to the IDA and to all of us.</P>
    <P>To conclude, my main point is that the objective that logically precedes the job creation objective is that of producing more goods and services competitively for sale at home and abroad.  In other words, our primary policy aim should be defined as competitiveness rather than job creation.  If we seek competitiveness first and achieve it, the great boon of new and secure employment will be added.  If we show an over-protective concern for less efficient industries, if we do not insist on an economic return from new and existing enterprises, if we do not progressively wind down our excessive budgetary and external deficits and our high rates of cost and price inflation, we shall be confronted with darker prospects on the employment front and, indeed, with social welfare obligations we might no longer be able to carry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I congratulate the Minister on the resumption of his old portfolio and welcome him into this House?  Such is the uncertainty of the times that one might not get a second chance to do so.</P>
      <P>I will speak very briefly to welcome the Bill.  As Senator Ferris pointed out, the people who are going to benefit by this Bill are entitled to these benefits.  It is what society has to do for those who are less fortunate and in particular the increase in the unemployment benefits is the kind of conscience money which a defective social and economic system has to provide when it fails to provide a productive living for them.  There are, of course, abuses in the system, in the unemployment assistance and benefits system and, as Senator Whitaker has suggested, an imaginative Government might well divert many of the unemployed into the basic work of building up infrastructure.  But for all that there remains the unfortunate miserable unemployed whose unemployment is no fault of their own and their indignity and misery have to be in some way redressed.  For those reasons no-one can but welcome this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> The Minister is right in saying &mdash; it is not simply a point of historical propaganda &mdash; in his statement that &ldquo;Fianna Fáil Governments have always been conscious of the need to provide a satisfactory level of welfare services even in times of economic recession.&rdquo;  Indeed, that is one of the explanations of their strength and durability as the major governing party in this State.  This, of course, was not always from the most altruistic of reasons, but from the very beginning part of the popular success of Fianna Fáil was their recognition that social welfare had to be initiated by them in the 1930s.  It is quite true that the first Fianna Fáil administration brought in a regime of social welfare which was more liberal and imaginative than anything outside the New Deal in America.</P>
    <P>I am rarely given these days to praising Fianna Fáil but that claim is historically true.  The present provisions and the decision not to go ahead with the removal of the food subsidies and the imposition on footwear is not only politic but humane.  By the same token, I sometimes think that the other crowd do not change very much either.  We had in the late twenties the same astonishing combination of probity in the public finances with a mind-boggling disregard for popularity. Fine Gael in 1981-82 seem to have the same death wish as they had in the late twenties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and have little to say about the substance of it except to take up something that Senator O'Rourke said.  She seemed to be satisfied with section 8 which she seemed to think of as being sufficient to rectify the anomalies in the treatment of women in the whole social welfare code.  No doubt Senator Robinson will deal with this more fully.  I want to say that I am far from being a frantic feminist but the way in which women are discriminated against in the social welfare code is not simply an affront to women; it is an affront to humanity.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of dependency in the social welfare code implies indignity and subordination.  It is not so simple a question as dealing with section 8 and remedying that anomaly; I think the Minister <Col N="381" /> would be well advised to anticipate the demands of the very effective lobby group, a very laudable lobby group who are at the moment quite active and who are campaigning for a unified social welfare code.  They point our facts which are not always well known.  It is one of the cases where the Minister might like to continue the crusading spirit perhaps of the previous Government in that the information available to the public about these anomalies is very scanty.  As Daniel O'Connell said long ago in regard to people: &lsquo;They do not know their wrongs.&rsquo; Not everyone realises that a married woman's unemployment benefit lasts three weeks less than that for a man or single woman.  There can be no possible justification for this anomaly.  There is also the fact that most deciding officers would turn down married women for unemployment benefit on the grounds that they are not available for work because they have children, even though they have worked for many years before claiming benefit and have paid social insurance contributions at the same rate as everyone else.</P>
    <P>It is not just piecemeal rectification that is needed here: there must be an almost constitutional reappraisal of the position of women in society.  Indeed, it is one more argument for a constitutional review on the definition for the first time of the concept of family, for example. There is plenty of crusading work for the Minister and I genuinely believe that he is a crusading Minister.  I suggest to him, for example, that the whole complicated network of the social welfare code should be looked at <i>de novo.</i> Simplification would result in economies in administrations; that is quite obvious.  The position as it stands at the moment, however, should be explained constantly to the people by way of an educational campaign on radio and television.  There is no reason why the Health Education Bureau idea, which we see from time to time being availed of to discourage smoking, for example, should not extend to giving information about the complications of the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>Is it not extraordinary that Deputies, in particular, are not more active and <Col N="382" /> aggressive about the anomalies in the code?  Is it not extraordinary that they are not pushing for the kind of reform for which women in that particular lobby group campaign &mdash; for a unified social welfare code?  It should not be necessary for women to campaign in this way.  This is what Deputies are for, after all &mdash; to bring about reforms in the law, or is it that the present system of inequality suits their view of themselves as Deputies?</P>

      <P>As is customary, I would like to join in the welcome to the Minister on his first visit to the House since his recent appointment.  However, I have to signal at this stage that there is one section of the Bill on which, because it continues the discrimination in our social welfare code, I will have to take a stand.  I had in advance, so as not to hold up the House on Committee Stage, tabled an amendment to section 8, on which Senator Murphy rightly anticipated I will be making fairly lengthy submissions. That amendment would have deleted the provisions that are proposed to be substituted in the Bill.  I understand, from a letter I received from the Cathaoirleach, that that amendment would not be in order because it would be a potential charge on the public purse and because, as it would be intended to, it would increase the possible categories of married women eligible to apply for unemployment assistance.  Therefore, I am in a position where I am not able to put down an amendment to section 8, but I propose to oppose section 8 and to call <Col N="383" /> a vote opposing it.  The reason I propose to do this is that, although it looks like a removal of a discrimination, it is tinkering around with and modifying the discrimination and not abolishing it.  For that reason, I was truly surprised, as was Senator Murphy, that Senator O'Rourke got up to refer particularly to section 8 and to praise it as a measure.  I regret this, becaue either the position has not been fully understood by Senator O'Rourke, or else she is satisfied with much less than I would be satisfied with. It is a pity, because she is in a better position to influence what will happen in relation to this section.  I would hope that, when we come to vote on it and Senator O'Rourke will have had an opportunity to reflect on the precise change proposed and the position that will result from the nature of the change, she will realise that it is still discriminatory against married women.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Senator when she points out that we are bound under the EEC Directive to remove all these discriminations by December 1984.  But surely, when we have a section of a Bill before us that is proposing to remove a discrimination, we should remove it and not tinker around with it and fiddle with it and reintroduce a different kind of discrimination against married women in ascertaining whether they will be eligible for unemployment assistance.  Because the section does not appear to have had the scrutiny which it warrants in that regard, perhaps it is necessary to explain in some detail the cost of the proposed section 8 and what the result will be.  I want to refer to the Principal Act and, first of all, explain the present discrimination against married women in access to unemployment assistance and, secondly, what the discrimination will be if this section were to go through unamended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since it is a half step, it may seem strange that someone in favour of the removal of the discrimination would oppose a section that is going a half step. However, as I have explained, if it is opposed in this House the Bill has to go back to the Dáil and it is in the Dáil that <Col N="384" /> there is authority to move a proper amendment and remove the discrimination entirely.  It is for this purpose that I will be seeking to have a vote taken on Committee Stage on that section.</P>
    <P>The proposal in section 8 of this Bill is to amend, by substitution, section 136 (3) of the Principal Act and the Principal Act is the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  If we look at section 136 (3) (d) as it stands at the moment, we see that it provides particular conditions that apply only to married women, which are conditions they must satisfy if they are to be eligible for a qualification certificate for unemployment assistance.  They do not apply to a single woman; they do not apply to a single man; they do not apply to a married man; they apply only to a married woman.  These conditions, as they stand at the moment in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, are as follows: For a married woman to get a qualification certificate she must satisfy all the other criteria, naturally, and, in addition, under subsection (3), paragraph (d) of section 136 in the case of a married woman either (i), that her husband is a dependant of her or, (ii), that neither she nor her husband is a dependant of the other and she has one or more dependants.  The fascinating thing about that section as it stands &mdash; and it is also true of the amendment proposed in section 8 &mdash; is that the word &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; each time it is used means something different.  Normally, when we use the word &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; in a dictionary sense we mean somebody dependent on somebody else, a child dependent on its parents, an adult dependent because of age or infirmity.  Interestingly, the word &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; in this section has been defined differently, depending on whom you are referring to as the dependant. That is a vital point to grasp in understanding, first of all, the extent of the discrimination against married women and, secondly, in understanding why this section 8 does not remove that discrimination but only modifies it slightly.  This is a very vital point in urging upon this House the need to remove altogether this special unique criterion that applies only to married women.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> Taking the first of these conditions that a married woman would have to satisfy &mdash; she would have to satisfy the deciding officer that her husband is a dependant of her, but in order to understand that we have to go back to section 2 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  In section 2 we find that there is a definition of what is meant by &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; and, as I say, it varies depending on whether we are talking about a husband or a wife.  Here we are talking about a husband.  For a husband to be dependent &mdash; it is not dependent in the financial sense that we might think it was; it has a particular technical, legal meaning and in section 2 (1) it is provided:</P>
    <P>In this Act, save where the context otherwise requires &mdash;&ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; means, in relation to any person &mdash;....</P>
    <P>(b)  a husband who is incapable of self-support by reason of some physical or mental infirmity and who is being wholly or mainly maintained by his wife,</P>
    <P>For a husband to be a dependant it is not enough that he be unemployed; he must suffer from some physical or mental infirmity that makes him incapable of work, incapable of self-support, and he must also be wholly or mainly maintained by his wife.  That is the technical meaning of dependant when we apply it to a husband.</P>
    <P>For a married woman to be eligible for unemployment assistance she would have to prove that she has a husband who is physically or mentally incapable of work and that she is wholly or partially maintaining him and then she would satisfy, or she has an alternative way of satisfying. Under the second category neither she nor her husband is a dependant of the other and she has one or more dependants. We have again the word &ldquo;dependant&rdquo;. If neither she nor her husband is a dependant of each other, for example if they are living separately, then she has to show that she has a dependant.  Presumably it could be an adult dependant in the circumstances I was describing or it could be a child dependant.  Here the <Col N="386" /> word &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; is defined.  It is defined also in section 2 of the consolidation Act.  In the case of a child it is a child who is residing with the person, so that a woman could not claim that her child was a dependant of hers if, for example, he came to her every day and she looked after him during the day time, perhaps paid for his lunch, collected him from school and then brought him back to her husband where he is residing: that child would not be a dependant of hers. Nobody else has to establish that he or she has a dependant.  Single women, married men or single men do not have to establish that they have dependants in order to apply for unemployment assistance. That is the law as it stands.</P>
    <P>Section 136 (3) (d) does not seem serious until you understand the definition of the word &ldquo;dependant&rdquo;.  Under section 8 of this Bill it is proposed to delete the existing paragraph subsection (3) (d) of section 136 and substitute a new paragraph (d).  That new paragraph (d) still singles out a married woman for exceptional treatment in relation to qualifying for unemployment assistance.  Despite all the talk about equal pay and rights of workers and no discrimination in pay and no discrimination in access to training or jobs, we are still in March 1982 seeking to introduce a special kind of additional barrier for a working married woman who wishes to apply for unemployment assistance.  The nature of the barrier does not look too bad if you are just looking at the wording and are not aware of the technical legal definition of &ldquo;dependant&rdquo;.  The change would be, in the case of a married woman, that her husband &ldquo;is a dependant of her&rdquo;.  If she can establish that, she can apply for unemployment assistance.  That still refers back to the definition of &ldquo;dependant&rdquo; when we are talking about a husband under section 2 of the 1981 Act. The definition of dependant would be governed by it because we are substituting a section into the consolidation Act and, therefore, it is governed by the definition section.</P>
    <P>If we are looking at that provision in section 8 of this Bill, when we look at the phrase &ldquo;that her husband is a dependant <Col N="387" /> of her&rdquo; what we mean is that her husband is incapable of self-support by reason of some physical or mental infirmity and is being wholly or mainly maintained by his wife.  I submit that that narrows very substantially the wording and makes the barrier to a married woman a much more formidable one, because, if the husband was a student and the wife had been working and would wish to continue to work and went along to the unemployment exchange and was willing to indicate what kind of work she would be available for, and willing to clock on like any other worker, she would not be able to do so.  Although her husband would be a student and not therefore having any income he would not be dependent on her.  He might seem to be dependent on her to those of us who looked at that relationship between husband and wife because she would be the earner and as somebody out of work she would be getting unemployment assistance, but she would not be eligible under this section we are supposed to be introducing as a major reform, if Senator O'Rourke is to be believed.  The position is that that wife would be told that her husband was not dependent on her because it had not been established that he was mentally or physically incapable of work and therefore she would not qualify.</P>
    <P>We come to the second possible way in which a married woman under this new section of this Bill could make herself ineligible for a qualifying certificate for unemployment assistance, that is that she is not a dependant of her husband.  That seems very straightforward but we have got to remember how &ldquo;dependent&rdquo; is defined when it refers to a wife.  That is completely different, because dependency when it comes to a married woman is an extraordinarily discriminatory concept. I say that as a married woman.  I resent totally the legal definition of a married woman as contained in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  I am sure that Senator O'Rourke would resent it if she addressed her mind to it.  I am sure that all other married women in the country would resent it if they addressed their minds to it because under section 2 <Col N="388" /> of the Consolidation Act of 1981 a wife who is living with or being wholly or mainly maintained by her husband is dependent on him.</P>
    <P>I am dependent on my husband according to the law, so is Senator O'Rourke, and so is every other married woman in the country who is living with her husband, regardless of whether she is working, of whether she has a job of her own, or whether she is the breadwinner of the family.  If a woman is working and earning the income and her husband is a student and has no income she is dependent on him and he is not dependent on her. That is the law of the land and for some strange and wonderful reason we seem to be prepared to leave that as the law of the land.  It is not good enough to suggest that section 8 is any kind of a reasonable reform.  It is not.  There is a clear way in which to remove the discrimination and that is to remove it.  Why should a married woman be in a different position as a worker who becomes unemployed? Why should she have a particular barrier to being eligible for a qualifying certificate for unemployment assistance?  We will not be able to have that barrier when the EEC insist that we change it by December 1984.  Surely under our own laws we can address ourselves to the problem and change it?</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss a potential other dimension of the problem and that is the possibility that this particular provision in the 1981 Act and in this Bill may be unconstitutional.  I find myself in a strange, rather paradoxical position in that I was in court this morning on a potential dispute raising the constitutionality. That matter is still to be heard before the courts and, for various reasons including the fact that I am a practitioner involved in that case, I do not wish to discuss the issue at all.  I am more inhibited than if there was not a case because I would feel that it is relevant to discuss the compatability with the Constitution of this kind of discrimination.  Merely on grounds of introducing reform and removing discrimination, how can we purport to remove a discrimination when we leave such a flagrant discrimination <Col N="389" /> on the Statute Book and reinforce it by this section of the Social Welfare Bill?</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was interested in reform of our social welfare code, that he would be looking into this and that he was interested in removing anomalies. Here is an anomaly and we have the possibility of removing it.  We can remove it without any prejudice to the time for this Bill to come into effect.  Like every other Senator in the House I am very anxious that this legislation giving the 25 per cent increase and some other benefits to recipients would come in at the date required.  It is possible for this House to amend by deleting that section and for the Dáil to bring in the amendment which I would like to see, which is the removal of the discrimination in the Consolidation Act, and then we can pass it.  We could meet specially to do it on Monday.  Both Houses could pass the Bill, as amended, on Monday and that would remove the discrimination.  It is, as I have indicated, a matter which I propose to press on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There are also one or two other matters in the Bill.  First of all, we ought, when noting and approving the increase of 25 per cent on social welfare benefits and allowances, to be aware, as was so forcefully put by Sister Stanislaus on television the other night, that 25 per cent of a very low income is not a great benefit.  It may be that it is marginally ahead of the cost of living but the problem of poverty in Ireland is that the rates are already very low.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech provided helpful tables at the end to show us what a widow with three children, an unmarried mother with her child or children, a deserted wife or a pensioner would be living on.  These are extremely low incomes given the very high inflation rate, the high cost of living, the high cost of energy, heating, light and so on.  As well as looking at anomalies in the social welfare code it is time we addressed ourselves to the very substantial difference in income and living standards between the average industrial wage and social welfare, whether it is benefit or allowance. That is an indictment of our society.</P>
    <P>We have two broad classes of people. <Col N="390" /> those on welfare who are on far too low a level of income and those of us who are fortunate enough to have jobs and, therefore, to have a completely different range of income.  We need to look very carefully at that, particularly in view of the fact that we already have a very high unemployment rate and that it is unlikely, under present circumstances, that there will be any early change in that rate.  I do not want to sound begrudging in the matter. I obviously welcome a 25 per cent increase.  I acknowledge that this was the increase which the Coalition Government were committed to but we must not give ourselves too big a pat on the back because it will not bring much comfort or much luxury to those on social welfare incomes.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to section 6 which the Minister in his speech referred to under the heading of single parents.  He said:</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill eases the means test for certain single parents by enabling them to increase their earnings without suffering a reduction in social assistance payments as a result. At present the means test includes a provision, in the case of applicants with children, to disregard any earnings of the applicant up to £104 a year for each child.</P>
    <P>That is £2 a week for each child.  The provision of section 6, as outlined by the Minister in his speech, would be that this would be increased to a disregard of £312 a year for each child, that is £6 a week for each child.  That is an improvement. I do not think it will make anybody very wealthy but it is a decided improvement.</P>
    <P>My difficulty is &mdash; it may be that it is just a very complex provision of the Consolidation Act &mdash; that as I have looked at section 6 which amends Rule 1 (4), of the Third Schedule, it is not clear to me that the amendment extends to single mothers, deserted wives and so on.  The reason is that the only change that is made in Rule 1 (4) of the Third Schedule is the inclusion of the part that is in brackets there &mdash;&ldquo;or for the purposes of widows' (non-contributory) pension, £312&rdquo;. It may be that &ldquo;widows' non-contributory pension&rdquo; is a code for the other allowances <Col N="391" /> but they are not expressly amended.  I would be concerned if this improvement in the calculation of means only applied to widows.  It is a Committee point but since the Minister is under pressure and has asked us to deal with this Bill as speedily as possible, I ask him to indicate in his reply whether I have misunderstood the nature of that amendment and whether it does what he outlined in his speech and indeed as indicated in the explanatory memorandum provided with the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a more significant anomaly that applies to unmarried mothers, that is, that they are the unique category of social welfare recipients who have only one category that they can qualify for. There is only the unmarried mother's allowance.  I know the Minister is aware of this problem because representations have been made to him for a number of years by Cherish and they were also made to Deputy Eileen Desmond when she was Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to know why this discrimination is continuing.  It means that any single mother who has worked for years as an insured employee, who has paid her contributions and who then becomes an unmarried mother, cannot qualify for a welfare benefit.  She can only qualify for an allowance.  This makes a difference in many ways.  If there were a total reform of our social welfare code one could argue that there should not be any difference between the benefits to which a contribution is made and the allowances to which no contribution is made.  If we are drawing that distinction in relation to widows, deserted wives and pensions, let us also draw it in relation to those mothers who contributed as workers and who, therefore, ought to be able to avail of the higher rate.</P>
    <P>With the assistance of the tables provided by the Minister at the end of his introductory speech, we can see that the difference would be quite significant for a single mother with one child.  Under the proposed rate in this Bill a single mother getting the unmarried mother's allowance, which includes in it one child, would get £42.60 but if she was getting <Col N="392" /> unmarried mother's benefit at the benefit rate she would be getting £47.50.  That is a significant difference week by week for the particular mother and a recognition that as a worker she had been making her contributions and that she was as much entitled to benefit as any other worker.</P>
    <P>That is an unjustifiable discrimination in the existing code; it is probably not one that can be amended at this stage in this Bill because there is no section dealing with it.  I urge the Minister, who has had ample representations, who has had written and oral requests from Cherish for a number of years, to address himself speedily to correcting this anomaly and to putting the single mother on a par with other single parents, and with the widow and the deserted wife, in relation to being entitled to benefit.  Indeed it is curious that in a number of cases &mdash; I am not disagreeing with this &mdash; a wife or a widow will be drawing the benefit rate because of the fact that it was the husband who was the insured worker but in the case of the unmarried mother, she is the insured worker and yet she gets no benefit for the contributions she has made.  The only thing she can qualify for is the allowance.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a final point on the broader indication by the Minister at the end of his speech that he is particularly concerned about reviewing and reforming the social welfare code, could I ask him to indicate in his reply when the regulations under the 1981 Act may be issued?  At the moment, although the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act was passed in February 1981 we are still operating under the regulations as published in a statutory instrument in 1934, the Unemployment Assistance Qualification Certificate (Regulations) Order 1934, as amended by the Unemployment Assistance Qualifications Certificate (Regulations) (Amendment) Order 1962, in relation to unemployment assistance. Similarly in relation to supplementary welfare and all the other various categories the regulations and the forms to be filled in are all under the old law and therefore under the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>I am very sympathetic to the problems involved in consolidating the regulations. <Col N="393" /> Whatever the difficulty of consolidating the Bill, consolidating the regulations is an even more formidable task.  I am asking, for the record, when it is likely that the consolidated regulations can be published and whether the Minister is in a position to expedite this.  I would agree very forcibly with the points that Senator Murphy made.  It is strange that we do not look more at the social welfare code. It is strange that politicians do not address themselves as much as they should to the anomalies, to the inequities, to law getting out of date, to law getting so obscure that it is incomprehensible except to the legal technician, to regulations falling very far behind and not being issued under an Act when there has been a consolidation Act and so on. It is not just politicians who do not place sufficient emphasis on reform and updating of the social welfare code.  It is also lawyers.  There are very few lawyers who specialise in social welfare law.  This is explainable by the fact that there are very few paying customers who can afford to retain lawyers to advise them on their problems in relation to the social welfare code.  We have not got to the stage where the provision of legal services is a provision determined by need rather than by ability to pay.  If we did have an approach that legal services were provided to people on the basis of need, then I believe that we would have and need to have a very significant concentration on social welfare law, a concentration on the law itself, the substantive law, on the procedures for deciding and on the procedures on appeal under the social welfare code. It would be a very good thing if there were to be more interest among lawyers and academics and also, primarily, among politicians in reform of the social welfare code.  Therefore, I welcome the Minister's statement of intention in that regard and I hope that we will have an early opportunity in this House, either by motion or on another Bill, to discuss some of the urgent reforms and in particular the removal of discrimination against women and against married women which still permeates our social welfare code and, above all, that insulting concept of dependency of a married woman.</P>

      <P>There are two other matters that I want to refer to.  One is that the Minister referred to the increases for children and this is included in a Schedule to the Bill.  I am not holding the Minister responsible for this because it is a continuation of what was suggested by the previous Government, but it is not acceptable that the increases for children laid out in the various schedules to the Act should be 25 per cent.  Let there be no doubt about it; they are not 25 per cent.  What has happened is that the increases in respect of children have been <Col N="395" /> reduced from the 25 per cent to take into account the extra children's allowance which is being paid to all children irrespective of whether or not they are children of social welfare beneficiaries.  In other words, the relative position of the children of social welfare beneficiaries is being disimproved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Take for example Schedule B of the rates of benefit. One sees quite clearly that the increase in respect of the fifth child is considerably less than in respect of the earlier children under the social welfare legislation.  They are taking into account the increases which are being received under the new revised children's allowance scheme.  But as a result of that, the children of social welfare beneficiaries will be less well off because their 25 per cent will include two sections, the increase of other social welfare benefit and also the increase which all children will be entitled to under the revised children's allowance schedule. That is one thing I find unsatisfactory in the Bill.  The very fact that it may or may not have been in the other Government's Bill is, as far as I am concerned, irrelevant. I have always maintained that position in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also provides in section 9 of the Bill a power &mdash; to which Senator Dooge has already referred &mdash; to increase temporarily or vary.  The same point struck me as struck Senator Dooge as to why the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; goes in when by the succeeding section of the Consolidation Bill the Minister is precluded from reducing. <Col N="396" /> Why he continues with the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; I do not understand.  But the Minister explaining it indicated that this year he would be making a double payment for the child dependants of social welfare beneficiaries in September and December. Am I to take it from that the Minister is not going to make any double payments except in so far as child dependants are concerned?  Is the Minister indicating to this House that there will be no double payments at Christmas time in respect of ordinary social welfare recipients, widows and the old, for example, who may not have child dependants.  The Minister's speech is very strange in that regard and the House would benefit greatly if before it gives him the power he seeks under section 9, he would indicate exactly what is in his mind with regard to section 9 on this occasion.</P>
    <P>In making representations to the Minister I listened with considerable interest to the contribution of Senator Robinson. I would completely subscribe to what Senator Robinson said about dependency and the various problems arising as result of the definition of that word.  I may not have the opportunity of speaking again in this House on social welfare legislation but I do not think that the concept of insurance and benefits should necessarily be extended to an unmarried mother.  That view of the social welfare legislation is an attempt to change fundamentally what is an insurance scheme. An insurance scheme is making provision for something that may happen in the future and which would be, by and large, outside a person's control.</P>
    <P>Entitlement to benefit under an insurance scheme is quite a different concept from an allowance which might be given by the State to take into account a particular social condition.  We should not go too far in abolishing the concept of the difference between benefit and allowance because it is quite useful.</P>
    <P>In section 5 the reference to the various rates of contribution is 5.5 per cent by the employed person and 11.3 per cent by the employer while in the explanatory memorandum it is 11.6 per cent.  I presume the remaining 0.3 per cent refers to occupational injuries benefit because the <Col N="397" /> two do not tie up with one another.  The only additional item I can see included is occupational injuries, which presumably is covered by different legislation.  It is not made quite clear from the Explanatory Memorandum.  I hope the Minister will be more successful on this occasion than he was in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. J. Harte Mr. J. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I know he will have a very onerous and difficult job.  The shortage of cash will add to his problems.</P>
      <P>I do not share the view of my colleague. The Minister will be adroit in applying his skills in this area.  The question will be whether the money is available or not and whether there is political will for a real redistribution of the wealth, particularly in an area where people are vulnerable. The people in the vulnerable and most deserving areas are there because of the type of economy we have. We do not have the fullest possible concern for them, and this is not only in respect of this Government but in respect of all Governments.  All I say is that the job is arduous and onerous, but it can be tackled well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not sufficient to say that we will give the Bill a speedy passage through the House and that we will give it our co-operation.  Of course we will give it our co-operation and we are delighted to see it.  My party colleague, who shares many of my views in respect of social reform, the former Minister for Health, Deputy Eileen Desmond, was largely responsible for providing the level of benefits available in the Bill.  The groundwork has been laid for future development.  Knowing Deputy Desmond as I do, it is not surprising that she gave of her best endeavours in the interest of the people I referred to.  It has always been the concern of the Labour Party since it was founded in 1912 that such people would be uppermost in our thoughts at all times and that we would have very serious regard to the question of dealing with the underprivileged and the deprived in our society.  While a lot of progress has been made in certain directions, the struggle is still on.  The battle is far from won in this area of social <Col N="398" /> concern.  If we are seriously concerned about advancing the cause of social justice, as Deputy Desmond and others of my colleagues are, I suggest that the new Dáil and, hopefully, the new Seanad, would show more anxiety in this area and move more rapidly in the direction of bringing about real social justice.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill, 1982, is welcome. Let me immediately say that it does not provide all the answers nor does it go anywhere near to the elimination of poverty.  I know that in respect of the elimination of poverty the former Minister had more ideas in her mind and had she had an opportunity we would have been discussing not only this Bill but would have been considering further steps towards tackling the question of improving the standard of living of the most deprived section of our society, the section that depends on the State for assistance.  She would have put those ideas into action in the area concerned with the elimination of poverty and the proper redistribution of wealth.  She would not have been able to do it on her own.  She would have needed the political will of her colleagues in the Cabinet.  I am sure she would have pressed very hard for it.  I trust that the new Minister for Social Welfare, who has the adroitness to do so, will manoeuvre himself into a suitable position so that he can further the idea of the elimination of poverty.  I do not expect it to be done overnight, or even next year or the year after, but certainly I expect him to use his skills in this direction.  If we do that perhaps we could get action in the areas of unemployment, the serious lack of housing and other intolerable inequalities.</P>
    <P>I have listened to spokespersons of this Government and of the Coalition Government and it came across to me indirectly that justice must await progress. I was listening to that when I was a boy in the thirties.  They were saying then that the question of social justice must await the question of progress.  It is still being said.  My voice may not express the Gregorian chant but I submit that the primary needs of all the people must be satisfied, whatever the resources of the nation may be.  Justice demands that the <Col N="399" /> humanitarian cause should be heard and attended to.  This Bill does not go anywhere near resolving all the humanitarian demands, nor does any other Social Welfare Bill.  Nevertheless, despite the arguments about the 25 per cent, in fairness I must say that aspect is to be welcomed in the sense that it is heading in the direction of an obligatory charge upon the nation's income.  We have seen this coming gradually and it is not the solution of everything but we must recognise that it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The economic system is the cause of widespread poverty and distress.  It has lavished riches and abundance on many people.  The primary obligation of those people who have gained abundance &mdash; I am not excluding my fellow trade unionists &mdash; is to relieve hardship and suffering which follow in the wake of poverty caused by the economic system.  All Members like to get this annual Bill through the House very quickly and I am not trying to hold up its progress but, as I have said, it does not satisfy the criteria for dealing with the elimination of poverty. Those who have benefited from the system which caused the evil in the first place must be made to face up to and acknowledge the justice of the fact that they cannot be relieved of bearing the cost of alleviating that suffering.  The 25 per cent is not the solution to the problem, but it makes the problem less acute for the underprivileged.  It does not touch upon the wider aspects of dealing with the question of poverty.</P>
    <P>After 60 years of self-determination as a nation our society is still characterised by many of the elements of the economic imbalance and underdevelopment that we have been experiencing for years, despite the fact that the structure of the economy has been altered significantly and output has accelerated at times.  The Social Welfare Bill, 1982 should be regarded as a welcome short-term element in a policy to combat poverty, but the whole area of poverty must be dealt with effectively.  Whatever initiatives have been taken by my colleague, the previous Minister for Social Welfare, <Col N="400" /> those initiatives should be followed up and Sister Stanislaus and her team should get all encouragement possible.  They were doing a great job of work which unfortunately came to an end and that further boost is necessary for them.</P>
    <P>Discrimination is immoral and unChristian and for the love of our fellowmen it is on the head of each of us to see that this discrimination is removed.  The 25 per cent is welcome, but provision should be made for all social welfare recipients to receive at Christmas and in September or October the benefit related to child dependents.  I do not know whether I have read this part correctly, but as I understand it long-term old age pensioners and widows are excluded from this.  Is that correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extra measure.  I will explain it in my reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. J. Harte Mr. J. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that.  I am not a lawyer and I do not intend to go into this at any great length, but on section 8 it seems to me as a layman that something is being done to eliminate discrimination, but discrimination against married women still exists.  Unfortunately, the position is still that their unemployment benefit is for a shorter term than others enjoy.  That should be dealt with.  Also, in order to qualify for unemployment assistance they are obliged to prove that they are separated or that the husband is an invalid.  This is discrimination and I do not know whether it can be remedied in the context of the amendment, but it must be tackled. I am talking about total justice.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to commit himself to the income-related pensions upon which his predecessor had commenced work.  She had committed herself to a White Paper on this and I trust that the present Minister will see that through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A growing number of long-term unemployed people are being reduced to seeking unemployment assistance.  This means a drop in income for them and, consequently, great hardship.  I ask the Minister to look at this to see if some special measure can be introduced, perhaps <Col N="401" /> not to solve the problem but to make it less acute.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  Perhaps I will not always agree with him and I am looking forward to a few good old arguments with him.  However, as long as he is aiming at the objectives which I believe should get priority, I will support him.  The organised nation must look to the welfare of the underprivileged at all times.  Many of us have this obligation and, as I said earlier, I am not aiming my remarks only at people who have had wealth lavished on them.  When I speak of abundance I refer to many categories of people.  We all have an obligation here and we must not cry &ldquo;Wolf&rdquo; at one section of society. Once again I wish the Minister the best of luck and I look forward to further developments in this area.  If he continues to bring legislation of this nature in here we will not have any great difficulty in giving him the necessary co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senators for their very extensive comments on the Bill and for their almost unanimous welcome to me as Minister in this office for the second time.  I do not want to delay the House too long, but I will try to deal with some of the points, many of them important, which were raised on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge made quite clear the basic fact that the substance of this Bill is common ground for the previous Government and the present Government. Some elements were added which I managed to negotiate, particularly in relation to the disabled and the handicapped, and then we have the major ones which were the subject of the recent election.  I will not repeat those because Senators know them, but leaving those elements aside we have a great deal of common ground here, and there is a 25 per cent increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dooge also mentioned the matter of abuse in the pay-related benefits scheme and in schemes generally, and this relates also to what Senator Whitaker said.  While we are not taxing social welfare benefits, I would certainly be concerned to remove abuse and waste within <Col N="402" /> the system and I will press forward with administrative systems to avoid abuse and ensure as far as possible that benefits go to those for whom they are intended. I could mention examples of what I did during my last period in office which were not, perhaps, as well reported as other elements of late.  One was the increase in the referee system.  By getting a proper salary scale for medical officers who conduct this system I was able greatly to increase the complement of medical referees and reduce by an average of 4,000 a week those who were claiming disability benefit.  This is a direct management approach which ensures that there is fair play and that those to whom benefit is due will receive it.  This means a very significant saving.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge also mentioned the fact that anomalies can arise even in a consolidation Act.  He knows very well that in drafting such a measure all we could do was to bring together all existing legislation. I pay tribute to two of my predecessors at this Department, the present Taoiseach and Deputy Frank Cluskey, who both attempted to get this consolidation done.  It was only because of the size of the task that it was not completed in their time, and by the time I took office there had been so many more changes that consolidation became a mammoth task.  It was very difficult for the members of the Standing Committee on Consolidation Bills to find the time necessary to deal with it.  The proposed measure covered legislation going back over 70 years. For instance, the Act relating to old age pensions dates from 1908.  At least our reference point for this legislation is now 1981, although many changes have taken place since.  Perhaps there should be a periodic reconsolidation, especially in an area such as social welfare where so much change needs to take place.  That might be the correct approach.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge also mentioned the 11.6 per cent and the 11.3 per cent. Because in the case of employers that part of the occupational injuries scheme was in excess, it was possible to reduce it by 0.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the use of the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; in the section <Col N="403" /> dealing with the power to make regulations. It would seem at first view that the Minister should just say &ldquo;increase&rdquo; and that would be the main intention, but there is also the element of varying for a time such as a week or a month.  The draftsman advises that the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; is appropriate.</P>
    <P>Senator Mary O'Rourke welcomed the children's allowances and the retrospective element.  She also welcomed the removal of discrimination against separated married women.  This will cost about £200,000.  My predecessor had not come to the stage of having a Bill drafted but I know she was anxious to have this element removed and I was happy to get approval for this measure.  Senator Robinson also raised this point very forcefully and I will come back to it later. Senator O'Rourke made the point that it is an improvement, although it may not be considered substantial enough.  It will certainly be my target to remove as soon as possible other elements of discrimination.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Rourke also welcomed the increase in domiciliary care allowance and other allowances for the handicapped. The January budget did not provide for these increases.  I know it has not always been normal to increase the domiciliary care allowance each year.  Last year I increased it and I was anxious that it should continue to keep pace with inflation. Accordingly I sought Government approval to increase this allowance, together with the mobility allowance for the handicapped and the training grants. These are very important to handicapped people as well as to those who care for and maintain in their own home a mentally handicapped person under the age of 18 or a physically handicapped person of that age.  Senator O'Rourke recognised that fact and welcomed it.  She also welcomed the review of the supplementary welfare scheme, which is very important.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris referred to payments which existed previously.  He spoke of the need for a human face in social welfare. Of course, it is very easy to have a human face if one is handing out money <Col N="404" /> without asking questions, but the man who must ask the questions is the officer of the Department of Social Welfare.  He must ask questions about a variety of matters, especially where there is not a benefit scheme.  This puts the officer in a difficult position and we must stand behind him.  I fully accept the need for a human face in so far as this is possible. The review of the supplementary welfare scheme is critical because it affects people who are in greatest financial difficulty.  I also accept what Senator Ferris said about entitlements being a right.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris and Senator O'Leary raised the matter of administrative problems. I will not go back into the changeover which took place &mdash; I do not think Senator O'Leary was here at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>He was not in the House but he gathered it from the media.  This is enabling administration.  That enabling administration was the computerisation of all the pay-related social insurance. This was a historic development of enormous magnitude.  A lot of problems arose in it.  It would either be tackled and done or left and you would go on working in a fairly hopeless way getting more and more people coming along being less able to deal with them and give them the service they wanted.  I had the task as Minister of bringing about that change. It was an extremely difficult task.  I depended on all the records coming from the Revenue Commissioners.  The House will be quite aware that the Revenue Commissioners had records of a lot of employers who had not made their returns.  An employee would come along to get a benefit and it depended on what came from the Revenue Commissioners. There was no return.  That is all on the record of the House if the Senator wishes to have a look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a very big undertaking but it has been done.  My successors, Deputy Eileen Desmond and Deputy Mary O'Flaherty acknowledged on the record of the House in June 1981 that the problem by the time they came into office had been cleared up.  The problem was in the <Col N="405" /> period before that.  There was great difficulty in trying to get that cleared up. There was also a strike at that time.  That was tackled and the change was made.  It slipped back a little in August after it came in.  I did not press unduly about it because I knew the reason was that some difficulties arose in staffing.  They were sorted out after a reasonable time.  It was not until that was done that we could begin to talk about having videos, first of all, in Gandon House and Oisin House, then in Cork and in due course in all the other places around the country. That is the change which is taking place. We can have a debate on that at any time. There is no business in the country with the kind of turnover activities involved in that area, so it was a major task and one which the staff in the Department undertook particularly well though some of the difficulties which arose could not have been anticipated.  I can refer the Senator later to the record of the other House in relation to that.  It might help to put his mind at rest in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get the record for the Senator.  The anomalies are there and I want to see them eliminated.  Any Minister for Social Welfare comes to a Government, be it a Coalition Government or a Fianna Fáil Government, with a shopping list of anomalies that he would like to have eliminated immediately. Of course you come back to the budget.  We have been particularly sensitive about budgets and finances, and the probity of our finances recently.  The Minister for Social Welfare can only hope to get a certain amount at a particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I got for old age pensioners and widows in three successive budgets, three successive Social Welfare Bills, 25 per cent <Col N="406" /> increases.  The 25 per cent this year is a 25 per cent against a higher rate of inflation than last year and the year before.  It is not easily achieved.  I accept what Senator Harte said, that we still have a distance to go and we have many anomalies within the system to get at.  Certainly, the question of bringing about improvement in the course of a particular year and a particular budget is not quite so simple when you come to the amount of money that is involved nowadays.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act and the question of Clover Meats were mentioned.  The Act did not do any of that of course because the Act only brought together in one book if you like all the existing legislation so any of the comments that were made in relation to that were totally unfounded.  I know that point was made in a variety of places. This is one of the things you have to put up with sometimes in politics.  We had to certify that the legislation exactly as it existed before the Consolidation Act was carried totally and in every detail into the Act, though with the updating of the language, and that in any way in which it was updated the original provisions were still maintained.  The benefit of having that together in that Act means that parliamentarians can turn back now, take out the pieces much more simply and deal with them section by section.  That is what I would like to see done with the Act from here forward in terms of improvement and removal of anomalies.</P>
    <P>The question was raised about PAYE being paid on the pay-related social insurance. There was an allowance made at the setting up of it for the pension element when a ½ per cent was taken off for the PRSI to allow for the tax benefit which was there previously on the pension element.  This would not apply to the other elements of the PRSI.  On the pension element there was a 0.5 per cent allowance made for the employee at that time; otherwise I think the point the Senator made is a fair one.</P>
    <P>Senator Whitaker said that this year we would be spending £1,565 million on this Bill and what it entails on the levels and rates which are involved in it.  He also, from his own calculations, reckoned <Col N="407" /> that unemployment would cost over £300 million.  It is actually £315 million but it is more or less the same argument as the Senator makes.  I agree that it is particularly important to find new ways of providing employment.  One of the principal objectives of the new Dáil and the incoming Seanad should be to use the imagination and the ingenuity of the Government and of the Deputies and Senators on both sides of the House in tackling the very practical problems that exist.</P>
    <P>I believe that in this budget we have a number of measures that will be helpful in that respect.  The £50 million into the construction industry will be very helpful to the unemployed.  Senator Whitaker tried to cover this point to some extent by saying that there were some on the register who were not fit to work but that there are increasing numbers who suffer from an involuntary idleness.  This is a very true point because in recent times people very anxious to get work were forced into unemployment.  They are anxious that work will be created.  The employment incentive scheme, being increased from £20 to £30 and from 24 weeks to 52 weeks will be very full.  I am not responsible for that but it has a very big impact on the total cost of the social welfare area.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy welcomed the Bill and said that this money to some extent was conscience money for all of us.  Now, when employment is not available, it is a true point.  He also recognised that abuses occur.  I accept that.  Within the terms that I stated earlier, we must acknowledge these are essentially rights of people but we must ensure that they go to the right people in the right way. Beyond that, I will certainly do what I can to avoid abuses and cut them out when they occur.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy said the provision in section 8 was not adequate but recognised that it was an improvement.  The previous Government did not make any such provision in their budget.  As Minister for Social Welfare I got this extra £200,000 from the Minister for Finance although I am not saying that my predecessor might not have been able to do <Col N="408" /> this too if the Coalition had stayed in power.</P>
    <P>Senators raised the question of making available to all information about the social welfare system.  There is a great need for an improvement in the number of these offices throughout the country. Here there is a capital requirement involved but I will do anything I can to accelerate such a programme.  Advertising is very important.  Because of the numbers involved the system has been under a great deal of pressure in recent years and this has caused a great deal of difficulty.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised a question about section 8.  I have tried to make clear that we are removing a discrimination against separated married women. Senator Robinson says the provision in this section is not adequate, that there should be a wider removal and that all discrimination should be done away with immediately.  The Government are committed to doing away with the rest of these discriminations over a phased period &mdash; before December 1984.  I am very anxious to see these discriminations removed from the system.  It must be borne in mind that there are very widespread implications in Senator Robinson's proposed alternative because it affects the element of dependency throughout the whole social welfare system. Consequently, her proposal has very far-reaching financial implications. That is why discriminations are being phased out over a number of years.  If we took that measure out we would be tinkering with the system and we would have to look into all the other areas &mdash; disability benefit, unemployment benefit and so on &mdash; to try to find the implications and repercussions involved.  In my view the issue is quite clear.  The proposed amendment will ensure that separated married women can claim unemployment benefit in their own right.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to rush this Bill through the House but these books have to be sent to social welfare recipients all over the country, an enormous administrative task.  These books are of vital importance to thousands of people.  We all know why this Bill must be passed today.  Last January <Col N="409" /> the budget was rejected, an election was held and another budget was introduced. If social welfare recipients are to get what is due to them from 31 March we will not be able to do that if we adopt Senator Robinson's suggestion.</P>
    <P>I want everybody to be clear about that.  The implications of what is proposed are quite wide.  We are talking about revising a budget which has been voted on in the Dáil.  The Government are committed to that budget and the Opposition were committed to a broadly similar budget.  If the Seanad reject this budget, the Dáil will have to reverse that decision &mdash; the Dáil is ordered to sit next Tuesday afternoon.  This means the Bill will be delayed; the measure will then come back to the Seanad and if again they reject the amendment, which will benefit separated married women, we would have to wait 90 days for the Bill to pass automatically.  That is what we are talking about and Senators should be very clear about the issue before they take any steps in that direction.  I want them to realise that if these payments are not made from 31 March they will not be paid for a considerable time.  All parties in the Dáil recognised that point and there was speedy approval of the Bill.  I am sure Senator Robinson appreciates the difficulties that will arise.  We cannot have an amendment because it would mean an increase in costs which in turn would mean we would have to throw out an improvement which is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson also mentioned that the 25 per cent increase was acceptable but not enough.  It is always easy to say that but if one looks at pay-related social insurance one will see that the employee has to pay an extra 1.75 per cent.  Last year the increase under the former administration was .25 per cent.  Because of our unemployment problems, particularly among young people, there is a 1 per cent increase for the Youth Employment Agency.  This means a 2.75 per cent increase on PRSI, a very substantial increase, which can be accepted only because of our extraordinarily difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the context of the general economic <Col N="410" /> background the increase of 25 per cent brings the old age pension for a married couple to £70.30 per week.  I am very happy to see that level achieved, which is in excess of 50 per cent of the national wage in the transportable goods sector. It took three years, with a 25 per cent increase each year, to get to this level. There are also other benefits &mdash; a double week at Christmas, free light, fuel allowance and other measures.  I accept that times are difficult, but as a result of not putting on the 18 per cent VAT on clothes and by continuing the food subsidies, we will have a 2 per cent reduction in the inflation rate.  Both the previous Government and the present Government in doing that are making a fair contribution in this year and in the circumstances of this year.  Likewise increasing the £104 per child to £312 costs £200,000 and is of some assistance to single parents.  I do not claim that it is going to solve all the problems but it will go some way in that respect.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised the question about the code in regard to the means test for widows <i>vis-à-vis</i> other groups. The Senator raised also the question about the regulations.  This is quite relevant and it is a very big and difficult area. It is one for which there is very little political thanks.  The Consolidation Bill took up an enormous amount of the time of politicians.  Even to get the committee to meet a number of times with the draftsman and to go through these matters was very difficult.  I am going to attempt to consolidate the regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>However, it is a big task. Because so many other pressing matters arise, that sort of work is not done generally. However, I appreciate the value of it and I can assure the Senator that I will try to consolidate the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Leary talked about the administrative difficulties in relation to benefit for child dependants.  What we have done is exactly what the previous Government were doing in relation to child dependants, that is, combining the <Col N="411" /> very substantially increased children's allowances with the benefits to ensure that an overall benefit of 25 per cent applies all the time.  That has been done mathematically in the preparations.</P>
    <P>If one takes the basic flat rate and the number of children, by virtue of the fact that the benefits for children are increasing all the time one can have more from one's flat rate and child benefits than when working and in receipt of children's allowance.  It is logical to ensure that all people with children, whether working or not, have the benefit and that if you are not working your personal rates are good enough to match what you might have otherwise.  Anomalies can arise whereby through increasing the benefit far too greatly one can end up having a greater income while out of work than while at work and this could lead to a considerable reluctance to go back to work.  That happens in some cases.</P>
    <P>The Senator raised also the question of the double payments in September and December.  These relate to the £4 million on the family income supplement.  It is a special supplement for dependants at that time.  The double payment at Christmas is a separate question and will have to be dealt with separately.  It is not included in this.</P>

      <P>Senator Harte welcomed the improvements involved and talked about the importance of political will.  I agree that particularly when times are bad the political will is very important if we are to protect those who are vulnerable.  I would agree with him that my predecessor was concerned in this respect.  I would agree also that the struggle is still there and will have to be pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Harte also expressed the hope that we could further eliminate poverty and raised a number of questions in relation <Col N="412" /> to that.  There was £250,000 included in the previous budget for poverty.  That has been increased to £2 million.  There will be a substantial amount of money available for the National Community Development Agency which arises from the studies that were done following the pilot studies on poverty and a review that was done subsequent to that.  There is also a task force for the elderly in respect of which there is £500,000.  I can assure Senator Harte that the question of tackling poverty is something which we will pursue very keenly.</P>
    <P>The Senator raised also the national pension plan.  As Senators may know that the draft national pension plan was just prepared at the time when we went out of office.  One of the difficulties is that, once you have a budget, you have to revise all the figures, which means that there is a problem again in relation to the present budget.  I will pursue that, though I recognise that we are back to the drawing board in terms of calculations.  However, I will pursue it as urgently as I can.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their very extensive, sincere and relevant comments on the Bill and I wish them every success in their own campaigns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to return to a point I touched on briefly on Second Stage, namely, the form of section 2. What we are doing here in section 2 essentially is amending the Schedule of the Principal Act.  The substitution is made in subsection (1) of section 2.  Then there follow subsections (2) to (9) in which we have to go through some extremely complicated amendments.  It appears to me that this complicated amendment here arises because, in this legislation, we have gone from the position of two classes of children in the Principal Act to four classes of children in the present legislation.  The original Schedule had a column 4 that dealt with the first two children and a column 5 that dealt with over two children.  In order to allow for the new division into a category of the first child, a category of the second child, a third category comprising the third, fourth and fifth children, and the final category children over the fifth child, we have practically two pages of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that, rather than have this amount of legislation relating to all the sections in the Principal Act, just because we have to make a column 4 and 4a and a column 5 and 5a in place of the original columns 4 and 5, this could have been drafted more skilfully by making <Col N="414" /> the original column 4 a double column with a single heading and making the original column 5 a double column.  Such drafting would be much better than the drafting that is here, and much more readable.  We the legislators and the public we represent have a right to receive legislation in the simplest form in which it is possible to write it.  It is possible to write this in simpler form.  I have no desire at this stage of this urgent Bill to move amendments, but I wish to deplore what has been done and invite the Minister to comment on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The method used in the Consolidation Act was used on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman.  I have noted the point the Senator has made.  I will take it up with the draftsman and see if we can improve the presentation next time round.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his colleagues had better be on notice. Invoking the authority of the parliamentary draftsman, without reason, belongs to early scholastic theology rather than modern-day legislation.  The draftsman has said that the correct way to act on pages 8, 9, 10 and 11 is to have columns 4 and 4a, and go through the mess of legislation in section 2 of the Bill.  I do not known if Part III of the Schedule was drafted by another parliamentary draftsman who did not have such an inhibition against double columns.  I would ask the Minister to look at page 12 of his Bill. We find, under the heading &ldquo;Disablement Pension&rdquo; a column 1, a column 2, which is later split into a double column, and a column 3 which is later split into a double column.  I do not accept, merely on the authority of a parliamentary draftsman, that the only correct way to act in Part I is to produce pages of text which make the reading of the Bill difficult, and to act otherwise in Part III.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the point I raised on Second Stage, that the increase in the amount allowed for each child from £104 to £312 applies to deserted wives and unmarried mothers as well as for the purposes of widows' non-contributory pensions. As I had guessed, and as is apparently correct, that is the code benefit that then applies to all the others.</P>
      <P>I have some doubts about whether it is a good thing to legislate by code when we are making changes which affect people's rights and people's entitlements.  We should try to avoid the kind of codes that make it difficult, even for those with some legal training, to follow the precise text. If one looks at the wording there, on the face of it, it applies only to widows' non-contributory pensions.  Even when I looked at the Schedule it was difficult to understand, and I assumed there was a code and that is the case.  I am pleased that there is an increase from £2 a week per child to £6 a week per child.  I still think the amount of the allowance against income is very low.  Apart from the increase in relation to the child, the standard allowance is still only £6.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="416" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, £6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is appallingly low in this day and age.  If a widow or a deserted wife or an unmarried mother is earning more than £6 it is set against her allowance.  If the step is taken here in this section to increase from £2 to £6 a week the set-off per child, there ought to be a realistic figure in relation to the person's own earnings and income.  Six pounds is a ludicrously low figure.  I would welcome the Minister's comment on that.  I hope he has an intention to raise that figure very substantially in the near future because, as it affects the widow, or the deserted wife, or the unmarried mother, it actually perpetuates the poverty cycle they find themselves in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, after the first £6 a week of income, the earnings are to be set off against the allowance, it is a disincentive to any kind of even part-time work by a widow, or a deserted wife, or an unmarried mother because immediately she is knocked in her allowance.  Take, for example, the unmarried mother &mdash; and I am very familiar with the problems posed there because I have been dealing with them and Cherish have been dealing with them for a very long time &mdash; if the unmarried mother cannot easily support herself and her child on the allowance and wishes to work &mdash; and we are talking about the lower rate; there is no benefit for unmarried mothers &mdash; at a very early stage her very meagre earnings are set off against the allowance and the allowance is reduced proportionately.  It means that probably she is going to take work for which she will not be insured and will not declare.  That is the first part of the cycle of poverty, that she will do the kind of work where there will be no stamps involved; it will all be in that kind of grey area.  Meanwhile, she needs to a get a child-minder for her child.  The same thing applies in relation to the child-minder. That is likely to be also undeclared, uninsured without proper safeguards and so on.  Therefore, you have a whole cycle of deprivation, of uninsured work, of low wages anyway and of a very, very low <Col N="417" /> cut-off where, because of earning £6 a week &mdash; and add now £6 to that for a widow or an unmarried mother with one child &mdash; after that she begins to have her allowance deducted <i>pro rata.</i> This is really unacceptable in this day and age. I would like an assurance from the Minister that at a very early stage he will dramatically increase that ceiling.  I think I am right in saying that £6 has been a fixed figure since 1974.  Am I correct in that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The base figure has been there, yes, and the upper ceiling moves up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>But the base of £6, which starts the set-off against the allowances, has been fixed since 1974?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been fixed, though the ceiling has moved up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the ceiling does not mean anything in the sense&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>For means it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It does in a sense.  But it means that once a person is in receipt of the allowance, if she earns £6 and if this section goes through as it will, she will get an extra £6 per child instead of £2 per child.  Therefore, instead of being £8 it will now be £12.  But that is the only allowance before the earnings are set off against the social welfare allowance.  That provision is unchanged since 1974.  That £6, which is the maximum a person can earn before it is set off, is totally unacceptable. The cost of living and inflation have increased hundreds of fold since 1974.  Yet we still retain that £6 against income.  I accept that this is definitely an improvement in relation to what can be set off per child, from £2 to £6 per week, but it does not affect the basic amount of £6 that can be set off, which has remained unchanged since 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this is a matter of extreme importance to those in receipt of an allowance who need to supplement it.  I do not think there is any Member of this House who does not know that any <Col N="418" /> unmarried mother on an allowance for her children, or any widow or deserted wife would find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to live solely on the allowance or benefit.  Therefore, on the whole she would seek to supplement it with at least part-time work.  Yet only £6 of that &mdash; and if this section goes through, £6 per child &mdash; would be allowed before the allowance itself was reduced <i>pro rata.</i> Therefore, this is very important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem here again is one of money.  Two hundred thousand pounds are available and that is the extent to which the disregard can be reduced.  At the same time I should mention that the means scale is altered also at present.  To date for every £1 in means one lost £1.20.  That has been changed in respect of non-contributory old age pensions, non-contributory widows' pensions and unmarried mothers' allowances.  Now it is a question of £ for £.  That may not be thought to be very important but it entails getting £760,000 from the Minister for Finance in practical terms.  That is the problem of the Minister for Social Welfare.  How much of that will go to unmarried mothers I cannot tell the House offhand.  But an unmarried mother can earn up to £46, assuming she has one child, and reap the minimum benefit which would be a benefit of only £2.60 and, if the earnings fall below that, the benefit increases.  That is what I have been able to do at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Minister, I want to make it clear that this £6, which has been a fixed cut-off of what can be earned by persons before it can be set off against their allowance, applies not merely to unmarried mothers but to widows and deserted wives.  It constitutes a crippling provision for the women conerned.  It means that they find they cannot live and, with respect, even though there are increases envisaged &mdash; even though we have the table here that a deserted wife, widow or unmarried mother will receive an allowance, with one child, of £42.60 &mdash; to be able to earn only £2.60 in excess of that before having one's allowance deducted is, I would submit, <Col N="419" /> part of the poverty cycle.  I do not know of any other ceiling in our social welfare code which affects people, which curtails their rights or their eligibility to benefit.  I do not know of one other fixed ceiling that has been there since 1974, there unchanged for eight years.  It is extremely important that this be looked at and changed as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned cost in relation to discrimination against married women and said that the partial change that has been made will cost £200,000.  I am sorry, but after Deputy Gregory's performance, cost is out the window&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I can say there is that we are finding £1,565,000 this year for these purposes.  I am afraid I would have to contest the Senator's other figures but there is no point in going into them here, as to the net cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the areas of poverty with which we are dealing.  I might refer the Senator to Deputy O.J. Flanagan's speech in the other House when he addressed himself to that subject.  It was a particularly valuable speech in relation to the inner city area of our capital city which he regarded as the capital of Ireland, and his capital, as well as ours here.  I might point out that there is a basic disregard of means of £6.  There will be now £6 for one child, which means a basic £12.  Therefore at least the £6 for an <Col N="420" /> unmarried mother with one child has been increased to £12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I refrained from intervening because Senator Robinson was making an excellent case herself on the obvious discrimination involved.  If there is a disincentive to people in this category to endeavour to keep abreast of the cost of living, to endeavour to cater for their child or children, whether unmarried, widowed or deserted, then when it comes to a question of money we must keep our priorities in order.  Any time we sought improvements in this regard we were told it was a question of money.  The Minister told us how important the inner city was, which I accept.  But I doubt very much that Knock Airport could not be postponed for another 12 months to allow some humanitarian legislation to be introduced in respect of people in this category and about whom we are extremely worried. At the stroke of a pen it appears there can be millions provided for anything and everything, but when it comes to the basic elements of social welfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister could clarify the point I made.  Is there any other ceiling which adversely affects people, in the sense that it constitutes a cut-off ceiling of £6 allowed before money will be deducted from the allowance, which has remained unchanged since 1974?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies to all the assistance schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but is there any other provision, apart from the lack of alteration of that basic figure, in relation to the assistance schemes?  That is my point.  It is incredible that a figure which was considered to be reasonable as the <Col N="421" /> cut-off point has remained unchanged for eight years.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Minister's point is a different one, that the assessment of the means test has gone up.  However, there is still the 1974 ceiling on what a person can earn before it starts to erode the value of the allowance.  That is a very serious indictment.  The Minister has taken a step in this section to make some improvement and I ask him in his reply to give a commitment that the £6 will not only be doubled but will be trebled or quadrupled in the next social welfare legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that the more I do in this House in terms of improvements the more I am castigated for not doing other things.  I must defend the Government's position in terms of the improvements that were made, even compared with those presented by the previous Government.  There are many groups of people who are disadvantaged in one way or another.  One must recognise that where a family keep at home a mentally handicapped child they also are due some improvement.  It becomes a question of priorities having regard to the amount of money available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The money available has been increased both in the budget and in the Bill over what was available before.  Further improvements have been made.  The improvements made by my predecessor in Government this year were substantial in any event.  We must bring some element of reality into the discussion.  I accept what the Senator has said in relation to this matter but I could show her a list of items where any Minister for Social Welfare would wish to give some improvements and help.  In any one year the Minister has to accept there is a limit to the additional funds that will be made available.  There has been a major change in the means test this year.  Now when a person earns an additional £1 he loses £1 in benefit: it was £1.40.  It was subsequently reduced to £1.20 and now the discrimination is being wiped out.  To me that is a most welcome development and it is one I have wanted for some time.  It benefits the unmarried mother, just as it <Col N="422" /> benefits the non-contributory old age pensioner or the person in receipt of a non-contributory widows pension or in the other non-contributory areas.  I can assure the Senator it will be my objective to carry out further improvements to ease the lot of people in such situations.  I accept the point she has made in that respect.</P>

I accept the point made by the Minister that the effect of so doing would be that, if the vote were carried, the section would be deleted from the Bill before us and would have to go back to the Dáil.  At the moment, as the Minister indicated, the Dáil has adjourned to be recalled on Tuesday, but there is nothing to stop the Dáil being recalled earlier. That is a very small administrative difficulty when one considers the immense commitments that were made to one single Deputy in the other House, with the rescheduling of a budget and all its ramifications. Therefore, I do not accept that there is a difficulty that cannot be overcome. Neither do I accept that this is a small matter or an academic matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Members of the House may not appreciate the extent of the discrimination we are retaining.  I repeat that section 8 continues blatant discrimination against married women.  In his reply the Minister admitted that we will have to get rid of that discrimination by December 1984, not because we may desire to do it ourselves &mdash; although one would hope we would &mdash; but because we will be required to do it by the EEC.  If we do not do it by <Col N="423" /> December 1984 we will be brought before the European Court of Justice under Article 169 of the EEC Treaty and found in breach of our obligations &mdash; a nice example of washing our linen abroad, of being brought before a foreign court because we continue discrimination.</P>
    <P>I submit that we have before us a half measure.  The cost of the half measure is £200,000, not exactly an amount that will shake the Exchequer.  It will cost a little more to remove the discrimination but it may mean that the next time there is a Bill dealing with social welfare there will be the important consequential amendments to which the Minister referred.  I agree they are part and parcel of beginning to remove this invidious concept of legal dependency which I and every other married woman in the country have under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.</P>
    <P>Let us make progress.  If we have to make progress in the Dáil and the Seanad at the moment by blackmail, let us make progress by blackmail.  Let us make change, even though it is inconvenient. I appreciate, particularly for my colleagues on both sides of the House who are Senators seeking election to panels, that the last thing they want is to be in the Seanad this afternoon or to be recalled next week, and I have great sympathy for that.  However, this is not a minor or academic matter.  It is a matter of basic legal discrimination.  It is a real problem for what is likely to be a continuing number of people.  We have a high unemployment rate; more women are seeking work and are available for work. Therefore, more women are potentially unable to get work and are looking for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Let us take the simple example I gave earlier.  The husband is a student and is not earning.  The wife has been working but becomes unemployed &mdash; a very easy thing to happen at the moment &mdash; and looks for unemployment assistance.  At the moment she cannot get that assistance because her husband is not dependent on her.  Because of the legal technicalities of the definition, curiously she is the one who is dependent on him because <Col N="424" /> she is living with him.  Even though she is the only breadwinner, he is not regarded as being dependent on her because he is not either mentally or physically incapable of work.  That is unjust. It is invidious discrimination and is unacceptable. It affects an increasing number of married women who happen to be the only breadwinner of their families.  There is also the example of a husband who is not working, who draws unemployment assistance but who does not hand over the money to his wife.  The wife is available for work and wishes to draw unemployment assistance but she is barred from that.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's point that he was only attempting to remedy part of the problem, to redress the discrimination against separated married women. Today we have before us a section that proposes to make a change by modifying a discrimination.  We know that in two years' time we will be bound to remove that discrimination.  I submit now is the time to do that.  Now is the time to make the necessary change.</P>
    <P>The only way in which we can do that, and I want to be clear on this, is to oppose the section and to refer the matter back to the Dáil.  When the matter goes back to the Dáil, I submit there is at least a considerable possibility that the amendment will be accepted by the Dáil, that the Dáil will bring in an amendment on the lines of the amendment I have introduced and which has been declared not to be in accordance with the procedural rules of the Seanad because it would involve a potential charge on public funds because it would increase the number of married women who technically would be eligible to apply for unemployment assistance.  That amendment would be perfectly in order in the Dáil.  I would submit that with the pressures in the other House in the last week most Deputies do not know that this section has not removed the discrimination, that most Deputies are not aware of the technical definition of &ldquo;dependant&rdquo;, that most Deputies would be astonished to learn that in the example that I gave, of the woman as the breadwinner in the house and she being the one who has been <Col N="425" /> employed and has become unemployed, that even though her husband is a student or is himself unemployed but will not draw benefit, that she is not able to draw unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I submit that this is a matter that has not had the kind of attention in the other House which would mean that it would be unlikely that this amendment would be accepted.</P>

I do not think there are any insurmountable difficulties or that the cost is anything comparable to the white elephants that we are costing at the moment.  I have referred, as Senator Ferris did, to Knock Airport and other fairly heavy capital projects for which we appear to have endless money to pay.  We are talking about discrimination against workers. We are talking about the breadwinner in a family being unable to get unemployment assistance and I submit that that is a matter on which the Dáil can be reconvened to consider and to change.  The Seanad can meet on Tuesday and that will give the Minister time for the procedures under the Bill to go ahead.  It will not hold up any of the allowances provided for which are to come into effect on 31 March.</P>

      <P>In supporting Senator Robinson in trying to remove this obnoxious section I was concerned that when the Minister was replying to the Senator's previous submission on this he intimated somehow that if we did not approve of the withdrawal of this section today the Bill would go back to the Dáil but he also intimated that he felt the Dáil would defeat the move.  Are we to presuppose that the Dáil would in fact defeat it?  We want to serve a useful purpose here today but we also want to facilitate the Minister and I am sure this House wants to facilitate the legislation that will bring into effect the 25 per cent increase for social <Col N="426" /> welfare recipients.  Please ignore, Minister, the inconvenience to Senators like us who are contesting the panels.  This might be a small price to pay for the legislation being improved.  If the Government in the other House would defeat our amendment, all we could do would be to defer the total payment in this Bill by three months.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that and I am waiting for the Minister to say whether he feels he has a majority of support for this kind of section in the other House.  As Senator Robinson said, possibly some Deputies allowed this to go through without knowing that it was creating an anomaly.  If we remove this section will all the other sections stand? We are not trying to obstruct legislation that is designed to give people greater benefits but we want to try to ensure that the legislation which goes through the Houses of the Oireachtas reflects the views of those of us who are concerned about people in these classes as outlined by Senator Robinson.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on what Senator Robinson said about this section &mdash; I am sorry that I missed hearing what both she and the Minister said on Second Stage &mdash; and since the section deals with the discriminations which have applied against married women who are employed, while I would like to welcome what has been done to improve the position I would agree with Senator Robinson that one should do away with this discrimination altogether.  Married women who are employed are citizens and human beings.  To treat them differently from other employed citizens or human beings simply because they are married seems to be a matter that is not only contrary to all the principles which are obviously those of the European Court and of the European agreements to which we are a party but also might well be contrary to our own Constitution.  The National Social Services Council and the National Social Service Board, of which I have had <Col N="427" /> the honour of being chairman for some years, have put before the Minister the desiribility of changing these regulations on a number of occasions.  I would have to say that if we are going to amend the situation partly in order to take away some of the discriminations we ought to accept that where a married woman works and where she is available for work she should not be cut away from unemployment assistance merely on the grounds that she is married and is legally and technically a dependant, particularly when as in the example given by Senator Robinson and in many other cases she is not really dependent.  She is only dependent by a legal fiction.  Therefore I ask the Minister even if he cannot do it immediately, if it so happens that we cannot get it done in this Bill, to look at it as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I wish to support Senator Robinson.  She has an irrefutable case in respect of the absurdity of the Bill, the inevitability of conforming to EEC Regulations, the heading off of the very determined lobby who are agitating in this matter and also the possibility of the constitutionality of the measure being in doubt.  It seems to me that the case is watertight and strategically the question of a Government majority seems to be very dubious at this point.  The Minister should accept that it is game, set, and match to Senator Robinson.</P>

      <P>I understand from what Senator Ferris said that there was some indication that the Government would attempt to defeat this with their majority.  If that were the case it would raise a very interesting question in that certain groups or individuals who claim to be socially progressive in that other House would then have the opportunity of showing whether they can vote in favour of such an amendment, in other words whether they are really socially progressive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct the impression gained by the last Senator who spoke regarding what might be the <Col N="428" /> situation if we were to go back to the other House and if that House were to vote unanimously in favour of the amendment which is involved here.  One must at least consider the possibility that the House could vote the same way again and would want this amendment in.  If that is the case I was just trying to figure out what sort of time-scale is involved.  You would then have to come back to the Seanad again and certainly as far as old age pensioners and other people are concerned their position would be set back some distance.</P>
      <P>Senator McGuinness says that it is only a partial improvement.  I accept and recognise that.  The measure removes this discrimination from separated married women.  That, of course, is an improvement. It is partial because Senator Robinson wants it removed from all married women now.  I would say to Senator McGuinness that it is my commitment to have this discrimination removed at the earliest possible date.  Senator Robinson alters the position by saying that if money can be found for anything else it can be found for this and, therefore, do it all at this time.  I appreciate the point Senator Robinson is making but I would be quite concerned about the risk at which it is putting the general beneficiaries to oppose this measure now but that is one to which I am sure the Senators, in their wisdom, will give full consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson said she accepts that it means removing a benefit at the moment.  Because she regards it as a partial benefit she is quite prepared to propose the removal of that benefit in the interests of an amendment &mdash; longer-term &mdash; which would deal with everybody. I must point out that Senator Robinson is talking of the order of £20 million when talking about her general amendment.  Because this applies to dependency generally it would apply to disability benefit, unemployment benefit as well as unemployment assistance.  I want the Senators to understand the magnitude of the matter which is before the House.  I would also like the Senators to recognise that the whole Bill has to go back to the Dáil.  I am not quite clear at this stage what the position would be.  My <Col N="429" /> understanding of the Standing Orders is that the Dáil has been ordered to sit on Tuesday at 2.30 p.m. and that is the earliest time at which it will meet.</P>
    <P>Even assuming that the Dáil will consider this matter on Tuesday it would be at least Wednesday before it would come back to the Seanad with any revision that would be involved.  The whole question then arises as to what the treatment of the matter would be in the Dáil, whether there would be acceptance or rejection, and what the position of the Seanad would be when it came back here subsequently. I can certainly visualise a situation where it would be put back beyond 31 March.  There is no question about that.</P>
    <P>I want Senators of the Fine Gael Party who initially supported this, Senators of the Labour Party whose Minister brought this measure forward in the first instance and hopes to have it included &mdash; I subsequently took up the matter and it was not included in the original mathematics of the budget and it is in the new budget &mdash; to be aware that if this goes through it will involve setting back payments to the beneficiaries.  I have said that I have no objections, in other circumstances, to considering any amendments the Senators might like to put forward and taking the time to discuss and debate them. However, in the interests of people who are awaiting benefits at this time there is no doubt in my mind that the whole administration system which is necessary to have these payments commence on 31st would be very severely set back and it would have a detrimental effect in that sense.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson said she felt that the Dáil might accept the amendment.  I want to assure Senator Robinson that it was well debated in the Dáil.  Deputies were quite aware of the position and knew about it.  They were fully informed.  I was quite keenly questioned about what was involved.  The Dáil was quite clear about that at the time and it was dealt with at considerable length on Committee Stage. Senator Ferris asked about the Dáil position.  I have made it as clear as I can. It was considered very fully and there was a unanimous decision to proceed on the <Col N="430" /> lines which have come to the Seanad now.</P>
    <P>On the question of creating an anomaly &mdash; we are not creating an anomaly; we are removing an anomaly as far as the Department of Social Welfare are concerned. There are further anomalies involved and those we will tackle subsequently. Separated married women would be deprived of this improvement if the House voted against what is involved in this section.  The reason some Senators would be giving would presumably be the reason which Senator Robinson has given, that they want to see it applying to all women, which is a much bigger thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to make two comments.  First, the Minister has said this was debated at length in the Dáil.  That is an exaggeration.  The account of the Committee Stage debate on section 8 occupied less than three columns. That is not a substantial debate of a major discrimination.  Let us be quite clear on what is happening here.  It is not a question of procedures between the two Houses.  It is a question that the Minister should come out straight and say, &ldquo;I am not prepared to do it now&rdquo;.  That, in fact, is the position.</P>
      <P>The Minister in winding up on section 8 said: &ldquo;This Bill must be passed by 7 o'clock but I am prepared subsequently to look at the situation to see what funds would be required to remove further elements of discrimination&rdquo;.  That is what we are talking about.  I am quite sure the Minister has looked at it.  It was not discussed again, as far as I am aware, in the Dáil and the Minister has apparently now looked at it, come up with the sum of £20 million and said that this is not possible. I do not know if the figure is correct but that is the sum the Minister has given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us he will be compelled to amend before the end of 1984.  He has also told us in so many words that, in fact, he is unwilling to amend before March 31 of this year.  He is, therefore, putting the Members of this House in a dilemma.  He is saying to them that he will not amend before March 31. It is not a matter of what the Members of <Col N="431" /> Dáil Éireann think; it is a matter of what the Minister and his colleagues think.  If they are unwilling to introduce the ministerial amendment in Dáil Éireann then, as far as I know, it does not matter what the Members of Dáil Éireann think.  If there is not a political will, the decision by the Government to introduce an amendment in the Dáil, if we send back the Bill without this section, then there is nothing to be done.</P>
    <P>I agree with what is being said.  This is a most grievous anomaly; it should be removed in its entirety.  I see little point in excising from the present Bill the small degree of progress that has been made because I see absolutely no hope of the Bill coming back to us next week with the complete anomaly removed.  If we could get from the Minister a firm indication to come back to the Seanad, if not with the removal of the whole anomaly, with the removal of a further substantial part of it sometime between next Tuesday and the end of 1984, then we would be content to let this section go through with the partial improvement that is there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I respond to the quite extraordinary and totally unsubstantiated figure of £20 million that the Minister referred to as the potential cost of the amendment?  Let us look at the amendment.  Section 8 proposes to amend an existing section of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 by deleting paragraph (d) in it and substituting a different paragraph (d) which contains some discrimination.  The Minister said the estimated cost of that is £200,000.  What I am proposing is an amendment which deletes (d).  It is still confined to married women applying for unemployment assistance, nothing else, no other aspect of the social welfare code, and the main category of married women who would apply would be separated women and married women available for work who are the breadwinners, or who are the workers in the family.  The number in any year could not be substantially greater than double the number that would apply under the amendment that has been put forward in this section.  A <Col N="432" /> fair assessment in the abstract of the estimated cost would be, at the most, another £200,000 &mdash; £400,000.</P>
      <P>Any married woman applying for unemployment assistance has to satisfy all the other requirements.  All we are doing is removing an additional burden of this fictitious dependency, of this denial that she is a breadwinner when she is evidently the breadwinner, unless her husband is mentally or physically incapable of working.  We are removing an invidious discrimination.  It will not cost that much and I defy the Minister; I believe it would be quite wrong to suggest that it would cost anything like the figure that he has mentioned.</P>
      <P>I submit that the procedural arguments do not wash.  I hope that I misunderstood Senator Dooge as indicating that he might not be prepared to support a vote on this because he does not see much hope that the Dáil would change it.  With respect, this is a Bill which the Minister wants badly, wants it so badly that he has emphasised it all afternoon and every Member of this House understands why, and we all support the urgent need for it. There is no doubt at all that this Bill is going to come back to us before 31 March, with or without the amendment we are looking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot introduce the amendment because it is outside the procedural rules of the Seanad.  It would impose a potential charge.  The charge would occur if the married women concerned who are eligible for work and who apply for unemployment assistance happen to be living still with their husbands and who can satisfy a means test and satisfy the authorities that they do not have another source of income that would defeat the means test and all of those strict criteria and that they are available for work and so on. That is what we are talking about and it is a cast-iron situation that this Bill would come back to us before 31 March.  We have a number of precedents a lot more complex than this, of legislation going through both Houses on the one day.  We are talking about removing just one discrimination. It was brought in in the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933 to cater for married women.  There may be <Col N="433" /> an earlier history of it, but the amendment to the 1981 Act carried forward the discrimination of the 1933 Act.  It applies only to married women and we are going to remove it for the kind of reasons that Senator McGuinness, Senator Murphy and others have argued.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of the other House being aware that the only amendment this House could make was a deletion of the section, with the knowledge that it was going back to the Dáil which has power to amend and remove the discrimination. It could come back to this House, it could all be done on Monday morning, Monday afternoon, Tuesday morning or Tuesday afternoon as the Minister chooses.  To suggest that we somehow cannot do it, either on procedural grounds or on cost grounds is, I submit, not in conformity with reality.</P>

      <P>In response to Senator Dooge, I want to make clear what I was trying to establish: it was that the Deputies in the Dáil were quite clear on what was involved.  The Senator mentioned there were only three columns.  There was a Second Stage discussion on it as well.</P>

      <P>There was agreement between the Whips.  It was discussed at the same time and Deputies were &mdash; I am speaking from memory here &mdash; quite clear because the point was brought out and discussed in the House.  The problem about the cost is there are legal implications and Senator Robinson is very fully aware of these and very much involved in them currently, as she has said.  I am advised by the Department that the implication of taking at this time the broader change which Senator Robinson suggests are that they would have to apply also in the other areas as the dependency would be effective in disability and unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They would have to apply and they would be there.  One would create the precedent immediately in relation to them and the next step should be to take those together at the one time. That was the way it was being approached by the Department.  That is where the cost arises globally, in doing that for £20 million.</P>
      <P>I do not know how Senator Robinson reckons that it would be possible for us to pay people almost immediately.  We have to get authorisation before we can go completely to the finishing point on the administration.  We are almost ready to commence much of that.  We are in an exceptionally difficult position from the point of view of social welfare.  I have had Senators talking to me this afternoon about delays which occur with changeovers and transfers and whatever else. The reason why the Whips in the other House agreed on this Bill was because it gave everything the previous Government had been giving and something more and that it involved substantial improvements at this time, and particularly that it involved that there was a crucial time scale.</P>
      <P>Even when the Bill has gone through the Dáil and the Seanad it still must go to the President and even though we would get an agreement about the urgency from the President, you still have a matter of a day or two involved.  That is the danger there.  There is very considerable risk.  I must make it very clear and I thought that I had, but Senator Dooge wants me to spell it out, that I am not prepared at this time to go ahead with a further amendment and the Government are not prepared to go ahead with a further amendment at present.  We have an improvement involved which Senator Robinson suggested should be taken out so that discrimination against separated married women would be removed.  I am not in a position to go any further than that at present.</P>

The matter was not fully debated, as Senator Dooge has already indicated.  Let us be clear about that.  I do not accept that there are legal, procedural or financial barriers which are insurmountable.  I believe that it is possible to remove this discrimination which we cannot stand over.  We are talking about breadwinners in families looking for eligibility for unemployment assistance.  I submit that the amendment should be put.</P>
      <P>The Minister is quite clear when he says he has no intention of bringing in a ministerial amendment.  The Minister said if we vote down this section with the partial removal of the anomaly that when it returns to the Dáil he is not prepared to introduce an amendment in order to remove the full anomaly.  Would his attitude then be to restore the removed section? Would he move an amendment to that effect?</P>

The moneys which are involved here are tied into the the budget, as Senators are well aware.  I have brought this amendment to the House and if the House rejects it, I can do nothing further about it.  I will certainly take the matter from there and back to the Dáil.  At this stage I must leave the responsibility to the common sense of Senators and their sense of responsibility in relation to this area.  It is fair to say that when the Whips in the Lower House considered what is involved in the Bill they agreed on the passage of the Bill because it meant an improvement over what was envisaged previously.</P>

      <P>The reasons we were trying to assist Senator Robinson is that we realised the anomaly and did not want payment to social welfare recipients to be delayed by three months.  In the event of the withdrawal of this section now is it the Minister's intention to resubmit the Bill to the Dáil with this amendment put back in or, has he no intention of submitting the amended legislation to the Dáil for debate?  This is a point of procedure that I want clarification on.</P>

      <P>All I am prepared to say is that if the Seanad makes a particular decision I will consider the position after that.  At this stage, as Minister, I am not prepared to go further.  Senator Dooge wanted me to make the position quite clear and I think I have done so.  We have an excellent budget, a considerably improved budget on what was already a substantial contribution to the sector as a whole and this is recognised by people <Col N="437" /> generally.  I would like this House to recognise it but I am not prepared to go any further.</P>

      <P>The charge of seeking publicity is a double-edged one.  It may well be argued that the person making the charge is himself seeking publicity. What Senator Fallon says seems to be an attempt to blackmail us.  If there is an onus on us to be responsible in this matter, the ultimate responsibility rests <Col N="438" /> with the Government.  If we accept £20 million as being the approximate cost of all the consequential implications of this Bill then that £20 million will have to be found anyway, must be found.  By the time it is found the rate of inflation is going to be a lot more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had reference to £400,000 and to £20 million.  If we are talking about £20 million, we are talking about an extremely serious problem.  We know perfectly well from the precedents of the Oireachtas and elsewhere that if there was an emergency there would be no problem in getting legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas in a very short time.  We have to consider whether this is an emergency.  It seems that the Minister can very well promise that he will deal with this matter before December 1984.  We know the reality.  As soon as this discussion dies the matter will be put on the long finger, people will be appointed to look into it and it will be a long time before those concerned receive any satisfaction.</P>
      <P>We should remember in all this crying about social welfare recipients and so forth that they will be looked after as they are at present, but here we are talking about individual people who are being affected by real injustice.  This has been revealed by Senator Robinson.  It is now a matter that we have discussed and brought out very clearly and the question is whether we in the Seanad are prepared to deal with this problem, if we can, and whether the Minister is prepared to deal with it, whether his Government are prepared to deal with it and if those people who claim to be supporters of the Government are prepared to face up to this issue and to react in a socially progressive fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not spoken on this, and obviously one has to be impressed by the cogent argument advanced by Senator Robinson on the problem created by this peculiar conflict of dependency and the effect it has on the eligibility of certain married women to apply for and to get benefits to which <Col N="439" /> they would otherwise be entitled.  That is a discrimination which extends far beyond the unemployment assistance provisions, into other categories of our social welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point that all the problem must be tackled.  It may not be necessary to tackle it all simultaneously on the same day, but ideally it is important that this effort should be made in a coherent fashion.</P>
      <P>The Seanad, not for the first time in my short period here, is faced with a dilemma and this dilemma is not peculiar to this Government.  The dilemma is that refusal to pass this legislation would have very serious practical consequences for people who are depending on the legislation to be passed this week.  I do not know whether it is possible to recall the Dáil before next Tuesday.  I do not know whether it is possible to get the Bill reconsidered by the Dáil and passed in an amended form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that because it is not a matter which is within my control.  I will be gambling with the situation if I put forward the proposition that it is possible, and that it will be done. I do not trust this Minister to behave in a non-political fashion.  I do not trust this Government to behave in a non-political fashion, because I think this Government gladly would not pay people, and then blame us for it.  I am not willing to have that responsibility.  That is a political charge, because the way in which the Minister introduced the Social Welfare Bill, 1982, today was done in a blatantly political fashion which I objected to.  I believe that this is a Minister who will take every advantage for his own party, and I do not trust him accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from the practical school of politics.  I am not looking for any publicity &mdash; it would do me no good.  The method by which I arrived in this House is unlikely to be repeated for my benefit on this occasion.  In those circumstances I cannot support, no matter how much I might feel like it, Senator Robinson.  I <Col N="440" /> will not support Senator Robinson because it is outside my control.  What will happen if this Bill is amended?  I do not trust the present Government not to blame me and to blame my fellow Members for any unpleasant consequences which might occur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely feel that we had better have a determination of this matter fairly soon before we all get into all sorts of convoluted reasoning.  With respect to Senator O'Leary, he is somebody who has made a number of contributions to this House and with whom I have been in considerable sympathy.  The position is that the Dáil can be reconvened in time.  The Minister knows that very well and he knows that he can put the matter before the Dáil and that the whole matter can be dealt with.  If necessary we could meet over the weekend. We are talking about 31 March.  We are talking about discrimination against people.  It may be inconvenient, as Senator Ferris has said and I appreciate that it may be very inconvenient, but if we raise questions of convenience to Members of the Houses when we are talking about a basic issue of justice, a basic issue of blatant discrimination, people have to be counted on this issue.  I would hope that some of the married women, particularly on the other side of the House will be counted on this issue and vote in accordance with the real issue involved, which is that we should continue a discrimination. There will be no delay in any welfare payments made in response to the vote being taken.  If people are going to be browbeaten or bullied into thinking that, they have lost an opportunity to remove a discrimination.  They have been fooled and they have allowed themselves to be fooled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robinson has covered most of the ground I wanted to cover at this juncture.  The Minister has refused up to now to give a commitment that he would go further now.  He gave a two year commitment &mdash; he had no alternative &mdash; to change the provision.  Unless we receive a commitment from him that before the Dáil rises for the Easter <Col N="441" /> Recess an amending provision will be introduced to take account of the case that was made today, we have no alternative but to vote according to our conscience, irrespective of how inconvenient it is, in the knowledge that great powers can move swiftly when there is tremendous pressure on them.  This is an anomaly which cannot be allowed to go through here without reference being made to it and without doing the best we can as elected representatives in this House to try to ensure that this legislation will go through this House in the best possible form, no matter what the inconvenience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from what the Minister has said that he is prepared to take the maximum political advantage out of this situation.  He is not concerned basically with any kind of principle of justice.  He is concerned to get through a measure which is basically, as far as he is concerned, a vote-catching measure.  He is prepared to manipulate the people of this country, particularly those people who are suffering from this anomaly, to the maximum advantage.  He is prepared to manipulate the social welfare recipients by drawing out this matter as far as possible in order to get the maximum <Col N="442" /> advantage and to try to put us on this side of the House in a difficult position.</P>
      <P>We cannot allow ourselves to be blackmailed into this kind of situation.  It merely underlines very clearly to anybody who has any insight into this matter that we have at the moment a Government that have no concern for social injustice.  They are concerned purely with power for power's sake, with vote catching, and consequently the attempt to claim that the Minister is looking after the socially deprived is one of the most cynical exercises that I have heard or read in my time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I agree in principle and propose to support Senator Robinson, I have to dissociate myself from what Senator O'Connell said.  I do not think that attribution of cynicism to the Minister is necessarily connected with the dilemma in which the Minister now finds himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Murphy in saying that supporting Senator Robinson does not necessarily mean that one is attributing to the Minister a note of cynicism or lack of concern for people who are social welfare recipients.  One may very well feel that this is an area of discrimination which should be dealt with without feeling that there is no concern on the part of the Minister or on the part of his Government for social welfare beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like it to be thought that I was in any way attempting to be personally offensive to the Minister. This issue has served underlying political reality, and the political reality which this country faces is that we have in power at the moment a Government that is essentially conservative, that has no serious intent of dealing with radical and fundamental injustices in our society. This whole episode helps to illustrate the way in which procedural difficulties which can be overcome &mdash; and it has been shown very clearly by Senator Murphy and others that they can be overcome &mdash; are dismissed out of hand or used by the Minister as a means of maintaining <Col N="443" /> the general philosophy of his party and his Government, which is not to deal with the fundamental ills in our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refute that the Minister is in any way not concerned with justice.  He is totally so concerned, and has proved it in the past.  We all accept that there is an area of discrimination here.  But I would like to ask the other side of the House why this area of discrimination was not deleted in their term of office, if they are so concerned about it now.  Why did their Minister for Social Welfare not eliminate this terrible area of discrimination they talk about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not take personally anything Senators say.  I have learned that in the political arena.  I do not think I have any need to either, because I can stand over our actions recently and my own previously.  I know, for instance, that there is a whole range of things in the health area where there were very severe cutbacks in the budget prior to this one but where I have now succeeded in getting sufficient moneys to at least offset the worst elements.  These cutbacks <Col N="444" /> involved, for instance, putting a means test on the disabled for the equipment they got.  They involved many other things like this.  I am certainly not concerned. I know what we are about.  I know what we are doing.  I know the value of it, and I believe the people know the value of it.  The Bill contains an amendment to bring about an improvement, but what we are told is that the improvement is not wide enough or substantial enough.  It is an improvement that was not included by my predecessors. I have brought it in here now and at this stage I can only leave it to the Senators to make up their minds whether or not they wish to delete the benefit contained in this section.  There is a clear benefit to separated married women who badly need this benefit, who particularly need the benefit.  To deal with part of the overall discrimination which exists I am happy to put that much before the House. In any event, it would be my intention to pursue the elimination of the remaining areas of discrimination at the earliest possible time.</P>

      <P>On section 9, I and at least one other Senator raised a question in regard to the maintenance of the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo;.  The Minister gave us the cliché <Col N="445" /> answer that the parliamentary draftsman considered this was necessary.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding was that to put the word &ldquo;increase&rdquo; in instead as was suggested by one of the Senators would be more limited in its application. &ldquo;Vary&rdquo; would include a period, in other words, increasing it for a period of time such as a week or two weeks or a month. It was on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman in that respect that the word &ldquo;vary&rdquo; was used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>

      <P>If the Minister looks at section 308 in the principal Act it is stated the regulations under section 1 shall not so vary the rate of benefit allowance, pension or assistance so as to reduce the amount of rate payable at the commencement of the regulations.  The Minister has given the explanation that even if you did increase temporarily you might find that you could not go back.  A regulation could not be made which would vary them from what they were at the commencement of the new regulation. A temporary increase would not allow you go back.  The Minister's explanation is in order.</P>

      <P>I am not interested in who made the arrangements whether it was the Minister or his predecessor because I would be equally critical of his predecessor as of him.  My suspicions were entirely correct.  I am sure that the Minister did not plan it himself because he did not sit down and work out the scheme, but it is not without significance that children are not mentioned in it at all.  That is quite unusual and the reason is that the more children you have under the new scheme the less increase you get so that when you come to the fifth child you get no increase in respect of that child.  You may get an increase in respect of the child under the children's allowances but that children's allowances increase is the same increase as is given to everybody who has a fifth child whether the person is working or not. The basic family income of a person on social welfare is not being increased in respect of the fifth child.  What is it in respect of the third, fourth and fifth child at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We see what has happened and I am not blaming the Minister. In respect of, say, the first qualified child the increase has been from £6.70 to £7.50 <Col N="448" /> or an increase of 80p.  Far from being an increase of 25 per cent in social welfare, those who have children are not getting an increase of 25 per cent in respect of their basic family income.  When that is taken together with the increase in the children's allowance it comes to 25 per cent, but if you are comparing two families, one of whom have a father and/or mother in employment and who do not receive social welfare, they are getting the ordinary increase which such persons get in their employment and they are also getting the children's allowances which are, as the Minister said rightly, increased substantially.</P>
      <P>The social welfare recipient is not getting the much-heralded 25 per cent in respect of the child dependant.  In some cases he is getting no increase at all, and in other cases he is getting something around 10 per cent or 12 per cent in the case of the first child.  It is not without significance that the tables which we see do not explain to people with one, two, three and four children the increase which they are getting.  That increase does not amount to 25 per cent, and the general public are not aware of that.  It is not good enough that it should be hidden like this.  It is not referred to in any way in any document on which I have been able to lay my hands so far.  It is not referred to in the tables.  No example of the effect on children is given in the Minister's table because his excellent officials, recognising that it was a politically disadvantageous thing to do, would remove it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances I would like to make representation to the Minister to bring through the 25 per cent increase to which people are entitled.  People with children require the full additional increase over and above the rather meagre increases &mdash; indeed in one case the increase is non-existent &mdash; which are provided in this legislation.  That is a vital necessity and I take this opportunity of protesting at the way this matter has been handled; whether by this or the last Government is irrelevant.  The Minister is responsible for his present legislation and what has happened is misleading to the <Col N="449" /> general public and I protest most strongly.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator O'Leary, in my speech I made it very clear in the first instance that no attempt has been made by my predecessors or myself to hide what was involved.  It has been made very explicit that it was to be a 25 per cent overall increase.  One effect of the application of the formula which was made clear to everybody &mdash; it was made clear in the course of an election, which is most unusual &mdash; would have been that certain of the rates would be due for a reduction.  No rates were reduced on that formula.  The formula was applied but in no case was there a reduction, quite obviously, when it came to the sixth child because the children's allowances have gone up from £9 to £17.50 per month.  The effect of that was greater at that stage.</P>

      <P>I would like to note the passage of a Bill which gave the Seanad a very rare opportunity of taking an important initiative in advancing social justice and social reform.  It gave us the opportunity to remove, not an academic discrimination but a very real discrimination on the ground for certain workers in this country and for certain citizens available for work who are barred through an illegal, discriminatory technicality, through a special barrier imposed against them, from being eligible for qualifying certificates for unemployment assistance.  It was a rare opportunity because potentially there was a majority to carry that reform in this House and because in the other House there was no clear, overall Government majority which could have replaced the <Col N="450" /> section opposed in this House, and where, therefore, a very strong likelihood was that the reform would have been carried through in the other House. Different people have to assess a situation at the time and I accept that the assessment by Senators on this side of the House who did not support the amendment was in good faith and exercising judgment.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to reflect on how a situation can appear to be one of such urgency.  An overall situation of apparent blackmail and cajoling may seem to be such that Senators feel that they cannot, even though they want to, to support a reform which is in the interests of social justice and which would remove a legal discrimination.</P>
      <P>I believe that it is quite within the competence and the obligation of the Government to recall the Dáil on Monday and to take the necessary measures to ensure that no delay would occur. Even had there been a week's delay I wonder how many of the beneficiaries would have minded waiting another week, if those in receipt of their social welfare benefits learned that the reason for the delay of a week was that another category excluded from access to a social welfare allowance which they should get as a right were having that discrimination removed.  I believe there would have been a willingness on the part of the other beneficiaries to wait a week or so, even the blind, the widows, and those whose case was pleaded for on the other side of the House.  There would have a willingness, particularly among women who are a very broad category of beneficiaries, to allow a certain minimal delay on behalf of their sisters in order to remove a discrimination. I do not accept that there need have been a delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had no definite commitment from the Minister as to when he will remove this and other discriminations from the social welfare code.  He admits he must do it before December 1984 but further than that he will not go.  This is a very serious reflection and I hope that this debate will be noted particularly by women and that they will realise that change will be achieved only when people <Col N="451" /> are committed to removing discrimination and are willing to pay a price and have bluffs called on the matter, people who do not collapse when procedural arguments are advanced.</P>
    <P>I very much regret that although there was a potential majority on this side of the House, certain people in good faith allowed themselves to be persuaded by the arguments put up by the Minister. Such arguments do not stand examination and the Minister would have been obliged to take the necessary steps to recall the Dáil and have the Bill enacted in time.  Even if there had been a minimal delay it would not have caused such hardship that this step should not have been taken in the interests of social justice. This was potentially a unique example of an instance where the Seanad could have exerted itself and taken an initiative for social change by removing discrimination which affects a considerable number of our fellow citizens.  This was an opportunity lost and I very much regret it.  The Minister has not yet indicated when he will take the initiative and seek to remove these discriminations.</P>

      <Col N="452" /> That Seanad Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft &mdash;</P>
    <P>Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1982</P>
    <P>a copy of which Regulations in draft was laid before the House on 18 March, 1982.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) of section 9 of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, provides that the Minister for Health may, by regulations, vary the income ceiling level which, taken in conjunction with the rate of health contributions applicable, determines the maximum amounts of contributions payable in respect of an individual in any particular contribution year. Subsection (5) of section 9 of the Act of 1979 requires that a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft regulations has been passed by each House.  The draft regulations now before the House deal with the income ceiling which, it is proposed, shall apply in relation to the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1982.</P>
      <P>The proposed new income ceiling is £9,500.  This will apply to the contribution year commencing 6 April 1982.  This ceiling of £9,500 is the same as that specified in the Social Welfare Bill, 1982, which we have already discussed.  In addition the income ceiling for eligibility for health services is being raised to £9,500 from 1 June.  This will ensure that persons whose income was over £8,500 and below £9,500 in the year ending 5 April 1982 will for the coming year be entitled to free hospital consultant services in a public ward.  This will retain eligibility for people in this category.</P>
      <P>The reason for the later date of 1 June arises from the need to produce evidence of income when claiming entitlement. The usual evidence required in the case of employed persons is the form p.60 issued by employers.  This is not usually available until late April or May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> However, the later date is to the general advantage of applicants as their eligibility during the months of April and May 1982 will depend on their income for the previous year which ended on 5 April 1981.</P>
    <P>All persons are now entitled to free hospital in-patient services in a public ward and to free out-patient services. Those who had incomes of £9,500 or more in the year ending 5 April 1982 will be liable to pay the consultants' fees.</P>
    <P>The original ceiling level specified in the Health Contributions Act, 1979, was £5,000.  This was varied to £5,500 before income related health contributions came into operation on 6 April 1979.  The latter sum was varied to £7,000 under regulations approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas in March 1980 and applied to the contribution year commencing on 6 April, 1980.  This ceiling was increased again in 1981 to £8,500 with effect from 6 April 1981.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of collection of health contributions, income is divided into three streams:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Income which is liable for income tax under the PAYE system and which is derived from insurable employment;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Income which is liable for income tax under the PAYE system but which is not derived from insurable employment;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Income which does not fall within the previous categories such as income from farming, the income of self-employed persons and investment income.</P>
    <P>The collection of health contributions from employees is integrated with the administrative machinery for the collection of pay-related social insurance contributions and redundancy contributions through the PAYE tax system.</P>
    <P>It is therefore necessary that the ceiling levels for social insurance, redundancy and health contributions should be identical. Otherwise the operation of the collection system would be more costly and far more cumbersome.  In particular, the <Col N="454" /> co-ordinated arrangements facilitate employers in the administrative processes involved at their end.</P>
    <P>The collection of health contributions from individuals with income which is liable for income tax but which is not derived from insurable employment is arranged through the tax collection system. The collection of health contributions in respect of income derived from farming is administered by health boards. Taking into account the present situation in farming income the multiplier which is used by health boards in the notional assessment of income for health contributions purposes will remain unaltered for the contribution year 1982-83 at 117.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that raising the ceiling level from £8,500 to £9,500 will result in an increase in-the amount of contributions to be collected of approximately £2,000,000 in the contribution year 1982-83.  Of the estimated additional income about £200,000 should arise in the calendar year 1982.  The remainder of the additional yield should be paid over in the first quarter of 1983.  This position arises simply because most contributors with incomes under £9,500 will not have paid over their maximum contribution by the end of 1982.  These represent by far the greatest proportion of income earners.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the purpose of the draft regulations is to fix the upper limit of income in relation to which the amount of the health contributions payable in respect of any one individual in the contribution year commencing 6 April 1982, will be determined.  I now ask the House to approve of the Health Contributions (Yearly Reckonable Income) (Variation) Regulations, 1982 in draft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. S. O'Leary Mr. S. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael Members, I express support for this motion.  It conforms with the general wish on all sides of the House that the health contributions and, indeed, the eligibility levels under the various schemes covered and mentioned by the Minister in his contribution should be reviewed periodically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the establishment of a level for the health regulations leaves <Col N="455" /> the Minister in somewhat of a dilemma because, as he quite clearly points out, it is necessary to have the social insurance redundancy and the health contributions at the same level.  Therefore, because quite considerable cost arises in respect of any extra contribution &mdash; in this case there is an increase from £8,500 to £9,500 &mdash; one is slow to recommend that the figure should be higher.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is absolutely legally necessary that the question of eligibility for free hospital consultancy services should be at precisely the same level.  The Minister might inform me of that.  I recognise that it is now at the same level and it is proposed to keep it at the same level. The contribution should continue up to and including £9,500 and the person whose income is over £8,500 and below £9,500 will now be eligible, as a result of this legislation, for free hospital consultancy services.  Is there automatically a tie in between those two figures?  For example, would it have been open to the Minister to say that everybody below £10,000 would be entitled to free hospital consultancy services even though they would not have paid any health contribution in respect of the last £500 of their income?  I say this because we must recognise that in the last 12 months there has been an increase in salary of 11.7 per cent, which represents the amount of the increase from £8,500 to £9,500.  If we are limiting the people who are now eligible for free hospital consultancy services to those who will have earned £9,500 up to April, 1982, there will be a certain number of people who were just below the limit of £8,500 and who because of the rate of increase in salaries in respect of that year will now in the following year fall out of the category entitled to free hospital consultancy services.</P>
    <P>We got into serious difficulty a number of years ago with regard to that and the restoration of something like a satisfactory situation required great effort, great political skill of negotiation with hospital consultants and with various other interested parties.  It took up a considerable amount of time of successive Minister of Health.  I would, therefore, like the Minister <Col N="456" /> to inform me if it is automatic that the £9,500 will also apply to the hospital consultancy services and if he recognises that, by increasing the limit by only 11.7 per cent, the number of people covered by free hospital consultancy services is likely to be less as a result of limiting the increase from £8,500 to £9,500.</P>
    <P>I believe what I have said is correct.  If it is, the number of people who will be covered by free hospital consultancy services will reduce.  I am not sure that is such a good thing.  Successive Ministers had to pay such a large political price to expand the service to the level to which it has been expanded now, in the face of considerable opposition from those with legitimate interests in this area, that I would not like this advantage to be wasted through an inadequate increase year by year.  In general I would like to welcome the motion and to say we will be supporting the draft regulations.</P>

      <P>The limit is part of the budget undertakings, so that I was not really in a position to vary one way or another at this point in time.  It is all tied in with the total package.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of having the £9,500 here, I think the Senator accepts the administrative necessity there in relation to the social welfare contribution, the PRSI.  As far as eligibility is concerned, legally there would not be anything to prevent them from being different. However, administratively, it would cause a fair deal of confusion.  The general intention is that roughly the same number of people will continue to be eligible.  If it is found that there is any significant departure from that, it is something we will have to consider.  The initial intention is that approximately the same number will be eligible.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to continue the review of the Constitution by an advisory committee with a view to its completion before the end of this year, and to present to the Seanad and Dáil the results of this review.</P>
      <P>I indicated today that I thought we should have time available to discuss some of the motions on the Order Paper.  I must confess that I thought we would have more time available than in fact we have.  However, interest was expressed in the question of taking other motions on the next day.  Accordingly, I think it would be quite feasible for us between now and 8.30 to complete this motion.  I intend to make a very brief opening speech to facilitate the Seanad if it wishes to complete this motion today.</P>
      <P>The motion asks that the review of the Constitution at expert level, which is now taking place in the Attorney General's office, should continue.  It, secondly, asks that they should work with despatch and complete their work at the very latest by the end of this year.  Thirdly, it asks that the result of this work should be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas for debate.</P>
      <P>I would like briefly to attempt to justify these three points of the motion.  We debated here towards the beginning of the session of this particular Seanad the general question of the Constitution. There was then quite a large majority in this House supporting the point of view that there should be a review of the Constitution. I have always held this view.  I remember the committee that made an interim report in 1967.  Constitutions should always be reviewed because, if they are not reviewed by Parliament and the people, then the so-called rigid Constitutions will be amended by continual judicial review which will amount to amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should follow the process of <Col N="458" /> review.  We can make this process most efficient if we, first of all, get the views of expert constitutional lawyers.  We should then have a through debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas where we can get the political input into what is essentially a political problem.  I agree with what Senator Robinson said earlier today on this point.  This is the essential input.  But I think, provided it does not delay things, then it is useful to have working papers, reports, which essentially are a number of working papers prepared by experts.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the reasons for review.  There are reasons for the review of the Constitution that are purely domestic.  There are reasons that relate to the process of reconciliation between the two traditions in this island whose division has given rise to so much tragedy. The members of the Attorney General's committee were chosen completely for their expertise.  There is not such a supply of experts on constitutional law that it was a matter of picking and choosing. There is of course a new Attorney General.  He may well feel that he would like to add one or two other persons, but I doubt that the Attorney General, being the excellent lawyer that he is, would wish to dispense with the services of any of those who are presently operating.</P>
    <P>This House should express its opinion on this matter and should call on the Government to give the Attorney General the necessary authorisation.  There is much work to be done at this expert level. The words &ldquo;call on the Government&rdquo; are used in the motion itself.  The meaning of the word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; is open to doubt.  The word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; has three meanings in the Constitution. There is an attempt to overcome some of the difficulties by occasionally using a lower case &ldquo;g&rdquo; or an upper case &ldquo;G&rdquo;.  The body we are calling on is referred to in the Constitution by the same word used here.  If one looks at Articles 1, 6 and 28, one sees these difficulties.  The Irish is not quite so ambiguous because alternative phrases are used.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I recommend to Seanad Éireann this motion which calls for a continuation of this review, for the work <Col N="459" /> to be completed with dispatch and for the report to be presented in Seanad Éireann and in another place.  It may be that when it comes to the Seanad or the other place the political decision will be made to proceed no further.  This process of review which was initiated by Seán Lemass in 1966 and was stillborn, has again been initiated and should be continued.  I recommend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion.  The day this motion was introduced in the presence of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, I outlined my reasons for wanting a constitutional and legislative review.  I explained that there were areas of progressive legislation which were required in this country but which were precluded from being put into operation because of constitutional restraints.  If Ireland is to progress, and to be seen by the rest of the world as doing that, it is obvious that our Constitution should not inhibit that progress. There are several areas in which it is obvious there is not alone a need for a review but a real need for change.  I will not spell out what those areas are, because that would be the purpose of the constitutional review and the people involved would highlight what areas, if any, needed amending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from experience over the last two years that there are areas in need of legislative change.  The Constitution debars certain progressive legislation being put into operation, such as the Rent Restriction Bill and the Land Bill, which was promised by the previous Government. We knew there would be constitutional difficulties raised under those Bills.  If the anomalies are highlighted in a review, the report would then be a subject for discussion in both Houses of the Oireachtas and it would be for the Government of the day to accept or reject the findings of the review committee. Hopefully, then, the people would be in a position to voice their opinions on it, especially if some sections were subjected to a referendum.  We cannot stand idly by and say that our Constitution, which was drawn up many years ago, should remain <Col N="460" /> intact today and should not be tempered with.  In the earlier debate Senators spoke about certain areas they were afraid to change, but this subject was never mentioned by the other side of the House when we were discussing the review committee. We are calling on this Government to continue this review so that at the end of the day we can all sit down and look at what the committee suggest are necessary legislative changes so that we can progress.</P>
    <P>The initiation of this review by Deputy Garret FitzGerald was welcomed not only in Ireland but internationally as a major step forward so that any anomalies that might exist <i>vis-à-vis</i> our separated brethren in Northern Ireland could be removed.  This would bring the eventual unity of this country much closer than a mere aspiration to which we all subscribe. The anomalies in our Constitution make the reunification of Ireland very difficult in the short term.  I have no doubt that a review of the Constitution is necessary and I sincerely hope the Government will carry out this review and bring the findings of the committee to both Houses in the immediate future, because this matter is very urgent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion in a non-partisan spirit as an Independent who holds very strong views about what should be done constitutionally, but that is not at issue in this motion. I support the idea that the new Government should encourage the work of the advisory committee and bring it to completion, and, as the motion says, report to the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been looking at the report of the Committee on the Constitution, December 1967.  It is a remarkable thing when we reflect that the initiative for this was taken in August 1966, in the euphoric aftermath of the 1916 anniversary celebrations. That points up how the all-party committee set to work in a remarkable atmosphere of detachment.  It is good to note that two of the members of that committee of eleven are with us tonight &mdash; Senator Dooge and Senator Ryan.  It might be no harm to quote from the preface to that document some of the <Col N="461" /> conclusions of the committee.  They said certain things would not change in any constitutional review, such as national sovereignty, supremacy of the people, universal franchise, fundamental rights, freedom of speech, association and religion. They also said, when they had their work completed, that the review had been worthwhile and they hoped similar reviews would take place after suitable intervals in the future.  They went on to say it was their earnest wish that every citizen, and particularly every public representative, would analyse most carefully the arguments for and against the propositions they had considered.</P>
    <P>My basic point is that if this could be done in the pre-troubles atmosphere of 1966-67, how much more important it is that it should be undertaken afresh in 1981-82.  Looking at the willingness to reappraise and to review in the late sixties, it is a rueful and dismal conclusion how reactionary the decade of the seventies has been and how regrettable it is that there is a reluctance to look again at the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I appeal to this Government to put aside their attitude of fear.  They are afraid apparently that by looking at the Constitution we are going to surrender and renege on our traditions.  All we are trying to do is look afresh at our heritage and see how it can be rearranged.  I do not accept for a moment that we are going to lose anything in a constitutional review.  It is simply adjusting what we have to the realities of the present day and to the knowledge we have now and which we did not have in the late sixties about the complexities of the conflict in Northern Ireland, and our new awareness of how difficult our relations with the North are and are going to be for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>Some people say that constitutional review means that the achievements of the Constitution and the establishment of individual rights under the Constitution, as they have been accepted and upheld by the court, will be at risk from the proceedings of the review committee.  I do not think that is so.  I do not think there is any question of setting aside the positive achievements and gains under <Col N="462" /> the decisions of the courts.  These can always be incorporated into any changes we may make in the Constitution.  We must remember as well that the Constitution in itself is not sacred.  What may be sacred are some of the principles enshrined in the Constitution.  It is very important not to see the Constitution as a sacred text which on no account is to be tampered with.  What is valuable are the values enshrined in the Constitution and I do not think that in 1982 any more than in 1967 anyone wants to interfere with those basic principles and values.</P>
    <P>I would appeal indirectly to Senator Ryan, who is representing the Government side, to remember that he was a party to that innovative committee in 1967.  If the minds of the party he represents were open in 1967 &mdash; there were five or six members of that committee from the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; why should their minds be closed now in 1982?  It seems that there is an overwhelming case for having a more open mind at this point.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important point of all in connection with this motion is that, for good or ill, the former Taoiseach has set a constitutional review in motion.  The work has begun and the whole process of debate has begun.  Last autumn in the country at large there was plenty of evidence that people were interested and willing to talk about the possibility of change.  I participated and talked to various groups in various parts of Ireland where the people certainly had a much more open mind than would seem to be indicated from the reaction of the new Government up to now.</P>
    <P>Certain things have been set in motion. The former Taoiseach has accustomed us to begin to discuss the possibility of constitutional change and under that new departure certain things have happened which are quite remarkable.  Let me cite the visit of Mr. Harold McCusker, M.P. to the remote and republican township of Skibbereen last November.  Mr. McCusker would not have come to Skibbereen &mdash; he told me this himself &mdash; if the whole logjam of misunderstanding had not been loosened up by the former Taoiseach. So, if there is going to be any <Col N="463" /> slowing down of the momentum it will be seen as an enormous reaction by Ulster Protestants.  The whole question simply cannot be arrested.  If nothing more is done it will be a positive reaction.  By getting people like Harold McCusker to Skibbereen and Robert McCartney to Dublin we were beginning to have the right &mdash; because we were engaging these people in dialogue and because the former Taoiseach was courageous enough to question and be prepared to debate the matter &mdash; to say to the McCuskers and the McCartneys, &ldquo;You will have to listen to us now about the Northern Catholics and about your relations with them&rdquo;.  So it seems that it is essential to continue the work that has been begun if we are to have the right at all to advise or to talk to people about the situation in Northern Ireland.  It is in the interest of better relations between the two communities in the North, of relations between North and South, and in the long term it is in the interest of unity, so much cherished in the Fianna Fáil philosophy and indeed in the philosophy of all of us.  In the most detached and non-partisan of spirit I appeal to the Fianna Fáil Party and to the incoming Government to maintain the momentum that has begun.</P>

      <P>Though I am happy to be called to speak I regret that this is inevitably going to be a very one-sided debate here this evening.  There appears to be nobody offering from the other side of the House.  That is really very remarkable. I appreciate that the matter was voted on against the views of the Government side of the House and that there was an amendment to the Order of Business to take this motion.  But the motion having been taken, I would have thought there would have been some view to be expressed on a matter which is of such importance as the review of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I approach this question in very much the same spirit as it was approached by Senator Murphy.  I do not think that this motion should be approached in a partisan fashion.  What we are considering is <Col N="464" /> whether this House would like to see a technical review, which has already been embarked on and carried out by a group of experts brought together by the former Attorney General, continue either with the same people &mdash; for the reason given by Senator Dooge, that they are nonpolitical and non-partisan &mdash; or with the addition of some other experts in the particular area if the Attorney General so wishes.</P>
    <P>I find myself in a certain dilemma because when that technical committee were established by the former Attorney General to advise him they were regarded by the media &mdash; I think mistakenly &mdash; as the review of the Constitution which had been launched.  I remember particularly that the <i>Irish Independent</i> ran it on their outside page as &ldquo;Committee established by Attorney General to review the Constitution&rdquo;.  Suddenly, yet again politicians had backed away from the problem.  It had been side-stepped and had been somehow passed on to a committee of legal experts.  From my discussions with him I do not think this was at all the intention of the then Attorney General, Mr. Peter Sutherland.  He had not intended that this committee would take away the major responsibility and political thrust of an essentially political debate which was, if not launched, certainly baptised in this House by Deputy Garret FitzGerald when Taoiseach in a major debate which was to launch a political discussion.</P>
    <P>We have to talk about two very different matters.  One is the review by a committee of experts brought together by the Attorney General of various sections, of various provisions, where it may be that politicians would like to have alternative wording, would like to have interpretation and working papers and advice.  That is what we are talking about when we talk about the continuation of a review.  But the particular legal experts are not the appropriate people to consider the crunch points, the real issues, the crunch points of Articles 2 and 3, the crunch point of the removal of the ban on divorce, the crunch point of the question of the protection of property, the crunch point of whether we require an amend- <Col N="465" /> ment to protect the unborn child or whether that is already adequately protected. These are the very important political problems that politicians should be facing up to.  Senator Murphy referred to the former report on the Constitution published in December 1967.  That was a political grouping which included Senator Dooge and Senator Eoin Ryan.  It was an all-party committee.  I agree with Senator Murphy that it is a pity that we have lost the possibility of having that kind of all-party committee where politicians try to face up to the particular problems.  It is worth remembering that that committee which published their report in December 1977 recommended a change in relation to the prohibition on divorce, and any change recommended had to be a unanimous decision of the committee. When an all-party committee got together in the middle sixties, in 1966-67, they were able to agree on the thorny issue that it would be desirable to remove the total ban on divorce.  There was a suggestion of alternative wording which would have permitted divorce for persons whose own religion would allow them to apply for a divorce, and they could get that divorce before the Irish courts.</P>
    <P>We now come to 1981-82 and it appears from the debates we had in this House when Deputy Garret FitzGerald was Taoiseach that we could not have that kind of either formal or informal committee on the Constitution at this stage. That is part of the price we are paying for the divisions in this land, and the kind of political aspirations and the methods used by some parties in furthering those aspirations which have led to polarisation. That is to be very deeply regretted, because we need political attention paid to our Constitution.  We need political reform of that Constitution.  If we are to have political reform of the Constitution, it would be of immense assistance to politicians to have the kind of technical review by a committee of experts which would explain the provisions to us, given us alternative wordings, point out implications of a change in one sector, and point out the need to interpret the Constitution as a whole.</P>
    <P>Clearly this is badly needed because, <Col N="466" /> as I said when this matter was being put forward by Senator Dooge earlier today as an amendment to the Order of Business, the Government of the day are identifying as the only possible change in the Constitution we are likely to see in this coming year a proposal to amend the Constitution to protect the rights of the unborn.  The judicial statements we have had so far interpreting the Constitution affirm that the right to life is a right under Article 40, section 3.  It is one of the personal rights of the citizen and it extends to the unborn child.  I have not heard any Government Minister or the Taoiseach explain why it is felt to be necessary to have this constitutional amendment.  I have seen no wording, no words, no text, nothing but a commitment which appears to have been given to a lobby by a private sector which lobbied the Taoiseach and he gave that undertaking.  Apparently he is prepared &mdash; presumably we will get some more specific detail on it &mdash; to introduce what I believe is an academic amendment, to underline twice Article 40, section 3, or in some way affirm what is already there.</P>
    <P>A constitutional referendum involves a great deal of time and commitment.  It involves a Bill going through both Houses.  It involves the expense of a referendum, and it involves the participation of citizens.  That is quite a considerable expenditure of energy, administration, commitment, time, and so on. Why are we not spending half that time and half the cost of a referendum on trying to meet the practical problem on the ground of unwanted pregnancies and the fact that an increasing number of women go each year from Ireland to various cities in Britain to have abortions? That is the problem we are trying to deal with.  Why do we not remove the discrimination against illegitimacy?  Why do we not provide better economic, social and financial rights for single families and rights for families, because not all of the women who go for abortions are single women; a number of them are married women but they cannot cope with further unwanted pregnancies.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting that this whole lobby on the right to life are not addressing <Col N="467" /> themselves to these problems.  They are not part of the pressure to increase immensely the budget of Cherish and other organisations who cope with the single mother and child.  They are not looking for changes in the law in relation to illegitimacy.  They are not calling on the Government.  They appear to have the same kind of hold on The Taoiseach as Deputy Gregory has.  Let them use that hold to bring about the legal, financial and social reforms we need, and that will reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and the number of women who exercise the option of going to a city in Britain for abortions.</P>
    <P>We have so many Irish responses and Irish solutions to Irish problems.  Please let us not have an academic exercise of so-called constitutional reform in one of the areas where we do not need it, in order to avoid coping with our real, pressing social problems on the ground where we have women going on a lonely trail, on an expensive trail, in fear, in dread, in guilt, without proper advice and counselling beforehand, without proper after-care and counselling, who are left very much to their own devices and resources and who are forced by the pressures we have created in our society to take the step they are taking, and who badly need to have these practical problems dealt with.  If we came down from the hypocritical heights of moral condemnation and started to deal with the problem on the ground, we could make very substantial progress in favour of life and in favour of the right of the unborn child to be born, a right protected by our Constitution.</P>
    <P>There are other areas where there is a clear political need for reform.  One of these areas is in relation to the protection of property as outlined at the moment in the Constitution.  It is a particularly difficult area.  For that reason alone it is important to have the help of experts. There are two articles that we are concerned about.  We are concerned about Article 40, section 3, which is the main article on personal rights, including the right to life and the right to life of the unborn child, and Article 43.  It is not <Col N="468" /> possible to envisage a change to Article 40, section 3, protecting the personal rights of the citizen without very serious ramifications.  If there was to be a change it would have to be in relation to Article 43.  Any politician faced with trying to devise a way in which we could bring the terms of the protection of property in the Constitution more into line with the kind of measures for social progress we wish to adopt, whether it be in relation to rent restriction or control of building land, or whatever the particular issue may be, knows we need expert advice and help on this.</P>
    <P>I have another reason for being slightly concerned about giving too much authority and attention to the committee of experts brought together by the Attorney General.  On these kinds of issues, which, as Senator Murphy pointed out, are issues of political values, and whether they are in conformity with the modern Irish faith, whether they meet the needs of a young growing population, it is politicians who must decide on what the values will be.  If the matter is left to either the existing committee of legal experts &mdash; the one brought together by the former Attorney General or even if a name or two were to be substituted &mdash; by the nature of the persons involved, some are lawyers, some are academics, one or two of them are practitioners, they tend to be conservative on these issues. They probably would not regard that as a criticism.  They might even regard it as a compliment.  They are conservative with a small &ldquo;c&rdquo; in the sense that they would tend to view the provisions relating to property rights in particular from a conservative perspective.</P>
    <P>It is important to see this committee of experts as being an aid to politicians, but no more than that.  Certainly from the perspective of a person belonging to a party seeking fairly radical social reform, we would benefit from the work of this committee.  At times we would approach in a different way the wording of articles or the particular values underlining them because we would wish to see some change that would reflect the very real pressures which have come since the last review of the Constitution.  These pressures <Col N="469" /> did not exist in 1966 because we had a stable or slightly declining population. We have reason not to be very proud of our record because, even though matters have not polarised and even though there have been changes, we have lived in comparative peace in this part of this country.</P>
    <P>I regret very much what appears to be the attitude of the present Taoiseach, that apart from his concession on this constitutional referendum we do not need, he does not envisage any changes other than that, certainly at present, and in some vague way, because he will do so only when we are all around the table again with the people on the Unionist side in Northern Ireland.  There is that awful credibility gap as to why on earth the Unionists and other sections in Northern Ireland should come to that table.  But apparently we are not to have any social and Constitutional reform here until that mythical moment when everybody gets around the table.  I have never believed that was a credible stance.  I have admired the courage of Deputy FitzGerald, when Taoiseach, in launching the constitutional debate.  I have differed on some details with it.  I believe that that debate has captured public imagination, that it ought to go ahead and I believe it will be greatly assisted by a continuous review and by papers supplied by legal experts on this committee established by the Attorney General.  I should like to see that continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on the Order of Business today that this motion was brought before the House with little or no notice, did not enable Members of the House to give it proper consideration and did not enable us to have a Minister here to talk on the motion.  To the best of my knowledge the Government have not yet seen the work done by this committee and certainly have not had an opportunity of deciding whether or not the work should continue.  Therefore, even if a Minister had been available he would not be able to express a view or give any decision whether or not it was proposed to continue with the work of this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> As far as I personally am concerned I do not disagree with the general proposition that the Constitution should be looked at from time to time but that is not really what is before us.  This motion is not that there should be a review of the Constitution, it is that this committee should continue their deliberations.  Without knowing what this committee have been doing, without knowing what progress they have made or in what way they are working, it would be impossible to express a view whether it would be a good idea for them to continue with their deliberations.  Consequently the whole way in which this motion has been introduced, its terms of reference, its very narrow approach, make it virtually impossible to speak at any length or give any serious view about whether or not this is worthy of support.</P>
    <P>When the Government have time to look at the work of this committee undoubtedly they will bear in mind the views which have been expressed here in the House and in due course will make up their minds whether this committee should continue, or perhaps whether some other kind of committee should be set up to review the Constitution.  But for the moment they have not reached that stage and, for much the same reason that they are not in a position to take a decision, I find myself in a difficulty about expressing a view on a committee, of the work of which I am not aware and of the merit of which I am also not aware. In those circumstances I do not feel I can express any view one way or the other about this motion.</P>

      <P>In view of the discussion that has just taken place, and also in view of an agreement into which I entered &mdash; I am not quite sure whether I am in order in referring to this agreement &mdash; with a distinguished Member of the House with regard to the possibility of him assisting me to return to this House on another occasion, he has indicated that he was not prepared to support me in any election unless I was prepared to give him some kind of guarantee that my contributions in any future House would be substantially less than they have been in the present one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to two points with regard to the constitutional review which were unfortunate.  These were with regard to the perception of the constitutional review.  The first point is that the constitutional review, as it is called, should not be regarded as something that is there as a sop to Unionists, that is something that would not take place or should not take place if the Northern problem, as it is called, were to be removed.  In other words this is something that should take place not because we are doing it as a gesture to our separated brethren but because it is good in itself.  The second aspect is &mdash; this is a point that has been made elsewhere and I have tried to make it as well &mdash; that this is not just a constitutional review, it is not just a legislative review, it is something very much deeper, something which at a certain stage in the development of our society we need to have, in other words, a far-reaching debate on the nature of our society as it is at present <Col N="472" /> and a debate that would involve a fair amount of questioning.</P>
    <P>This questioning need not necessarily be something of which we should be afraid.  It may well be that there are aspects of our society &mdash; and one can think of them &mdash; which would emerge fortified and re-invigorated by such a debate.  Nevertheless the fact remains &mdash; and it is something that we as public representatives have been very much concerned about over the last year &mdash; that our society is in a crisis, the economic and financial aspects of which a great deal of attention is devoted to in political life are the symptoms of a very much deeper crisis in our society.  This is not removed from the question of a Constitution.  A Constitution should reflect those aspects of our national philosophy on which we as a nation can agree.  There would be some who would argue that, in the context of a pluralistic society, it would be difficult to find such points on which we could agree.  But it seems to me that if we consider our society as it is, consider from whence it has come, and consider those themes and patterns in our history which have brought us to the position in which we are, we are not just entitled but have a duty to consider where we stand in relation to those themes and patterns. Consequently, if we carry out such a debate, such an investigation, if we are prepared to question aspects of our society, we will then be able to find how far we have moved from those objectives of our ancestors and antecedents and where we should go from here.</P>
    <P>Consequently I would plead with the present Government and with the members of the Government Party to consider the question of this review, to face up to the questioning involved, to do so with courage, with an open mind because it is something &mdash; as Senator Robinson and others have said &mdash; in which we should all involve ourselves in a non-partisan way in the hope of taking our society out of the crisis in which it finds itself at present and moving forward toward a future more in line with the aspirations of those who went before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed to hear <Col N="473" /> Senator Eoin Ryan kicking for touch on this issue when he got up to speak.  It was quite obvious that he had very little instruction on it when he said he could not decide and that no decision had been made by the Government on whether the constitutional review would go ahead.  It appears to me it will probably not go ahead and it will be quietly dropped.  At the end of the term of office of the previous Government I was doubtful about the whole thrust of the crusade.  This may be because the media were not covering it with quite so much keenness as they had done before.  It seemed to be fading somewhat into the background under the umbrella of the Attorney General and that may or may not have been a good thing.  It worries me that the new Government are going to drop it very quietly.</P>
      <P>The reason I think this debate is important is because there has been the change of Government.  As I understood it, the objective of Deputy FitzGerald's crusade was to be seen in an all-Ireland context. As Senator O'Connell has said, there are very good, absolute reasons why things should happen here in their own right and without any appeasement to any element in Northern Ireland.  Deputy FitzGerald and the previous Government saw the crusade they launched in an all-Ireland context and it is important that we debate it here today because there has been a change of Government.  It is very important that the new Fianna Fáil Government should realise that whereas Deputy FitzGerald had won a great deal of confidence from the majority population in Northern Ireland, the Fianna Fáil Party and the new Government have started extremely badly.  It is unfortunate that this should be said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The visit of the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, to America a few weeks ago, with his call for British withdrawal and the fact that he did not condemn violence, has reawakened those fears that the Northern Unionists have always felt about him.  The real worries they have and the confidence they had in Deputy FitzGerald have completely reversed roles.  Now there is a situation where they need some sort of reassurance from Dublin.  They have seen a Fianna Fáil <Col N="474" /> Government come to power and they regard a Fianna Fáil Government as an aggressive Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to warn the new Government &mdash; I represent many people from Northern Ireland, as does Senator Robinson &mdash; that if this is dropped, if the sabre-rattling goes on and if the constitutional crusade is dropped, the confidence of the Unionist population will be gone.  I believe the attitudes shown during the past few weeks have thrown a life-line to Mr. Paisley who was on the way down.  He lost a by-election rather humiliatingly.  He had been getting a very bad press but the Taoiseach's sabre-rattling has thrown him a life-line.  This is a great pity.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the constitutional crusade should be enacted under another name. Perhaps we should have an all-party constitutional review.  I do not think we can play around with the Constitution, as Senator Robinson so eloquently said today, by introducing a pro-life amendment which is playing party politics and which wrongfoots many people.  It is not necessary; it is not a controversial issue that needs to be written into the Constitution. The Constitution contains too many more important things such as the provision regarding divorce, Articles 2 and 3 and extradition, matters that are material, necessary and immediate.  On those items we should go ahead with a constitutional review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little I have to say in reply.  Speakers from this side of the House have largely echoed my own sentiments or have uttered sentiments with which I agree.  Although I would not like that to be interpreted as saying I agree with everything that was said on this side of the House, on the other side of the House Senator Ryan seemed to indicate that perhaps this debate was premature, that the Government have not yet received a report regarding the Attorney General's committee and that perhaps this debate should not have been held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree quite sharply with that view. Now is the time before that interim report reaches the Government and before it is <Col N="475" /> considered by them.  The Seanad debated this matter at great length on the opening day of its session.  Having looked at what has happened, now is the time to say that it should continue.  The nature of the debate changed somewhat during those months.  As I said last October and I repeat now, my personal view is that the constitutional review should be not a continuous process but an intermittent one and that one is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, having discussed this question at the beginning of its life, I think it is a good thing that this Seanad should discuss it towards the end of its life and put its views on the record.</P>
