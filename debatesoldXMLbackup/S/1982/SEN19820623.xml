      <P>I have notice from Senator Trevor West that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The unreasonable delays in payments under the dental benefit scheme by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

This is a very important Bill to which the House would like to give due consideration. I should like to ask the Leader of the House if it could be ordered for another day, possibly in two weeks time.</P>

      <P>No. 1 is merely to fix a date for taking the Bill and it will not be debated today.  With regard to No. 10, that would have been taken today, but, in spite of the intense pressure to have it taken, Senator Murphy is not here today. Therefore it cannot be taken.  It would have been taken otherwise and that is the reason it is proposed to take No. 14 instead.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been introduced into this House and for that we are thankful.  It is a Bill that has been long awaited and accordingly is one that will require a good deal of consideration by this House.  Next week is a little early for the taking of this Bill.  If the exigencies do demand this, I take it that what is being proposed is that only the Second Stage would be taken next week and that there would be an opportunity of considering many of the important matters in more detail for Committee Stage at a later time.</P>

    <Title>Litter Bill, 1981: Committee Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This section refers to vehicles left in such circumstances or for such a period that it is reasonable to assume that the vehicles have been abandoned. What is &ldquo;a reasonable period&rdquo;? The Minister should be more definite on what is meant by that phrase.  That section states that a litter warden means a person employed by a local authority to perform the functions of a litter warden. Do I take it from that that the Minister is prepared to appoint and pay these litter wardens?  If that is not the case the Bill, the whole motive behind it, is going to fall down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to litter wardens, I should like to ask the Minister if the local authority will employ the wardens <Col N="402" /> or will the local authority be funded by the State for employing them?  I should like to remind the Minister that local authorities at present are almost without funds.  If we start at the base in 1977 of a unit of 100 and keep in mind that the successive Ministers allowed local authorities to raise the rates by 10, 11 and 12 per cent in three successive years that means that compound interest makes it 136 units that local authorities are now allowed to spend.  Inflation during the same period was running at roughly 17 per cent so that local authorities now should be getting a figure of 160 units for the 100 in 1977 or with rates that would have been needed for local authorities to expend on roads, bitumen based materials, salaries and so on running at 25 per cent, that would leave a figure of 190. Local authorities do not have funds available to expend anywhere.  I am advised by officials of Donegal County Council that if this continues for another three years local authorities will merely have moneys to pay the salaries of those already employed but will be unable to continue with the services they now provide.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind the Minister that in the town of Carndonagh, which has the biggest comprehensive school in Ireland, Glenties, the recipient of the tidy towns award in two successive years, and Falcarragh, the capital of the Gaeltacht, the public toilets have been closed because Donegal County Council cannot afford to pay the attendants for their upkeep.  I should like to ask the Minister if he proposes to pay litter wardens out of State funds because local authorities, and certainly Donegal County Council, cannot afford to pay them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I wish to raise is in regard to seashores.  According to the section a public place means any street, road or seashore.  It is my impression &mdash; I could be wrong &mdash; that the jurisdiction of any local authority ends at the high water mark.  This was made clear during the hearing of a case regarding the burning of a boat in Donegal.  A malicious damage claim could not be taken against Donegal County Council because the jurisdiction of the council ceased at the <Col N="403" /> high water mark.  If that is the case is it in order for a local authority to ask their employees to collect litter off the seashore? It would be my desire that this should be done but the Minister should clarify the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with colleagues in referring to the existing dilemma which local authorities have found themselves in.  I am chairman of a local authority which initiated an anti-litter campaign in its own right during the past four or five years.  We have prize-giving ceremonies for schools and local organisations involved in an anti-litter campaign.  I take it that section 2 of this Bill envisages&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on section 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the rights of an authority to carry out what the Minister has in the Bill.  Such authorities will need some financial assistance particularly those authorities who are unable to fund themselves except they determine a charge to the public for the service.  The Minister should let us know if that is what he wants from the local authorities.  Litter can be anything that is discarded in a public place over which a local authority has jurisdiction.  I am referring to litter that is dumped deliberately at a dumping site, or dead animals or other sorts of litter which create health hazards and problems for tourists.  Local authorities have had to discontinue many of their litter collecting services because of the restrictions on funding them.  They are now precluded from extending the service, which would be in the interest of all of us, or even maintaining the existing service.  We have had to cut this short so quickly that litter was left lying around and the council cannot afford to send anyone to collect it.  The Minister should spell out exactly how he intends to implement the spirit of the scheme, with which we all agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady, Dublin South-East) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady, Dublin South-East)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-East):</i> I am pleased that we have advanced to Committee Stage of this rather protracted debate.  It is non-contentious legislation and the spirit of every Senator here is to see it implemented despite the very close scrutiny it has come under.  Senators want to see it made law as quickly as possible.  Some important points were made today but I must prefix my comments by saying &mdash; this has not been clearly understood in the framework of this legislation &mdash; that the local authorities are now vested with a power they did not have before.  That is a crucial issue.  Local authorities in the past were hamstrung in that they did not have the power to be able to have on-the-spot fines or to be able to penalise in a meaningful way the perpetrators of litter offences. This power overrides all the comments that have been made in regard to this section.</P>
      <P>Senator Reynolds asked how long an abandoned vehicle could be allowed to remain in a particular place.  The local authority will have to judge that case for themselves because it will vary depending, perhaps, upon the mechanical state of the vehicle, information that might be given from another source and so on.  It is not an easy question to which I can give a very generalised answer.  It is not possible to do that.  The important point is that the local authority will have the power to remove an abandoned vehicle when that authority see fit to do so.  That is the answer to that question.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris asked if the Minister would come clean on this issue, so to speak.  I hope the whole nation will do so.  I am not taking that comment out of context.  There is no intention to impose any charges on the public for what I feel should be an automatic reflex on the part of a nation to keep its house in order and keep itself free from litter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Loughrey spoke about finance.  That is very important.  I have been meeting local authorities over the past few months &mdash; I will be meeting <Col N="405" /> representatives from Letterkenny quite soon &mdash; and we discussed this whole question of finance.  I can give the House an assurance that one of the attractions of this legislation is that it will not, in fact, cost a great deal to implement.  If the Senator addresses himself to the practicality of an on-the-spot fine which can be changed and brought into line, if necessary, with inflation, a fine that will accrue to local authorities, he will realise that it will be a form of finance to local authorities that they did not have before.  I would like to see that aspect being made clear to all local authorities.</P>
    <P>Local authorities in some cases employ litter wardens already.  Dublin Corporation have eight; Dublin County Council, five; Limerick, three; Cork, two; Galway, one and Bray, one.  At all times they were impotent when it came to having the power to fine on-the-spot and to prosecute for abandoned vehicles.  Now the fine has gone from £10 to a maximum of £800.  That is a realistic start.</P>
    <P>The necessity for additional staff, if any, will have to be considered individually by each local authority in the context of their needs.  Local authorities already spend a considerable amount on street cleaning, waste collection and disposal and so on.  The provisions of the Bill will strengthen their powers.  Senator Reynolds referred to the question of seashore collection.  I am sure it is agreed that the local authorities should be involved as they are at present.  That aspect is covered and litter offences of that nature are covered.  It is my intention to get strong co-operation from the public. As I mentioned before &mdash; I repeat it now for the benefit of some young children who are in the Visitors' Gallery now &mdash; that the more young people who tell their parents about the lessons they get in civics in relation to litter, the better. This legislation will work if it is given a strong chance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On the definition of a litter warden, the Minister in his contribution said that the effect of this legislation is to remove the condition of local authorities being hamstrung by not being <Col N="406" /> able to impose on-the-spot fines.  A hamstring is a very serious injury and we should not use the word lightly.  I should like to suggest, as other Senators suggested, that the inability to have on-the-spot fines for litter is a mere twinge in the arm compared with the hamstring injury that every local authority is suffering due to lack of finance.  This power in the Bill for on-the-spot fines does not really deal with the comments that have been made by a number of Senators.  The Minister has said that it will not cost a great deal and, therefore, I see no reason why, if there is to be this very inconsiderable cost in the opinion of the Minister and his advisers, that that should not come straight from central funds.  It would be appropriate if this definition were changed to say something to the effect that litter wardens be employed by local authorities as agents of the Minister, that the Minister should be responsible, if the amount collected in fines is not sufficient to pay the expenses required, this would be made up by a special grant from central funds.  This would be the contribution of the Minister and his Department.  The local authorities will certainly have to make a real contribution in the organisation of this.  We should define litter wardens in the Bill as being employed by the local authority as agents of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. Brady (Dublin South-East) Mr. Brady (Dublin South-East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> Contrary to what the Senator said, what would be happening then is that we would be directly interfering with the powers of a local authority.  That would be a very serious error.  I have had eight years experience on a local council and spent a lot of time dealing with the cleansing department and the limitations of the laws they were using to get the job done effectively.  That is the spirit of the law now.  If there was any attempt to change that we would be doing, in effect, a grave disservice to the effectiveness of this most important piece of legislation which was approved more than one year ago.  It went through the Government and the previous administration.  From that point of view the definition has been not the slightest bit contentious.  It is disappointing <Col N="407" /> to hear anyone disagreeing with that fundamental power that is being given to local authorities to do their job effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister sounds so plausible but it is such an effort to try to find any sense in what he is saying.  We are saying that this is a charge on local authorities and one we feel should not be imposed on them because of what successive Governments have done in removing from local authorities their own taxing powers.  That is the point we are bringing forward.  We are not opposing the measure at all.  We are saying that this is an extension of the powers of local authorities which is most welcome but the extension of that power will be partly financed by the fines which, under another section, will be remitted back to the local authority.  But this will probably not be enough to meet the full cost and the suggestion is that in the partnership which should exist between local authorities and the Department of the Environment, part of the contribution of the Department should be the meeting of the additional cost that is required.  That is not to say that we are seeking in any way to go against the spirit of the Bill, or that we feel that this is not an important problem. This was stated on Second Stage.  It is a most important problem.  It is high time something was done but it is high time it was done properly.  That is what Committee Stage is for.  The principle of this Bill is agreed.  The Second Stage vote agreed the principle of this Bill.  We are now on the detail to try to get as good a Bill as possible.  The view is being expressed from this side of the House that the ideals of the Bill have a better chance of being carried out, that we have a better chance of having not only a good Litter Bill but one that will be effectively carried out by local authorities throughout the country, if we manage to keep this new venture outside this realm of the shortage of cash in local authorities which is crippling them at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is questioning the chargeability as to who might pay <Col N="408" /> wardens.  Through the Bill and, indeed, the provision of capital, or a major portion of it, will finally have to come &mdash; I do not know if Senator Dooge is a member of a local authority or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I was twice chairman of Dublin County Council and I am well experienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some experience of chargeability and who, at the end of the day, might pay.  This is a very technical submission by Senator Dooge as regards who might pay the wardens.  It does not matter to Senators or in the overall context who will pay at the end of the day.  My own experience is that the Minister for the Environment will have to share a major responsibility for the implementation and financing of the Bill initially, as is happening at present.  The next section deals with measures for the provision of dumps and so on, that will also have to come from the Minister for the Environment.  The Senator is being very technical when he speaks of who will pay the wardens.  If a local authority employ a warden, from the administrative and chargeability side it should be that authority that should pay the warden. The Senator is asking the Minister of State, to state that under this section, and its definition, the Minister for the Environment will pay the wardens employed by the local authorities.  I totally disagree with that because the whole capital involvement will be a percentage in the final analysis and I can assure you the Minister for the Environment will be the most important person in this capital allocation.  There is an ever-increasing bill coming in for litter disposal in every local authority.  We are only half-way there.  The Bill is really giving power.  I do not think the question of who should pay at this time should be an issue.  We should go ahead with the technicalities of the Bill but leave out the financing question until such time as we get the measures agreed on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has now put his finger on what is the nub of the problem as far as we are concerned, <Col N="409" /> because it is very relevant to us now as members of local authorities particularly that we know now who will be responsible. Ratepayers are becoming very few and far between; they are limited to either large farmers or business people and so we are faced with a restricted number of people paying rates.  We are limited by a restriction from the Minister in the amount we are allowed to increase our rate.  This has nothing to do with capital because the capital allocation comes direct from the Department of the Environment to us.  If we decide to employ one extra person, it will have to be done out of revenue.  I presume the Minister will have to give his permission to employ the person.  I am thinking of small local or urban authorities and I could name them in my own electoral area and indeed in my own constituency. There are local authorities there that cannot afford to employ additional people, much as they would like to.  Unless some commitment is given by the Minister, as Senator Dooge has advocated, so that some assistance would be available to implement the spirit of the Bill to ensure that the proper, classified warden as we have it here is appointed.  This may not be possible.  We hope that the on-the-spot fines will help to compensate but to take the initial step of employing somebody in the sanitary services department of the county council requires consideration at least because it will have to be a new post, an additional post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are four local authorities in my area.  One of them is quite a big town, with 15,000 to 20,000 people, which might need four wardens.  We could have 15 additional people in the sanitary services department of the local authorities in Tipperary.  Where will they be paid from?  The money we are allowed at the moment is decreasing.  The Minister has put a limit to what we can do with rates, so where do we go?  We can buy a new lorry; we can buy a new dump, we can buy many things because these are out of capital but in a revenue situation, how do we employ staff and get the assurance that they will not be caught in any embargo on staff?  There are embargos <Col N="410" /> on staff in many areas of the public sector &mdash; I mentioned some of them last week &mdash; in which in spite of having EEC money we are unable to increase staff numbers even for productive purposes.  I would like to have clarification from the Minister on this point: how do councils live with the spirit of the Bill?  If we have that assurance we would be quite happy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. Brady (Dublin South-East) Mr. Brady (Dublin South-East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> Unless that is not spelled out emphatically enough, there has been a substantial allocation to local authorities of £7 million this year, for environmental schemes.  I have met many of the local authorities and I am confident that if a local authority &mdash; mark you, a local authority are not obliged to do so &mdash; desire to employ litter wardens they having had negotiations with them, this can be done. I would like to thank Senator Dooge for his kind remarks to me at the start when he said he could not make sense of what I was saying.  I will spell it out again to him.  The Department of the Environment do not have any directive over a local authority.  A local authority do not have to and never did have to consult with the Department of the Environment if they want to employ litter wardens. The Bill is not putting such a halter around their necks to do this.  All the Bill is doing is increasing penalties and making it easier for local authorities.  The £7 million will certainly go a long way towards employing litter wardens to do a particular job.  I am conscious that local authorities find themselves in tight financial bonds at the moment; no one is making any denial of that fact.  I certainly have no intention of running away from that reality.  But this Bill as it stands is going a very long way.  It is actually giving local authorities the power to fine people substantially by increasing the fine from £10 to £800 for litter offences, an accumulation of abandoned vehicles and unsightly skips.  It has very wide and far-reaching ramifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have liked to mention Senator Barnes' point as she is leaving the House now.  I apologise that I did not get to the point she made about the by-laws.  That comes under section 4 and I will be happy <Col N="411" /> to deal with that when the time comes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the number of years' experience he has as a member of a local authority.  I could multiply that by five; as far as experience is concerned, I have plenty of it.  But I know that when a local authority meet now to discuss their estimates, the county manager says he has sewerage, water, refuse collection commitments and so on and whatever is left is available for spending, but what is left is very little.  The situation is that last year the local authorities got an increase of 15 per cent on the previous year's money; the year before they got an increase of 12 per cent over the previous year's money and the year before, 10 per cent.  At the same time, materials and wages had more than doubled the percentage increase that was obtained.  There is no way a local authority can afford to pay litter wardens.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the powers that local authorities will get.  The powers the local authorities have are nil and the power they will get is nil.  We must be honest.  He talks about a £5 on-the-spot fine.  There is a £5 on-the-spot fine in this city for illegal car parking and let the Minister walk down the nearest street and see how many people are breaking that law.  The £5 on-the-spot fine will have no effect in regard to clearing litter.  The income from it will be nil.  It would be interesting to know the figures for the income last year from the £5 on-the-spot fines here in this city, if the Minister's Department deals with it.</P>

      <P>The Minister says he is giving local authorities power but he will not say that he will give them money. Without money they have no power because they cannot employ people to use the power.  As Senator Reynolds said, local authorities at the moment do not have moneys to employ anybody.  In fact, the reverse is the situation, because they are laying off people.  I mentioned toilet attendants and I can tell him about road workers and maintenance men.  Donegal County Council have laid off umpteen men simply because they could not afford <Col N="412" /> to pay them.  If the Minister says that the cost will be minimal, I am asking the Minister to give the local authorities the powers to employ and if, as the Minister suggests, the income from fines would be substantial then I ask the Minister to give us an assurance that the difference between the fines taken in by the wardens and the cost of employing the wardens will be recouped by his Department to the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I am not so sure if I heard the Minister suggesting that local authorities might use some of the money given by his Department to local authorities for environmental schemes.  Was the Minister suggesting that they might use some of that money to employ litter wardens? If he was, I think it is ludicrous because most local authorities have already designated that money for one scheme or another and the engineers and the officials of the councils have already set about employing people or are setting in train the motions to employ people for those schemes.</P>
      <P>Thirdly &mdash; this is a technicality but one which I would rather have cleared at this stage &mdash; the Minister has not answered me about the seashores.  Do the local authorities have jurisdiction below the high water mark?  If not, would any fines which litter wardens might impose for offences occurring below the high water mark in effect be proper and if not, would there be any sense in imposing those fines?  It is important that the Minister would if necessary seek advice from his officials on this because I have doubts about it.</P>

      <P>I would like to add to the comments that have been made.  While we are in favour of the Bill in principle we feel that it will not be successful unless the money to implement it is provided.  I would like to emphasise again the point raised about giving powers to local authorities.  Local authorities do not appreciate extra powers particularly now because they are inundated with financial problems as it is.  I was a bit disappointed to hear the Minister say that it was not mandatory on local authorities to appoint wardens.  In my book the whole success <Col N="413" /> of this Bill depends on the appointment of wardens.  The only way that the matter can be resolved in the long run is by the appointment of such wardens.  It is a pity this debate did not take place on section 2 because the appointment of wardens is only the tip of the iceberg as regards the overall expenditure which will be incurred by local authorities because there are many other measures and duties imposed on local authorities in section 2. As I said, it is a pity we are not discussing it now.</P>
      <P>All I want to say is that this Bill will not be successful unless the Minister sees fit to insert a clause which will put the onus on the Government of the day to provide funds to implement its provisions. I spoke thus on another Stage.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not refer to that point.  This is the first time he has given his opinion with regard to the financial side of it.  I am not happy with it and I certainly will have to consider whether I will support any aspect of this Bill at this stage.</P>

      <P>I also speak as a member of a local authority for over 20 years and as far as I am concerned the fear we have as members of our local authority in Louth is that some of our workers will have to be laid off.  We are talking today about the appointment of litter wardens while we were told not so long ago at our council meeting that there is a great danger that some of our road workers will be laid off.  The whole thing does not make sense to me.  We welcome this Bill and we welcome the appointment of these people but the big question at the moment in all our minds is: who is going to pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a situation at the moment when circulars are going to and fro in relation to services and what suggestions local authorities may have about charges for certain services.  I have fears, and I hope I am wrong, that in the not too distant future further circulars will come to local authorities telling them to charge certain fees for services.  For that reason I am very worried about this.  Senator <Col N="414" /> Loughrey has spoken about the question of making up the difference between the amount collected in fines and the total cost of the scheme.  I would hope that nobody is fined.  I want to say here and now that I hate the thought of anyone being fined for anything, least of all for litter.  I hope that the appointment of these people will be a deterrent in itself, that the fact that they are appointed may help or may act as a deterrent.  For that reason I hope that there is an improvement and at the same time that we get very little money in fines.  I do not mind saying that here and now.  I would say the same at my own local authority.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I still feel that if these people are to be appointed, and if we are to continue with all the other existing services, when we come to our estimates meeting next year if we do not get a greater allocation of money &mdash; and it has not been forthcoming in the past &mdash; this scheme will not be operated because the other schemes in the eyes of the public are perhaps more important, water schemes and the many other things that we have in operation.  This is an additional one.  In the streets at the moment &mdash; and I refer to some of my own towns &mdash; we have traffic wardens for cars and if we have wardens on the streets for litter, then between all these wardens and the people on the dole God knows there will hardly be a place for the rest of us to walk.  I am somewhat worried about this. In some cases we have these wardens imposing fines no matter where we park our cars at the moment because there is so little space to park them.  We arrive back and find a notice on the car.  In most of these towns we have no place to park a car; we just have to put up with the fines.  When we talk about these fines for litter we have our other services to consider as I have said, including bin collections. We will have to drop either one or the other.  That is the great fear I have. If the Minister could give us an assurance that he would have this included in his Estimate next year and allocate money to cover this scheme I would say that we would all be happy.  Otherwise, as a member of a local authority for 20-odd years, I certainly am not happy with it.</P>

      <P>I, too, as a member of a local authority, am extremely concerned about the financial implications in this Bill.  I certainly welcome the powers.  It is the first time, I would say, in years that the local authorities have got any additional power and I certainly welcome this and hope that in years to come that some of the powers we have lost over the years will be given back to us.  Speaking of a county that is already £2 million in the red, County Wexford, we certainly at this stage could not undertake any additional financing.  The success of this measure is going to necessitate a certain amount of initial capital expenditure and I suppose then the financial success after that in any county will depend on how litter-conscious they are.  It would be an impossible thing at the moment.  Also, there would be an extra burden on counties with extensive coastlines.  I think our beaches need constant surveillance by litter wardens.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if, when he was allocating the money for the local environmental schemes this year, he explained to all the local authorities that they would be expected to use part of this finance to employ litter wardens later in the year?  As in the case of my colleagues, money in our county has been allocated.  The schemes are in motion and people have been employed, so I cannot see in our case any money being made available from the environmental scheme in 1982.  Could I ask the Minister what was the percentage increase this year over last year on the moneys allocated for the environmental schemes and did it take sufficient cognisance of the extra burden that was going to be put on the local authorities by the employment of the litter wardens?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> There are a few direct questions to which I should like to reply immediately before I speak more generally about various points that were raised.  Senator Ferris raised the matter of prosecutions for below the high water line offences.  As it stands at the moment, prosecution could not take place although clean-ups can be done, but the Department are examining the position to see if such power of prosecution could be extended below the high water line.</P>
      <P>Senator Reynolds referred to the question of a £5 on-the-spot fine being either totally inadequate of making no difference to people if they were going to be fined on the spot.  That is a very inaccurate statement.  If the £5 on-the-spot fine for cars was abolished the situation would become intolerable.  Take Dublin city alone.  We had an example of it when the traffic wardens were not present on the streets and we can remember that cars were parked four and five deep in some streets.  That is not an accurate statement to make.  Regrettably, fines have to be introduced.  If I thought that any other system would work I would be only too happy to go along with it.  The £5 will be a starting fine and can be changed by regulation.</P>
      <P>Appealing just to the national spirit to keep the country clean is not working and will not work as the nation increasingly becomes a throwaway society.  I think the position will get worse and worse unless some firm action is taken. The cleansing superintendents have told me that in their experience the only way to cure this problem is to have an effective on-the-spot fine and increase the maximum penalty as much as possible. Initially, the fine was £500 and after debate in the Dáil we had it increased to the practical maximum of £800.  We looked for £1,000 but £800 was the maximum that could be worked through the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to environmental schemes, I could not possibly &mdash; I am not sure whether the Senator intended it to be this way &mdash; give an assurance that the Department of the Environment would pay the bill for any differential between <Col N="417" /> the fines collected and the cost of employing wardens, in other words, to write a blank cheque.  That is being unrealistic &mdash; almost like making some form of wildcat promise.  Rather than what the Senator suggests, I would encourage and communicate with all local authorities to make sure that they conduct effective environmental campaigns to try to get a new attitude established throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Bolger referred to her particular situation in Wexford.  I would like to compliment Wexford for the very excellent results they had without money. Once the situation is established I am absolutely certain that people will develop a new attitude to litter.  I am content to leave the situation where the local authorities would have this power and might set about operating this Litter Bill immediately.  If there are any particular points I have omitted I will be happy to come back to them again.  So many points were raised that it was difficult to cover them all.</P>
    <P>All Senators who are members of local authorities are aware that local authorities are at present engaged in this form of work.  They are engaged in trying to remove abandoned vehicles but the penalties are ludicrous.  The penalties for indiscriminate dumping and despoliation of the countryside are ridiculous.  The powers within this Bill are making it possible in a realistic manner to make littering an offence in the minds of the people so that they will become conscious that what they are doing is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, and I think in my opening remarks I told the Minister that many local authorities had schemes of their own, and my county is no exception. I would like to think it is a premier county in that respect.  This Bill confers certain rights and powers on the local authority. As a member of a local authority, I want to ensure that I am prepared to match the power that the Minister is giving us but to do that I need to know that funds will be available to do what he wants us to do, particularly in regard to the employment of staff, many of our staff <Col N="418" /> are now unemployed or under threat of being redundant or on short-time working, as they were last year.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that he had made a special fund available this year. That was very welcome.  It ensured that people could be maintained in the employment of local authorities specifically for environmental works where the results could be seen in the localities and where local people could be involved in community development associations, working on projects and with the assistance of the environmental work through the deployment of council staff we achieved a lot.  But at the time of the allocation we were unaware that the Minister had any intention that some of this money would be directed towards the employment of litter wardens.  Unless I am mistaken I got that inference from the Minister's remarks when he said that he had made £7 million available to local authorities.  Surely a warden can be employed out of that money?</P>
      <P>Could I get an assurance from the Minister now that in future when he is making allocations to local authorities for environmental works he will specifically request each authority, out of that fund, to comply with this Bill and employ a warden?  The fines, we hope, will be very small because the employment of wardens will be a deterrent.  We also have school children who are in schemes for tidy schools, tidy towns and villages and there is the fact that somebody in authority will be on the streets to ensure that there is no indiscriminate or accidental littering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister writes that in to the allocation, I am confident that all local authorities will respond to the principle that it is now their responsibility to follow the spirit of this Bill through and employ a warden and that there will be funds available to recompense them for employing a warden.  The power to employ litter wardens and to pay them should lie with the local authority.  That is very important.  But if the Minister gives a commitment that in future that allocation will be intended to cover this employment, I could accept this section. I agree that he could not give a blank <Col N="419" /> cheque, that he would pick up all the tabs, because there would be no incentive whatsoever to employ them, even if it was necessary, if we thought someone else would take up the tabs.  But if we have a specific scheme allocated to councils for environmental works and anti-litter and if portion of that is intended to fund the authority in the following through of all the charges being made on them in this scheme, I would accept this section.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to apologise to the House and to the Minister for taking up so much time on this today but I am not satisfied with the Minister's answer on two points.  The first is in regard to the environmental schemes.  As a member of a local authority, so far as I am concerned environmental scheme money is meant to be spent on environmental schemes.  As far as my local authority are concerned it was never intended that it would be spent in any other way and certainly not as payment of a salary to a litter warden.  Secondly, I have no intention of suggesting that a blank cheque should be sent to a local authority to spend on environmental schemes.  But the Minister should give us an assurance that where this is a shortfall between the revenue raised by way of fines for littering and the amount paid to litter wardens for the collection of such fines, the State rather than the local authority would make up the difference. If he does not give that assurance the local authorities would be unable to employ litter wardens and this Bill would in itself become rubbish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to follow up what Senator Ferris said in his last contribution to the discussion of this section. It is important, and I want to assure the Minister of this, that it should be on record that all of us in this House are in favour of the Bill.  One hopes that there would be the utmost effort made to implement the Bill.  Our difficulty is that in section 2 there is an imposition of a duty on the local authority.  The use of the word &ldquo;employed&rdquo; by a local authority in the definition section is what has given <Col N="420" /> rise to this problem and given rise to this debate which has lasted for almost one hour.</P>
      <P>However, it would be inappropriate for us, with this difficulty, which we are unable to resolve with the Minister, on that account to vote against the whole of section 1, because section 1 is essential to the operation of the Bill.  It might be possible that we could produce an amendment for Report Stage which would try to avoid the implications which are created by the word &ldquo;employed&rdquo;. Thereby we would be able to reduce the difference between us, which now appears to be a difference about the whole of section 1, to a net point.  When we make a decision on that net point, then we can all express our opinion in the usual way.  Accordingly, I will do my best to frame an amendment that will be helpful to the debate and not be in danger of being ruled out of order by the Cathaoirleach. The net point could be determined on Report Stage rather than continue along with discussion on section 1 on Committee Stage.</P>

I cannot give the guarantee that has been asked of me, that is, to provide local authorities with moneys to cover any differential that might occur.  It will be for them to decide whether to employ litter wardens.  To give such a commitment would be misleading.</P>
      <P>So far as Senator Dooge is concerned, I would beg to differ with his request in that respect.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a couple of authorities who employ litter wardens but these are big authorities and strike a much higher rate in the £ than do many smaller authorities.  I am thinking of many local authorities within the country who because of the PLV's of their ratepayers are unable to perform the normal duties of a county council.  If on the one hand we write in this power to employ a warden and impose fines but, if because of restrictions on them now they are unable to live up to the spirit of this, is it not the responsibility of the Minister and his Department to try to assist us?  The Minister must benefit from the fact that we are all members of local authorities.  We would like to see the Bill in operation.  We would like to see it working on the ground.  The Minister will be making allocations for these environmental works.  All he has to do is prescribe a percentage of that allocation to match the spirit of the Bill and say, &ldquo;Here is X number of thousands of pounds for environmental work; I would like you to use 5 per cent of this on the employment of litter wardens to carry out the functions of the Act of 1982&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not asking for a specific amount, it is asking the Minister to recognise the dilemma of local authorities and to ask them to live up to the spirit of the Bill. Otherwise all authorities will wash their hands of it.  I have asked the Minister to come clean.  Now local authorities will <Col N="422" /> wash their hands of the whole thing and say it is a lovely scheme but that they cannot afford to employ litter wardens.</P>
    <P>The recent Water Pollution Act was the most necessary legislation that was ever enacted because local authorities were powerless to do anything about the pollution of streams, rivers and so on. We had to employ additional staff to put that legislation into operation.  We had to have people to monitor the situation.  We had to have people competent to monitor and we also had to set up laboratories on a regional basis for the testing of samples. To say that any scheme will cost very little is not to appreciate the problems at local authority level.  At administrative level they are flat out trying to live within the restrictions on rates.  There is a decreasing number of ratepayers and there are restrictions from the Department about how much they can strike in the rate.  We know the Department cannot ever give us all the money we would like because their funds are not unlimited. But here we have a specific vehicle that does not tie the Department down to taking up the slack.  To do so could be dangerous because there could be big slack in some councils and no slack at all in others.</P>
    <P>We have made our point and we would like to give the Minister the section but we would like to ensure that local authorities are indemnified from an additional responsibility that they cannot match. This is the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I take the point but to put this into perspective, this Bill is not hinging totally around the employment of litter wardens to go out and fine offenders on the spot.  Local authorities are not obliged to employ litter wardens to do that.  Local authorities may prosecute for litter offences regardless of whether they have litter wardens. That is a crucial point because if a local authority for one reason or another decide that they can manage fine without litter wardens and that they have schemes whereby they can encourage voluntary organisations to do this work, the voluntary organisations or residents' associations can easily report litter offences <Col N="423" /> to the local authority who can send out someone from the cleansing department, prosecute and that is the litter offence gone without an on-the-spot fine.</P>
      <P>However, if you take large areas like Limerick, Wexford, Dublin or Galway, where the litter problem has got out of hand, where there is indiscriminate littering, you have to have some way of catching people quickly on the spot.  That is the intention of the provision for litter wardens and we want to make the exercise self-financing to the local authorities.</P>

It provides that moneys accruing to a local authority under this Act shall be disposed of in accordance with regulations made by the Minister.  We do not know what those regulations are.

I agree with the Senator that to get money from the Department of Finance is like having to go to the Gestapo.  Now is the opportune time for the Minister to do something about the sentiments he has expressed.  I am and always have been antagonistic towards the Department of Justice and I make this point just for the sake of comparison.  In most county councils areas throughout the country, the upkeep of the courts is the responsibility of the county councils.  Yet for all the money that accrues either to the Department of Finance, or to the Department of Justice, through fines imposed in those courts, the county councils have no way at all of getting back their investment. Now is the time when we could alter the situation if the Minister could state in the Bill that the money coming from those fines should go to the county council concerned.  I think now is the time we could do it; it might not be easy but we should write that in.  I think everybody agrees with the spirit of it.</P>
      <P>Now is the appropriate time to do it because county councils are going to starve later on if the Department of Finance come up like beggarmen, begging a few pounds from them.  We have done it in all Governments.  The county councils had no function.  The Minister is nodding his head but if he could write the provision in, it would be very acceptable.</P>

However, I can give the Senator the assurance that the necessary regulation is in draft form.  It will happen, but it cannot actually be written in substance into the Bill now as it is before the House.  It has to come under a separate regulation and that regulation is in draft form at the moment.

      <P>Like Senator Killilea, Senator Reynolds and others, we all query in some way the financial situation.  On Second Reading I queried section 14.  I am glad that these fines will go into the coffers of local authorities.  I would like to think that if a local authority have a good litter warden who is doing his job he will more than pay his way, that he will in fact at the end of the week give more money to the local authority than he takes from them by way of salary for himself.  In the final analysis, while I can appreciate what the Minister says in relation to finance, I believe that the local authority members, who are very much the watchdogs of the finances of that authority, will see to it that every penny that is collected under this legislation will go to the local authority expenditure.  I would be happy with that situation if that is the way it is to be implemented.  I am pleased that it is being done this way and as a member of a local authority I will be endeavouring to ensure that whatever money is collected by way of fines will be put back into the local authority funds.</P>

      <P>I will not deal with section 14 although I share the views expressed in that regard because I think it is inappropriate to try to overcome the problems of section 1 by reference to the other section.  The Minister in his reply did not respond to the gesture I made about the possibility of insuring a council's debt in the allocation of this environmental grant in future.  He would just advise them that that is the wish.  Certainly it is the wish of this House.  It is a requirement of the allocation of the grant that the spirit and the letter of this Bill would be put into operation by all local authorities, otherwise we are initiating legislation just for the sake of legislation and we could be leaving it on the scrap heap.  This would be regrettable since we are dealing with a rather good and useful Bill.  I ask the Minister to consider my suggestion between now and Report Stage.  Otherwise I may have to put down an amendment and I do not want to create a division on this.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that, in the allocation of funds for environmental works, he <Col N="426" /> would expect local authorities to respond to this Bill and to employ litter wardens.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> An over-all sum of £7 million was allocated. For individual local authorities that could be £150,000 or it could be £1.5 million and so on.  To request me to direct a local authority to allocate a percentage of that for the employment of a full-time or part-time litter warden would not be helpful.  It would be better, on an educational and communication basis, to encourage each local authority and not so much direct them on a percentage because this percentage might be either too little or too much.  That is something that neither I not the authority would know until after a scheme had developed. It is in the initial stages at the moment. As the local authority comes to grips with their problems they will have to tease out how much money they should allocate for the employment of a litter warden. The Senator wants to ensure that it has effect and I respect that intention.  It is my intention also but it is not the intention of this legislation to give a directive to a local authority.</P>

To encourage the recycling of waste does not cost money but to facilitate the recycling of waste could mean providing the wherewithal to recycle.  I would like to know what is in mind here.</P>

    <P>Subsection (2) provides for the undertaking of work and the provision of facilities and services.  These are areas which <Col N="428" /> would cost money and I would like to know what the Minister has in mind particularly in regard to the provision of facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> To take the point about encouraging the recycling of waste, we are expending valuable resources on a daily basis.  One example is the common bin sack that is put out every week for collection.  I would hope that local authorities could encourage householders to separate the waste into, say, four categories &mdash; glass, paper, ash for road resurfacing and animal fats and oils which can be used as foodstuffs. The local authority can encourage recycling. It is not common practice but certain categories of waste separation go a long way to create a war on wastage of valuable resources which are thrown into dumps.  About 65 per cent of all dustbins contain paper and a large measure of other useful products which can be recycled.</P>
      <P>The Senator mentioned that this would require money.  I do not think so.  If the local authority decide to provide a skip to collect glass or waste paper in an organised manner this could be a self-financing prospect.  My Department are constantly aware of the need to conserve those resources, that are being dumped out on a daily basis.  The question of recycling of waste is a very big area and a lot of scientific work has been programmed in this direction.  Switzerland is years ahead in this area.  I would hope that Irish people will show a better attitude to separating and recycling waste products where possible.</P>
      <P>Regarding the second point about facilities that will be made available, this would be entirely at the discretion of the local authorities and would vary from one case to the next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2(3)(a) provides for measures for the collection and disposal of litter.  At this time all local authorities are conscious of the fact that the authorities themselves are causing problems because the measures they are taking for the collection of litter are not <Col N="429" /> ample.  A perfect example of that is that soon after litter has been collected from various local authority areas the areas are in a worse state than they were.  Why? Unfortunately, because of present-day functioning of trade unionism and management the people who are doing this type of work are always in a hurry because they are paid for doing the job in a particular time and if they do it faster, this is their business.  I am not objecting to doing this type of work in this way, but we are all conscious that the area when they are finished is in a worse state.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand how we can readily say, as is said throughout the Bill, that we should become more conscious of cleanliness with regard to litter while the vast majority of local authorities are more at fault than anybody else.  Section 2(2)(a) should be noted by the relevant local authorities.  It is very unfair to ask the general public to do a thing whilst the people who were expected to do this properly are in fact creating litter.</P>
      <P>We say that the local authority must keep the place clean.  I cannot understand how we can say this when we readily admit that the general trend of life in Ireland as regards litter and society generally is deteriorating because moneys are not available to local authorities to enable them to keep places in order.  I will give an example.  How can we expect anybody to say that we should clean footpaths or roads throughout our own area when the footpaths that we walk on elsewhere are not in order?  Litter may be the very little bit of gravel loose on the ground.  How can we readily say that things are in order when the vast majority of areas that we are living in, because of the lack of moneys from the relative Departments for the local authorities, are not in order?</P>
      <P>The Minister speaks of example.  We, from the top, should encourage the local authorities to show example, but how can they do it in present conditions?  I am not saying that it is the Minister's fault, but we must admit that society generally has deteriorated and because of this litter is now a big problem.  I would like an answer from the Minister.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> The two points the Senator makes are valid. Firstly, on the question of management of litter, it is regrettable that in Ireland the attitude is that the very essential service of waste collection has never really been regarded as an important task.  To me the management and control of all matters pertaining to hygiene and health hazards are equally important.  For example, a member of the cleansing department coming along to remove dustbins is performing as important a task in society as a medical doctor would be, but the attitude of the public suggests that they hold a different opinion on this. Here again, I must look to the continental examples where workers of the cleansing departments are dressed in proper uniforms, even wear gloves, and take pride in their work.  The public there would not leave out a dustbin that was falling asunder or a litter basket that was leaking. Such behaviour would be an absolute insult to a member of the cleansing department who would have to lift it up and put it into a lorry.  I agree with what the Senator says: in many cases the cleansing department here would leave a household in a state worse than that in which they found it because they have not this sense of pride in their work.  I hope that as a result of the Litter Bill a new attitude will develop.</P>
      <P>The other point the Senator made about footpaths and so on being in such a state is slightly outside the realms of this Bill but again it goes back to an Irish attitude.  We are wasteful and unthinking as to where we drop litter.  A nation with a very much lower standard of living than ours which I have mentioned previously in the Seanad is India which has no litter problem because the people there do not have the things to throw away.  Here, we are unthinking and that is why we have to include the on-the-spot fine.  It is regrettable but it is part of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome what the Minister has said and the fact that his response to this on Second Stage was positive.  I would also like to press on a local level for a separation and recycling of waste.  On that point much has to be <Col N="431" /> done in regard to depots and whether it should be the responsibility of the local authorities or done centrally I do not know.  I know of areas where collections were made and then they found themselves in the unenviable position of having mountains of paper and loads of glass and they did not know where to send them for recycling.  I take the Minister's point about educational information, and a list of depots would make it worth while for the local authorities to engage themselves in that occupation.</P>
      <P>On a central basis &mdash; I know these things do not happen overnight &mdash; is the Minister aware if his Department have done any research into or if there is any evidence or information available at all about the recycling processes that have been done on the Continent, particularly with regard to generating energy through the disposal of waste?  Even the initiation of a public discussion and debate to allow all of us to come to terms with such an innovation would be tremendously helpful and it would certainly be in line with the Minister's own commitment to the change of attitude that we need here.</P>

      <P>On section 2(2)(c), measures to facilitate and encourage the recycling of waste, is the Minister seriously considering in Dublin, Cork or any big city or town the question of incineration? For example, an incineration unit in a new scheme of local authority or private sector housing could mean that that area could be heated by incineration. Such a scheme would have to be worked in such a way that the incinerator would look like, say a warehouse.  In another country I have seen a local authority scheme of something in the region of 600 houses and around the corner from that an incineration unit was burning one-quarter of the city's rubbish and creating heating for the area.  Are we consideraing that?  Planners in all local authorities do not mention it or seem even to have heard about it.</P>

      <P>Section 2 (1) in its wording envisages co-operation between local authorities.  I agree with Senator Cregan that recycling is an area in which co-operation could be effective, but toxic waste should be dealt with perhaps at a central location controlled by the Department. I sincerely hope that local authorities will not be expected to facilitate dumping of unwanted waste from some counties into other counties because we all have enough problems in our own areas.  We have problems in industry about developing dumping sites or renewing applications to use alternative sites for litter.  Quite a number of residents in those areas object to this kind of work.  For instance, if Cork, with all due respect to my Seanad colleague from that county, had quite a number of problems, I would hate to think that South Tipperary would be saddled with them just because of a provision in this section for co-operation between local authorities on the effective collection and disposal of litter.</P>

If his truck breaks down, litter on the route for possibly 20 or 30 miles may not be collected and the route may not be <Col N="433" /> serviced again until the following week. Because of the failure of the contractor and the county council to pick up waste on that route litter may be strewn on the road for miles by birds, dogs and various other animals.  That type of negligence and aiding and abetting by the county council and the contractor, to say the least of it, is not a good example to give to the public at large, the people whom we are trying to educate with the implementation of this Bill.  Who, in a case like that, will be responsible?  The onus is on the local county council to implement the regulations and impose the fines and they themselves are aiding and abetting the sub-contractor who has failed in his duty to service the route on a given day.</P>
      <P>This Bill must include a provision ensuring that somebody is responsible in such a case.  If the contractor or sub-contractor does not collect that litter it will lie there perhaps until the following week.  This can create very unsightly scenes throughout the country.</P>

On section 2 (2) (c), recently I read that somewhere, on the Continent perhaps, electricity was being generated from the recycling of some of the litter and group water schemes were being heated thereby.  I am glad to hear from the Minister of the experiment at Ballymun.  Will his Department make any grants towards this?  If so, people in a number of places in the country might interest themselves in this. The St. Vincent de Paul Society are building a number of houses for elderly people <Col N="434" /> in my town and if we can get any grant towards the recycling of this material we could have the houses heated from it.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> On the question of publicity schemes that would be inaugurated to encourage local authorities to get this message across, we have many ideas.  At present the local authorities are engaged in many tidy areas contests and so on but it could be extended to a more aggressive campaign with visits to schools, audio-visual examples, prominent on-the-spot fine notices which I would like to see put up on our highways and which would be a constant reminder to people of the extent of the fines that will be imposed if necessary through the courts and also, an educational campaign to support the legislation.</P>
      <P>The success of the legislation will depend greatly upon poignant examples being made in the courts in the early stages for persistent offenders.  The Department can readily conduct a survey through the local authorities to see where the principal acts of despoliation take place and identify the perpetrators and then I hope that the justices will mete out the heaviest possible fines with maximum publicity against people who dump indiscriminately so that their businesses would be adversely affected as a result of their indiscriminate dumping and the public would rapidly become aware of people who are earning a living from this country and at the same time despoiling it.  The Senator's point has very wide ramifications and is very valid.

      <P>The points we are making at the moment are of the utmost importance.  They form the key to unlock the door, our main weapon in this war against litter.  We are dealing with the two-pronged attack to which reference was made on Second Stage.  We must get the goodwill of the people and every agent who can mould public opinion must be enlisted.  The Church, the promoters of games, tourism operators, schools, educational services and every agent who can be enlisted on our side must be enlisted.  We must get the people to realise that now is the time we either win or lose this war.  If we lose the war against litter now I am afraid that our tourist trade will suffer very grievously, apart from the danger healthwise to our people.  I was delighted to hear the Minister advocating the imposition of the stiffest penalties possible and I am hoping and praying that the justices will see that these fines are imposed where appropriate. A stiff fine will have a deterrent effect, of that there is no doubt.  If a person is fined only a nominal sum for depositing and creating litter he will repeat the offence, but if a stiff fine is imposed upon him, running into hundreds of pounds, thousands of pounds if necessary, then he will not do it a second time.  For a person who will not listen to reason a very stiff penalty imposed mercilessly is the only real deterrent for such crimes as creating litter.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer the Minister to two items in relation to section 2.  The first is of significance to people who live in the Border area.  The fact that the Border exists makes it very difficult to prevent litter on both sides of it.  Sometimes one can see a buffer zone where the perpetrators and offenders do not live within the relevant jurisdiction, and this creates an enormous problem.  Living very close to the Border as I do, I see old cars appearing very suddenly at night and it is very obvious that the people who abandon them do not live in the jurisdiction within which I live, and this works both ways.  Is there any communication with the Northern Ireland authorities, Northern Ireland Office or local authorities, on this matter?  This can be a tremendous burden to local authorities on both sides of the Border as a result of the unique situation that they are in.  I am not aware of what relationship there may be or what provisions have been made between those authorities.  In terms of the EEC extra quota allocations a substantial amount of money was made available recently in relation to Border areas.  That money generally has been taken up by local authorities and it would be a shame that the spending of that money especially in relation to tourism &mdash; and we are talking about some of the most scenic areas in Ireland &mdash; would be rendered almost useless by the logistic implementing the legislation before us and the legislation that exists within the North of Ireland.  This is a problem, and I would welcome some indication from the Minister that there is at least a recognition of it between the Government here and the Administration in the North of Ireland and an understanding as to how it can be dealt with.  One can nip in and out of the two jurisdictions very quickly.  Any Senators from the Cavan-Monaghan-Louth area would recognise that what I call this litter buffer zone can build up very quickly.  It is causing enormous expense to local authorities on both sides of the Border, and it might well be looked at as a means of creating practical co-operation between local authorities and, indeed, between the central authorities which would have a tremendous beneficial <Col N="437" /> effect especially in those areas of scenic beauty.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (2) (d) relates to the undertaking of works and provision of facilities and services including publicity, advisory and educational services.  It would seem a terrible shame that in a very excellent Bill &mdash; and as a member of a local authority for some years I recognise it as such and I congratulate the Minister on it &mdash; if the terms of this subsection stopped short at this buffer zone.  It would be almost akin to someone shaving one half of his face and leaving the other half bearded.  Whatever type of publicity and educational arrangements are used &mdash; and, like Senator Cranitch, I think they are very important &mdash; the provisions of the subsection should not stop short at this buffer zone, and their effect should be seen across the Border.  It is a problem common to local authorities North and South of the Border, to central government in the South of Ireland and the Administration in the North of Ireland and, more important, to the people.</P>
      <P>Those are the two points I want to make under that section, and I seek the advice of the Minister on them.</P>

Our experience in my local authority area of these pieces of equipment is that they are, unfortunately, an invitation to litter because of their design.  They are usually designed in steel with the most extraordinary opening devices so that litter can be mechanically removed and deposited.  It makes it almost impossible for housewives particularly to use them to any great effect.  Rubbish has to be tipped over the top which is quite high.  If a shutter door is provided it will rust because it is steel and never open.  I have seen literally everything one could think of dumped at the side of skips, from dead animals to all sorts of obnoxious waste, just because a council tries to facilitate people who have litter other than normal household litter which would be picked up at the doorstep.</P>
      <P>We, as a council, have had to take a conscious decision to close all the skips and remove them, otherwise we would not be making an effort to ensure that these designated areas in or adjacent to built-up areas did not become scenes for the activities of all sorts of vermin.  The authorities must face up to changing the design of the skips which are specifically made to fit the machines which transport them and do not suit the person who dumps rubbish into them.  Otherwise, there will be widescale breaking of this section.  I recommend to local authorities that they look at the possibility of doing away with this facility as it has never served any purpose except to create an invitation for people to litter.</P>

      <P>I wish to echo what Senator Ferris has said.  The use of skips creates many other tipheads or rubbish dumps in county council areas.  In the beginning, county councillors thought skips would solve a problem and we agreed to them.  I also echo Senator Ferris' point that the design of the skips is such as to render them, one would think, inaccessible rather than accessible to people.  You cannot get at them.  In trying to do so you automatically disperse litter. <Col N="439" /> I should like to bring to the Minister's attention the unattractiveness and non-utilisation of the skips for the purposes for which they were intended in the first place.  I should like to hear the Minister's comments on this.</P>

      <P>I endorse the sentiments expressed by both Senators Ferris and O'Rourke in connection with the type of skip used.  I raised this when I spoke on the Litter Bill previously.  They are completely unsuitable for domestic use.  They may be suitable for industrial use, on building sites and so on.  If they were in a pit situation they would be concealed. We must eliminate the unsightly look of a skip and, as Senator O'Rourke said, the creation of a tiphead at various points throughout the country.  If there was some sort of an established pit where they could be hydraulically lifted when collection takes place, it would serve the purpose of the fill in the first instance and eliminate the unsightly scenes we have at present in places where they are located. They are definitely unsuitable in their present form for the collection of litter as people are unable to put any type of litter into them because of their size and because they are open at the top.  Pits or something on the ground that could be hydraulically lifted would be more suitable.</P>

      <P>...that creates or tends to create litter in a public place or litter that is visible from a public place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest offenders in this area are the local authorities.  The tipheads are left open overnight or indeed for weeks or months and create more litter than what is put into them.  In Cork, with regard to the last tiphead that was created, it was agreed by management and the council that every night when tipheading was finished, it would be covered with topsoil. By doing that, we created a situation where it is a pleasure to walk into the tiphead.  It is a very good idea and it is a <Col N="440" /> very easy thing to do.  Any topsoil that is collected and brought to the tiphead is now held until late in the evening.  The loose rubbish, as we call it, is covered by topsoil.  At the same time we are filling in the land.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) reads:</P>

    <P>We will stop people from working if we implement this section.  It is too strong. Let us read it carefully and see exactly what it says.  It means that any person anywhere, visible from a public place or on a public place, may not load, unload or carry on a trade and so on.  Can a person load rubbish on the side of a road now?  Are we saying he cannot?  How do we get rid of rubbish if we cannot load it?  Am I wrong in saying that this section states that?</P>

      <P>Is the section joined where it states: &ldquo;tends to create&rdquo;?  Senator Cregan is probably right.  It is a little bit vague the way it is worded.  Certainly the parliamentary draftsman did not excel when he came to this one.  It says you shall not load.  If you cannot load you cannot prove that you will not create litter.  It is a little bit vague.  I am sure the parliamentary draftsman probably intends us to read it together.  So long as the litter warden reads it together we will be quite happy.</P>
      <P>Some items which are transported create problems.  I am glad the section prevents this.  I have in mind items such as products of factories which process meat and bone meal from dead animals.  A lot of damage is done by containers which are not properly covered or protected. The smell is so offensive.  It is bad enough when they pass through areas but when they drop some of their material on the way it becomes almost intolerable, particularly when one discovers that the local authority is not due for another six days to pick it up.  I am glad that somebody now has power to issue fines in such situations.  Admittedly such people are carrying on a trade but they should be a little more careful about how they transport obnoxious material.  We will have to accept the spirit of the section as it is.  A person who is loading would need to be careful so that when he loads he will not create litter.  If this is so, the warden will have the sense to implement the section properly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The system in use, generally speaking, in rural areas is as follows.  On a certain day within certain hours people in a particular locality leave their bags of refuse adjacent to the gate in front of the house by the side of the road.  The collection van is supposed to come along at a certain hour.  It often happens that the van will break down.  It could be a number of hours late and, in the meantime, word <Col N="444" /> goes around to the birds of the air, through the telephone wires probably, to come in their numbers.  They come and they attack the bags of litter and the bags in which the refuse is safe.  As a result of their concentrated attack, litter becomes visible.  What is the position there?  We create a big problem for the people involved and for the local authority.</P>

If some young fellow gets a few shillings for putting some type of advertisement papers on a car that is not an offence.

The same applies to gravel or refuse.  The question here is the spillage of offals from slaughter houses.  We often see open vehicles travelling along the road and there is spillage from them.

If something falls off a truck and the proper precautions were not taken either by covering the vehicle or having proper sidings on it, that could be interpreted by the court as a deliberate situation that would create an offence and prosecution would ensue.  In another situation where an accident takes place, for example, through a defect in the road or a siding springing off a lorry and litter or blocks fall off, a prosecution would not ensue.  It would be up to the court to decide.  The prosecution can be brought by the local authority in question but it would ultimately be up to the court to decide.</P>

That housewife is not sure whether the lorry will arrive on time or not; they do not arrive at the press of a button every day and it may be 11 o'clock or 4 o'clock.  If it is quite windy between those hours on the day she expects the collection to be at 11 o'clock, she could in theory be fined under this section because she has put out her refuse in a receptacle which became damaged <Col N="448" /> through wind or otherwise.  It is a strong section.

      <P>If there is another provision in the Bill that allows some liberalisation of the interpretation of that I am happy enough but this section is fairly restrictive in its wording.

A litter problem may be created between the time the housewife left out her refuse and the time it is collected.  Unfortunately that happens.

There are people who despoil environments and ruin a whole road. There may be one or two perpetrators while the rest of the citizens are trying to keep the road in a tidy state.

      <P>I agree with the Minister. After representations from local people Mayo County Council zoned an area for collection of refuse but the same people abused it to such an extent that we had to abandon the location.  I agree about the need for firmness in the legislation. There may be liberalisation in its implementation. However, I would not agree with liberalisation because if the legislation is not strong enough we will not get co-operation.  I had a personal involvement in a case where the people who demanded the service abused it.  We had to abandon the dump.  That is a reason for this section.  The containers those people arrived with were not suitable, they had no lids.  Those people did not have any respect for the location which was adjacent to a public road.  The case mentioned by Senator Ferris where a housewife leaves her refuse on the side of a road and it is not collected in time is where liberalisation should apply.  That is an isolated case and it will not happen every day.  Generally speaking, the section is a good one.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw to the attention of the Minister that subsection (2) seems to crystallise the problem I was presenting to him earlier in relation to the accumulation of litter in an area where two local authorities are involved. The subsection states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The occupier of any land ... that is not a public place shall keep the land <Col N="450" /> free of litter that is visible from a public place.</P>
    <P>There are practical examples of this in regard to litter in the form of old vehicles. I can assure the Minister that in Border areas there is a proliferation of old vehicles for various reasons, not altogether unconnected with the MCAs on cattle and pigs, on private lands.  The problem is that the Border runs somewhere in the middle of that heap of old vehicles.  The implementation of this legislation and, indeed, the implementation of the more limited legislation that exists in the North of Ireland, would not separately be able to cope with this problem.  If prosecution was threatened by the relevant local authority in the South, one hour with a bulldozer would relieve the man of his problem in relation to the South.  Similarly, if it were a unilateral threat of prosecution from the Northern local authority, his problem is relieved by a similar type of action.  This crystallises a situation where there must be some type of agreement between the local authorities and the central authority if this problem is to be dealt with efficiently.  If it is not, we are prone to the situation where people can very effectively and legally flout the law.  Otherwise, it would be a nonsense if this legislation was not effective simply because of that imaginary line that exists underneath this enormous pile of unsightly rubble which is very close to a main thoroughfare between North and South.  That must be regarded as a tremendous eyesore not only by the people living there but by tourists who use that road.  I use that example to point out that this crystallises the type of problem that exists in Border areas.  It crystallises the need for joint action between the Department of the Environment; the authorities in the North of Ireland and local authorities.</P>
    <P>It would be a tremendous shame if by unilateral action and not by joint action within this area of land &mdash; as has been pointed out there is a tremendous area of land involved &mdash; that one's introduction from the North to the South was a heap of unused vehicles and, <i>visa versa</i>, going from the South to the North, while legislation <Col N="451" /> existed but because of the unique situation that pertains neither legislation was effective.  I suggest that neither legislation will be effective unless there is common agreement between both sets of authorities as to how they will deal with the problem and, more important, unless there is common will to proceed to deal with it.</P>

It would be unfair if any owner of land has to go to court to prove that he was not responsible for the litter.

      <P>I want to make it clear that I am not offering myself as a litter warden. A few minutes ago a point was made in regard to an individual picnicking and littering a man's land.  There is a more serious instance where a group of travellers take over a lay-by on a primary, secondary or county road and litter an area, and if that litter spills over on to a farmer's lands it would be most unfair if the farmer in question was penalised.  I suggest that a recommendation be made to local authorities to become strict with such travellers, who are by no means poor and who are spoiling our lay-bys which were put there for the benefit of tired drivers.  Throughout the country our lay-bys are taken over by such wealthy people who have expensive caravans, big cars, vans and goods of all descriptions and after staying a fortnight or three weeks leave the place in a mess.  They are the greatest litter bugs in our society at present.  The Minister should impress on local authorities the need to deal harshly with such people.</P>

It appears that now that they have got around to doing something for themselves we are blaming them for being wealthy.  The second matter is that if there are legitimate, deserving poor travelling people there is nothing shameful, in spite of what the Minister said, about the possibility of treating them fairly and decently.  These myths and rumours that float around that travelling people are more wealthy and well-off are easily dispelled and I do not like them.

Refuse may fall from those lorries and gather in people's gateways and around hedges and trees.

Does the owner of the land have to prove that he is not guilty?  The Minister has said, more or less, that the person is guilty until proved innocent and in this instance it is the landowner.

It will be up to us all to ensure that this new attitude develops.  The goodwill is there provided that the spirit can be engendered. I do not think it will happen overnight although I hope it will.

I am concerned at the possible effect that this section could have on farming activities.  It proposes to impose an obligation on the owners of land that is visible from a public place.  I take as an example a farm which is visible, or at least most of it, from a public place.  I have looked for a definition of litter and if I could have located it within the time span it might not have been necessary to raise the query.  However, especially with regard to livestock farming where cattle are fed on hay this problem may arise.  Anyone with any knowledge of agriculture will realise that hay saved in the past few weeks is going to be of very poor quality when it comes around to feeding it out next winter or spring and therefore it is not all going to be consumed by the animals.  A residue will be left on the fields.  What is the position if some litter warden decides that that residue is litter?</P>
      <P>Another aspect of it is this.  Are there implications here that in a more intensive type of agriculture which gives rise to the spreading of slurry on agricultural land this slurry would be regarded as litter.

There is this business of posters going on and the type of thing that Senator O'Rourke referred to on an earlier section, putting literature on cars outside churches and all over the place. I certainly do not think they should be exempt from this Bill, and one only has to go out and drive this evening through the Dublin West constituency where <Col N="460" /> there was a by-election recently, or even go down through rural Ireland, and there are still posters up by all parties since the last general election.  In my opinion, if the parties do not make an agreement we should not give them any encouragement in this Bill and I certainly do not think they should be exempt.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> There is a very strong provision in the Bill.  As far as agreement is concerned that would be desirable but, of course, it is part of the democratic process to permit the candidate for election to allow his or her name to appear in public view.  I think the major provision is that the political signs must be removed within seven days. That is a fairly strict provision and I think that will bring about a new attitude to electioneering and so on.  I think that is as far as you can go within the meaning of the Planning Act.</P>

Perhaps I am being bipartisan here, I certainly think that in an election situation such as is provided for under section 7 (5), (a), (b), (c) it is a natural part of any election and just a democratic process, as the Minister has said, that a person, man, woman or party, be allowed to publicise themselves.  The electorate <Col N="461" /> expect it and it is part of the process to which all parties subscribe.  I think the Minister is right when he said &mdash; and I know that he is intent on this &mdash; that he will tolerate no personal representations or any other kind of representations in this matter and that the political parties should be the very first people to have test cases brought against them in this respect.</P>

      <P>I almost missed the section, I must apologise to the Minister. Has anybody really thought about the source of all this fly-posting that everybody is so incensed about?  I read a contribution from a Senator on the Second Stage and he made reference to Meat Loaf.  Obviously he thought it was very funny and thought it was a food.  I would not wish to identify that particular Senator in any way and I am not doing so. Most of the fly-posting and most of what people take exception to, or a large part of it, is done on the particularly objectionable and ugly hoardings that surround building sites or derelict buildings. I, no more than anybody else can be an arbiter of aesthetics, but it is highly questionable if an unadorned hoarding around the building site is any more attractive looking than the posters that are put on it.  That is only a peripheral matter.  The point I want to make, and I am going to make it more strongly possibly than people imagine in a second, is that I think this section as it stands represents nothing less than an attack on part of the culture of our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a section produced by middle-aged thinking, middle-aged minds who fail to realise that most, 90 to 95 per cent of what turns up in this sort of fly-posting, is advertising and publicity for the sort of events, musical and others, which are attractive to our young people.  By young people I would suggest people from my own age down, although I would be on the upper margin of those who would be interested in that sort of culture.  I feel quite strongly about this.  If people had thought about that section they would realise what they are doing; they are effectively saying that all the small rock concerts, all the small rock gigs, all <Col N="462" /> the small folk gigs, all the folk clubs, all of those groups that cannot afford to pay for expensive hoardings, that cannot afford to pay for all of those things, will be liable to prosecution because they put up posters which are not on an authorised position.</P>
    <P>I do not know if everybody else realises how serious this is, but what is going to happen is that when somebody like the aforementioned &ldquo;Meat Loaf&rdquo; turns up, who is an international rock star, nobody is going to chase him to ask him to pay his £50 or £100 fine or anything like it. But when the small punk rock band in Galway or Cork or Sligo are having a gig in the local pub and they put posters up and somebody takes exception to it&mdash;some, I repeat, middle-aged official in the local authority&mdash;they are going to be prosecuted by virtue of the fact that they have posters up.  Anybody who realises the way this culture is propagated&mdash;I am disappointed and I think it is typical of our political system that both the Minister and Member of a Fianna Fáil Front Bench would find this amusing; it is not amusing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is indicative of the way that our political system is distanced and detached from our young people that this sort of section could be put in its naked, unqualified fashion.  What it effectively endeavours to do is to make it impossible to put up a poster about anything unless it is authorised.  I listened to the Minister, because he obviously does not agree with me.  I notice, for instance, that under subsection (6) with reference to public meetings, it makes an exception where a poster advertises a public meeting and is <Col N="463" /> taken down within seven days.  It makes no provision for anything else like a folk or rock festival or a rock concert.  I am sorry for going on and on, but rock and folk music and the methods by which they are publicised are a large part of the culture of our young people and that is the way they are publicised.  They are publicised as small events that go on all over the country and are one of the few forms of recreation that are available to young people in country areas outside of public houses.  These events cannot afford to be publicised in any other way except by fly-posting.  This section, as it stands, would make any advertising for those things so expensive as to be prohibitive. It would be a fundamental attack on the culture of our young people.  It could have been drafted and written in a more sensitive fashion, in such a way as to prohibit some of the ugly, unnecessary posting on public buildings with which I do not agree.  I do not accept that all fly-posting is objectionable; I believe a lot of it improves the appearance of many building sites and derelict sites.  The objections that people have raised to some fly-posting are legitimate, but I believe the section is effectively and classically using a sledge hammer to crack a nut.  It could have been re-drafted, and I have fundamental objection to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I take the point that the Senator has made here. I am not sure if he was in the House at the time I made my Second Stage speech, which amplified exactly the points he is making.  To reiterate, it is not the intention of this Bill at all to spearhead an attack on social or cultural events of this country, which I might say are not only confined to the youth of the country but are concerned with senior citizens as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will just give you a number of types of advertising which will not be liable to prosecution.  They include advertisements which are exempted development under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1977. The advertising of local events of a social, cultural or recreational nature or of a <Col N="464" /> circus, carnival, show or the like would come into this category provided they fulfil the conditions of exempted development. In other words, Senator, no one will be above the law here.  The indiscriminate rash of fly-posting that has gone on, just to take our capital city alone, is disgraceful. Any window face or building or hoarding has been the subject of fly-postering.</P>
    <P>An example comes to mind, not too far away, where I took a lot of trouble with the local authority to have a particular building cleaned up.  The city manager concerned said there was very little point in doing it because within 24 hours it would be defaced again.  They cleaned up the building, painted it and sure enough, within two or three days the entire building was defaced with fly-postering. It is not intended in any way to inhibit young people from advertising their particular events.</P>
    <P>I totally agree with the point made about hoardings.  Part of the provisions in the budget was an attempt to penalise by way of taxation derelict sites where hoardings are left up by indiscriminate developers who show no concern for their surroundings and are only waiting to redevelop a particular site.  They are guilty also.  It is certainly not discriminating against young people at all.  I give the Senator that emphatic assurance here today.</P>

I did not speak of hoardings on derelict sites.  I spoke about a very prominent city street, Dame Street, and a very prominent building which unfortunately is vacant, Helys of Dame Street, and I think he would agree that indiscriminate flyposting on that building is something that could not be condoned.  I looked so carefully at it because I considered it to be an outrage.  I looked to see what Meat Loaf was and that is why I referred to it.  I agree with him that hoardings on derelict sites such as the one mentioned may encourage flyposting.</P>

Am I to understand that the type of things that I referred to would be exempted developments under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 or am I simply getting an assurance from the Minister that it is not his intention that promoters of such events should be prosecuted?  If it is already enshrined in legislation I do not mind about the section because, obviously, the protection exists: if it is nothing more than the Minister's assurance, that does not hold up in the courts.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> The situation is that notices or fly posters cannot be pasted or pinned on to any structure without any concern for that structure. That will be an offence regardless of who commits it.  But if a proper advertising structure is used and the advertiser complies with the regulations as set down that will be exempted development.  One cannot simply paste a notice on a building, because that would contravene the planning regulations, and that is the type of offence that this legislation is directed against.</P>

I thought the Minister made reference to circuses, local events and so on, and what I need to know, before I decide what I might want to do about this section, is whether some people publicising a small cultural event &mdash; I would call it a small cultural event although the cultural experts of the media would not call it a cultural event &mdash; and who do so by pasting up posters as has been traditionally done, most of them on hoardings around building sites can be prosecuted?

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> If, say, the person gets the permission of the owner to put up a notice, that is all right. If he puts up a notice without concern for the owner that is an offence and is liable to prosecution.  Perhaps the Senator is aware of the three conditions that must be complied with at present.  There is <Col N="466" /> nothing new here.  The section of the Bill refers to indiscriminate fly-posting without the consent or co-operation of the owner of the property.  The actual conditions obtaining state that no such advertisement shall exceed 1.2 sq. meters in area; no such advertisement shall be exhibited more than 2.5 metres above ground level or be glued or posted to any structure other than an advertisement structure, and no such advertisement shall be exhibited for more than seven days after the conclusion of the event or matter to which it relates.  The Senator, I am sure, will agree that there are numerous posters lying around cities and towns that are still there months and sometimes years after events have taken place, because the perpetrators of what I would regard as serious offences are totally unconcerned about the despoliation of their environment.  I certainly would not offer any sympathy whatsoever to them.</P>

What I tried to say was that as far as I am concerned it is part of the culture of our young people that the type of events I referred to are publicised, usually on the hoardings associated with building sites and so on.  They are the property of the owner and most of the owners will not give their permission.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I understood that in the past it was the person caught putting up the poster who would be prosecuted. We have now got a convenient simplification, which is that the person or group named on the poster, the individuals who are participating in the event named, can be prosecuted.  That, I understand, is the difference between this and previous legislation.  If that is the case I take exception to it because I believe it is using a sledge hammer to crack a nut and will effectively make it impossible for anybody to publicise any small cultural event because they cannot afford to pay for advertising space on the advertising hoardings available.  If we are going to do this, municipal advertising hoardings <Col N="467" /> should be made available.  I repeat that most of the flyposting is done to publicise small events either of a para-political nature or of what young people would call a cultural or social nature.  This proposal, as it stands, because it will penalise the people taking part and therefore will obviously inhibit any of that publicity, will effectively make it almost impossible to publicise that type of activity.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> With respect, the Senator did say earlier that it is part of our cultural heritage which has been going on for many years and so on.  How did it go on for many years? Local authorities will tell you that it is only within the last two or three years that this indiscriminate lack of concern for other people's property with regard to fly-posting and so on has developed. That is what the legislation is aimed against.  It is not intended to discriminate against any cultural or social events taking place in any part of the country.  It is simply that in recent times this has become a major problem.  If one were to photograph streets in Dublin inside the last year or so one would see that it has become disgraceful as a result of people using windows or any spare hoarding space without consultation with the owners of these properties.  The public relations officer of Dublin Corporation gave me information to this effect.  Previously a person would go into a shop and seek permission to put a notice in a window. That is not now the case.  The posters are being put up without the owners even being consulted.  I believe that to be terribly wrong.  It is certainly not giving good example to the young people to whom the Senator referred.</P>

It is the fact that they are using property without the owner's permission to advertise events.  I would heartily agree with the Minister on this <Col N="468" /> point, and I would ask Senator Ryan if he would like to wake up in the morning and find his front door blazoned and festooned with posters for any such event.

In this, as in many other areas, young people have been indulging in activities which we deplore, but this is because we have not provided an alternative. On the question of the provision of special hoardings, one sees this in many continental cities.  There are some continental cities in which even the political parties must paste their posters on hoardings which are provided in very strategic spots.  It is felt necessary that we should have a severe &mdash; I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;draconian&rdquo;&mdash; legislation such as we have in this section, we should think of the alternatives and the Minister should discuss with the local authorities the question of making available hoardings which could be used for this particular purpose.</P>

Those of us who have been to universities had every opportunity to plaster the university with posters.  There is a place for a hoarding in the community and I would like to support very much what Senator Dooge has said.</P>

No particular example comes to mind where local authorities actually provide hoardings for commercial firms and commercial operations.

      <P>I accept, with one exception, and the exception is the inclusion of the word &ldquo;structure&rdquo; in the first paragraph of section 7.  Senator O'Rourke asked if I would like to wake up and find a poster on my window.  Obviously that is not acceptable but that is not where most of the fly-posting is done.  I suggest to the Minister and to all the eminent Members of this House that they tour the major cities of Europe and look at the hoardings in most of those major cities which advertise everything &mdash; music, films, art, political events and so on.  We are going to try to create something that will be close to the sort of environment in that area that is only prevalent in eastern Europe where nothing will be advertised except what is acceptable.</P>
      <P>There is no point in telling me about the offence to private property involved in putting up posters on a hoarding around an ugly building site or around a derelict site.  The offence to the community probably greatly exceeds the offence in terms of the relative gravity of the posters stuck on the hoarding.  There is no point in waiving the rights of private property every time we have a problem. The rights of private property are subject to the common good.  I repeat what I said at the beginning: if those who drafted this legislation and if the Minister and the Members of these Houses were sensitive to the values, the attitudes and the culture of our young people this would not be the approach which could be used to deal with what is, admittedly, in some cases an offensive and a serious problem. It is far too wide-ranging, too widespread and it will be offensive.  If it is used in the way I suspect it will be used, it will be used discriminately against unacceptable groups or musical events which do not have the stamp of social approval.</P>

My interpretation would be that if the offence was committed in close proximity, if, say, three or four telegraph poles had some type of fly-postering put up on them the local authority would regard that as a single offence.

      <P>On the same point there is a problem regarding cars left on the side of a public road.  I mentioned this on the first discussion on the Bill but I did not get an answer to it.  I read in the Bill that where abandoned cars are on private property, in other words belonging to a farm on the side of the road but in off the road, the person who owns the land is in fact responsible for them.  He must ensure that the land is kept clear of them. At the same time, the Bill provides that the local authority are not responsible for scrap cars or any cars on the side of a public road.  I understand that the Department of Justice are responsible in that situation.  Would the Minister clarify that point as to whether a local authority have the right to take away a scrapped vehicle from the side of a public road?</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I beg to differ from the Senator, and I have had experience in this area.  In relation to the removal and storage of abandoned vehicles the road traffic regulation provides that a vehicle which has been abandoned on a public road or in a car park may be removed by or on the authority of a road authority.  A severe problem arose in Dublin where the cleansing department could not remove an abandoned car if it had its number plates on &mdash; that was a restrictive clause &mdash; but they could remove the abandoned car if it did not have number plates.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> Perhaps the Senator is speaking about a case where the abandoned vehicle in the eyes of the law would be legally parked. Under the present legislation the car can be removed by the local authority in all circumstances.  What has prevailed up to now might be one set of circumstances but what the present legislation holds will cover the fears the Senator has.  I am content in my mind now that any abandoned vehicle can be removed by the local authority.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister is trying to do.  I also believe that an abandoned vehicle can be removed, but how do we define an abandoned vehicle?  We cannot do so.  What happens if it is parked legally in a public place and if the owner comes along two <Col N="477" /> days after it is moved and claims it?  The Minister should write in a definition of &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I gave a lot of thought to that, and I am pleased that the Senator has requested such definition. The word &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; was not defined in the Road Traffic Acts, but the Road Traffic Removal, Storage and Disposal of Vehicles Regulations 1971 defined it as including a vehicle which appears to have been abandoned.  It would be impossible to be absolutely definitive about when a vehicle which has been left on the side of a road or in a field has been abandoned.  In practice it is usually reasonably clear, but in view of the fact that the maximum fine for abandoning a vehicle is £800 &mdash; this I believe is where the initiative will come from &mdash; proof could prove contentious in the absence of the definition as given.  The definition allows for taking into account the place in which the vehicle is left or the condition of the vehicle.  For example, wheels removed, windows smashed or engine dismantled together with the length of time the vehicle is left in a place are indications of whether it might be abandoned.  The concept of reasonableness is invoked.  That covers the definition of &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo;.  It is of critical importance, but the local authority under this legislation will have the power to remove such a vehicle.  This is the kernel of the issue and it is the framework of this section.  I am confident that the powers the local authorities will have will make it possible to remove the abandoned vehicle.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Cregan that it is very difficult to decide when a vehicle is an abandoned vehicle.  I am sure the Minister as a member of Dublin local authority will have experience of the countless complaints we have had from residents in areas with regard to the removal of abandoned cars.  There have been difficulties in regard to defining whan a car is abandoned.  The Minister said it was so if the wheels have been removed.  Wheels have been removed <Col N="478" /> from cars in the car park at Dublin Airport and they were not abandoned cars. A car may be defined as abandoned if the number plates have disappeared, but in Dublin a car may not be 24 hours or 12 hours in the street before the number plates are removed.  The Keep Dublin Tidy Committee had a suggestion, which the Minister might consider, that power could be given to local authorities to declare these wrecks and parts of wrecks as litter for immediate removal without storage and not to regard them as parts of vehicles.  If they came within the definition of litter and if you gave local authorities power to do that, then the local authorities could deal with it much more effectively.</P>

      <P>I feel, as I am sure the Minister does, even though he is not ready to admit it, that this is the one part of the Bill that will fail.  It is a pity when an excellent Bill comes before us which is needed badly throughout the country, to see this section fail.  The Minister feels that something is wrong with this section. There are problems within the Department of Justice because of this.  For instance the Minister said &ldquo;wheels or other things.&rdquo;  Supposing one wheel is left on a vehicle that is otherwise completely scrapped, can we define that it is not a vehicle?  Why are we calling it a vehicle? We should not be calling a thing like this a vehicle.  Senator Belton is right, it is litter.  If the litter wardens &mdash; I hope they can be employed because the argument at the moment is about paying them, and I cannot see Cork Corporation doing it &mdash; of the area were conscious of the fact that litter was on the side of the road &mdash; I emphasise litter &mdash; for more than a certain time it must be removed, but a time limit would have to exist.  For instance if an abandoned vehicle is on the side of the road for a period of four months, it should be removed.  Those four months could be November, December, January and February, yet the owner could fix the car in March because he wants it for April.  It could be <Col N="479" /> on the side of the road as a scrap vehicle, constituting litter.  This is one area which is going to destroy the Bill.  We cannot say enough on it.</P>

I do not wish to attack the Minister personally, but he is very conscious of the fact that every local authority are looking for money in every way and are under instructions from the Minister for the Environment to collect money in any way.  It is now coming about that every manager of a local authority will work in any way or do anything to get moneys in so that his authority will be in good order. A manager may tell his authority's litter operators that his local authority will get a certain amount of money per year, if they can create a situation where on-the-spot fines will be given back to the authority but if they will get nothing from other litter fines he might do nothing about it because it is not worth while for the local authority to do anything.  We must give every incentive possible to local authorities throughout the land to keep their area clean.  Even if the money is from a fine of £1,000 imposed in court on a person who dumpted a lorry on the side of a road it is only right that the local authority should get that money back. They are the people implementing the Litter Bill.  I agree that £1,800 is a fairly high amount but at least it is going back to the people who created a situation in which the man was fined £1,800.

It would be lamentable if we had reached the stage where you would have to do what is tantamount to cushioning or protecting a public body to do their work.  The spirit of this Bill, as I said before, is public co-operation with the local authority.  The on-the-spot fines will be given back to the local authorities. That is the assurance that I have given the House.  I feel that that is going a very long way to creating the best environment within the local authorities to make the Act workable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 15 the on-the-spot fine is £5.  Seemingly for any type of an offence for an abandoned car and abandoned lorry the on-the-spot fine <Col N="483" /> is a fiver.  Do I take it that, no matter what the offence, the on-the-spot fine is £5 and in court afterwards if the person refuses to pay the on-the-spot fine the judge has power to fine that person £800? I do not want to be unkind to judges, but when the on-the-spot fine for this is a fiver and in the courts the maximum fine is £800 it is not terribly hard to know what the judge will do.  As I said at the outset, the amount of money that will be collected from on-the-spot fines of £5 will be very limited.</P>
      <P>Senator McGlinchey raised the point to discover if the local authorities will get any financial assistance.  The answer is no but in a very short time when we conclude this we will give Senator McGlinchey an opportunity of supporting, if he wishes to do so, an amendment that the Central Fund can pay the litter warden.  If the Bill is to be a success, certainly it must provide for litter wardens.  No local authority will appoint any litter wardens because they have not got the money for that purpose.  The Minister said that it is the height of folly to say this, but it is the height of folly for the Minister to think that the local authorities have the money. They have not, and nobody knows it better than the Minister himself.  The whole thing is going to fall down.  I am beginning to think that trying to get this Bill through the House is an act.  We all agree with the Bill, there is no objection to the Bill but we cannot see it working.</P>

    <P>In page 4, lines 1 and 2, to delete the words &ldquo;employed by a local authority and authorised by it&rdquo; and substitute <Col N="485" /> the words &ldquo;authorised by a local authority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>During Committee Stage of this Bill we had an extremely long debate on section 1.  A great deal of the discussion was taken up with the concern of Members about the onus laid on the local authorities in section 2 which imposes on them a duty to prevent litter, and the power of local authorities to appoint litter wardens which everyone agrees would be an effective means of carrying out this duty but an unfortunate additional burden on the local authorities who are hard pressed for finance.  We had a long discussion on this at the end of which those of us who raised the matter on this side of the House were of the same opinion as we had been and the Minister was of the same opinion as he had been at the beginning of the debate.  It would have been inappropriate that the opinion held on this side of the House, the dissatisfaction with the question of the litter wardens being entirely employed and paid by local authorities, should be decided on the question of whether section 1 &mdash; the definition section &mdash; should stand part of the Bill.  We did not wish to vote against the definition section because to do so could be interpreted as removing a vital organ from the Bill and, therefore, voting in such a way as to render the Bill inoperative.  It was a matter of some difficulty to draft an amendment which would express the key point.</P>
    <P>I have prepared an amendment to section 1 to delete the words &ldquo;employed by a local authority and authorised by it&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;authorised by a local authority&rdquo;.  This still allows local authorities to authorise litter wardens to act in the way in which the appropriate sections of the Bill allow them to act but it does not indicate that these must be employed persons so that there is inevitably in it a contract of payment by the local authority.  I do not think there is any need to develop it at length but some Senators on this side of the House would like to express their extreme disquiet in regard to the aspect which I mentioned by voting for this amendment.</P>

        <i>Dublin South-East):</i> The suggested amendment excludes the reference to being employed by a local authority and I feel this would be very undesirable.  It would allow for the appointment of voluntary litter wardens. An example might be the case of residents' associations who might put forward persons to become litter wardens. This is totally unacceptable to local authorities who are the authorities best suited to train and, in the spirit of this legislation, educate litter wardens to perform their functions in the best possible manner.  Allowing for the possibility that voluntary litter wardens could be employed would be very undesirable. The amendment, apart from being of doubtful value, is misdirected.  It is very serious that persons employed by the local authorities be skilled persons who are tactful, able to deal with a new situation that they have become familiar with through local authorities, and familiar with particular areas throughout the country.  Opening this to the possibility of voluntary litter wardens is very unacceptable. I am disappointed with the spirit of the amendment in the context of earlier discussions today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>One reason we decided that this amendment was necessary was the reservations we had about the ability of the local authorities to match the challenge of the Bill, which we wanted them to do.  Having listened to the Minister's contributions, we felt that in the event of a local authority not being in a position to employ wardens the Minister was not going to direct them to do so.  He saw local communities playing an active part and in reporting areas of littering to the local authority who would then have the power under this Bill to take action.  This amendment tries to make that possible in the event of a local authority, through its financial restrictions, being unable to meet the challenge of employing a warden. If the Minister had assured us that he would assist us in some way whether <Col N="487" /> by appointing the warden or giving the local authorities the power to do so in the knowledge that they would have the funds to pay them, then we would be happy.  I suggested to the Minister earlier today that he ask authorities, with the help of environmental grants, to employ wardens.  We all feel that they are a necessary part of the Bill.  If the Minister had made it incumbent on local authorities to employ wardens with the aid of the special fund he is making available, we would have been satisfied.</P>
      <P>As mentioned by the Minister the amount of money might vary from county to county or authority to authority, but the principle will be there.  I know that the local authorities &mdash; many Members of this House are members of local authorities &mdash; will match up to the challenge he is giving them.  I hate to think of local authorities, because of their varying degrees of PLVs throughout the country, being unable to meet it.  It would be a tragedy if some counties becomes litter counties because of the inability of the authorities to match the challenge of this Bill.  Some more progressive counties will make the effort somewhere, and they might have to allow some other important service to stand back and let this be a preference.  Because this Bill is restrictive, and it probably has to be because of the menace of litter, it will be a pity if it goes for nought because the local authorities cannot meet the challenge.  The only reason we put this amendment down was to get authorities off the hook and let them use the voluntary services of other agencies.  They could use their statutory power to fine, but people acting as wardens could detect the offences for them. It is a question of community spirit.  We do not want witch-hunts and spies all over the place reporting to the authority about litter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, question the ability of the local authorities to employ sufficient litter wardens but I also question the ability of the State to do it effectively. Any average town of 5,000 people would require about 20 litter wardens <Col N="488" /> because litter, as was said on Second Stage, is not just dropped from Monday to Friday between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.  They would need to operate three shifts.  I am totally opposed to this amendment.  Irish history has taught us to detest the very mention of the word &ldquo;informer&rdquo;, and that is what we would be creating if this amendment was accepted.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> In answer to the points Senator McGlinchey made, the purpose of the local authorities implementing this legislation is that they have the machinery at their disposal. They are familiar with the problems and that is why I feel, and I am sure Senators and other public representatives do also &mdash; that they are the best people to do the job.  This amendment would allow for voluntary litter wardens.  This would not be in the best interests of the legislation, if Senators give serious consideration to this now and think about their experiences.  I have discussed it with county managers and so on at great length.  If they seriously felt this legislation could work by allowing voluntary litter wardens to operate it, they would have second thoughts about the amendment. I have absolute confidence in the local authorities now that they have been given the power they were craving for with realistic fines, they should be given the chance now to implement the legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this Bill, the real problem lies in trying to get evidence to convict people.  That has always been the experience in my local authority, and it has not changed.  Litter wardens will have to be paid and somebody has to pay them. There must be co-operation.  I accept the spirit of the Bill.  I hope local authorities <Col N="489" /> will make every conceivable effort to implement this Bill but, nonetheless, the amendment could be useful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the Minister.  No one can operate this better than the local authorities.  There will only be one reason why the local authorities will not be able to operate it, and that is because they have no money. It is that simple.  On Second Stage, I pointed out the cost of refuse collection in County Leitrim.  It was £120,000 last year.  It will cost far more this year.  The situation is that the money is not there to pay litter wardens.  It will not work without litter wardens, because everybody knows that county council officials will not be able to get roadmen to do it because they will say it is not their job. No-one in the county councils will do it so litter wardens will have to be appointed.  The local authorities have not the wherewithal to pay litter wardens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that county councils cannot afford to pay litter wardens, because they pay traffic wardens and there is no special allowance for that. There is no reason why traffic wardens could not also act as litter wardens.  We pay beachguards and various extra staff and get no special allowance.  It would be ludicrous if we gave special allowances to one group of people because then every group of people would look for it.  We would make the employment system, as bad as it is, even more complicated.</P>
      <P>One Senator said that if people acted as voluntary litter wardens there would be a witch hunt.  That is exactly what would happen and it would create very bad feeling with friends and neighbours. We are trying to build up a community spirit, and if we employ someone with a chip on his shoulder &mdash; it is only someone with a chip on his shoulder who would agree to do that kind of work voluntarily &mdash; we would have someone breaking up a community.  I can see it as a very dangerous precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One problem which worries me is that many people in our seaside areas and in lay-bys, under the cover of darkness, dump bags of rubbish.  No litter wardens <Col N="490" /> will be able to deal with that.  This is the most serious type of litter problem we have.  I wonder how we could come to grips with it?  If one opens those bags one may see envelopes and different types of documentation, but one cannot prosecute on that because there is no guarantee that the person whose name is on the literature is the person who dumped it. This is the most serious aspect of our litter problem.  I do not know if we have tried to come to grips with that very serious situation.  It is a problem on our lay-bys and on seashores.</P>

Is he aware that Dublin Corporation are threatened with a strike simply because they cannot pay existing staff? With regard to traffic wardens, the Minister is aware that we are inhibited in the number we can employ because of lack of finance.  How does he expect councils to have the finance to pay extra staff?  In Dublin, because of the size of the city, because littering is more prevalent in urban areas and because of the size of the seashore, it will be difficult in the summer to keep it under control.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In his first intervention, the Minister said that the effect of the amendment would mean that all wardens would be voluntary wardens.  I suggest that that is not necessarily so.  The amendment gives a flexibility.  If we use the word &ldquo;employment&rdquo;<Col N="491" /> it means that every litter warden must be on a contract of service with the local authority so that there is no possibility of the local authority adopting a flexible scheme which could build up and keep pace with the income of the fine.  In our amendment we have given a degree <Col N="492" /> of flexibility that is not in the original wording.  Accordingly, I see no reason to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will amend and extend the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1982, to give effect to the EEC Second Directive on company law and certain related matters.  That directive is concerned with the formation of public limited companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> It will be recalled that, very recently, the Oireachtas passed the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1982 which was a short measure to improve the facilities and information available to the business community at the Companies Registration Office, to make certain minor revisions and to update the fines and some other figures in the Companies Act, 1963, which is the basic statute governing the operation of different classes of companies in Ireland.  At that time, I described that short Act as the first step in a considerable programme of company law reform.  The Bill before us today is the second stage in that programme and makes considerable amendments to the 1963 Act.</P>
    <P>Before the short 1982 Act, there were only two small amendments to the 1963 Act.  One of these was in 1973, by way of regulations, to give effect to the EEC First Directive which was concerned with the publication of documents and certain other information about various classes of companies.  The other was the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1977, which was concerned with the transfer of title to securities on the stock exchange.</P>
    <P>Before moving on to some details of the Bill in hand, it would be appropriate, by way of information, to say something about the EEC approach on company law matters.  Though it is not an area of great popular appeal or political interest, it is one in which there has been a very large number of EEC initiatives.  Seven directives have already been adopted and, consequently, require translation into Irish law.  There are various other proposals at different stages of development in the EEC negotiating process and the study, discussion and servicing of meetings in Brussels in relation to these proposals puts considerable demands on the resources of my Department.  The European Community approach has been one which seeks harmonisation in relation to different aspects of company law and sets out principles about those aspects to be included in its laws, by each member state, in an appropriate form.  It is this approach that brings about the numerous different measures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> Some Senators will be aware that the EEC Commission has brought Ireland before the European Court of Justice for failure to implement the second directive by the appointed date, December, 1978. One reason for that failure has been a shortage of suitable staff resources but there are other significant considerations. It is no accident that five other member states were brought before the European Court on the same charge.  It is only now becoming clear that the requirements of the directive are more complicated than was first realised and call for complex adjustments of legislation.  Given the burden of the other EEC company law activities to which I have referred, it has taken much longer to make the necessary changes in legislation than was originally envisaged.  Senators will appreciate that the Bill which we as a member state have to produce as a consequence of the directive is not any less complex than that required of the other larger administrations who have also encountered difficulties in meeting the deadline.  The case against Ireland and the other member states concerned was heard at the end of April 1982 and those proceedings are not yet concluded.  The House will recognise, therefore, that we are dealing with an urgent matter.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that, as regards the other directives which have been adopted by the Community, Senators will be looking for some mention of the Fourth Directive which, of course, is of considerable interest.  The Fourth Directive deals with the content and format of company accounts, their presentation and publication, and it embraces both public and private limited companies.  Work is proceeding on a Bill to give effect to that Directive, and I propose to introduce that particular measure later this year.  In addition, as I have already mentioned in the Oireachtas and elsewhere, I propose to introduce a further Bill which arises from domestic, as opposed to EEC, considerations, and which will aim at removing some of the abuses that can occur in the direction and management of some companies and at bringing about other desirable improvements in company law.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the content of <Col N="495" /> the Bill before us, the basic purpose of which, as I have said, is to give effect to the EEC Second Directive.  In doing so, I want to draw the House's attention to one very fundamental factor, which is that the principles of the Directive, having come through the administrative process of the EEC and having been adopted some years ago, are not negotiable at this stage.  Consequently, most of the provisions in this Bill which implement those principles are not negotiable either.  Put quite simply, there are provisions in it which we in this House are not free to dilute or avoid even if we were inclined to do so.  I would ask Senators to bear that basic factor in mind when they are examining the different aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The objective of the directive and, consequently, of this Bill is the protection of the interests of both shareholders and creditors in relation to the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance, increase or reduction of their capital.  Obviously, the proper conduct of such companies in relation to those matters is also of considerable benefit to employees.  The greater part of the provisions of the directive are given force in Parts II, III and IV of the Bill and the remaining three Parts deal with ancillary matters and companies changing between limited and unlimited status.</P>
    <P>Part I contains the usual provisions associated with any Bill concerning title, citation, commencement, interpretation, repeals and savings.  As regards interpretation, it will be seen that a &ldquo;public limited company&rdquo; answering the requirements of the directive is separately defined in section 2, as is a &ldquo;public company&rdquo;. I want to make it clear that those definitions do not impinge upon or in any way affect the position of private companies, which will continue to be defined by section 33 of the Companies Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>I am drawing the House's special attention to this matter because the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, in a report in 1978, recommended that the definition of a private company as in <Col N="496" /> the 1963 Act should be maintained.  It is important to leave that definition stand because the private company so defined has long been the dominant corporate entity for business ventures here.  The significance of private companies in the economy is best indicated by the fact that at December 1981 there were about 65,000 private companies and 340 public companies registered at the Companies Registration Office.  The measures in the directive apply only to public companies limited by shares and public companies limited by guarantee and having a share capital.  As there are only two or three of the latter type of company in existence it is clearly not a very effective business vehicle, so I am taking the opportunity in this Bill to discontinue any further registrations of this particular form of company.</P>
    <P>Part II implements the requirements of the directive as to the name and registration procedures for new public limited companies.  These are that:</P>
    <P>the name of a public limited company should distinguish it from other types of company; the memorandum of such a company must state that it is a public limited company; and</P>
    <P>the allotted share capital of a public limited company must not be less than a specified minimum and must be paid up as to, at least, 25 per cent of the nominal value of the shares and all of any premium on them.</P>
    <P>I am providing for the designation &ldquo;public limited company&rdquo; or &ldquo;p.l.c.&rdquo; or the Irish equivalent of these so that an incidental, if technical, income as far as public companies are concerned is that the old identification of &ldquo;and Co. Limited&rdquo; will be replaced by &ldquo;p.l.c.&rdquo;.  However, private limited companies will continue to use the well recognised &ldquo;and Co. Ltd.&rdquo;.  The Bill provides for an authorised minimum capital of £30,000.</P>
    <P>The remainder of Part II sets out the re-registration requirements for companies changing from their existing status to that of a public limited company.  As might be expected, the key requirements in those changes which are imposed by <Col N="497" /> the directive are that they observe the rules as regards the name, authorised minimum capital and the payment up of shares.  Of particular interest here is that existing public companies limited by shares, or limited by guarantee and having a share capital, are defined as &ldquo;old public limited companies&rdquo;.  These companies, if they wish to retain their present status, must re-register as public limited companies within 15 months of the appointed day and appropriate provisions are specified.  Accordingly, it is the 340 existing public companies, to which I have already referred, which will be affected by those provisions, and to the extent that those companies do not have the £30,000 authorised minimum capital they will have three years within which to bring their capital up to that level or, alternatively, to re-register as some other form of company.  As they may under existing legislation, private companies will be free to become public companies, but if they wish to re-register as public limited companies in the new form they too will have to comply with the requirements as to name, capital and payment up of shares.  There is also provision for a public limited company to change its status in the opposite direction, so to speak, and to re-register as a private company. If it does so it will, of course, have to meet the requirements in the definition of a private company in the 1963 Act. Briefly, a private company must&mdash;</P>
    <P>Have a share capital,</P>
    <P>restrict the right to transfer its shares,</P>
    <P>limit the number of members, and</P>
    <P>prohibit any invitation to the public to subscribe for shares.</P>
    <P>Part III implements the provisions of the Directive relating to the share capital of public limited companies.  Requirements are set out as to the issue of and payment for share capital, the maintenance of share capital, the rights of existing shareholders on the occasion of the issue of further shares in the company and the variation and registration of class rights attaching to shares.  Part IV deals with distribution of profits.  I have already mentioned that the Second Directive <Col N="498" /> only applies to public limited companies. However, many ideas of the directive in relation to the share capital and profits of a company simply reinforce existing practice or have, for some time, been recognised as desirable for the proper conduct of companies generally.</P>
    <P>Though there is no obligation to do so, I consider it appropriate, in the interests of the development of company law generally, to apply some of the provisions in Parts III and IV to private companies.  In adopting this approach, I am carrying out the wishes of various interested professional bodies which made representations on the subject.  In taking this course I have been careful to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the need to develop proper commercial practice which would result in some benefit for members, employees, creditors and the business public generally and, in the other, the necessity to avoid imposing unnecessary and fruitless burdens on private companies which, as I have said, form the backbone of the Irish business scene and provide considerable employment.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer specifically to some of the provisions in Part III of the Bill.  As required by the directive, the idea of an authorised minimum share capital for public limited companies is introduced and is set at £30,000.  This figure is somewhat above the minimum requirements of the directive, but since the underlying principle is that small entities may not seek to become public companies and that such companies should not be allowed to commence business without some semblance of financial viability, it would not be appropriate to fix a lower figure.  In any event, I have taken account of representations which have been made on the subject and of the desirability of avoiding frequent amendments to recognise inflation or currency fluctuations. The authorised minimum capital requirement applies to public limited companies only.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision, new to Irish law, that directors of a company may not allot shares unless they are authorised to do so by the articles of association or by the company in general meeting.  Such an <Col N="499" /> authority must state the maximum amount of shares to be allotted and the duration of the authority given, which may be for a period up to five years but can be revoked, varied or renewed.  This kind of control over the issue of shares has been mooted for some time.  It should be to the advantage of shareholders in private as well as in public limited companies, in so far as it should prevent directors making an offer to issue shares to some members of the company or even outsiders on terms below market value which would result in the value of the holdings of the remaining members being reduced.</P>
    <P>The directive requires that provision be made in relation to pre-emption rights.  These are the rights of first refusal when the capital of a company is being increased by a new issue of shares for cash.  The provisions in this Bill, which apply to both private and public limited companies, set down the principle that such shares must first be offered to existing shareholders in proportion to the nominal value of shares already held by them.  These provisions will have the effect of safeguarding the interests of all shareholders against any allotments which might change control of the company or damage the relative position in the company as represented by their holdings.  While the setting out of pre-emption rules is new in our company law, it is not a new idea and it is, in fact, a requirement for those public companies which are quoted on the stock exchange.</P>
    <P>Similarly, some of the ideas in Part III in relation to the payment for share capital are not really new.  The provisions that shares may not be issued at a discount and must be paid for in money or money's worth represent what is, in practice, the existing position and it is appropriate, therefore, that they be applied to all companies.  The directive makes it necessary, however, to introduce a partial restriction on the existing position in that it specifies that an undertaking to perform work or supply services may not from part of the assets paid for the shares of public limited companies.  One of the innovations of the directive and, consequently, <Col N="500" /> the Bill, is that, as I have already mentioned, the shares of a public limited company must be paid up as to at least 25 per cent of their nominal value and the whole of any premium on them before they are allotted.  At present, the Companies Act, 1963 requires only 5 per cent payment on application.</P>
    <P>In relation to shares which are not paid for by cash, the directive introduces another new idea in that it requires the valuation by an independent expert of considerations other than cash paid for shares in a public limited company.  A further requirement is that such payment of non-cash assets for shares must be made in full within five years of the allotment. An expert's valuation is also required where a public limited company proposes to acquire non-cash assets from a subscriber to its memorandum and the value of those assets exceeds 10 per cent of the subscribed capital.  These provisions of the directive are reflected at sections 29 to 33 of the Bill, and it will be appreciated that they are a serious attempt to get an objective assessment of the proper value of non-cash assets transferred to a public limited company.  This is in line with the objective of the directive to preserve the capital of the company and thus provide protection for all those involved with it.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage the participation of employees in the capital of companies the directive provides that the payment up before allotment of at least 25 per cent of the nominal value of shares need not apply to shares issued in connection with employee share schemes.  The concept of employee share schemes is not, of course, new to our company law code.  Section 60 of the Companies Act, 1963 already recognises the special place of such schemes by providing that financial assistance may be given by a company for the acquisition of shares in the company or its holding company to be held by its employees or the employees of a subsidiary company.  I understand that a number of Irish companies already operate share purchase or share option schemes for employees.</P>
    <P>In Part III under the heading &ldquo;Maintenance of capital&rdquo; there are provisions <Col N="501" /> preventing companies from acquiring their own shares either directly or through nominees.  We have provisions in section 60 of the 1963 Act which enable a company to provide financial assistance in certain special circumstances for the purchase of its own shares and, while the directive requires us to amend those provisions so that they no longer apply to public limited companies, that section will remain in force for private companies.  I would also like to draw the House's special attention to the provision at section 40 of the Bill which requires that, where it becomes known to any director of a company that there is a serious loss of the subscribed capital, an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders must be held to consider what measures should be taken to deal with the situation.  In the present difficult economic circumstances there is a growing number of company failures and it is now widely accepted by persons such as receivers, liquidators and financial bodies closely involved in such matters that most of these failures have a common factor, which is that company directors and managers do not take appropriate action when financial difficulties first appear on the horizon.  I think that it is useful to apply this general principle to all companies if only to encourage those concerned to tackle the situation in good time with a view to doing everything possible to prevent the failure of the company and all the attendant adverse consequences, particularly the loss of employment.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill implements the requirements of the directive concerning distributions to shareholders including, in particular, the payment of dividends. The general basic principle governing distributions, to be found in section 45, is that distributions may only be made from profits available for that purpose.  In this context, &ldquo;available profits&rdquo; are defined to mean a company's accumulated realised profits less its accumulated realised losses.  The idea that distributions may only be made from profits available for that purpose is already included in the First Schedule to the 1963 Act, but the <Col N="502" /> definition of available profits clarifies a situation that has been in some doubt.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the position will be that a company may not make a distribution until accumulated losses have been made good.  These principles represent prudent accounting practice, and the accountancy bodies agree that they should be applied to all companies.  The directive imposes a further restriction on public limited companies in that they may only pay dividends where the amount of the net assets is not less than the aggregate of the called up share capital and undistributable reserves and where the payment of the proposed distribution would not have the effect of reducing the net assets below that level.</P>
    <P>The remainder of Part IV deals with ancillary matters arising from the basic rules which I have just mentioned.  It takes account of the special position of assurance companies and investment companies and specifies the accounts, and regulations concerning them, to which reference must be made before any distribution is contemplated.</P>
    <P>Part V provides for companies changing between limited and unlimited status. These provisions do not arise from the directive but since this Bill deals, to some extent, with the question of re-registration of companies, I think that it is appropriate to include them.  The Companies Act, 1963, already authorises an unlimited company to re-register as a limited company.  There is no provision in that Act, however, to enable a movement in the opposite direction, that is a limited company to re-register as unlimited.  I propose making this facility available now in section 52 because various representations requesting it have been made to my Department.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned earlier, in relation to Part II, that existing public limited companies must within a given period re-register as the new public limited company, or as an alternative, be re-registered as another form of company.  This provision will enable an old public limited company to re-register as an unlimited company if it so desires.  A change from limited to unlimited status will require the assent of all the members of the company.  Such a <Col N="503" /> change has serious consequences for the members of the company involved in that the assumption of unlimited liability means that the members will be responsible for the debts of the company to the full extent of their personal assets.  Where such change takes place the position of creditors and employees is of course enhanced.  Therefore it is clear that a change in status from limited to unlimited is not one that will be lightly taken.  Section 53 replaces section 20 of the 1963 Act and makes better provision in relation to the protection of the interests of its creditors where an unlimited company re-registers as limited and, subsequently, goes into liquidation.</P>
    <P>Finally, Part VI covers matters such as publication requirements, the use of misleading names, penalties and procedures for indictable offences, expenses and order-making arrangements.</P>
    <P>From this review of the Bill I am sure that Senators will appreciate that the subject matter is fairly complex.  In formulating it, I have had regard to the views of various interested professional groups and I would like, therefore, to take this opportunity to thank them for offering those views.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I need hardly remind Senators that the enactment of this particular Bill is a matter of great urgency. I have referred to the proceedings before the European Court regarding non-implementation of the EEC Second Directive so I am sure that the House will understand my anxiety to get it through the Oireachtas with maximum speed.  As the Bill itself is generally dictated by that directive, is largely technical and is, therefore, uncontroversial.  I think that I am justified in urging Senators to refrain from pressing for amendments in relation to other general matters not connected with the Second Directive on the clear understanding that I will be introducing further measures for the reform and updating of company law as soon as possible. Given the special circumstances which surround it, I look forward to the House's co-operation in processing this Bill quickly, and recommend it for the approval of this House.</P>
    <Col N="504" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister concluding stated that this is a very complex Bill, and it is.  It is a very technical Bill.  This side of the House on general terms welcome the Bill and we support it.  There are some points of detail in relation to a number of provisions on which we will be seeking information and clarification.  We may, in the light of what the Minister will say in reply, seek some further improvements.  It may well be unavoidable that we will in certain circumstances seek amendments to this.  As the Minister said, the measure largely gives effect to or translates into Irish law the provisions of the Second EEC Directive on company law.  By and large that is true except in relation to Part V which relates to the changes of status between different types of companies.  The Minister, in the course of his speech, indicated as he did previously that this is what might be described as another instalment of the reform and review of company law in general.  While accepting that that is so I want to express my disappointment in some small way about the fact it has not been possible in this Bill to pay more attention to the position in relation to private companies. It is in this field that the greatest difficulties and problems in relation to Irish company law exist and there is general acceptance about the need for reform there.</P>
      <P>Section 19 authorises minimum share capital of £30,000 for public limited companies or any other such sum as may be specified by order of the Minister.  I wonder if that &ldquo;other sum specified by order of the Minister&rdquo; may be lesser, as well as greater, than £30,000.  We are establishing this as authorised minimum share capital of a public limited company while at the same time we do not appear to attempt to establish a realistic basic figure of share capital in private companies.  I want to express my disappointment at the fact that that and other aspects of company laws relating to private companies have not been incorporated in this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time I want to give credit to the positive aspects of this measure. The Bill will tighten up, and make more effective, company law in relation to public <Col N="505" /> limited companies and it will ensure better protection to shareholders and creditors.  However, a further category of people need protection under company law, the employees.  There may be some measure of protection for them but if there is it is indirect.  It only arises because of the improvements or the centering of the capital structure of companies which in the first instance will be of direct benefit to shareholders and creditors of companies.  The measure will make the capital formation of companies more realistic.  It contains certain desirable restrictions as far as the dispersal of capital and assets within the company are concerned.  It will also make more difficult certain undesirable trends as we witnessed in recent times for unscrupulous individuals to misuse company law to hide or to disperse capital or assets of certain companies.  They are the positive aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>What is desirable and necessary but is absent are the measures that will afford maximum protection to creditors and employees of public limited companies and, more especially, to the employees and creditors of private companies. These, and other areas of company law reform, are in need of urgent review.  I accept what the Minister said in his statement that this is part of a continuing process.  The Minister dealt with the need to implement the provisions in Irish law of the Second Directive of the EEC and he also referred to the fact that we have found ourselves before the European Court because of our inability to get this legislation on the Statute Book much earlier. I regret that the prime motivation in bringing in these desirable measures for the strengthening and improvement of company law comes from the necessity to conform to the Second Directive of the EEC rather than a recognition that these reforms are necessary and desirable to improve the position in Irish company law in their own right.  It is also an indication of how we organise ourselves as a nation that when worthwhile changes are necessary we are motivated because of a need to comply with an EEC directive.</P>
    <P>There are many areas of company law in urgent need of reform.  On the last <Col N="506" /> occasion we were debating a similar measure the Minister gave an indication that this was a complex job, would take a considerable amount of time and is not easily processed.  I accept that.  There are daily examples of weaknesses in company law that are being exploited to the advantage of a few and the disadvantage of many.  All those weaknesses will not be eliminated in the Bill.  I am not attaching blame to the Minister.  He is on record here and outside the House as accepting that it is necessary to bring in these reforms, but many people feel that company law can be manipulated resulting in injustices and wrongs being inflicted on many people.  More especially I am expressing the reaction of people to the apparent inability or ineptitude of legislators to bring in these necessary reforms quickly.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that substantial fines are being brought in.  They will have the effect of improving a situation that needs to be improved.  Section 31 provides for a fine of £5,000 as a penalty for those who supply false or misleading or otherwise deceptive information.  The fine may seem substantial but it is necessary and has my support.</P>
    <P>I want to briefly refer to section 40 which governs the maintenance of capital within companies.  The Minister indicated that he expected that the section as it is will increase substantially the powers required in that area but in my view the section as drafted is a poor reflection of what the Second Directive felt was necessary to cater for the situation.</P>

      <P>The matter in hand is one on which we all agree.  The protection of people in Ireland, of people who invest, is the paramount concern of this Bill.  I will not delay the House very long as the Minister said in his introduction it is based on a directive on company law from the EEC.  Because of that I will be very brief: there is no point in delaying the proceedings of the House in discussing this Bill.  I agree with certain points made by Senator Howard.  The £30,000 share capital is very low in terms of modern-day company set-up.  That <Col N="508" /> might be increased.  In his introduction he did say that company failures have to be looked at very carefully and he was very careful to mention that.  A lot of those company failures were brought about because of bad management and because people did not take the initiative in time.  In too many cases we hear of companies failing because workers create difficulties for companies.  I am glad that the Minister in his introduction did lay the blame for the majority of failures on the management, directors and the direction that companies are taking.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope that the word will go out from this House that it is not always the workers who create failures. The Minister was quite specific in his opening remarks that the majority of company failures come about because management, owners or directors do not recognise where the problems are until the problems have overtaken circumstances. In this particular time we must analyse carefully where difficulties come from in private or public companies.  The implications of this Bill are not major in terms of the Irish situation because, as has been said by the Minister, we have 65,000 private companies and only 340 public limited companies.  Any investor in a public company of any description should know what he is getting into in the first place. But it is not always possible for an investor in a private company to know whether he is getting the best deal in terms of management or advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have the Fourth Directive from the EEC before this House in a very short time.  It is on the Fourth Directive that we are going to have the biggest problems in company law in Ireland.  We must recognise the fact that there is a large number of limited companies in this country which are not giving the information normally required.  People are involved in limited companies as workers and they do not know exactly where the share capital of that particular company is.  They do not know how much the borrowings are.  In particular since the abolition of the stamp for social welfare, they do not know how much is owed on PAYE <Col N="509" /> and PRSI.  In Ireland at present the hidden debt to the State and to the workers is enormous in terms of PAYE and PRSI. When companies close down, one of the important factors one reads about is that the major creditors, the PAYE and VAT have not been paid.  The bigger the company, the bigger the fiddle.  The bigger companies send in a return at the end of each month, at the end of each recording period; they do not send in cheques.  The smaller companies send nothing in.  They go through the courts and they are charged 18 per cent interest on what is determined by the Department of Finance.  The bigger companies send in returns.  It is recorded in the Department of Finance that these companies owe a lot of money.  They are not fined anything. But when the company goes bankrupt the first and major creditor is the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I sincerely hope that we do not have to come into this House and have a Bill produced to us which is as a result of a directive from the EEC in the future.  We should be able to legislate for ourselves.  I know we are quite capable of doing that.  I sincerely hope that we do not have to implement a directive from the EEC in this House again.  On the Fourth Directive which is on private companies, every Member of the House will have a lot more to say than I have to say this evening.  We agree that there is more protection in this Bill for the investors in public companies.  We welcome it because of the protection that is afforded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the willingness on the part of the Government to implement the provisions of the second EEC directive on company law.  The amendment is all the more welcome because it is originating in the Seanad and thereby making the Seanad a more effective House.  The debate on constitutional reform in which I took part was one of the finest debates ever heard in either House and it originated in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the directive only applies to public companies, limited by shares and limited by guarantee, it is considered worthwhile <Col N="510" /> in the interest of company law to apply many of the provisions to private companies. The Bill provides that the registrar will not grant a certificate of registration unless the statutory declaration is completed to the effect that the nominal value of the allotted share capital will not be less than £30,000.  As has already been stated, this figure for a public limited company seems very small: when one thinks about the size of the operation and when one compares it with a private company, the figure of £30,000 share capital and base capital before you start the operation is to me very small indeed. When you take the cost of one house as in effect £35,000, you are talking about a big operation starting with a very small capital.  So I think that should be looked at.  There are reasons for and against; a figure has to be arrived at.  I think that the figure of £30,000 is too low.  I would suggest however that the provisions be applied to private companies.  At present the private limited companies according to the Minister's statistics, are now mounting to 55,000.  In the last debate in which I took part I suggested that about 99.5 per cent of all companies in this country are private companies.  This is borne out by the figure of 55,000 against 340 public companies.  When we look at the capital makeup of these private companies we find that the issued share capital is £100 and in effect the only thing you need is £2 paid up capital.  The majority of companies in Ireland have as their base capital the figure of £2.</P>
    <P>The law as it stands allows for the formation of these private limited companies to commence trading on such a low base and confers on the directors of these private companies full protection as far as limited liability is concerned.  We are agreed, and in fact it has been stated that it is probably on the Fourth Directive that we will talk about the reforming of private limited companies, but the low capital base encourages people to get involved in very risky businesses which they would not necessarily do if they had to have a high capital base.  When we talk about the things that are at stake, we talk about the employees and creditors and the innocent people whose lives have <Col N="511" /> been dedicated to these small companies, companies who will take massive risks and who are in effect in most cases made up by a husband and wife.  The husband in effect often has under his control up to 15 or 20 companies.  It is very simple to form a private limited company.  The major cost in effect is just the formation cost.</P>
    <P>In the case of the public company, the certificate is sufficient evidence that the company is entitled to do business and exercise borrowing powers.  To operate without a certificate is a criminal offence. This would well be applied to private limited companies, making it mandatory to have a base capital, either by guarantee or by issued share capital, in region of £5,000 to £10,000.  This would have the effect of ensuring that the directors of limited companies have reasonable assets before they commence to form a limited company.  The Act provides that a private company is prohibited from offering shares to the public.  If the private company offers shares to the public it loses certain privileges, and one of these privileges is to file accounts.  If they offer shares outside the private companies they would then have to file accounts.  So, the filing of accounts is mandatory on the public company.  The law will have to be changed to compel private limited companies to file accounts.</P>
    <P>As I have stated in a previous debate there is no reason why firms should not file their accounts with their annual returns.  These accounts are in fact prepared for tax purposes and therefore the amount of added paperwork is not sufficient reason why these accounts should not be submitted to the Companies Office.  The disclosure would be of major benefit to employees and to other companies dealing with that organisation. This Bill gives the independent expert power to require information and explanations from officers of public companies, and makes it an offence for anybody to give false or misleading information. The expert or the inspector of inquiry should be appointed by the Minister with full powers to investigate private limited companies and to inquire into the capital <Col N="512" /> activities and performances of such companies. This would give employees and creditors and the general public protection and information on the company's activities.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that when it becomes known to a director of a public company that the net assets of that company have fallen to half or less than half of the called up share capital, an extraordinary general meeting must be called for the purpose of taking effective action.  The proposed meeting would enable shareholders and company managers to take early and appropriate action to cope with financial difficulties.  This provision should apply to all private limited companies and would act as an early warning system against companies getting into financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>The case of limited liability is central to this whole debate.  The public company in order to commence trading is subject to very strict rules and regulations.  Its base capital has to be financed &mdash; we may disagree with the amount, but the figure of £30,000 has to be there.  In the case of a private limited company the base capital can be as low as £2.  The cover which limited liability gives the individual should be looked at and investigated as a matter of urgency.  The public companies are well controlled and they act under strict supervision from the Government. These public companies only account for less than 1 per cent of all companies in Ireland.  But the private limited companies which virtually control the whole trade of this country and account for 99.5 per cent of all companies, operate with full protection but with absolutely no control from the Government over their activities.</P>
    <P>The public companies are duly bound to file their annual return and their accounts and in this return other companies in which the directors have an interest should be specified and shown. At the moment, the situation is that with public companies, in their annual return, in their accounts they show all the other companies that they are involved in, but as far as the directors of these companies are concerned, these are not shown.  I think that the Act should be amended to <Col N="513" /> show the various directors and all of the other companies that they are involved in.  We have argued in fact that the same thing should happen with private companies, and a method should be found to look at and investigate all these pyramid type companies where you have mergers and amalgamations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Lanigan's contribution was to be very short but in <Col N="514" /> fact it was quite long.  I shall wind up by welcoming this Bill.  It is a very good Bill for public companies.  It should be examined in regard to its application to private companies.  Indeed part of the memorandum which I read stated that it should be looked at in connection with private limited companies.  I think that should be done.  The private limited company law demands reform.  The public companies are controlled but private limited companies are not.  It will be interesting to see, when the Fourth Directive comes up, the consensus of opinion which we will get for all these measures about accounts.  It will be interesting to see if Members on the other side of the House will be willing to allow and to demand that private limited companies file their accounts with their annual returns.  That is the whole base and centrepiece of any investigation, information or control which the Minister wishes to get for private companies.  It will depend on the lodging of the accounts and their examination at the Companies Office.  I am sorry for having taken as much time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister here again and I also welcome this Bill. Honesty was certainly the best policy with regard to the Minister in his speech. He is right when he says that some Senators are aware that not alone was it meant to be brought into force in the member states within two years of the directive, which was 13 December, 1976 but some Senators are also aware that Ireland had been taken to the European Court on it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the matter of the limited company I hope there will not be such a delay in the case of the next directive not only because we might be brought before the European Court but because of the need for justice particularly to the employees and because of the unlimited and unbridled freedom that private companies now have.  We as a society should face up to this and bring in the legislation as soon as possible.  I acknowledge the Minister's commitment in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reiterate what Senator Conway and Senator Lanigan said.  It seems incredible that whilst I would question <Col N="515" /> the £30,000 in the context of values today, at least there is a minimum and it is to be welcomed.  The minimum share capital of £2 for private companies is outrageous.  As has been shown both in the Minister's speech and in the remarks of Senator Conway we know that the major bulk of companies in Ireland are private companies and that the major number of crashes have also been in private companies.  It is very urgent that we would question that a huge empire could be built on a risk capital of £2.</P>
    <P>Section 40 relates to article 17 of the directive.  I welcome the Minister's remarks on this.  It does a lot to tighten up the liberties and eliminate abuses which occurred.  In reading Article 17 of the EEC Second Directive it is clearly spelled out that at the extraordinary general meeting which must be called when it becomes known by any director of the company that there is a serious loss of &mdash; I think &mdash; half of the subscribed capital, consideration should be given as to whether the company should be wound up or what other measures should be taken.  That is taking a very serious view. When that is translated into our Bill I find it says &ldquo;for the purpose of considering whether any, and if so, what measures should be taken to deal with the situation&rdquo;. This does not carry the thrust and force of what Article 17 states within the directive.</P>
    <P>I think we were all anxious that within our legislation we could have meetings where the obligation would be met, but the thrust and fundamental reason for having such meetings might not be met. I should also like to have it provided that they would not fulfil their obligation by just having only one meeting and making a decision on that.  Perhaps it should also be provided that there be a review in three or six months or that the company be called on to have another meeting with a six-month period to review the situation and see if things have improved or otherwise. We know that in many of our companies, even when serious losses appeared and a downward slope was being followed the progress downwards was not stopped.  One extraordinary general <Col N="516" /> meeting might not answer the needs of that situation.  I hope the Minister understands what I am getting at and that we should perhaps provide for the calling of a second meeting.</P>
    <P>In the case of many companies that collapse the directors deny that they had knowledge of the serious financial situation of the company and that they had not considered the position in relation to the provisions of the Companies Act, 1963, relating to fraudulence of trading. Even when a heavy loss begins to occur in a company a certain amount of risk or sheer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The best I could do would be to deal on Committee Stage next week with the various points raised.  The question of the minimum capital for private companies was raised by several Senators.  Obviously it is a matter of some interest.  We gave it some thought but I decided against putting it into this Bill because the Bill deals primarily and almost exclusively with public companies.  It is not easy to fix on any figure because there are many private companies which are trading very satisfactorily with little or no capital.  Capital is only one of the elements that goes towards the creation of a business success. That is a matter which might perhaps be developed further at the next Stage but it is worth bearing in mind that the Second Directive lays down a formula which, in our case, would have resulted in a minimum figure of £16,000 for the authorised capital of a public company and in fact I chose to almost double that figure to £30,000.  The House may have noticed that there is power for the Minister to increase the figure further by order under section 19 if that is considered appropriate.  I would envisage that in some years an order would be made increasing it somewhat above the £30,000 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the House for their welcome for the Bill.  If Second Stage is passed tonight I would hope that we would get the remaining Stages next week so that the Bill might be put through the Dáil and we would be in a position to concentrate on two Bills which I hope to produce <Col N="518" /> in the autumn.  One of these is on the Fourth Directive and the other on domestic issues relating mainly to the abuse of limited liability which we discussed on the previous Bill before the House.</P>

      <P>Senator West has given notice that he proposes to raise on the Adjournment the unreasonable delays in payments under the dental benefit scheme by the Department of Social Welfare.  I call Senator West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I will remark before I start that it is rather like the old days when we used regularly meet until 10 o'clock in the evening.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise the problem of unreasonable delay in payments under the dental benefit scheme by the Department of Social Welfare.  I raise this not in a critical spirit. There is an important criticism to be made but I want to try to make constructive criticisms of the difficulties that arise. At the moment something like 825,000 of our citizens qualify for this scheme. The delays in payments to the dentists who treat patients who come under this scheme stretch as far as 18 months.  I am aware of this because I was shown a form by my own dentist in Cork during the week.  First of all the payment was queried, then the application was queried, then it was passed without change.  The total delay between the treatment and the receipt of payment by the dentist from the Department of Social Welfare was 17 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was told by the Irish Dental Association that this is not an isolated case.  My own dentist had a large number of these slips.  Some of them had been returned <Col N="519" /> from the Department of Social Welfare. He said he was no longer prepared to operate the scheme.  There was too much trouble, so much form-filling, and when he filled in the forms he did not see the pay-off at the end of the line, so he was going to opt out of the scheme.  On inquiry it appeared that a number of dentists feel similarly about the scheme.  The Irish Dental Association's Annual Report 1981, on page 4 makes the following comments.  It said that the entire administration of the scheme was poor. Identification of patients' eligibility is non-existent.  Processing of approvals and claims is far too slow.  It is unreasonable to expect dentists to undertake costly treatments which they may never be reimbursed for.  It also said that no other profession or, indeed any supplier of services is expected to deliver without positive identification of the recipients' entitlement and that it is essential that eligible patients have some form of identification card valid for a specific period and guaranteeing the patients' entitlement for that period.</P>
    <P>That is the view of the professional body representing dentists in this country, and they have a point to argue.  Their members are being paid very tardily for their services.  In some cases they have not been paid at all because there are disputes about eligibility.  I would like the Minister to look into this.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the people who will suffer if payments are held up indefinitely or even for long periods and dentists opt out of the scheme, are the less privileged members of our community. Most of them are in the lower income bracket and they will be the people who will be penalised.</P>
    <P>I would like also to make the following point: I believe that we have a very good dental service and, in spite of criticisms such as this, our standard of dental care is high and our general dental maintenance is also extremely good.  The dentists quite rightly advocate prevention rather than treatment, and one important administrative change that is needed is that the preventive side of treatment be <Col N="520" /> encompassed in any sort of scheme as well as the treatment which involves actual operative procedures, If we concentrate more and more on prevention, it will lighten the burden of correction at the far end.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister that it is absolutely unreasonable to expect dentists to wait for up to 18 months for payment of their bills by the State.  Something should be done to straighten out the problem of entitlement, which should be a straightforward problem.  I believe that the Department of Social Welfare are doing their utmost to rectify the situation, but some more administrative changes may be necessary before this scheme works fluently.  It is a very important aspect of our total health service and it is very important that it should be seen to progress rather than regress, I would like to bring the problem to the Minister's attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Gallagher,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Mayo West):</i> First of all, as Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare I am only too delighted to hear from any public representative in relation to irregularities of the kind which Senator West referred to.  From the information I have from my Department the facts are not as stated by Senator West.  I would submit at this stage that in the case he put before the House he has taken what may be an isolated case and generalised.</P>
      <P>Dental treatment under the dental benefit schemes is provided by the dentists who are on the dental panel.  It is open to any qualified dentist to apply to have his name placed on this dental panel.  To do so he signs an agreement under which he undertakes to treat insured persons in the same manner as private patients and he agrees to a set scale of fees for the various treatments provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dental profession is represented by the Irish Dental Association and in recent times to a minor degree by the Medical Union.  The fees are increased periodically in line with the general fee increase and in recent years have been increased each year from 1 April, and <Col N="521" /> are negotiated with the two representative bodies.  There are approximately 620 dentists on the dental panel and 234,659 claims for dental benefit were made last year.  In the first five months of this year, from January to May 1982, 108,253 dental claims were received.  The Department pay the full cost of extractions, fillings including acidetch, composite and pin-retained amalgam fillings, certain treatments, X-rays, scaling and polishing and portion of the the cost of dentures, repairs and crowns.  To obtain dental treatment an insured person must attend a dentist whose name appears on the dental panel.</P>
    <P>Under present arrangements a dentist may proceed and complete any treatment in respect of which the Department pay the full cost provided the dentist is satisfied that his patient is qualified for dental benefit.  If, however, the treatment, such as supply of dentures, requires the insured person to pay a portion of the cost, then prior approval must be obtained so that the Department may have the opportunity of informing both dentist and patient of the amount the patient will have to pay as his contribution. If, however, a dentist has any doubts as to the eligibility of his patient he may seek Department sanction before he proceeds with any treatment.</P>
    <P>This is the point as far as the Senator is concerned.  When treatment is completed the patient signs a certificate of satisfaction and the dentist submits the claim for payment.  If the insured person is qualified according to the Department's records the claim is then listed for payment.  This is normally done within 21 days of receipt of his claim.  Payments for the month are totalled in respect of each individual dentist on the last day of each month and a cheque for the total amount due is issued to each dentist between the 10 and 15 of the next month.  Each cheque is accompanied by a schedule setting out the individual amounts which comprise the total, and the payments procedure is computer-based.</P>
    <P>About 80 per cent of all dental claims received for payment fall into the straight flow category.  However, about 10 per <Col N="522" /> cent of claims require further investigation regarding the insurance record of the patient concerned.  This usually involves writing to the patient for particulars of insurance.  Frequently the person concerned is slow in responding, thus causing delay in payment of the claim for the dentist concerned.  In a further 10 per cent of claims, no PRSI number or an incorrect number is quoted, thus giving rise to further investigation and delays. In the vast majority of dental claims the dentist involved is paid promptly.  When dentists submit lists of claims which they claim are unpaid it is usually found on investigation that the majority have already been paid and that the dentist's records systems are at fault.  The Irish Dental Association who represent the interests of dentists are well aware that the Department are always most willing to co-operate in streamlining the system in any way possible in the interests of both the dentists and the insured persons. The Department are not aware of any widespread complaints regarding delays in the payment of claims, and The Irish Dental Association have not made any representations to the Department on behalf of the profession on this matter.</P>
    <P>On the transfer of the contribution record system to pay-related social insurance, that is PRSI, in 1979 using computer produced data, certain difficulties arose but these have now been ironed out and the system is running smoothly.  The total allocation in respect of dental benefit for 1982 is £7 million.  From the information I have received from the Department they are quite satisfied that, in general, the scheme is operating fairly successfully.  On average, about £11,000 per dentist is paid out.  As in all schemes, there may be situations where there are isolated cases of mistakes or faults.  I accept the Department's word that of all the schemes operated by the Department, this would have to be regarded as one of the most satisfactory.</P>
