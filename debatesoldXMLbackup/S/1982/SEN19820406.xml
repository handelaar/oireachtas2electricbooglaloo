      <P>The Bill extends the provisions of the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1981, to 25 July 1982 or to the date of commencement of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, whichever date first occurs. The Bill is required in the event that the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1982, is referred by the President to the Supreme Court in accordance with Article 26 of the Constitution to test the constitutionality of the Bill.  The extension of the temporary legislation will ensure that tenants of controlled dwellings will continue to be protected against rent increases and against demands by landlords for possession of their dwellings. <Col N="478" /> We shall in the course of the day's sitting be dealing with the permanent Act and in these circumstances I think I need not go further in relation to this short Bill which I commend to the House.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to dwell too long on this short Bill, because, as the Minister says, we will be dealing with the longer Bill and substantial legislation later on.  I would like to express our support for the short Bill.  The Minister has met very fairly the view of the other House and the wish of the Members of our party in the other House that this temporary provisions continuance Bill should be introduced.  In that regard I should like to thank the Minister for his co-operation and courtesy and to extend a welcome to him on his appointment as Minister and on his first appearance in the House.  I hope that he will have a successful, though short, tenure of office. The main Bill will be discussed later and I have nothing further to add on this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot be as brief as the Minister or Senator O'Leary in relation to this Bill.  I welcome the Minister on his first visit to this House since taking office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to examine the background to this Bill in more detail than the Minister has done in his speech.  I say this because of the very serious underlying problem which faces the Seanad in the area of controlled tenancies, both in this Bill and the other Bill which we will discuss later.  I do not propose to make any party political points or to allocate blame in this matter to any Minister or Government. This is a very serious issue which has caused immense worry and anxiety and, in some cases, physical illness.  In a number of cases it has led to steps being taken which were not warranted under the then existing law.  The problem has also been of concern to landlords, particularly where the landlord is in more deprived circumstances than the tenant &mdash; in other words, where the tenant has taken advantage of the controlled tenancy under the pre-existing law and is paying a very low rent whilst enjoying, <Col N="479" /> perhaps, a much higher income than the landlord.  I recognise that in some cases there are two sides.  There are some instances where the equity is on the side of the landlord, but these are only some individual cases.  The main thrust of the legislation dealing with this problem is addressed to seeking to secure a reasonable position for the tenants of premises which were formerly controlled.  It is worth confessing that we, as a Legislature, have singularly failed to do that since the problem arose in June 1981.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of us can be happy with the long period that has expired since June 1981 and the heartache, worry and concern that have been caused to a very substantial number of tenants affected by the decision of the Supreme Court and by the legislation which ensued.  We must be particularly concerned when we know that very many of these tenants are elderly; very many of them are living in very deprived circumstances as it is and they have no alternative option if they are forced to leave those premises and they could not afford to pay some free market rent if that was imposed on them.  They have lived in great fear and great anxiety.  I do not believe that any of us can be happy about the way in which successive Governments and we, as a Legislature, have responded to that problem.  I do not believe we have given it sufficient priority.  I do not believe we have addressed ourselves with anything like the degree of urgency that we should have to redressing the problem.</P>
    <P>The first legislative measure that was passed is the one we are seeking to continue in this Bill.  It was the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1981 which came into effect on 16 July 1981. That Act froze the pre-existing position, continued the pre-existing position pending the enactment of legislation to deal with the issues raised by the Supreme Court.  That was done in July because the Oireachtas was about to go into summer recess.  That meant that although the legal position had been successfully challenged, the response at that time of the Oireachtas was to say, &ldquo;Well, we are <Col N="480" /> going to allow it to continue for a short period while we address ourselves to the new legislation which will replace the old legislation&rdquo;.  It effectively meant that the sections of the legislation which had been struck down as unconstitutional were being continued for a temporary period.</P>
    <P>The question we have to ask ourselves, and it is a very serious question, is how long can this continue?  How long can we go on freezing a position which was declared by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional?  It is an invidious position to be in and indeed I do not want to add further to the anxiety and the alarm of the tenants who are protected by the 1981 Act and now this Bill proposing to continue that Act freezing the existing situation and continuing the rent controlled premises.  It raises very important and complex legal issues and even issues which bring into very sharp focus the relationship between the Judiciary pronouncing upon the constitutionality of legislation and the Oireachtas concerned about policy in relation to tenancies, to rent and rent restrictions generally and in relation to ownership and the control of land and rights that flow from that.</P>
    <P>I have serious doubts about this Bill because as it is going through this House it is proposing to continue until 25 July, that is for more than a year, a situation declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in their judgment.  That is very worrying.  That is a problem that the Minister faces indeed and I have considerable sympathy for him because he does not have any easy options on it.  He is faced with the need for a holding position until the Government are sure that the next Bill we are going to consider this afternoon is constitutional and until the question has been determined of whether it, too, will be referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26.</P>
    <P>I have to put a question to the Minister. Has he considered the possibility that this Bill might be referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26?  The position as set out in the first of the judgments of the Supreme Court which was handed down in a decision called Blake and Madigan against the Attorney General, was handed down in June 1981.  That decision <Col N="481" /> appeared to state in unequivocal terms that the particular sections were in breach of one of the two Articles of the Constitution which protect property rights, namely Article 40.3.2.  Since we are proposing in this Bill to continue that situation in operation until next July, it is on this Bill that it is appropriate to refer to the reasoning and conclusion of the Chief Justice in delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court.  There was only one judgment of the Supreme Court because it was a judgment on the constitutionality of the particular measure.</P>
    <P>I propose to quote the extract from the judgment from the report in the <i>Irish Law Reports Monthly</i>, Volume 1, No. 2, 1981.  It does not contain the full judgment which I have here but it is a convenient source from which to quote what the Chief Justice had to say.  It is appropriate to start at the part of the judgment where he considered the relevant Articles which protect the property rights of citizens. We have to look at this because we are the ones who will have to take the policy decisions.  It is our responsibility and has been since June 1981 to take decisions which will stand up on this issue and to afford protection, particularly to the most vulnerable sector of our community.</P>
    <P>In looking at Articles 43 and 40.3.2 the Chief Justice in the Report stated:</P>
    <P>Article 43 is headed by the words &ldquo;Private Property&rdquo;.  It defines the attitude of the State to the concept of the private ownership of external goods and contains the State's acknowledgement that a natural right to such exists, antecedent to positive law, and that the State will not attempt to abolish this right or the associated right to transfer, bequeath and inherit property. The Article does, however, recognise that the State &ldquo;may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.  It is an Article which prohibits the abolition of private property as an institution, but at the same time permits, in particular <Col N="482" /> circumstances, the regulation of the exercise of that right and of the general right to transfer, bequeath and inherit property.  In short, it is an Article directed to the State and to its attitude to these rights, which are declared to be antecedent to positive law.  It does not deal with a citizen's right to a particular item of property such as a controlled premises.  Such rights are dealt with in Article 40 under the heading &lsquo;Personal Rights&rsquo; and are specifically designated among the personal rights of citizens.  Under this Article the State is bound, in its laws, to respect and as far as practicable to defend and vindicate the personal rights of citizens.</P>
    <P>There exists, therefore, a double protection for the property rights of a citizen.  As far as he is concerned, the State cannot abolish or attempt to abolish the right of private ownership as an institution or the general right to transfer, bequeath and inherit property. In addition he has the further protection under Article 40 as to the exercise by him of his own property rights in particular items of property.</P>
    <P>The question of the relationship of Article 40.3.2 to Article 43 was discussed in <i>The Attorney General v Southern Industrial Trust Limited and Simons 1960 94 ILTR 161.</i> In that case Lavery J. when delivering the judgment of the court said, at p. 176: &lsquo;In any event, in the opinion of the court, the property rights guaranteed are to be found in Article 43 and not elsewhere, and the rights guaranteed by Article 40 are those stated in Article 43.&rsquo; The court is unable to accept this view.  Article 43 does not state what the rights of property are.  It recognises private property as an institution and forbids its abolition.  The rights in respect of particular items of property are protected by Article 40.3.2, by which the State undertakes by its laws to protect from unjust attack and in the case of injustice done, to vindicate the property rights of every citizen.  It is the duty of the courts to protect such property rights from unjust attack and the decision as to what is such an attack is to be made by the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that as a general ruling, but it is very difficult to understand the problem and to examine, from a legislative perspective, a Bill to deal with that problem without knowing in fairly substantial detail, what the legal position is.  This may not be easy listening and I sympathise with some of my colleagues who sit here patiently during an examination, but I submit it is necessary to know what precisely was the problem the Supreme Court identified, why the Supreme Court struck down the legislation, and then to ponder on whether we can reinstitute that position and continue it until 25 July.  That is the Bill before us. I will try to limit my quotations in so far as possible, but I submit that I must be able to refer to the relevant passages of the judgment.</P>
      <P>The next relevant passage is where the Chief Justice applies the Article 40.3.2. of the Constitution and said:</P>
      <P>In this case the plantiffs claim that their rights to the private property in question have, by the impugned legislation, been subjected to unjust attack and that what has been done is in breach of Article 40.3.2. of the Constitution. In the opinion of the court, this legislation cannot be regarded as regulating or delimiting the property rights comprehended by Article 43.  It accordingly requires to be examined for its validity in relation to Article 40.3.2.  The question, therefore, to be decided is whether the impugned provisions of the Act of 1960 (as amended) constitute an unjust attack on the property rights of the plaintiff.</P>
      <P>I now come to the two parts of the judgment where the Chief Justice applied the law to the facts, and found it was unconstitutional.  At the top of page 45 of this report he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the opinion of the court, the provisions of Part II of the Act of 1960 (as amended) restrict the property rights <Col N="484" /> of one group of citizens for the benefit of another group.  This is done without compensation and without regard to the financial capacity or the financial needs of either group, in legislation which provides no limitation on the period of restriction, gives no opportunity for review and allows no modification of the operation of the restriction. It is, therefore, both unfair and arbitrary.  These provisions constitute an unjust attack on the property rights of landlords of controlled dwellings and are therefore contrary to the provisions of Article 40.3.2 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In addressing himself to the question of the landlord's lack of power to recover possession, the Chief Justice stated:</P>
    <P>In the view of the court, a restriction to this extent of a landlord's right to obtain possession of rented premises is not in itself constitutionally invalid, provided the restriction is made on a basis that it is not unconstitutionally unfair or oppressive, or has not due regard both to the personal property rights of the landlord and the rights that should be accorded to tenants having regard to the common good.  However, the restriction on the right to recover possession contained in Part IV is not distinguishable, or capable of being saved, by such considerations.  It is an integral part of the arbitrary and unfair statutory scheme whereby tenants of controlled dwellings are singled out for specially favourable treatment, both as to rent and as to the right to retain possession, regardless of whether they have any social or financial need for such preferential treatment and regardless of whether the landlords have the ability to bear the burden of providing such preferential treatment.</P>
    <P>They were the grounds on which the Supreme Court found the relevant provisions of the existing legislation unconstitutional. In July 1981 we had the temporary Bill which re-enacted those provisions for a period.  We are now proposing in this Bill to continue the same <Col N="485" /> provisions until July, unless the second Bill to be taken today is passed and enacted into law in the meantime and replaces that measure.  There is a legal difficulty in doing that.  The Legislative last July said it was necessary to do something for a temporary period &mdash; and there is a portion of the judgment of the Supreme Court that I have just referred to where that is one of the criteria mentioned:</P>
    <P>This is done without compensation and without regard to the financial capacity or the financial needs of either group, in legislation which provides no limitation on the period of restriction.</P>
    <P>That is only one of the grounds on which the original legislation was found to be unconstitutional.  When the first temporary provision was brought in, there was a limitation on it and we extended it; now we are proposing a further extension for more than a year.  This raises a very serious question as to whether that is the kind of very limited and temporary provision which might be permitted by the passage I have just read in the judgment of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The reason I feel it is appropriate to ponder on this is that it gets back to my original point.  Since the very far-reaching and significant judgment of the Supreme Court in June 1981 &mdash; a judgment which affected critically the stability and security in their homes of very vulnerable people &mdash; this Oireachtas has not addressed itself to this matter with sufficient care, attention, time and energy. Perhaps we should not have had a summer recess; perhaps we should have had far more sittings in the period between September and Christmas, and since, in which to fully thrash out the kind of replacement legislation we sought to enact.  At the moment, there is a cloud over this Bill, as well as a potential cloud over the Bill we will be considering later and on which I will make my comments in due course.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to an even more difficult area.  In looking at the interpretation by the Supreme Court of the Articles on property, it is clear from the judgment in the Blake and Madigan case that <Col N="486" /> in considering the property rights of individuals, the Article in question is not Article 43, which guarantees no abolition of property rights, but Article 40.3.2.  It is worth looking at that Article because it is one of the most basic Articles for the protection of the personal rights of individuals in the Constitution which has contributed more to a growing jurisprudence in the protection of human rights than any other Article.  Article 40.3 provides:</P>
    <P>1º The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of a citizen.</P>
    <P>2º The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.</P>
    <P>We are talking about vindicating property rights.  The legislation was struck down as being unconstitutional because it did not adequately vindicate the property rights of the class of landlords involved in relation to the class of tenants involved &mdash; the tenants in rent controlled properties.</P>
    <P>The problem for us as elected representatives, as people who are concerned about policy in this matter, is that that Article is extremely difficult to contemplate amending because it is the key Article in the protection of personal rights.  It is not just a question of somehow adjusting that Article and feeling that we can get over this problem, because I do not believe we have a problem which arises from the particular interpretation by the Supreme Court of property rights &mdash; perhaps one could say, not so much the interpretation, but the application of their interpretation to the cases before them.  I am inhibited in my remarks in relation to the Supreme Court by the fact that I am a practitioner and, even with the privilege of this House it would not be appropriate for me to do more than point up the problem which arises, which is there in this Bill and the next Bill, and which the Minister would have to see, about how the Legislature is <Col N="487" /> to respond to the particular interpretation of words.  That is the proper role and function of the Supreme Court &mdash; to interpret words.  I express this view because I would be interested in the contributions of other Senators on this point, as it is one of the most important things we could be debating and I am glad we have this opportunity to discuss it.  It seems that when property rights are related to land, the application by the Supreme Court of the principles which derive from the Articles is much more absolute.  There is much greater protection of a property right in relation to land than there is for any other property right. For example, publicans, hotels or shops cannot charge what they want, they cannot make a property profit to the extent they want, particularly in relation to prices that can be charged in public houses or hotels.  The trade would respond in dismay to the responsible Minister that he was putting them out of business, that they could not continue.  I submit that that is a property right.  Yet it would appear that there can be very substantial regulation and control of that property right.  It appears to be much more difficult to have control of a property right to land.  It is as though there was some difference in the way in which the Supreme Court approach the application of the principles relating to property, when it is land.</P>
    <P>This is more evident in the second judgment of the Supreme Court to which I will refer when we are discussing the next Bill.  It seemed evident that when the Supreme Court delivered judgment on the reference in the Bill passed before Christmas that the principles applied appeared to rule that the rent a landlord was entitled to get was the market rent, and if there was any inroad on that, for example, was as there was in that legislation by having a phased period over five years, that did not defend and vindicate the property right of the landlord.  There are inroads of the kind I described on all kinds of property rights.  There is the whole are of planning controls, which seem to be another kind of inroad.  Yet in this case, we seem to be faced with a <Col N="488" /> very real difficulty &mdash; and it is a difficulty we will have to examine extremely carefully in relation to the second Bill because I do not think the second Bill gets over the difficulty &mdash; that the landlord is entitled to a fair market rent for the premises and any inroad on that, it appears, would be liable to be challenged as unconsititutional. We will deal with that when we look at the manner in which a fair rent is to be ascertained by the District Court under the Bill.</P>
    <P>It would be useful for Senators to take this opportunity to place on the records of this House a view on the protection of property rights under the Constitution. When I say &ldquo;a view&rdquo; I mean a policy approach.  What kind of policy do we want to see on this?  I speak as a member of the Labour Party who have a very clear policy in wishing to see proper social control and planning in relation to property rights in land.  We wish, for example, to control the price of and profits made out of re-zoning of development land. We are scandalised by what has happened in and around the city of Dublin and other cities of what can only be described in modern Irish circumstances as decadent profits being made by exploiting property rights without any control.  At the same time, for the reasons I have given, it is very difficult to know how to propose an amendment of the Constitution to deal with this.  It is difficult to know what wording could be put forward because it seems as though it is not the words in the Articles &mdash; the words in either Article 43 or Article 40.3 (2) &mdash; it is the approach, what one reads into those words, how one regards a property right.</P>
    <P>In this instance it is the individuals who compose the Supreme Court who have a view of that which has become an interpretation of our property rights and which is going to continue to pose very real problems for us.  It is a matter of the gravest concern and one on which we should ponder.  I hope that the Minister, in replying to this debate, will deal with these issues which arise on this Bill.  He introduced the Bill with an opening statement of half a page.  That is not good <Col N="489" /> enough.  We need to ponder on these matters.  We may not have easy answers. We may be opening up questions that will worry people but it is our responsibility to look at these things.  I hope the Minister will give a much fuller response when he replies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reserve what I have to say on the main matter until the next Bill.  Senator Robinson's contribution has prompted me to reflect on some of the basic issues she raised and on which there will be a more elaborate discussion in the next Bill. What is wrong it seems to me &mdash; I speak purely as a layman &mdash; is that the considerations of private property in the Constitution are paramount and mandatory. There is no corresponding concern in the Constitution for those who are at the receiving end of property.  Thus, proprietors are taken care in, as has been pointed out, two Articles.  They receive a double protection and the mandatory verb &ldquo;shall&rdquo; occurs only in connection with private property.  There is no such concern or guarantee by the State for those who are the victims of private property. Senator Robinson suggested that it would be extremely difficult to amend Article 40(2) because it contains such fundamental guarantees, for personel liberty anyway.  A review of the Constitution day in day out becomes more imperative. There is no topic discussed in this House that does not raise how imperative the reviewing of the Constitution is and it is shortsightness to the point of myopia on the part of the Government to close their eyes to that.  Is it not possible in a review of the Constitution to give the family corresponding rights, or equal rights, to those guaranteed to those who are in possession of private property? There is, of course, an Article on the family.  It does guarantee the family certain things, but it does not guarantee the family shelter or a home, which is an extraordinary omission.  There is more than enough for any reforming or crusading zeal which the incoming Government may have to consider in this matter.  I will confine myself to asking the Minister one point: in introducing the main Bill in the <Col N="490" /> Dáil he expressed the confidence that it would prove constitutional and can he give the same assurance or how does he feel about this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators O'Leary and Robinson for the welcome they extended to me on this my first occasion in the Seanad since the change of Government and on my appointment as Minister for the Environment. I should like to refer to Senator Robinson's contribution.  I was glad she started by saying that this was far too serious an issue for party politics because so many of the tenants involved are old and have suffered concern, anxiety and distress.  There are many landlords suffering this distress.  It is for that reason that I hope the main Bill we have before us will receive the welcome of the Seanad and will be passed as soon as possible to relieve the worry of the tenants that has existed since June 1981 from the original Supreme Court decision on the Blake-Madigan case.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson raised the question of how long the temporary Bill can continue. It was suggested in the other House that when the temporary Bill passed that there was no great urgency about the permanent legislation.  I am glad Senator Robinson recognised that this is a false impression.  There already exists a challenge in the courts to the existing temporary legislation.  There is also a major possibility of this temporary Bill being referred to the Supreme Court.  Extensions to the temporary Bill increase the risk that it too will be found to be unconstitutional. Were this to happen the position of tenants would be very serious indeed and the options open to the Government very limited.  Accordingly, it is imperative that the main Bill should become law at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson referred to the brief speech I made when introducing this temporary provisions Bill.  The main issues we have to debate today arise on the second Bill and it is for that reason that I reserve my main contribution to the introduction of that Bill.  Senator Robinson <Col N="491" /> also referred to the Blake-Madigan case.  The main Bill has been drafted in accordance with both the judgment on that case and also on the referral to the Supreme Court.  I do not purport to represent myself as a constitutional lawyer and, consequently, I must take the best legal advice available to me, that of the Attorney General and the legal advisers available to the Government.  This Bill has been drafted in accordance with that advice.  There can be different points of view and I have no doubt I will hear them from Senators with legal backgrounds and training in the course of the afternoon. I can assure the House that the Bill was drafted on the best legal advice available to the Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson made the point that perhaps the Dáil and Seanad should have continued to sit right through the summer to debate the issues which arose as a result of the Supreme Court decision last year.  I would remind the Senator that the Bill which the President referred to the Supreme Court, on the advice of the Council of State, appeared in December last year and it was not possible, even while we were in Opposition, to discuss legislation which we did not have before us.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy and Senator Robinson made the point that apart from property rights tenants also have rights and they must be protected in any legislation. The balance which I am trying to achieve in the second Bill is essentially a balance between the conflicting rights, and this is not easy to determine.  However, in the final analysis, we must fall back on our obligations under Article 45 of the Constitution &mdash; and this goes some way towards meeting the point made by Senator Murphy &mdash; to safeguard with special care the economic interests of the weaker sections of the community, and generally to promote the welfare of all the people by securing and protecting as effectively as we may a social order in which justice and charity shall inform all the institutions of the national life.  That is the principle which guided me in drafting the main Bill we will be discussing later on.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy also made the point <Col N="492" /> that he intended to reserve his main contribution on this whole area to the main Bill which we will be discussing later, and it is my intention also to reserve the remainder of my comments for the main Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 1, which is the effective section in this two-section Bill, I should like to refer to some of the comments the Minister made in his reply. It seems as though he is operating on a wish and a prayer.  He hopes this Bill will not be challenged because he admits there may be a problem in relation to it, and he hopes that the other legislation will come into effect and will not be challenged. Specifically this House ought to know at this stage if there is likely to be a reference to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of either or both of the Bills. If I am allowed to ask about this one only, is this Bill likely to be referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26?</P>

      <P>It would be highly improper for me or, I would suggest, for any Senator or Deputy or anybody else in the country to suggest to the President that any Bill should or should not be referred to the Supreme Court.  In the final analysis, this is a matter for the President, and it is not my intention here in this Chamber today to make any comment on the referral of this Bill to the Supreme Court.  As the Senator will be well aware, that is a decision for the President alone.  He can ask for the advice of the Council of State.  He does <Col N="493" /> not have to take it, as far as I am aware. It is a matter for himself.  He has seven days from the time the Bill gets to him to make a decision on that.</P>

      <P>Obviously I accept fully that it is not the Minister or, indeed, the Government who would take the decision to refer.  In his reply on this Bill the Minister expressed concern about its potential constitutionality.  When that was done previously an indication was given that there was at least some possibility of a reference, knowing that the actual decision to refer is a matter for the President, on which he may, and normally does, consult the Council of State.</P>
      <P>I want to make it very clear that it is not my desire or intention in any way to exacerbate the situation by further alarming already far too alarmed people, but we are legislators and there has been a tendency to avoid the problems in the past.  We have not looked carefully enough at the situation.  We have not faced up to the situation and it is about time we did.  It is about time we got away from a kind of wish and hope of a Minister that all would be well and came to a decision.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that this is an awkward time for Senators because we are a leftover Seanad going up for re-election. Many Senators are actively involved in that.  It is a pity when we are discussing something of such social importance and such deep concern to a very vulnerable sector that there are not more Senators here to pursue very actively on the record the particular issues which arise.  If anything, the Minister's reply has further concerned me, because it appears to share the anxiety about the constitutionality. It is for that reason I wish to know whether it is likely to be referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, it is not my business as Minister to defend the presence of Senators but I do know that at the start of business today there was a very full Seanad attendance which reflects very honourably on the Members of the Seanad who are taking their business very seriously and the matters before this House very seriously indeed, even <Col N="494" /> during the course of a Seanad campaign when the ballot papers are actually out. The presence of so many Senators here today does great credit to the Senators who are taking this matter very seriously.</P>
      <P>I want to say to the Senator that I am not operating on a wish and a hope.  In the response I gave to the Senator I was highlighting my fears about the Bill's constitutionality. I did this in the Dáil too. When the main Bill was originally introduced I did not introduce a temporary measure because of my fears with regard to its constitutionality.  It was in response to contributions made both by Fine Gael and Labour that I decided, because this is a non-party political issue, to bow to the wishes and advice of both Fine Gael and Labour.  Therefore I agreed to the introduction of the temporary Bill.  It is not a wish and a prayer.  All I am doing is voicing a concern about its constitutionality, and the situation which would arise for the unfortunate tenants if it were found to be unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>I specifically provided in section I that the Act shall have effect until the 25th day of July 1982 or the date of the commencement of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, whichever first occurs, and shall then expire.  The main Bill should be passed as soon as possible to remove alarm, fear, anxiety and concern from the unfortunate tenants and many landlords.  It should be passed as soon as possible for the reasons expressed by Senator Robinson and for the reasons I expressed both in the Dáil and Seanad.  The Supreme Court decision was made on 30 June last year and we cannot continue to pass temporary legislation. I am as concerned about that as anyone else.  I am fearful about the constitutionality of this Bill.  I want to get the main Bill through to protect the tenants' and the landlords' rights as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>May I make a point in connection with the Minister's reference to Article 45?  He said both in the Dáil and here that he would hope to fall back on Article 45 to guarantee the welfare and the interests of the weaker sections of the community.  Article 45 of the <Col N="495" /> Constitution comes closer to the democratic programme of the first Dáil and to the social vision &mdash; which inspired the founding fathers &mdash; than any other Article in the Constitution.  If that Article were in the main body of the Constitution many of our problems would not arise and the balance which the Minister seeks between private property and social justice would be established.  But Article 45 is a wish and a prayer, to borrow Senator Robinson's phrase; it is a pious aspiration. It is, to speak irreverently, pious codswallop for the simple reason that it is not cognisable by the courts and therefore until it is in the main body of the Constitution no Government and no court will take it seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Reluctantly I would have to take issue with Senator Murphy on that last point.  The High Court has, in an ingenious way, made at least partially cognisable, the direct principles of social policy in relation to a case on the equality of bar waitresses to be employed in a bar in a case about 1973.</P>
      <P>However, I wanted to take up the main thrust of what I have said, what Senator Murphy has said and indeed what the Minister has said in his reply, which is that this is a very difficult and worrying area.  We know now precisely what the nature of the problem is.  Can the Minister tell us whether the Government are going to continue and indeed accelerate the constitutional review &mdash; which Senator Murphy mentioned and to which the Minister did not respond &mdash; given this kind of difficulty, and it is not an isolated example?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The second Bill before the Seanad today in the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1982.  This Bill provides permanent legislation for these rented dwellings previously controlled under the Rent Restrictions code.  The Bill is broadly along the lines of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981, but there are a number of important differences to take account of the latest decision of the Supreme Court and of certain amendments put down by me when the 1981 Bill was before the Dáil last December, including rent allowances to tenants for whom payment of the higher rents would create hardship.</P>
      <P>This Bill arises out of a series of court decisions on the constitutionality of various laws relating to private rented residential accommodation.  It is needed to ensure that tenants who were previously protected under the rent restrictions code are not left entirely to the mercy of market forces.  It was suggested during last week's debate in the Dáil that perhaps the Bill was no longer as urgent as it previously was, since the temporary legislation protecting tenants is now being extended for a further period.  This is not the case.  As the Taoiseach pointed out in the Dáil, the temporary legislation provides no more that a fall back position to be used if necessary.  In the last analysis, it would be very unwise to place total reliance on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the temporary legislation is already under constitutional challenge in our courts and every extension of the legislation <Col N="497" /> increases the possibility of it, too, being declared unconstitutional.  Were this to happen, tenants would be placed in an impossible position with no obvious courses of action open to the Government to relieve their plight.  Faced with that dark picture of what might happen, Senators will understand my anxiety that this Bill should be passed into law as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In their judgment of 19 February 1982 the Supreme Court declared section 9 of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981, unconstitutional.  That section provided for the phasing-in of rent increases allowable under the Bill over a five year period.  The Supreme Court considered that the resultant depriving of the landlord of part of his just and proper rent for his property was an unjust attack on his property rights in contravention of Article 40.3 of the Constitution.  Accordingly the President declined to sign the Bill.  In the Dáil considerable time was devoted to this judgment and its implications. In this context we need to remember that, under the Constitution, the Supreme Court have a duty to ensure that legislation referred to them is in conformity with the Constitution.  It is up to the Supreme Court and no other body, to make this judgment.  The job of the Oireachtas in these circumstances is to enact legislation which is in conformity with the Constitution and its interpretation by the Supreme Court.  This is what I have sought to do in this Bill and to achieve in it a proper balance of the rights of landlords and tenants.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil particular attention was directed towards the new formula for the setting of gross rents in section 13 of the Bill.  Some Deputies argued that there was a serious risk that the basis for determining the gross rent of a dwelling as set out in section 13 raised fundamental questions as to constitutionality of that section.  I intend to address myself to this question here.  It was suggested in the Dáil that the only conclusion which could be drawn from the Supreme Court's judgment was that the just and proper rent for a dwelling was a market rent.  I do not think this is the only interpretation that can be taken from the judgment.  The real <Col N="498" /> objection of the Supreme Court was to the phasing-in of the just and proper rent over a number of years so depriving landlords of part of their proper return from their property.  The Bill before the House allows for payment from the outset of the just and proper rent determined in accordance with the criteria specified in section 13 of the Bill.  The advice available to the Government is that the provisions of section 13 are in conformity with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The other main issue that arose in the Dáil concerned the District Court being the proper forum to settle matters arising from the Bill.  In the first place it was held that the volume of cases would be too great for the District Courts to accommodate; secondly, that the formality of the proceedings would inhibit and upset tenants or landlords not familiar with how the courts operate; thirdly, that the tenants and, in some instances, the landlords would be faced with considerable costs; and, finally, that an administrative tribunal with legal and technical personnel on it would be preferable to the District Court as a means of arbitration.</P>
    <P>I would like to say at the outset that I share many of these concerns.  The Bill is designed to overcome these difficulties in so far as it is possible in the time available to me.  For example, a tenant's costs in connection with an application to the court by a landlord will normally be borne by the landlord.  On the question of rent tribunals a clear commitment has been given by the Taoiseach and by myself in the Dáil to set up such tribunals. Discussions in this connection will take place with the Opposition parties, at whatever level is appropriate, after Easter, and legislation to set up the tribunals will be introduced in the next session.  I want to emphasise that.  Perhaps I should stress there is no disagreement between the parties about the desirability of setting up rent tribunals.</P>
    <P>Senators must appreciate, however, that it would take some time before such tribunals could be fully functioning and could deal with the volume of cases that are likely to arise once the Bill becomes law.  It is not simply a matter of having an enabling section in this Bill.  Personnel <Col N="499" /> have to be recruited and trained, procedures set up, accommodation obtained, the precise terms of reference of the tribunal determined and so on.  There are also certain legal and constitutional difficulties to be sorted out.  These problems are not insurmountable but they will take some time to resolve.  In the meantime, the only realistic course is to use the District Court as the body to adjudicate on matters arising under this Bill.</P>
    <P>On the other problems associated with the use of the courts, the Government are taking steps to avoid disruption to the courts system generally by the extra burden this Bill will put on the District Court.  As I announced in the Dáil, the Government are appointing extra district justices in the Dublin area to deal with rent cases.  With a view to making for a more informal and consequently a less intimidating atmosphere, these justices will sit in accommodation separate from existing court buildings.  The Government will, of course, continue to monitor the situation in all parts of the country to ensure that the District Courts have the facilities to deal with the cases arising from this Bill.</P>

      <P>I must apologise to my fellow Senators for not having had the opportunity to give them any formal notice of what is now about to transpire. I am invoking Standing Order No. 29 to request permission that a specific important matter of public interest be debated by the Seanad as is provided under the Standing Order.  The matter in question, as I have specified in the Private Notice to the Chair, concerns the publication yesterday of the document on Northern Ireland concerning devolution issued by Mr. Prior, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My case for stating the motion is that the matter concerns the prospect of an elected Assembly in Northern Ireland and, furthermore, the possibility of <Col N="500" /> devolved Government.  These matters are of the most critical importance for Northern Ireland and for Ireland as a whole.  I should like to point out that the Seanad has pre-eminently been the Chamber which has discussed these matters. The urgent consideration aspect which is referred to in the Standing Order arises, I suggest, from the fact that this is very likely to be the last sitting of the Seanad and that it would be opportune and responsible for the House, before its dissolution, to draw attention to a matter of paramount and pressing public interest.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that I am reinforced in my view that it is a matter of urgent consideration because of what would seem to be <i>prima facie</i> the dismissive attitude of the present Government in respect of the document.  I am requesting that leave to debate the matter be given.</P>

      <P>The document to which the Senator referred is a publication of the United Kingdom Government which was published yesterday.  I understand that copies of the document are not available to Members.  Indeed, from informal inquiries which I have made I gather that supplies are obtainable only from the United Kingdom Stationery Office.  I am, of course, fully aware of the great importance of the matter.  However, since copies of the document are not available to Members, I do not see how it would be possible to have it discussed fully today.  To attempt to do so, in my opinion, would be a futile proceeding and in the circumstances I do not have any option but to rule that the matter is not one contemplated by the Standing Order to which Senator Murphy refers. I cannot allow any discussion on the ruling.</P>

      <P>I was going to intervene in support of Senator Murphy.  It had been my intention to point out that the full text of that document is carried in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.  Indeed the reaction and the rather dismissive, preemptive reaction of the Taoiseach, which Senator Murphy referred to, is also contained <Col N="501" /> in that and the other daily newspapers. So it is a situation in which although Senators may not have the official publication of the United Kingdom, we would have the text available.  I support Senator Murphy in this.  It would be appropriate, perhaps not this afternoon, but that we meet either tomorrow if we have a Committee Stage of this Bill to deal with or next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated earlier, this Bill follows the broad outlines of the Bill that was passed by the Oireachtas last December but part of which was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.  A number of important changes have been made in the light of the Supreme Court's judgment and to <Col N="502" /> cater for amendments put down by me during the passage of the earlier Bill through the Dáil, as well as other drafting and consequential changes to that Bill. Apart from the dropping of any arrangement to phase in rent increases and the new formula for determining rents, the most important change in this Bill is the inclusion of a section to enable the Minister for Social Welfare to pay allowances to tenants suffering hardship as a result of rent increases.  Normally such a provision would be part of social welfare legislation but, given the urgency of the matter and the time constraints, it was considered necessary to bring forward the provision in this Bill.  The details of the scheme of allowances and the regulations under which it will operate will be announced as soon as possible by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>A provision of £6 million was provided in the recent budget.  This was the same amount as in the January budget and questions as to its adequacy were raised in the Dáil.  The change in the formula for fixing rent, compared with the earlier Bill will reduce the subsidy demand and any saving can be set off against the extra cost arising from the omission of the earlier arrangements to phase in rent increases.  In any event, I would like to assure Senators that the Government will provide whatever funds are needed to finance the allowances schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill confers on tenants of dwellings previously controlled under the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960 a right to retain possession of the dwelling for their lifetimes. The same right is given to the spouse of the tenant.  Members of the family of the present tenant are given a right to possession for 20 years from the commencement of the Act.  Where a member of the tenant's family succeeds to the tenancy towards the end of the 20-year period, the member is given an extension of the time so that he is entitled to possession for a minimum of five years. This latter extension is in line with an amendment I proposed when the 1981 Bill was before the Dáil last December. A right to retain possession does not on its own provide the tenant with all the protection he needs.  There must also be <Col N="503" /> certain restrictions to safeguard the interests of landlords.  A mechanism is required to determine rents in case of dispute and to provide for the normal procedures whereby a landlord can recover possession of the dwelling in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined the reasons for the use of the District Court to determine rents in cases of dispute between the landlord and tenant.  The formula for doing so is very different from the 1981 Bill and allows the court to take into account, amongst other things, the nature, character and location of the dwelling, the means of the landlord and the tenant, the date of purchase of the dwelling and the amount paid for it, the length of the tenant's occupancy of the dwelling and so on.  This formula takes into account very many more factors that were provided for in the 1981 Bill.  Both the landlord and the tenant are given a right at any time to apply to the court to fix the terms of the tenancy but once fixed by the court the terms stay in force for five years.  In effect, therefore, rents can be reviewed at five yearly intervals which meets one of the more strident criticisms by the Supreme Court of the old rent restrictions code which provided no basis for a review of rents.</P>
    <P>The landlord is given certain rights to recover possession of a dwelling.  These are in line with the rights he had under the old Rent Restrictions Acts but he can regain possession only on foot of a court order for certain specified reasons. Where the landlord recovers possession for reasons which involved no fault or failure on the part of the tenant, the tenant may be entitled to substantial compensation &mdash; up to three years rent or alternative accommodation plus moving expenses.  These compensation provisions are more generous than under the 1981 Bill by reason of an amendment I moved in the Dáil increasing the maximum compensation from two to three years' rent or alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>As I think is widely recognised, this is a very difficult piece of legislation.  It has taken more than one attempt since the <Col N="504" /> first Supreme Court decision last July to fill the legislative vacuum created by that decision.  It is not to be expected that a Bill such as this will satisfy everybody. The main parties involved, landlords and tenants, have interests which are essentially opposing in nature, and legislative action must seek to balance these within the limits set by the Constitution and successive judgments of the Supreme Court.  Both parties cannot expect to get everything they demand.  In the light of the decisions of the Supreme Court, tenants cannot continue to enjoy the benefits they formerly had at a landlord's expense.  On the other hand, the Government in this Bill must meet their constitutional obligations to safeguard with special care the interests of the weaker sections of the community, among which are many tenants of controlled dwellings. The Bill before the House is a genuine effort to get the right balance as between these conflicting rights.  With these objectives in mind, I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. S. O'Leary Mr. S. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, introduced as it is in the closing stages of this session of the Seanad, is probably the most important piece of legislation which we have considered since we were convened last August.  It is, as other Members have made clear in a debate on the earlier temporary piece of legislation, all the more important because its predecessor, the 1981 Bill, was on reference to the Supreme Court declared to be unconstitutional. It is right that we should consider not only the nature of the content of the Bill in isolation and how it stands up as a piece of legislation, but also that we should view it in the context of the original decision which gave rise to this crisis in the area of housing &mdash; specifically the area of what were previously controlled dwellings &mdash; and also in the context of the decision of the Supreme Court arising out of the Madigan case. We should also consider it in the context of the decision of the Supreme Court arising out of the reference by the President of the 1981 Bill to test its constitutionality. We should differentiate between what we might like to see as an <Col N="505" /> ideal piece of legislation coming through the House, what we have before us and how we can amend it to bring it as close as possible to what we consider to be ideal while not infringing the Constitution as it is at present and as it is interpreted by the Supreme Court.  Whether we like it or not, the Constitution is not what is written on the piece of paper but how it is interpreted by the judges of the Supreme Court.  We have now two major judgments as an indication of the criteria which the Supreme Court will apply to any challenge to this Bill or any reference of this Bill by the President to them to test its constitutionality.  We can, therefore, say with some degree of accuracy what the view of the Supreme Court would be if they were presented with this piece of legislation.  I understand completely the views put forward by the Minister today and sympathise totally with his motivation in bringing this piece of legislation forward.  However, the Bill is deficient in many ways and I have the greatest possible fear that it too will be declared unconstitutional.  This would, of course, give rise to the problem outlined on the previous piece of legislation except that it would be compounded further. Every time we make an effort to legislate in this area and this effort is not successful we make the resultant continuation Bill that much more difficult to justify and that much more likely to be challenged either by reference by the President or by some citizen who believes his rights have been interfered with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I am not greatly impressed by the requests of the Minister for an urgent examination of this piece of legislation. Whatever the merits and demerits of the temporary legislation which has so recently passed through this House, at least for the purpose of our discussion we have to consider that that temporary legislation will, in fact, be effective.  There are ample grounds for optimism in that regard, as at the end of the judgment on the Madigan case which gave rise to this problem, the Supreme Court went out of their way to emphasise that legislation would be expected and that there would be a period of time between the judgment of the court and the enactment of the <Col N="506" /> legislation.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the Supreme Court will adopt a more favourable view towards the time which we take for the further consideration of the permanent Bill, that is that they will consider the problems arising from the constitutionality of the temporary Bill more favourably than they will the actual problems which will arise if they once again find that the permanent Bill which we are putting through is unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The Bill which is presented to us fails in a number of ways to tackle the problems which the Madigan judgment gave us.  It also fails to tackle the additional problems which were given to us as a result of the judgment which has been handed down on the 1981 Bill.  The Minister has been deluded if he thinks that the changes which he has made meet the objections of the Supreme Court.  I propose during the course of my Second Stage speech to say why I believe that to be a true statement.</P>
    <P>We must first of all understand the nature of the objection which the Supreme Court had to the 1960 legislation, which was declared unconstitutional in the Madigan case, and also in the case of the 1981 Bill, which was also declared unconstitutional.  It is very hard to pick one thread out of both judgments and to say exactly what the essence of both judgments is.  It is true to say that in the consideration of judgments judges allow their minds to range over many factors. But even allowing their minds to range over many factors, and even mentioning those factors in their judgment, we must be careful to differentiate in our own mind between the asides they are making which are not really the essence of their objection at all and what is, in fact, the essence of their objection.  That is what has happened in this regard.  The Minister has looked at the judgments which he has, has seen that there is a thread running through those judgments in which the Supreme Court said words to the effect that the differing and individual needs of the landlords and tenants were not taken into account.  He then assumed that this was in fact the main source of objection by the Supreme Court, while a <Col N="507" /> reading of their complete judgment in the Madigan case and only a partial reading by me of their judgment in the other case &mdash; unfortunately, due to an extraordinary situation that judgment is not easily available &mdash; seem to indicate that the essence of the argument there is quite different.  The essence of the argument of the Supreme Court is that one category of property owners, one category of owners of rented accommodation, cannot be arbitrarily set up for separate consideration by the Oireachtas and that the Oireachtas must treat all owners of all property which is for renting in a similar fashion.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court are not saying &mdash; in so far as I interpreted it &mdash; that it is improper to make regulations with regard to the amount of rent which would be paid by people in respect of property and in respect of dwellings.  What it is saying is that there is no logical, reasonable and constitutionally sound reason why dwellings in the course of construction on 7 May 1941 should be put into a separate category from other dwellings which were not constructed or were not in the course of construction prior to 7 May 1941 and that two different sets of criteria should apply.  The Supreme Court held, in my opinion, that to differentiate between houses which were built prior to 7 May 1941 and those built after that date was unjust and unwarranted. This is the essence of the objection which the Supreme Court has to the 1960 legislation, which it struck down, and is the essence of the objection which it has to the legislation which we passed through this House and which was referred by the President to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>This is where the Minister has failed to grasp the real objection of the Supreme Court.  If the Minister, in the Bill before us today, fails to arrive at a conclusion which satisfies the Supreme Court's view that there should be no difference between the treatment of landlords who owned property which was constructed before or after May 1941, by exactly the same line of reasoning, it is inevitable that the Supreme Court will declare <Col N="508" /> unconstitutional any Bill which fails to meet that test.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, against that background that we should consider the legislation before us.  It is for that reason that I find it so difficult to accept its constitutionality.  If I might digress for a short while, we find ourselves in a difficult position because we are not really considering whether we would like the Constitution to be something other than it is.  We must really consider the Constitution as it is, or must establish a system of rents which is both in conformity with the Constitution, that is, that will pass the test of the Supreme Court if it is referred to it, and that is also as near to our individual view of social justice as we could possibly make it.  Unfortunately, it is a fact of life that if there is a conflict between the constitutionality of legislation and social justice, we have no option but to err on the side of constitutionality. That is not something which we like saying or of which I approve, but it is a fact. The Minister is to be commended in so far as he recognises that fact within his Bill by making specific provision for the granting of rent rebates, even though he does not make it clear to us exactly how these are going to operate.</P>
    <P>I quote, not extensively, from page 8 of the Supreme Court's judgment, on the reference to Article 26 of the Constitution, with regard to the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Bill, 1981, which judgment summarises the arguments by quoting from the earlier legislation, stating that the legislation:</P>
    <P>applied only to some houses and dwellings and not to others, that the basis for the selection is not limited to the needs of tenants, to the financial and economic resources of the landlords, or to any established social necessity, and, since the legislation is now not limited in duration, is not associated with any particular or temporary emergency situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken the second portion ot that and seems to have come to the conclusion &mdash; in my opinion quite erroneously &mdash; that if the legislation which he puts before us takes into <Col N="509" /> account the financial and economic resources of the landlord, establishes social necessity and is not limited in duration, his problems are over.  He fails to cater adequately for the essence of the argument, which is that the basis of selection is the real problem of the case.  The court, in expressing its opinions on the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, went on to say that the provisions of Part II of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960 (amended):</P>
    <P>restricted the property rights of one group of citizens for the benefit of another group.  This is done without compensation and without regard to the financial capacity or the financial needs of either group, in legislation which provides no limitation on the period of restriction, gives no opportunity for review and allows no modification of the operation of the restriction.</P>
    <P>There are three essential elements contained in that.  In the original Madigan case, the reasons for its being declared unconstitutional were threefold, firstly, that it restricted the property rights of one group of citizens for the benefit of another group; secondly, that it was done without compensation and without regard to the financial capacity or financial needs of either group; thirdly, that it gives no opportunity for review and allows no modification on the operation of the restriction.  In the Bill which was before us before Christmas last year the permanent nature of the disability was lifted but that, apparently, did not satisfy the Supreme Court.  In addition to lifting the permanent nature of the disability, the Bill now before us goes to the second stage and talks about the financial capacity and financial needs of the individual groups.  However, it does not get over the problem that it still restricts the property rights of one group of citizens for the benefit of another group.  I continue with the quotation, from page 8 of the recent Supreme Court decision:</P>
    <P>These provisions constitute an unjust attack on the property rights of landlords of controlled dwellings and are, therefore, contrary to the provisions <Col N="510" /> of Article 40.3.2 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It appears that what has happened in this case is that the Supreme Court, having failed to declare a Bill constitutional which got rid of the permanent disability under which landlords of pre-1941 dwellings found themselves, and the Legislature having failed to consider that that went far enough, it is now proposed in this Bill before us that a second step should be taken to see that the financial needs of landlords and tenants should be taken into account.  This, however, does not confront the crucial problem in the Bill, which is the question of arbitrary selection of certain dwellings for special consideration and the restriction of the rights of landlords and owners of these properties compared with the rights of landlords and property owners of similar properties which happen to be built after 7 May 1941.  In these circumstances, whether it is a good or a bad thing, any Bill which comes before us which does not talk in terms of allowing the fair market rent is bound to fail.  The only way of solving this problem is by allowing the court or the tribunal, the appropriate body, to assess the fair market rate but giving to that tribunal or court the view of the Oireachtas as to what is the fair market rent.  We can draw on our experience and can indicate what our view on that matter is.  I have an amendment down which will cover that problem.</P>
    <P>The solution proposed by the Minister is not a solution at all.  I want to draw the attention of the House to what the Minister said in his speech when he spoke about the £6 million provided in the budget.  He said: &ldquo;The change in the formula for fixing rent, compared with the earlier Bill, will reduce the subsidy demand&rdquo;.  If that is so, how can this Bill improve the rights of the landlord?  This is not what I want or not what the Minister wants, but it is what the court want, because the court say that under the previous Bill, these people were not being adequately compensated or fairly treated.  Without reference to and without changing what the Supreme Court <Col N="511" /> have done, they said these people are not being treated fairly with reference to other people who do not come within the scope of this legislation at all.  The Minister told us that proposed legislation would reduce the amount of rent which the landlords are going to get.  This does not in any way change the reference point outside &mdash; if it did my argument might not be valid &mdash; but will still overcome the constitutional infirmity the first Bill had. It appears a total contradiction that the Minister could say there would be less subsidy required, because his speech will be read as meaning that his view and the view of the Legislature is that the proper interpretation of section 13 is that there should be less money given to landlords than envisaged under the 1981 Bill.</P>
    <P>The 1981 Bill was specifically declared unconstitutional because it took five years to reach the fair market rent and because of the effect it would have on the rights of the landlord in years one, two, three, four and five.  There were other problems with the Bill which the court did not go on to consider.  On page 17 of the judgment it says:</P>
    <P>The effect of the rebates permitted by section 9 is that, for a period of five years after the passing of the Bill, landlords are to receive an amount which will be substantially less than the just and proper rent payable in respect of their property.  In the absence of any constitutionally permitted justification, this clearly constitutes an unjust attack upon their property rights.</P>
    <P>That is justification for what I was saying earlier: that the Supreme Court will not be satisfied with the removal of the permanent nature of the discrimination against landlords and will not be satisfied with what is proposed in this Bill &mdash; that the means of the landlord and tenant should be taken into account &mdash; but clearly spell out here that a system of rebates which reduces even temporarily the amount which the landlord would receive would be unacceptable.  In this legislation before us there is a proposal that the gross rent, that is, the rent which <Col N="512" /> the court will determine will be payable in the absence of agreement:</P>
    <P>shall be the rent which, in the opinion of the Court, would be a just and proper rent having regard to the nature, character and location of the dwelling, the other terms of the tenancy, the means of the landlord and the tenant, the date of purchase of the dwelling by the landlord and the amount paid by him therefor, the length of the tenant's occupancy of the dwelling and the number and ages of the tenant's family residing in the dwelling.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe that a Supreme Court which struck down a Bill on the basis that it was unconstitutional because it allowed a rebate for five years will allow a Bill to be constitutional which takes into account the number and the ages of the tenant's family residing in the dwelling. It is not believable and is not going to happen.  We need a much more fundamental look at the problem, we need to put in the fair market rent and we need to subsidise those tenants who for one reason or another cannot meet that fair market rent; and the sooner we do that the better.  For that reason, the fundamental basis of this Bill is flawed.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of other problems which we can discuss on Committee Stage and to which I will make passing reference now.  The Bill fails to tackle the problem of the overcrowding of the District Court and, in a curious reversal of roles, an amendment by Fianna Fáil in the Seanad on the last occasion this matter was discussed was in favour of a rent tribunal.  The Government at the time, supported by me, felt that the urgency of the matter did not permit that to be passed.  In view of the commitment of the previous Government and the commitment of this Government, obviously I can only believe that work has been proceeding on that matter in the Department of the Environment and that the technical problems which it would be necessary to overcome in a short space of time have been considered in the meantime.  As it was the policy of the last Government to have a rent tribunal, and as it is the policy <Col N="513" /> of this Government to have a rent tribunal, I presume that the consideration of the matter has now reached a stage, and a conclusion, in the Department of the Environment which would enable this matter to be considered quickly.  We should take up the suggestion of our Fianna Fáil colleagues on the last occasion and I will be moving an amendment in the same terms as the amendment which was not carried in the Dáil on the question of the establishment of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I would like to refer on Second Stage is the question that arises with regard to the necessity for the continuation of the type of protection which we are giving to the landlord under the heading of recovery of possession.  It is not necessary to have a continued protection of the landlord in terms of recovery of possession as if he was no longer getting the full market rent or fair rent for the property, because irrespective of the form of legislation when passed, presumably those who pass it will maintain that the rent established thereunder is a fair rent.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I do not see any justification whatsoever for not giving the tenant a permanence until the end of the relevant period, which permanence, of course, would also be subject to matters like the tenant paying the rent which had been agreed and the place not being used for immoral purposes.</P>
    <P>We will move another amendment which will seek to remove from the landlords the power which they would have under this Bill to get possession of the property merely in the interest of good estate management.  In most commercial properties the tenant is protected until the end of his tenancy period at which stage he would be entitled to renewal of a tenancy, but at that stage the landlord could plead good estate management and get possession of the property with adequate compensation.  In the case of a commercial tenancy there is no provision whereby a landlord in the middle of the tenancy can get possession of the property except by agreement with his tenant. I do not see why we should give additional protection to landlords of dwellings <Col N="514" /> over and above the protection which is given to landlords in a commercial enterprise.  If it is necessary, to effect this change, to repeal the appropriate legislation in respect of non-controlled dwellings, then we should take both the former controlled dwellings and the non-controlled dwellings in the same Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, there were very substantial points made in the other House about the whole nature of the approach of this legislation with regard to the problem of assessing the means of the landlord.  It was pointed out correctly that the means of the landlord meant nothing if the property happened to be owned by a limited liability company or a partnership or by any other kind of association.  What would the means of the landlord be and how would those means be taken into account if the property was owned by the Representative Church Body or any other incorporate body of that kind?</P>
    <P>Many of these dwellings have fallen into the ownership of these organisations. Therefore, to talk about taking into account the means of the landlord is taking the judgments of the Supreme Court and extracting from them sufficient to flatter the judges to pass the legislation the next time it goes through, without getting to the essential of the problem. Whether we like it or not, the Supreme Court has found that there cannot be less money paid to a landlord, by reason of the fact that this is a dwelling which was built before 7 May 1941, than is paid to a similar person in a similar house where the house was built after 7 May 1941.  It is a failure to grant that essential point that is the real fallacy in this legislation. This is why we have to sit long hours to consider and improve the legislation, confident in the knowledge that the temporary legislation has already gone through the House.  I anticipate a full examination of the Bill on Second Stage but an even fuller examination of the Bill on Committee Stage and the consideration of many amendments which I and, I assume, other Members will be tabling. Therefore we should reconcile ourselves to the thought that we will be considering this for a long time to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>First, because I may not get another opportunity, I should like to make some complimentary remarks about the Cathaoirleach, who, I regret, has just left the Chamber.  As this may be the last occasion that the Seanad will sit before the election, I should like to place on record the fact that I have always found him most courteous and impartial and I compliment him on the dignified manner in which he carried out his duties. Second, I should like to welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in his job and look forward to great achievements on his part.  He has my special good wishes.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Bill, the Supreme Court recently recognised that a serious and long standing problem exists in the area of rent restriction.  It falls to the Oireachtas to find a solution to this problem, a solution which will recognise that there are and have been serious cases of hardship to tenants and in some cases serious cases of hardship to landlords.  The type of solution required is a solution that will do justice to both parties and protect people in cases where serious hardships would result, whether the people are landlords or tenants.  In order to do this adequately, it seems that the solution proposed in the Bill must take into account a number of things, first that the State protect a tenant in the case of serious hardship by ensuring that he or she cannot be put out on the side of the road because that tenant has been asked to pay a high rent which he or she cannot afford to pay.  This protection should be given by way of subsidy where genuinely required.</P>
      <P>Second, and I would stress the point as much as possible, I would refer to speculators. By speculators I mean those people who recently bought rent-controlled houses in the hope of making large profits from the tenants or from the State. I suggest they be singled out and dealt with in the Act to prevent this happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, cases of genuine hardship to landlords also should be dealt with by way of subsidy where appropriate.  I would appreciate if the Minister would take those points into account.  I believe <Col N="516" /> they are reasonable and serious points and I hope he will honour me by dealing with them in his reply.</P>

      <P>This is the fifth Bill to come before this House to try to resolve the problem which has arisen following the Supreme Court judgment in the case Blake and Madigan against the Attorney General which was handed down in June 1981.  Before dealing in detail with the proposals in this Bill I would like to welcome the Minister of State on his first visit to the Seanad and I would also like to say that I was pleased to have a contribution from the other side of the House from Senator Hanafin because, although it is the fifth Bill, it is also arguably, as Senator O'Leary has said, the most important of them because it is a serious attempt to try to resolve this very serious difficulty.  In view of that, I feel it necessary to do something I have not done in this House since I became a Member in 1969, and that is to draw attention to the fact that there are at the moment three Senators in the House and that we have not had a quorum for most of the afternoon. I therefore draw attention under the Standing Order No. 20, to the fact that the Seanad does not have a quorum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, that is the first time I have ever felt it necessary to draw attention to the very poor attendance in the House.  I have very real sympathy for Senators, who have a lot on their minds including their own electoral prospects, and indeed I hesitated before drawing attention to this.  But I want to <Col N="517" /> emphasise, as indeed was already emphasised by Senator O'Leary, that this is probably one of the most important pieces of legislation this House has had to deal with for a very long time and that it is the fifth Bill that has come before the Seanad in an attempt to resolve the grave crisis for a number of people which has arisen since the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Blake and Madigan case last June.  I feel that, because there is serious concern about the Bill itself and because of the gravity of the social problem and the hardship, anxiety and worry caused to a very vulnerable sector of our community, many of whom are elderly, many of whom are exposed to very serious threat to their home and the security of the little flat they have lived in for perhaps 30 or 40 years, it behoves us, even when we are understandably preoccupied with other matters, to ensure that this Bill gets the attention and consideration which it certainly deserves to have.</P>
      <P>When we were considering the other Bill this afternoon, the Rent Restrictions (Temporary Provisions) (Continuance) Bill, 1982, I referred at some length to the reason we had the problem and in particular to the approach and judgment of the Supreme Court in the Blake and Madigan case, because that is an essential background to understanding what the problem is and understanding the way in which we are constrained as a Legislature in seeking to approach the problem.  I do not propose to put again on the record of the House the extracts from the judgments of the Supreme Court or my own views, such as they are, on the approach adopted and the constraints which it imposes on us.</P>
      <P>But we have to take stock of the situation and to realise that we face a very difficult problem.  Although it is in many ways a technical, constitutional and legal problem, it is one which we have to address ourselves to and therefore which we must discuss in sufficient detail to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were a member of the Judiciary, which I am not and not likely to be, I would say in relation to a great deal of what Senator O'Leary has already said that I concur to a considerable extent <Col N="518" /> with his approach and with his analysis both of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case referred under Article 26 and also in his approach and attitude towards this present Bill.  But in the best judicial tradition, having concurred, I then shall go on to give my own approach to the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand what the problems were with the predecessor to this Bill, the predecessor being the Bill introduced before Christmas, to deal in a longer term way with the problem caused by the finding by the Supreme Court that the previous legislation on the control of rents, and indeed in relation to the restriction on recovery of possession by landlords, was unconstitutional.  It is sufficient to refer to the approach adopted by the Supreme Court and the criteria set out there.  I may, to a very small extent, overlap with Senator O'Leary in this, but I think it is probably worth repeating, because what we are doing is clarifying the framework, the limits we have to operate within, and the pitfalls which we must avoid if we are to ensure that we do not pass through these Houses legislation which is ultimately, either by reference or by a challenge in the courts, ruled to be unconstitutional, with the further anxiety and fears that that would impose on so many people affected.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the portion of the judgment of the Supreme Court delivered on 19 February in relation to the Bill referred to it on 24 December by the President for an opinion as to its constitutionality.  The first point I would make is that the court have analysed the broad scheme of that Bill.  We had an opportunity of discussing it in this House and it is not necessary to go into it again. Most Senators recall the approach that was adopted in that Bill.  At the bottom of page 13 of the Supreme Court judgment the Chief Justice says:</P>
    <P>This being the broad scheme of the Bill, it is clear that it varies pre-existing rights (where such exist) of both the tenant and the landlord in respect of controlled dwellings.  It has been urged on the Court that in some respects this <Col N="519" /> interference, under the guise of control, amounts to an unjust attack on the property rights of both tenants and landlords.  However, the Court notes that the major criticism of the Bill's provisions is directed at those which determine the rent that is to be paid by the particular tenant and accepted by the landlord in respect of each dwelling.</P>
    <P>The Court now proposes to examine those particular provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to that passage because the Supreme Court left open a number of the issues that Senator O'Leary had identified. We are still talking about a particular class of landlord and a particular class of tenant.  We are making provision in relation to a particular class of landlord on two fronts, firstly in relation to the rent and, second, in relation to the recovery of possession.  The Supreme Court, in a very unusual way, left their view open on some of these issues.  The section allowing for phased raising of the rent to the fair market rent over potentially a period of five years, on which the debate focused when the Bill was going through the Dáil and the Seanad, was the section that the Supreme Court in their judgment examined and subsequently ruled was unconstitutional. We must bear in mind that there is a possibility in relation to the provision for recovery of possession, for example, that the measure is not entirely free from potential constitutional defect.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to the deeper issues which I raised and which some other Senators, notably Senator Murphy, raised in relation to the first Bill.  We still have not pondered sufficiently on the overall problem of the constraints placed on us as a legislature by the interpretation of the Constitution.  It is a legislative and tactical mistake by the Government to seek to deal with the problem in the narrow context of this class of landlords and class of tenants because that has very substantially narrowed the possibilities. It has exacerbated the potential legal problems and the problems of constitutional infirmity.  It opens up the whole dimension of invidious discrimination <Col N="520" /> against a particular class of landlords or invidious treatment of a particular class of tenants.  It would have been much better from a legislative point of view and from the point of view of the approach to the adopted by the Oireachtas, to have broadened the scope of this legislation and made it a general basis for rent control. As legislators we are not only in favour of but would see the necessity for proper controls over the rent and conditions of private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>I have already submitted some amendments as to the proper forum to decide on rent controls.  I believe this is better regulated by a tribunal establised for that purpose which would be a forum to which both landlords and tenants could go in a much more relaxed, confident and equal way.  It would not have the intimidating attributes which many people find a court has, even a District Court.  It would not have the problem of potential delay or overloading which the District Court has even with the provision the Minister has indicated of appointing new district justices and having them sit somewhere &mdash; it is not quite clear where &mdash; to hear claims under this Bill.</P>
    <P>My first general comment on this legislation is that we must be acutely aware of the constitutional and legal constraints. This is the fifth measure which has come before this House trying to resolve the problem.  Having analysed those constraints, they would be less of a problem and less inhibiting if this measure had dealt with a broader range, in other words, had dealt with rents in the private sector and had not sought to identify what Senator O'Leary has clearly analysed as a totally arbirtary and artificial class, a class deriving from the date of construction of buildings and other dates when rent was fixed, arbirtary and implacable dates and not related to broader and social conditions.  To some extent, an opportunity has been lost for the Legislature, even within the constitutional and legal constraints, to put forward proposals which take into account our perceptions of social justice and our concern to strike a balance and have equity in this situation.  Not only have we been inhibited from the point of view of <Col N="521" /> the Legislature carrying through a policy in an important area, but because of the approach adopted by the Government, this Bill is left much more open to the possibility of constitutional challenge or to the possibility that if it is referred to the Supreme Court it will be found to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>In order to explain my concern that the Bill may suffer from constitutional infirmity, it is necessary to refer to another passage of the court's judgment on the referral to it of the predecessor to this Bill, the judgment given on 19 February last.  In the judgment the court referred to the way which was devised for basically fixing rents at a fair market rent taking into account the improvements and so in that assessment and then allowing the five-year phase period, where warranted, in which the tenant would gradually have to pay increasing amounts up to the fair market rent as determined. On the question of the way in which the rents were fixed, and this is really the nub of the Supreme Court's judgment, the Chief Justice stated on behalf of the court:</P>
    <P>Having carefully considered the submissions of counsel on both sides of the case, the court is of opinion that the intent of the Bill is that the gross rent to be determined by the District Court under section 6, in accordance with the criteria therein set out, is to be regarded as the just and proper rent. The effect of the rebates permitted by section 9 is that for a period of five years after the passing of the Bill, landlords are to receive an amount which will be substantially less than the just and proper rent payable in respect of their property.  In the absence of any constitutionally permitted justification, this clearly constitutes an unjust attack upon their property rights.  The Bill offers no such justification for depriving the landlord of part of his or part of her just rent for the period specified in the Bill.  This court has already held that the pre-existing rent control constituted an unjust attack upon property rights.  In such circumstances, to impose different but no less <Col N="522" /> unjust deprivations upon landlords cannot but be unjust having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.  The court has, accordingly, come to the conclusion that the provisions of section 9 in the referred Bill would constitute an unjust attack on the property rights of landlords of controlled dwellings and would accordingly be in contravention of the provision of Article 40.3.2 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>That was in a situation where the model was that the first step would be to fix the fair market rent.  The second step would be to allow a phasing in under section 9 of that Bill where the tenant could not be expected to pay the full market rent.  When that Bill was debated in the House, some of us were unhappy with that very limited protection to tenants. We would like to have gone further. However, that was the model and we call it model A &mdash; fix your fair market rent and allow a period for it to be phased in &mdash; declared unconstitutional because it is an unjust attack on the property rights of landlords.  It is an unjust attack in the context that it is only a special identified class of landlords who do not get their fair market rent.  This is essential to an understanding of the Supreme Court's approach and was an aspect of it properly highlighted by Senator O'Leary.</P>
    <P>Now we turn to model B which is the model before us in this Bill.  Model B fudges the issue but does not fudge it sufficiently to make it comfortably constitutional. It fudges the issue because it proposes to allow the District Court to determine what the rent will be.  Section 13 provides that the District Court will fix the rent.  Section 13 (2) says that for the purpose of subsection (1) the gross rent shall be the rent which, in the opinion of the court, would be a just and proper rent having regard to the nature, character and location of the dwelling, the other terms of the tenancy, the means of the landlord and the tenant, the date of purchase of the dwelling by the landlord and the amount paid by the landlord therefor, the length of the tenant's occupancy of the dwelling and the number <Col N="523" /> and ages of the tenant's family residing in the dwelling.</P>
    <P>These appear to be very reasonable criteria for any court to take into account in fixing rent, but they are not general criteria, nor are they very clear.  They apply only to this identified, specific class of landlords.  These are the only landlords whose means are taken into account in fixing the rent.  These are the only landlords whose rents will be fixed by the District Court not in accordance with fair market rent.  It is not clear how the district justices will approach this problem. I have great admiration for the ingenuity of district justices but I do not envy them when they have a particular problem.  As Senator O'Leary said, how will they assess the means of a landlord when the landlord is a limited liability company or is an absentee landlord in some other country?  What will be the basis of it? When they do it, what will be the basis for the rent that they fix?  Whatever one may say of it, it would appear to be a rent open to exactly the same conclusion if brought before the Supreme Court as the Supreme Court have already reached on model A where a fair market rent was fixed but the landlord did not get it over a phased period because the rebate system was provided under section 9 of the previous Bill.  Here the landlord does not get the fair market rent either, because a district justice is fixing a fair rent in accordance with other criteria.</P>
    <P>If we were talking about an overall social measure reflecting a legislative approach to the return a landlord should get for his private property we would be on surer ground and more secure because we would, as a Legislature, be taking a decision on the overall approach.  We still would need to be much more precise and specific on the guidelines and how they were to be assessed, but the approach would be more secure.  However, we are still carrying over this arbitrary classification, this identifiable number of both landlords and tenants who are involved. We are talking about former rent controlled tenants and the landlords of the properties concerned and we are saying in relation to them that a new and different <Col N="524" /> mechanism for fixing the rents will apply, but it will not be a fair market rent.</P>
    <P>To refer to an important aspect mentioned by Senator O'Leary, it will not, apparently, be as beneficial to the landlord as was the legislation of the Coalition Government which has been declared to be unconstitutional.  The Minister when introducing this Bill made it clear that the money allocated would be £6 million.  I will quote what he said:</P>
    <P>A provision of £6 million was provided in the recent budget.  This was the same amount as in the January budget and questions as to its adequacy were raised in the Dáil.  The change in the formula for fixing rent, compared with the earlier Bill will reduce the subsidy demand and any saving can be set off against the extra cost arising from the omission of the earlier arrangements to phase in rent increases.  In any event, I would like to assure Senators that the Government will provide whatever funds are needed to finance the allowances schemes.</P>
    <P>The Government have given a commitment that they will be prepared to provide further moneys if these are needed.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the assessment &mdash; which presumably has been costed with considerable expertise, both in the Minister's Department and the Department of Finance who are in position to view and assess and conclude on these figures &mdash; is that less Government subsidy will be applied to the rent which tenants will have to pay under this Bill than the Coaliton Government committed themselves to through the phased-in mechanism. How reassuring is that to the very vulnerable tenants who have been at such an unjustifiable risk and who are still not secure in their tenancies?  How are they to view the situation that the mechanism for fixing rent is much less favourable to them in the sense that less payment will be required from the Government to the landlord?  If that is the case, who is to bear it?  Will it be the tenants?  Is part of the job of the district justice in fixing the rent that, in so far as he can have regard to the means of the landlord and the <Col N="525" /> means of the tenant, that will not be very significant?  Basically what he is fixing must approximate to or be somewhere near a fair market rent.  What is the situation? I accept that we will tease this out, and we will have to do that at some length on Committee Stage when we come to section 13, but I repeat my questions on it and perhaps the Minister will give some indication when he replies on Second Stage.  What exactly would be meant by a just and proper rent, having regard to the issues set out, in particular the means of the landlord and the tenant? Can the Minister give some specific examples when replying on this point? Perhaps he can take examples of fictional tenants in different kinds of former rent-controlled dwellings who have being paying rents.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to know whether we are talking about the district justice looking at a rent which at the moment is £2 and on the basis of all these criteria putting it up to £4 but the landlord saying, &ldquo;That is not good enough because if that was under the old system, that of establishing a fair market rent, I would be getting £40.&rdquo;  If this system results in a rent being fixed at £4 because of my inability to pay any more than that, if I can pay only £1 extra and the Government come in and pay a subsidy of £1 under the section as a social welfare allowance, a topping-up so to speak, then the landlord could say that that is unconstitutional and there is no doubt about it because he is not getting anything like the increase he should get.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, take the case of the tenant paying £2 but the District Court says that in the light of all these criteria the proper rent would be £10.  The landlord may say &ldquo;If I am going on the fair market rent in the sense of demand for this property, I can produce evidence to the District Court that I have at least a couple of other tenants, people working in banking and insurance who can be grouped together and who are anxious to have a centre-city flat like this and they are offering me £60&rdquo;.  In such a case will the Government bridge the difference between £10 and £60?  If so, and if this is done in relation to 30,000 or 40,000 <Col N="526" /> rent-controlled tenants, surely we are talking about a good deal more than the allocation that is being made.  In other words, it is very hard to envisage how this system will work.  It is very hard to envisage how the Minister had concluded that a smaller allocation of money is needed to subsidise it than was needed in relation to the Coalition provision.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we must have an opportunity to get examples from the Minister to illustrate what he envisages the District Court will do.  It will not be enough to say that that is a matter for the District Court.  It is not a matter for the District Court.  It is a matter on which we must be very clear.  We must be clear about the job we are asking the district justices to do and we must be clear about the guidelines that we will propose for the district justices in doing their job.</P>
    <P>We come back to the problem that a limited class of landlords are still having their rents fixed by a system that does not apply to other landlords and they are not getting their full rent, and a limited class of landlords are still having their right of recovery limited substantially in comparison to other landlords in the private rented sector.  We are not doing what very badly needs to be done, which is providing an overall regulation and control of rented accommodation in the private sector, including the proper establishment of a fair rents tribunal to carry out the necessary balancing in that area. We seem to be making the legislation much more prone to attack by continuing to legislate on the basis of a limited class.</P>
    <P>It is possible that the Minister may refer to the problem of time and the difficulty of having more far-reaching and broadly based legislation within the time constraints.  As I said in relation to the other measure earlier this afternoon, that really is not an acceptable answer.  I am not making party political points on that. The issue has been known to us as politicians and to the experts in the Attorney General's office and in the relevant Departments since June 1981.  The serious responsibility has been ours since then and we have not measured up to it very well.  The kindest word I can apply to the manner of fixing rents in this Bill <Col N="527" /> is that it fudges but does not get over the constitutional and legal difficulty.  That is something we will obviously have to come back to.</P>
    <P>The predecessor to this Bill when it was being debated in this House also received a good deal of criticism from both sides of the House, particularly because it did not provide for a fair rents tribunal.  I recall vividly that the then Leader of the Opposition in the House, Senator Eoin Ryan, called a vote specifically on that issue of the need for a fair rents tribunal.  That was in December and now here we are in April of 1982 with this Bill.  No doubt the Minister will say, as he did in his Second Stage speech, that there was not time to do it.  I would submit that we have a Bill before us and now is the time to do it.  We all too often are appeased by and accept ministerial promises, but the record does not justify this, because ministerial promises tend to go very rapidly on the never-never.  They do not tend to be promises that are delivered. Senator Eoin Ryan obviously thought so when he called a vote seeking to have a fair rents tribunal introduced into the predecessor.  Now we have a new Bill and a new opportunity before this House to introduce the proper method to adjudicate on and balance the interests as between landlords and tenants.</P>
    <P>A tribunal develops a kind of expertise and learning experience when it is dealing with a specific problem in a specific area and a specific issue.  An extremely important aspect is that it is a body which is much more accessible and much less intimidating to the tenants concerned, who are the vulnerable sector that we must, even at this late stage, seek to contrive to protect.</P>
    <P>These are the major points that I feel it necessary to make on this Bill on Second Stage.  It is quite a detailed Bill and I would ask that we have an opportunity for a separate Committee Stage.  I am aware of time pressures and other constraints, but the text of this Bill as passed by the Dáil has only very recently been available to us.  I know there are a number of amendments down and it would be appropriate to have a separate Committee <Col N="528" /> Stage.  I have no particular view on the date.  I am aware that Senators, particularly in these few days, have on their minds a number of other crucial issues relating to their election and it might be that next week would be appropriate.  If we are going to do the job properly on Committee Stage then it will take at least half a day &mdash; meaning the normal sitting time of the Seanad.  To try to do it in less time would mean that we would not fulfil our responsibility.  It is a responsibility which must lie heavily on us since this is our fifth attempt and since we make this attempt in the knowledge that the Bill passed this afternoon is, to say the least, of doubtful constitutionality.  We must get this one right if we can and we must spend enough time on it to make sure that we do.  We must have time, therefore, to debate in detail the issues which arise.  I hope that provision will be made for a separate Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak briefly in support of what Senators Robinson and O'Leary have already said. There seem to be two points of some importance emerging.  I feel the Minister would be doing a service to the country, to the administration, to the civil service who will have to deal with the consequences of this, and not least to himself, if he were to give some consideration to the request for a separate Committee Stage on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points that have stood out very much in the course of this discussion. The first is the question of the fair rents tribunal.  I do not intend to speak at length upon that since it has already been dealt with very eloquently by previous speakers.  There is a very strong case for having a specialised body dealing with a matter of this kind.  The point has already been made that we as public representatives are familiar with the frightening labyrinth of landlord and tenant legislation.  It is clear from this debate that there does not yet exist one single Act or piece of legislation that governs these matters.  It is a very complex matter.  It requires a specialised body and to throw these matters into the District Court, which is failing to cope with <Col N="529" /> the growing problem of law and order, crime on the streets and other matters as well, is to impose far too great a burden on the District Court and also to run the risk that the urgent matters dealt with by this legislation would not be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>The second point is in regard to the constitutionality.  I must defer here to the superior knowledge, expertise and wisdom of my colleagues in the legal profession. Even to an uninstructed layman like myself a picture emerges of a piece of legislation which is discriminating between one set of citizens and another, indeed between two separate sets of citizens and the remainder of society.  Again I defer to the wisdom of the legal profession, but, even on a common sense basis, it seems to me that we are moving into an area where somebody could at the very least challenge this legislation and say that in discriminating in this way it interferes with the rights of people not covered by this legislation.  Consequently I am beginning to fear that this is not the last that we will hear either of this legislation or of legislation that will take its place when and if this legislation is challenged. It seems that there are elements in this legislation which are &ldquo;dubious&rdquo;, to use Senator Robinson's word.  Consequently I believe that the Minister would be doing a service to all of us, to those of us in this House and those outside the House if he were to accede to the suggestion that a prolonged period be given to consideration of Committee Stage of this Bill so that we could co-operate in producing legislation which would be of real benefit and which would produce a substantial improvement in the current situation.  I fear that if we attempt to rush this through we will be creating further trouble for ourselves, for this House and for Houses which succeed this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make good my omission when speaking earlier in that I forgot to pay the usual courtesies to the Minister.  I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well.  I believe he is bringing this Bill into the House with very good intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> I take up the last point made by Senator Maurice O'Connell.  Perhaps the reason we are now considering this kind of measure for the fourth or fifth time is that it tends to be hastened through, because it is not given sufficient legislative attention. The increasing tendency for the courts to do the business of the country, to take on an excessively reviewing function in our Constitution and in our laws is because the Legislature does not give due and leisurely consideration to its business, and in this case at least is under pressure to meet a particular deadline, as in the Social Welfare Bill a week ago.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I wish it well. In terms of social justice it tilts the balance in favour of the tenant compared with the previous Bill but for that reason its constitutionality is all the more doubtful. I note that among the bodies which welcome the Bill are the Private Tenants' Action Group and the organisation which is called Threshold.  My clear recollection is that when we were discussing a similar measure last July one of the most critical bodies was Threshold.  It is of interest that on this occasion, according to a letter in today's <i>Irish Times,</i> this national voluntary housing advisory service, which is how they define themselves, welcome the Bill and point specifically to four or five favourable features of the measure which they see as very much in the tenants' interest.</P>
    <P>It is true that they argue strongly for the establishment of a private rented appeals board and propose to issue a publication on this in the near future but their support for the Bill is noteworthy. So is that of the Private Tenants' Action Group who want a fair rents tribunal. They would like to see Article 45 brought within the cognisance of the courts but on the whole they give at least qualified backing for the Bill.</P>
    <P>If two organisations who sponsor the tenant interest see this Bill as an improvement on the previous Bill, then it augurs constitutional trouble because the Supreme Court were concerned on the last occasion that the rights of the landlords were being infringed.  If these tenant organisations see a considerable improvement in the present Bill then <Col N="531" /> automatically it would mean that the courts would have <i>a priori</i> grounds for seeing the landlord's rights threatened all the more.  It seems to me that section 13 of the present Bill is at least as threatening or intrusive on the landlord's property rights as section 9 in the previous Bill.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Leary, Senator Robinson in her lengthy contribution, and other Senators made clear, the major substantive point of unconstitutionality would appear to hinge on the entirely spurious distinction between one set of landlords and another and between one set of tenants and another.  Either all property relations must receive the same rigorous investigation, as is envisaged in section 13 of the Bill, or no property relations should be so considered.  All tenants have rights to the classic three F's of the rural agitation of 100 years ago &mdash; fixity of tenure, free sale or recognition of compensation for improvements, and fair rent.  Either all tenants must have these rights or no tenant has these rights. Either all landlords must be accountable or no landlord is accountable.  My colleagues have pointed out the nub of the question here.  I wish the Bill well but I doubt we are free of the dilemma.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the approach of the Minister in his introductory statement.  In his speech he stated:</P>
    <P>The job of the Oireachtas in these circumstances is to enact legislation which is in conformity with the Constitution and its interpretation by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>With great respect, but with great conviction, I submit that the job of the Oireachtas in these circumstances is increasingly to consider whether the Constitution is adequate for our view of social relations and for the implementation of social justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, and I take him to be quite sincere in this, that he wants to establish a &ldquo;proper and constitutional balance between the rights of property and social justice&rdquo;.  I doubt whether this is a real balance.  What I mean is that property is always loaded against social justice.  The fact that a man has property <Col N="532" /> means that he is powerful and, therefore, he has great odds on the man or woman who has no property.  The notion of a just balance between property and tenant rights is in itself vitiated by the fact that property is power.</P>
    <P>In the Constitution, property in its 1930s conceptualism was not meant to be an unlimited right to property and the rights of property.  What the framer of the Constitution intended was that every man and every woman should have a little piece of property.  In this sense the way in which the courts stand over property as the absolute rights of ownership of land, whether they be ground landlords, speculators or landlords of tenancies, is not in accordance with the original concept of property in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Constitution gives all the privileges to property and it puts the common good and social justice in a secondary place.  There is no mandatory power backing the common good or social justice. It is very much a pious aspiration. When the Minister says he wants to establish a balance between the rights of property and the common good, he is not going to succeed for the simple reason that the Constitution itself does not do this.  It is high time it did.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to join in welcoming the Minister here today.  I wish him well in his period of office.  This Seanad will probably not see him very much again, but we hope he will be successful in his period of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill raises a number of very difficult questions which have been very difficult for this Government and indeed the previous Government to solve.  I appreciate that the Minister is doing his best in bringing this Bill before the House to try to solve these problems.  There may be individual difficulties which have been pointed out by various other Senators, but I accept that he is trying to deal with the situation which is a kind of child of history, as it were, in this country.  The whole idea of the balance between both private property and the common good, and the balance between the rights of landlords and rights of tenants, raise a <Col N="533" /> number of very difficult questions to be solved.</P>
    <P>First, I will deal with the question Senator Murphy dealt with towards the end of his speech, that is, the possibility of whether it would be necessary to change the Constitution to deal with this point. This was also mentioned by a number of Deputies in the Dáil debate.  This is a very real problem because, when we think in terms of the common good and private property, we realise that when the Constitution was set up private property was envisaged in terms of the person who owned his individual family home or the small farmer who owned a small amount of land.  It was not framed in terms of the large-scale property developer who is enabled to enrich himself by £8 million simple by holding on to a piece of land for a number of years and then passing it on to somebody else without contributing one single bit of work or input of any description to the common good.</P>
    <P>We will probably have to look at the constitutional position, but it is not as easy as it might seem.  It is easy to say that we should put the common good first and forget about the good of these particular cowboys; but on the other hand, how does one frame an amendment to the Constitution on these lines which will not also open the dangers of an attack on the small property of the small person? In a nation where we have a remarkably high level of personal home ownership, there would be a considerable amount of worry among many people about a constitutional change which would perhaps leave it open to some Government in the future to attack their rights.  They feel very strongly about this.  What we need is to try to find some kind of formula which will do away with the undoubted exploitation which exists at the present time, the undoubted destruction of the environment in the city of Dublin by these very people, their undoubted unjust self-enrichment, but a formula which at the same time will not threaten the ordinary person in the small property he owns.  While private property is not, and should not be, an unlimited right, we need to be very careful about how we <Col N="534" /> define the powers of the Government of the day in relation to the common good, because we cannot always rely on having a Government which will deal with these things in a sensible manner.</P>
    <P>With regard to the actual issue of control of rents and the rights and wrongs of it, whether it was right or wrong to start with, it is undoubtedly true that, as it has operated over the long number of years, since the beginning of the First World War, it has created a situation which is very difficult to deal with.  It has created this body of vulnerable tenants &mdash; very often elderly people or less well-off people who have lived in rent controlled dwellings for a considerable number of years and who would be totally unable to pay a truly economic rent for their housing.</P>
    <P>We ought also to remember that it has created a certain body of poor landlords. I, too, have had letters from elderly and less well-off widows who happen to own houses in which there are rent-controlled tenants who are probably well able to pay a great deal more than they are paying. It is not only the body of tenants who are vulnerable; there are also some landlords who are highly vulnerable.  They may have had quite a good private income from renting at one stage, but because of the fall in the value of money it has now dwindled to an absolutely derisory level. These are the people who are likely sufferers from the rent control situation.</P>
    <P>There are also exploiters on both sides. There is the property developer, the kind of person who will buy a property that has rent-controlled tenants in it, and persecute them and make their lives a misery in order to get rid of them so that he can sell the site for development at an enormous profit &mdash; what used to be called Rachmanism in the British situation.  Let us be quite sure about it.  This happens. People are terrorised, they have undesirable people camped on their doorsteps and so on.  On the other side, there are also tenants living in this kind of property who are well able to look after themselves and who should be encouraged to pay an economic rent or to purchase a house to live in themselves.</P>
    <P>Part of the historic difficulty is that we <Col N="535" /> have really used rent control and the whole idea of rent-controlled dwellings to house people who should actually have been housed by the local authority.  We have used this system to provide cheap dwellings for people who really qualify to be housed as a public responsibility.  Now we have inherited this problem and we are having very grave difficulties in dealing with it.  Against this background of inherited difficulties there is the Supreme Court judgments, both on the original rent control and on the Bill passed by the previous Government, and we have this Government's and the previous Government's efforts to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>In general terms I welcome this Bill.  I think the Minister is making a very genuine effort to deal with the matter in terms of balancing a fair rent and social justice.  There are areas, as other Senators have mentioned, which may well be unconstitutional yet again, as in section 13.  On the whole, however, the aim of trying to meet the needs of protecting the tenants, while at the same time allowing a fair rent to landlords, is reasonably well carried out.  There is also the problem particularly in urban areas, of the need for a stock of reasonably-priced housing which can be rented by people.  As I said, we have a remarkably high level of home ownership &mdash; much higher than in most other EEC countries, for instance. Nevertheless, there is a need for reasonably-priced rented accommodation, particularly for young married couples, elderly people living alone and so on, who do not want to own a whole house for themselves.  Therefore, whatever we do, we do not want to create a situation where this kind of accommodation will cease to exist.</P>
    <P>I agree with various people, both in the Dáil and here, who suggested that a fair rents tribunal would be a much better way of dealing with this situation than putting the matter into the District Court. I know the Minister has said he will bring this in as soon as possible, but he has also said it is a fairly complex matter and may take some time.  I feel very strongly that fair rent tribunals would be a much better way of dealing with this situation.  They <Col N="536" /> would not only be more accessible to the tenants but also more accessible to the less well-off landlords.  I know two District Courts are to be set up in the Dublin area which would deal specially with this, but the matter will arise in many other areas in the country and the District Courts' lists are already over-burdened and matters have to be dealt with fairly speedily.  I do not feel that the District Courts are really suitable forums for dealing with this.  Having voted with Senator Eoin Ryan in the last vote when he called for the introduction of fair rents tribunals in this situation, I would like to see the fair rents tribunal brought in now as opposed to a future time.  However, on the general lines of the Bill as it comes in I would be pleased to support it and I only hope that it will not create any more constitutional difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank those Senators who have spoken in this debate and I thank those who have expressed their good wishes to myself and to the Minister of State at my Department who was here earlier.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House strives to deal with a difficult and complex problem, as, I think, all Senators will agree. If something on the lines of the Private Rented Dwellings Bill is not enacted the families in about 30,000 dwellings &mdash; that is the figure which has been prepared by the Private Tenants Action Group &mdash; will be faced with great uncertainty as to the future possession of the dwellings they have for so long occupied.  The Government are determined that measures must be taken to avoid the social disruption that would follow.  In the legislation we need to achieve a balance which in line with the common good gives reasonable protection to tenants and allows landlords a just and proper return from their dwellings.  As well as protecting tenants the provisions in the Bill will redress the injustice landlords have endured over a lengthy period.  It was that injustice which led to the Supreme Court's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As with the previous Bill, most serious questions have been raised by Senators regarding the constitutionality of the Bill <Col N="537" /> and this, indeed, has been of major concern to the Government.  The Government must legislate within the Constitution and we do not help anybody, least of all the tenants, by producing legislation which has a high probability of being unconstitutional.  The advice available to the Government is that the Bill is in conformity with the Constitution.  The Bill has been prepared bearing in mind the criticism of the Supreme Court, of particular aspects of the former code and the terms of the court's judgment and the reference to it of the 1981 Act and I firmly believe that it will stand up to the constitutional test.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary suggested that the essence of the Supreme Court judgment was that the dwellings concerned were arbitrarily chosen in the Rent Restrictions Act while the arbitrary nature of the control was a matter that was raised in the Supreme Court judgment.  The February judgment made it clear that it was possible to legislate to deal with those dwellings, the dwellings that are controlled under the 1960 Act.</P>
    <P>I quote from the Supreme Court Reference given by Chief Justice O'Higgins and which is to be found at page 10 of the judgment of the court:</P>
    <P>The Attorney General has submitted that the basis for the selection of the same category of dwellings to be covered by this Bill derives from this Court's judgment in the Blake and Madigan case and that the necessary rectifying legislation need not go beyond that category.  The Court notes this submission and is prepared to accept that it supplies a valid reason for the application of this Bill to the category of rented dwellings and not to others.</P>
    <P>I think that covers the point raised both by Senator O'Leary and by Senator Robinson.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary expressed some optimism that the temporary Bill would be constitutional and quoted certain comments at the end of the Blake and Madigan case in support of his view.  We discussed this at great length earlier on when we were discussing the previous Bill and <Col N="538" /> I do not think that we can place undue reliance on what the court said to support the extension of the temporary legislation much longer.  This temporary legislation has now been running since July of last year and flying in the face of a Supreme Court decision.  I really do not think that the tenants will thank either the Dáil or the Seanad or any public representative involved for leaving them unprotected. What we really need is this Bill that we are debating now.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin spoke of the necessity for the State to come to the assistance of tenants who would have problems meeting their increased rents and the need to ensure that speculators do not benefit from court decisions.  It is natural that there should be concern as to how poorer tenants are to be helped with their rent payments.  As I said in opening, I am not in a position to spell out the details of the allowance scheme provided for in the Bill but the Minister for Social Welfare who will administer the scheme will announce the details shortly.</P>
    <P>In the normal course of events it would be usual for such subsidisation to be provided for in legislation sponsored by the Minister for Social Welfare.  However, time constraints prevented us doing this in the present case.  Even though the Government are less than one month in office we have succeeded in including a power to pay subsidy in the Bill, something that we had not got in the former Bill, though when the last Government had the 1981 Bill in the House they had been six months in office.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hanafin that it is undesirable that speculators should profit unduly from their purchases of controlled dwellings.  This point was made by Senator McGuinness also.  The criteria in section 13 go some way towards restraining speculative gains.  It should be remembered that the changes in capital gains tax made in the recent budget will also help considerably in this regard.</P>
    <P>A number of the Senators once again on this debate mentioned the need for rent tribunals.  I want to reiterate here that we as a Government are totally committed to the setting up of rent tribunals. This was a commitment given in the Dáil <Col N="539" /> by myself in December when we discussed the 1981 Act brought in by the Coalition.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil last Thursday the Taoiseach confirmed that we will be having discussions immediately after Easter with the main parties, either at party leader level, at Whip level or at Minister for the Environment and Spokesman on the Environment level with a view to introducing legislation in the next session of the Dáil.  I accept the concern of Senator Robinson, of Senator McGuinness and of others about that type of ministerial promise.  I hope Senators will accept that it is not an empty promise, not a political promise, but a firm commitment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We will hold you for another 11 in another number of years time.  I give this firm commitment to the House, that the discussions will take place between the parties at whatever level is considered appropriate, immediately after the Easter recess and that the legislation will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred earlier to the constitutional and legal problems involved in tribunals. It is not a simple matter just to set up a tribunal or to accept some of the formulae that have been presented in amendments that were tabled in the Dáil which were a direct &ldquo;cog&rdquo; from the employment unfair dismissals tribunal.  The situation is that what has to be decided &mdash; and it is only right and proper that it should be decided by an all-party discussion &mdash; is whether rents tribunals are to deal with <Col N="540" /> only the rents question or whether they should involve themselves in other aspects of the whole relationship between landlord and tenant.  The constitutional difficulties and the legal difficulties arise if you extend the terms of reference of the tribunal into other matters of relationship between landlord and tenant.</P>
    <P>On the face of it there should be no legal or constitutional difficulties if we relate it only to rents.  These are the sort of matters that have to be discussed between the parties and, on an issue of such importance, it is right to get an all-party view of it.  I can give this categorical assurance to Senators here this evening that, in the next session of the Dáil, prior to the summer recess, the legislation to set up these tribunals will be introduced. The discussions will commence immediately after Easter.</P>
    <P>I accept fully the deficiencies of the District Court, the intimidatory nature of the courts as suggested by myself in December when I discussed this in the Dáil.  They have been voiced again by Deputies and Senators.  I want to have an interim measure to remove this sense of intimidation from many controlled tenants, people who never had any dealings with the courts, or many controlled landlords, or people such as those mentioned by Senator McGuinness, widows who have inherited property and who now find themselves with tenants who are better off than they are themselves.  They will have to go before the courts.  We anticipate that the greatest difficulty will arise in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I want to admit to the Seanad that we do not know exactly how many tenants are involved.  The registers which will be available from local authorities will show how many people are involved.  Nobody knows the exact number of people involved.  The number which has been used on all occasions is the number that was first used by the Private Tenants' Action Group, about 30,000.  We anticipate that because of the nature of the city most of the problems will be in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>I have given a firm commitment to the Dáil.  I gave it to Senators in my opening speech and I give it to them again now. <Col N="541" /> Pending the setting up of the tribunal we will be appointing two temporary District Court justices.  They will not sit in the Four Courts building but in the old Dolphin Hotel.  This is the building we have in mind at this stage and the Minister for Justice is co-operating very well with us. It is intended that the court will have as informal an atmosphere as possible to remove any sense of intimidation which might arise for tenants or landlords who are getting on in years and who were never before in contact with the courts of the land.</P>
    <P>I labour this point with regard to the tribunal because I know that it is a matter of deep concern to many Senators.  I appeal to the Seanad and to the Senators generally to allow this Bill in its present form to go through the Seanad.  I give a firm commitment that the legislation dealing with the tribunal will be brought before the next Seanad &mdash; and I can go no further at this stage.</P>
    <P>Much comment was made on the operation of section 13 of the Bill which sets out the criteria by reference to which a rent is to be fixed.  It was contended that the rent set, if it is to be in accordance with the Supreme Court judgment, must be a market rent.  I do not agree that this necessarily follows from the Supreme Court's judgment.  The judgment held that the rent must be the just and proper rent, but what was unconstitutional was the provision which phased in the just and proper rent over a number of years and made the landlord wait some years for the full rent.  A reasonable interpretation is, I believe, that there remains some discretion as to what constitutes a just and proper rent.  This interpretation is supported, I might add, by the comment by the Supreme Court in its earlier judgment in the Blake-Madigan case, that part of the reason why the 1960 Act was an unjust attack on property rights was that the Act did not take account of the means of the landlord and tenant. This, of course, is a particular feature of the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary and Senator Robinson referred to my earlier comment that less subsidy could be required under the formula in section 13 than in the earlier <Col N="542" /> Bill.  They argued that this means that the section must be unconstitutional because the landlords will get lower rents.  The criteria do not preclude an individual landlord from obtaining a market rent if the respective means and other circumstances warrant it.  It is a matter of fact that the majority of tenants are poorly off and it is for this reason, and not because of the criteria themselves, that over all a lower level of rents will be determined by the court.  If the relative financial circumstances of the landlord and tenant were reversed, the section would not prevent landlords obtaining full market rent, and this is the justification for the section.</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly this Bill attracted a good deal of comment not only in the Oireachtas but also in the media and elsewhere.  It was referred to by Senator Murphy in the letter pages of of the newspapers. Representatives of landlords have attacked the Bill on the grounds of the restraints it imposes on them.  Spokesmen on the tenants' side &mdash; while welcoming the Bill in the main &mdash; have taken issue with certain aspects of the Bill which were not to their liking.  The approach of the Bill is neither pro-landlord nor protenant. It attempts to strike a balance which takes account of the constitutional advice available to the Government and of the terms of the Supreme Court judgment.</P>
    <P>It is manifestly obvious that, in the face of successive court judgments, the benefit so long enjoyed by tenants of controlled dwellings could continue only for a limited period required to enact permanent legislation.  Equally the Government have a responsibility, in line with the pledge in the Constitution that the State shall safeguard with special care the interests of the weaker sections of the community, to protect tenants of controlled dwellings, many of whom are amongst the poorest members of our community.  The manifestation of the Government's concern in this regard is the provision in section 23 of the Bill for the payment of rent allowance to tenants faced with hardship in paying increased rents, and this I will come to later.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy mentioned the whole <Col N="543" /> constitutional question.  I have already referred to the constitutional situation and the best advice we have available.  As a Minister, all I can operate on is the best legal advice and the advice of the Attorney General, which is that this Bill will stand up taking into account the two judgments, the referral judgment and the Blake-Madigan judgment.  I am grateful to the Private Tenants' Action Group and to Threshold for their welcome for the Bill, but I do not think this automatically means that the Bill is anti-landlord. As I have said, we have tried to get a fair balance.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuiness rightly referred to this Bill as being a child of history.  It is a very complex problem, as the Senator said.  We have tried to get a fair balance between the rights of landlord and tenant. The whole area of housing and the need for rented accommodation are matters to which I am giving considerable thought.  We have not had a White Paper on housing since the mid-sixties.  I hope to have available for discussion by the end of the year a White Paper on housing generally which will take into account such matters as the provision of adequate rented accommodation and not just the matters that immediately come to mind such as the availability of new houses and reconstructed houses.  The whole area of rented accommodation needs considerable thought, and needs to have considerable work done on it.  I will be giving considerable thought to it in the White Paper on housing.</P>
    <P>To conclude, in this Bill I have striven to achieve a solution to a difficult problem and do so in a way that would be fair to and in the best interests of both landlord and tenant.  Given the 25 April deadline and the recent coming into office of the Government, the time available was exceedingly limited.  We have to do better than express concern about the plight of the tenants.  There must be positive legislative action to protect them and to remove the uncertainties that exist.  One cannot be happy while the legislative void continues.  The temporary legislation we discussed earlier today does not provide a satisfactory solution to the problem. <Col N="544" /> We should bear in mind that there have been moves by landlords to test the temporary legislation.  If that should fail tenants would be left in a very perilous state in the absence of legislation such as the Bill before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 provides that the Act will come into operation on such day as the Minister may appoint by order. I would like to know why it is necessary to have provision for the Minister to have power to decide when the Bill will come into effect.  If this Bill was not being referred to the Supreme Court &mdash; which would be a matter for the President &mdash; is there any reason why it would not come into effect when passed, particularly in the light of the urgent situation which the Minister has stressed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>This was not in the Bill as originally drafted.  It arises from the introduction of the temporary Bill.  It was thought better to bring in this provision and relate it to the temporary Bill which extends to 25 July or when this Bill is signed.  As soon as the President signs the permanent Bill I will bring it into force by order immediately on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, then why do we need it?  If the Minister is going to bring it in on the same day as the President signs the other Bill, then the President will either sign the other Bill in the normal way when the Bill is sent to him, not before the fifth and not later than the seventh day &mdash; whatever the provision is &mdash; and it will come into effect then.  If the Bill is to be referred to the Supreme Court and that court finds that it is unconstitutional then there is no Bill and the President may not sign it.  If the Supreme Court were to find that it was constitutional then the President would sign it and it would come into effect that day.  Although this is not a matter of dispute, I still do not see why it was necessary to introduce an amendment giving the Minister this power.</P>

      <P>The Bill as originally drafted shows 25 April as the date of operation of this Bill.  I felt that by doing it in this way it would avoid confusion between the two dates.  I assure the Senator that there is no intention of delaying the bringing into operation of the Bill.  It is to avoid confusion that it is drafted in this way.  If it is referred to the Supreme Court by the President, and I hope it will not be, then there are 60 days to decide in advance.  It is easier to do it this way just to avoid the confusion of 25 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>So that I may understand the confusion we are avoiding, if the Bill is passed through this House and goes to the President for signature and he does not decide to refer it to the Supreme Court, but decides to sign it in the normal way, and if that happens on, say, 16 April, is the Minister saying that he would not bring this Act into effect until 25 April and he would allow the temporary measure to run its full scope?  Or, is he saying that he would bring it in immediately? The time is already extended, so 25 April is no longer a relevant date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would bring it in on 25 April at the earliest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>That itself I do not quite understand because 25 April is no longer of much significance in view of the Bill that we passed earlier unless that Bill also is referred to the Supreme Court on the question of its constitutionality.  In other words, it seems that this is legislation which all of us want to come into effect at the earliest possible date.  We share that concern very much with the Minister.  So, why are we introducing a possibility of a discretion in the Minister in delaying that implementation?  Normally an Act comes into effect when it is signed by the President.</P>

      <P>I accepted amendments in the other House with regard to registration, rent books and other matters that it would not be a matter that the Minister &ldquo;will&rdquo; but the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo;<Col N="547" /> bring in regulations.  I want to bring them in before 25 April, at the same time as this Bill will come into operation.  The Minister for Social Welfare also has to introduce details of the subsidy to be payable.  I am trying to get everything to jell on the one day.  Obviously, it is my aim and my desire to have this Bill operative as soon as possible.  I would suggest to the Senator that there is no conflict between us on this issue.  She is anxious to have it operative as soon as possible. However, I have certain regulations to make and the Minister for Social Welfare has to set down terms under section 23 of the type of allowances and so on to be paid.  The date I have in mind at this stage is 25 April.  If I can bring it forward a day or two fine but that is the day I have in mind.  I can assure the Senator it is not an issue of controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonetheless, it has been a matter worth probing because the Minister has neatly and adroitly shifted ground.  He is now of the view that the reason why he is seeking to have the power to determine when this Bill, if it is passed, will come into effect is because he needs time to prepare the regulations under it.  He also refers to the regulations to be made by the Minister for Social Welfare in relation to supplementary welfare allowances.  We can deal with those in relation to separate sections but it is important to have got from the Minister an undertaking, as he has given us, that he feels that it is both possible and is his intention to do this by 25 April.  In view of the Bill we passed earlier this afternoon that date no longer has the same significance because we have continued that to 25 July but the Minister is still referring to that date as a reference date for bringing in the necessary regulations in relation to rent books and in relation to the Minister for Social Welfare bringing in the necessary provisions for the allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided Senator O'Leary has no objection to that.  I certainly have no objection to debating these amendments at this stage and then, if necessary, they can be considered separately when it comes to the House determining its approach to them.  As the person responsible for amendments Nos. 1 and 2 I should like to debate these amendments.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (1), page 3, line 26, to delete &ldquo;the District Court&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the Fair Rents Tribunal to be <Col N="549" /> established by regulations made by the Minister under this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The clear objective in this amendment is one which has been a very important policy objective of the Labour Party for a long number of years.  It is fair to say that we are the major political party that has been calling for a fair rents tribunal for the longest period.  We continue to call for it and to use an opportunity such as this to say that the forum which must adjudicate on the assessment to be carried out, particularly under section 13 of the Bill, must be a fair rents tribunal.  It is because this Bill comes to the Seanad at a fairly late stage and with a certain amount of urgency that it is not possible to draft a broader framework for a fair rents tribunal.  I am encouraged by the Minister's commitment to that broader framework.  He went out of his way this afternoon to give a very clear and explicit commitment to introduce a fair rents tribunal in a broader context in relation to the assessment of rents in the private sector.</P>
    <P>I welcome that and I take his commitment seriously.  He has made that commitment on the record and off the record. In both contexts I believe it is a serious commitment and I very much welcome it.  However, that commitment does not detract from the immediate position of the Bill before the Seanad or from the opportunity in the context of a limited class of people, a limited class of landlords and tenants but an important class for the purposes of this legislation, a class deserving of protection and also the institutions and procedures which will secure and bring about much greater confidence and hope for these people, particularly for the tenants.  I agree with Senator McGuinness that we must not be too one -sided in this.  There are circumstances I mentioned this afternoon where it is the landlord who is exploited, or has been exploited, in a situation by a tenant in rent controlled premises who, in fact, could have paid a much higher rent and who has used the law to exploit the comparatively much less favourable position of the landlord.</P>
    <P>The objective in seeking to replace the <Col N="550" /> District Court with a fair rents tribunal is to seek to introduce a long desired aspiration of the Labour Party and a long desired objective of the spokesperson for the Environment, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, who spoke eloquently on the need for a fair rents tribunal when the predecessor of this Bill was before the House.  This is a relevant amendment which would only introduce the fair rents tribunal in relation to the limited category of tenancies covered by this part of the legislation.  It would be a forerunner to the broader proposals that the Minister would have. It might, indeed, be very valuable to have the experience in the short-term of a fair rents tribunal dealing with the specific category of landlords and tenancies under the Bill.  I submit that landlords and tenants would benefit from the experience of this tribunal with rather limited powers in the short-term but with a commitment at a political level to expand and enlarge on its scope.  Therefore, the approach we are proposing in this amendment is that the fair rents tribunal to be established in section 2 will be done by means of regulations to be provided for in section 3.</P>
    <P>The second amendment in my name, which is supported by the Labour Party, proposes that the Minister would have what I accept are very far-reaching powers but are also compatible with other far-reaching powers that the Minister has under this legislation.  The only reason for giving the Minister such far-reaching powers is that we are in what I could only characterise as an emergency situation. We need to have detailed legislation more quickly than we have time and opportunity in both Houses.  That is evident by everything that has been said to date in this House and by the time constraints under which we operate.  Unusually and because this is a short-term measure in relation to this provision, as the Minister has already indicated, I move the amendment which states that the Minister shall within two weeks of the commencement of this Bill by regulation establish a fair rents tribunal.  This would consist of a President who shall be a judge of the Circuit Court and six other members who shall, because of their particular <Col N="551" /> knowledge or experience, be suitably qualified for membership of such a tribunal.</P>
    <P>The power given to the Minister there is a greater power than I would normally be in favour of but it is for the substantial objective of bringing in a fair rents tribunal. Let it be in the Dolphin Hotel.  I see no objection to that as a location for it.  It will give rise to a certain amount of Dublin humour about dolphin rents and whatever, but there is no harm in that. The Dolphin Hotel is well known to Dubliners, is an accessible venue and there is no reason why the fair rents tribunal would not establish itself in that venue. It is sufficiently adjacent to the existing courts to be a suitable location in geographical terms.</P>
    <P>It is not beyond the Minister's energy and resources and those of his officials and advisers, including advisers in the Attorney General's office, to surmount what I do not underestimate &mdash; the problems in establishing a tribunal to exercise this kind of power and discretion.  If it is helpful to the Minister, the idea is implicit in the name of the tribunal that it would deal with the fair rents question.  If the Minister subsequently, as he mentioned &mdash; and I appreciate this point &mdash; in consultation with the political parties and groupings in the Dáil and Seanad wishes to enlarge the future scope of a tribunal to deal not only with fair rents but also with other issues such as rights to repossession or other matters which arise under this legislation, fair enough.  I would be very interested in seeing Government proposals on this, but it goes beyond the resources of an Opposition party to put forward matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important to have a fair rents tribunal for the rents of this category of tenants and, indeed, also of landlords. Since June 1981 they have suffered and suffered badly, because of the vacuum created by the judgment of the Supreme Court, a vacuum which we have failed to fill adequately as a Legislature. We must exert ourselves now and use every effort to ensure that this legislation is the best approach we can adopt and not use excuses like lack of time, or <Col N="552" /> opportunity, or the Easter vacation, or whatever, to avoid introducing a rents tribunal.</P>

      <P>I did not get an opportunity to welcome the Minister to the House but it is no harm to do so on Committee Stage.  I wish him well in his very onerous duties in the future.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Robinson in this amendment.  We have had many problems over Bills of this type.  The exercise we are engaged in at the moment is trying to get through as easily as possible legislation which will be adequate in many areas, not just that of rent control.  The Minister, as Minister for the Environment, appreciates the extent of the present demand for private rented dwellings, whether flats, houses, or whatever, and how this demand has been steadily growing. We should not have to wait for some emergency situation to force us to deal with situations.  This amendment suggests how we can make the necessary provision. Otherwise, we are going to have agitation on this matter for a long time to come.</P>
      <P>This is not a new idea.  It was thought of in England about 15 to 20 years ago. I certainly would favour it.  We have here a difficult Bill which is not the fault of any individual Minister, Deputy, or Senator. We are all at fault.  Over the years we did not look at the changing situation in the whole area of housing.  Whether we like it or not, one thing relates to the other; and if we do not tackle this question of a fair rents tribunal, agitation will grow.  While we have an opportunity, we should tackle the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is wrong with a fair rents tribunal? Why should there not be a fair rents tribunal and why should its composition not be as proposed here?  As Senator Robinson mentioned, the Labour Party, since their foundation in 1912, have been agitating for such improvements in the area of housing.  It is nothing new and will not be a great revelation to anybody outside who knows how difficulties occur in the private rented housing area.  We are not going to be put to any test of the Constitution by inserting this proposed section in the Bill, <Col N="553" /> particularly having regard to the way it would be framed.  It is time we made up our minds.  We have had difficulties with this Bill and an amendment could now be conceded that will go a very long way towards alleviating the problems of very many people who have to depend on private rented dwellings.  It will give them a little more satisfaction to know that they have some kind of redress, which can be provided in a fair and equitable way.</P>
    <P>I am not coming down heavily on the side of the tenant as against the owner of the property.  After all, the owner can have redress also.  He has property which has an increasing market value and we will, under other sections of the Bill, be able to deal with the question of fair rents from his angle.  It is a two-sided thing.  I urge the Minister to insert this proposed new section between sections 2 and 3.  It will bring about a lot of goodwill on both sides of the House.</P>

      <P>The position is, however, somewhat different.  I realise that I am trying to rationalise my position when I say this.  However, things look different on 6 April from the way they looked on 17 December last, and it is not only our physical position in the House.  While we on our side of the House at that stage were very unhappy with the speed with which our Minister brought the legislation before the House, that was due to the impending adjournment of the Seanad until after Christmas and the necessity to do something before 31 December.  The view of the Fine Gael Party was put very forcibly; we expected that a fair rents tribunal or, as we call it, a private rented dwellings tribunal, would be established by the Government in pursuance of the policy which they had agreed with the Labour Party and under <Col N="555" /> which they entered into Government. That was our policy.  The present Minister had eloquently argued for this concept as had Senator Ryan.</P>
      <P>As I said in my Second Stage speech, it is a reasonable assumption, it being the policy of every political party who are likely to achieve power or share power, that there would be a rent tribunal of one kind or another, that the officials of the Department of the Environment would, in the meantime, have completed the necessary work to bring such a tribunal before the House.  Therefore, the same excuse is not available to the present Minister.  I am not blaming him personally for it.  It is not available to the present Minister as it was to the last Minister because the Government of the day were clearly put on notice that we expected that, at an early date, a fair rents tribunal or a private rented dwellings tribunal would be established.  When the previous Bill was declared unconstitutional there was ample time to introduce into the Bill this new concept, no matter in what sketchy form it was introduced because a rent tribunal of one kind or another will be expected to cover not only this category of dwelling but all the categories of dwellings which are rented in the State, and that the same criteria should apply to them all.  That can be seen quite clearly from our consideration of the judgment of the Supreme Court. There is no good reason why this tribunal should not operate even in the same area as ordinary rented accommodation which was at no time controlled by law.  The Minister should have been properly advised on this.  I am sure the information was available in the Department to include it in the Bill.  Therefore, it is right and proper that an attempt should be made at this stage to have it included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of section 13 and one or two other items, there is general agreement in this House with regard to the need for the Bill and for the Bill itself. There are difficulties founded on different interpretations of what will succeed. There are various other difficulties, but <Col N="556" /> nothing of a political or partisan nature. Therefore, the proposal that I have before the House that a private rented dwellings tribunal would be established and would take up the duties allocated in the various sections of the Bill allocated to the District Court is a proposal which the Minister said in the Dáil that he shared and he repeated that in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of whether a Fianna Fáil amendment or a Fine Gael or a Labour Party amendment would be accepted.  Surely it is not a question of pride that we cannot accept an amendment because it comes from the other side of the House?  That does not make sense.  If it will ease matters, let the Minister put down his own amendment and I shall be delighted to support it.  If the Minister wants to go down as the man who introduced the amendment which is necessary to establish the tribunal, let him do that.  He will have my support if he puts it down on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I had had the Senator's support on the last occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. S. O'Leary Mr. S. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator did not have my support on the last occasion but we should take the opportunity which is presented to us today and establish the tribunal.</P>
      <P>The Minister rightly said the amendment put down by the Fine Gael Party in the Dáil which, unbelieveably, was not accepted and which is repeated here today under my name and with the support of the Fine Gael Party, is based on an existing tribunal which is operating successfully.  I do not see anything wrong with that.  It is to be commended that one would take the framework of another tribunal which has been very successful in administering quite a difficult area of law where the rights of employers and employees are in direct parallel with the rights of landlords or tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to have a tribunal on this occasion, more so even than on the last occasion because the nature of the Bill is such that the court or the tribunal will be establishing the gross rent and will be taking into account the nature, character <Col N="557" /> and location of the dwelling, the terms of the tenancy, the means of the landlord, the date of purchase of the dwelling by the landlord, the amount paid by the landlord for it, the length of the tenant's occupancy, the number and ages of the tenant's family residing with him, the means of the landlord and the means of the tenant.</P>
    <P>This will give rise to the most appalling, complicated formula which is not suitable to the District Court even though the District Court, if asked to assess the amount of the market rent, would arrive at a very fair figure.  I made this point on the last occasion and I do so again.  The District Court would adequately and properly do that job because, with the benefit of its local knowledge, it would easily arrive at a conclusion.  However, it cannot put aside its other work to receive and process information from solicitors and professional advisers which would give rise to an equitable, just and consistent decision under the proposals of this legislation.  It is one thing to say market rent would have been proved by one auctioneer or valuer coming in and giving evidence, another valuer giving contrary evidence and the court deciding which of these two is sensible and reasonable. They would arrive at a figure and that would be it.  The valuer is only one small portion of the picture; in fact it could be read that the valuer has no part at all to play in it.  Assuming that &ldquo;just and proper&rdquo; does include at least some element of the market, then that must be discounted by a chartered accountant and the accountant of the people who are making the application and evidence must be heard with regard to the number of children and various other things.</P>
    <P>It is a much more involved, complicated process which must be done by a group of individuals acting under central control and authority.  That group would arrive at decisions which were consistent so that the number of cases which would appear before the tribunal would be a diminishing, not an increasing, number of cases.  The tribunal should be encouraged to arrive at reasonable and just settlements and by doing that encourage people to arrive at their own internal <Col N="558" /> agreements which is the proper thing to do if at all possible.</P>
    <P>District Courts scattered throughout the country cannot arrive at the same internal cost-consistent conclusions under the complicated system of calculating the rent chargeable proposed in section 13 (2) of this Bill.  For that reason there is an additional need for the private rented dwellings tribunal.  It is proper that the tribunal should be appointed, that there should be some one with legal knowledge on it and other people appointed on the basis of having good, sound, common sense.  The experience which we have of the employment appeals tribunal should encourage us to appoint this tribunal.  The members of such tribunals never have become remote from the problems with which they have been dealing.  They have served the country well, as I believe the tribunal being proposed would do.  They would be fair to both the landlords and the tenants.</P>
    <P>It is also important that there would be provision for appeals against the tribunal, and that is included in the amendment in subsection (11).  It is important that the tribunal would have sufficient flexibility to meet in quite unusual places, that they could go very far into the country where the number of controlled dwellings would not be sufficient to justify permanent sittings. For those reasons I appeal to the Minister to accept Senator Robinson's amendment, or mine, or indeed to put down his own amendment.  In any one of these circumstances he would have my support and that of all Fine Gael Senators.</P>

      <P>The bodies interested in this matter are very seriously concerned about the necessity for a rents tribunal.  I accept the Minister's solemn and sincere guarantee that legislation to set up such a tribunal will be introduced within a short time.  Of course it is only a matter of enlightened self-interest for the Government to set up the tribunal machinery as soon as possible.  However, in the interim, how does the Minister envisage dealing with the matter?  How long will the interim be?  Is it seriously envisaged that a substantial number of <Col N="559" /> cases can be brought before the courts while the legislation to set up tribunals is being brought into being?  The Minister promised us that extra district justices will be appointed in the Dublin area to deal with this work.  How many does he hope to appoint?  In the interim, will the courts be able to deal with the business arising from the Act?</P>

      <P>I was particularly interested to hear Senator Robinson talking about the long-term aspiration of the Labour Party to have this kind of tribunal. When the Labour Party had an opportunity to implement that long-term aspiration last December they avoided taking it up.  The popular way to describe that is that it was merely a hiccough in their long-term aspiration.  However, the long-term aspiration will be achieved shortly.  The only difference between the position then and now is that then there was no undertaking, no commitment given by the Minister to introduce such a tribunal.  In spite of that, my friends on the other side refused to support my amendment which would have provided for the introduction of a tribunal.  Indeed, not only did the Minister not give a commitment, but on reading the report I see that Senator Robinson congratulated him on his high principles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Though the Minister did not give a commitment, and he was specifically congratulated on that, nevertheless Senator Robinson did not see fit to support my amendment which would have led to the introduction of a tribunal. The difference now is that we have a specific commitment that we are to have these tribunals in a relatively short time. In the circumstances it does not give me any trouble at all to refuse to support this amendment.  I know the amendment is a gesture to try to have these tribunals introduced, but it is quite clear it could not be included in this Bill in a serious way, and that it is quite unnecessary in view of the Minister's commitment.  I do not have any hesitation or feel in any way embarrassed in refusing to support the amendment.  I think Senator O'Leary was right when, going at some length to describe the kind of tribunal that is necessary, he described how the tribunal should work.  He said this would have to be a comprehensive and sophisticated tribunal that would be able to go into the merits of the issues involved in a very detailed way.  But that merely proves the point that it would be impossible to incorporate that kind of a tribunal in this Bill, that the proper way to do it would be, as the Minister said, to have a complete new Bill.  As I have said, I am delighted that all sides of the House are agreed that we should have a tribunal, and I am very glad the Minister has given the commitment that such a tribunal will be established in the near future.  That gives me a very good opportunity to do what I should have done at the beginning, to welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Ryan and Harte for their welcome and their contributions.  I accept the principle involved in the amendments put down by Senators Robinson and O'Leary.  I want to restate that it is the intention of the Government, at party level, at Whip level, or at the level of the Minister for the Environment and his opposite number <Col N="561" /> in the Opposition, the spokesman on Environment, immediately after Easter to get together to discuss the details of the formation of a rents tribunal and the whole scope of that matter.  The necessary legislation to set up a rents tribunal will be introduced in the next session.</P>
      <P>I appeal to Senators today, not from a party political point of view &mdash; there is not a party political point between us on this because we all agree about the need for rent tribunals.  I disagree with all sides about the use of the word &ldquo;fair&rdquo;.  The Supreme Court decision ruled out the use of the word.  It should be a rents tribunal, not a fair rents tribunal, but that is a matter for another day.  As I have said, I appeal to all sides of the House to consider that in an area as complex as this the last thing the people of this country need &mdash; when it is such a sensitive area and has this history of involvement with the Supreme Court &mdash; is legislation by regulation.  What Senator Robinson's amendment asks me to do is to accept that I will set up by regulation rent tribunals within two weeks.  I think we would be doing a major disservice to the tenants if we set up that type of tribunal by regulation.  What is needed is substantive legislation which can be debated at leisure without the time constraints that we have before us because of the decision of 25 April.  What we need is to set up these tribunals in a constructive way so that they will meet the legitimate demand of all Political parties and of the tenants involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Senator Robinson and the Labour Party will agree that the worst thing from a democratic point of view is legislation by regulation.  It totally negatives the operation and effectiveness of the Dáil and Seanad because we do not have the opportunity to tease out the detail that is so necessary.  But we should have these substantive discussions between ourselves as parties.  Surely there has not been a more gracious and a more committed offer for some time, even if I say so myself.  But it was originally made by the Taoiseach, so I do not feel embarrassed about saying it.  I refer not to my commitment but that of the Taoiseach, which was a very gracious <Col N="562" /> offer and shows the way to tackle this major social problem.  I hope the Senators will accept my good faith in this matter and the good faith of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>As far as party political manifestoes on this issue are concerned, all parties share this aspiration for the creation of rent tribunals, but it is a question of setting them up in the best form.  We are discussing a number of amendments.  This highlights the need for discussion, and it highlights the difficulty and the danger of doing it merely by accepting an amendment put down by any party.  The amendment put down by Senator Robinson is direct, using more or less my own words when I put down an amendment in December when we were discussing the Bill in the Dáil.  On the other side, Senator O'Leary has his own quite legitimate ideas on it.  There is merit on both sides, but I do not think this is the forum for doing this.  What we are faced with is trying to protect the interests of those tenants who will find themselves without protection after 25 April if the continuance Bill is found to be unconstitutional and if the President has referred it to the Supreme Court in the meantime.  We are going to have a time lag of two months while waiting for the decision of the Supreme Court and the tenants are left without protection.  That is something nobody in this House wants to see.</P>
    <P>I accept totally the point made by Senator Harte with regard to the demand for rented dwellings.  There is this demand and it has to be met.  It is my intention, as it was my predecessor's intention, to introduce before the end of the year a White Paper on housing.  We have not had one since the sixties.  It is my intention to devote a considerable amount of my time and energies to the private rented dwelling sector because it is going to become an even more important area in the future than it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Senators for their co-operation at this stage.  I want to give Senators an idea of the time scale that I have had to face on this.  Senators asked why, when this Bill was introduced last December, we have not had the time to set up the tribunals.  The general election was on 18 <Col N="563" /> February.  The decision on the referral was on 19 February.  The new Government came into office on 9 March, and today is 6 April.  In the time at my disposal I have tried to cover as many of the points of issue and of concern that were causing so much distress to the tenants &mdash; for example, the issue of confirming that subsidies would be available, and that is written into section 23 of this Bill. Some would say that the regulations should be clearly spelt out.  I have not had the time to do it and the Minister for Social Welfare will be doing it before 25 April.  I appeal to the Senators, not from any party political point of view, not from Government embarrassment &mdash; if the Seanad decided to put through the amendment in one form or another the Dáil would have to come back to discuss the matter &mdash; but for the sake of the protection of tenants and for the peace of mind of those tenants who are already sorely distressed by the present situation. I have not had the opportunity, it was not possible in the time that I have had available, to set up a complex and what for Ireland is a totally new administrative structure, involving the recruiting and training of staff for a new institution, a rents tribunal.  It would take considerable time before such an operation could be properly working and there is no possibility that such a tribunal can be set up in the time scale we have on this legislation. I am asking for the understanding of the Senators.  I was not present for that debate last December.  I gather from the comments made on both sides of the House that it must have been a fascinating debate.  Having read some of the comments of various Senators there have been certain contradictions in everybody's point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  But there have been statements made by all sides that were not necessarily the same as those made last December.  I can understand there is a certain temptation to score points.  I also understand and <Col N="564" /> accept that the amendments before us are not in any way point-scoring.  The comments might be but the amendments are well-intentioned and are in good faith.  I would make a special plea to the House to accept my good faith, as I accept the good faith of this House, that in the time I have available I cannot set up the tribunals asked for.  I honestly believe the tribunals that will eventually come out of the all-party discussions will be in the greater interest of the people of Ireland than the type we are thinking about here tonight, because there are contradictions between Fine Gael and Labour on it.  If Senators just wanted a rent tribunal, I am giving the firm commitment that by summer recess the rent tribunal legislation will be introduced into the House resulting from the discussions that will take place.  That is of greater concern to the tenants, and the passing of this Bill is equally of greater concern, than the amendments before us. It is not my usual form to appeal at such length and I do it not from my point of view or the Government's point of view, but strictly from a tenant's point of view and because the common good will be better served by doing it in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy asked me about the operation of the Bill.  There will be two District Court justices appointed.  Sometimes tenants, landlords and older people are not used to the atmosphere of a court and as the greatest numbers will be in the Dublin area, we will be appointing two District Court justices there who will sit in what was the Dolphin Hotel.  That is the intention at present and the Minister for Justice is working on it.  In Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, the major cities, I am also looking at the possibility of having special sittings of the District Court away from court buildings, in as informal an atmosphere as possible.  I am not in a position tonight &mdash; I do not want to mislead the House &mdash; to give the exact details but pending the tribunals &mdash; and I emphasise pending &mdash; in the short interim period between the coming into force of the Act and the setting up of the tribunals, it is my intention to meet the need and legitimate anxiety of both landlords and tenants to get away from the <Col N="565" /> atmosphere of the court.  I can go no further than that.</P>

      <P>The time on the Bill is 25 April.  That was the time on the original Bill when I introduced it but because of the points made on Second Stage today by both Fine Gael and Labour spokesmen I decided to introduce further temporary legislation despite the fact that I have already expressed reservations about it.  Now there is the situation in which I can bring this Bill into force by regulation pending the decision on signature by the President. The earliest date I could do it would be 25 April.  I should like to do it earlier but I have to prepare the regulations with regard to registration and so on and also the regulations for the subsidies which under section 23 are paid to tenants who find they will not be in a position to pay whatever increased rents are agreed. However, if the President refers the Bill to the Supreme Court, they have 60 days in which to make a decision.  It would be during those 60 days that our discussions would be going on and the Bill would be prepared and introduced.  Now we find ourselves in a situation in which we are talking about the middle of June.  If the Bill comes into force in April, I hope the tribunals will be set up by the summer. That is my goal at this stage and the legislation will be introduced in the next session.  I can assure the House of that.</P>
      <P>As regards the form and the agreement in the informal discussions that will take place, they may go through immediately or there may be an extended debate.  I do not know at this stage: that awaits the form of discussion that takes place between the parties.

      <P>I should like to respond to a number of the contributions <Col N="566" /> made on my two amendments.  I begin by responding in full measure to the very generous approach adopted by Senator O'Leary in relation to the amendment which he has put forward, which is an alternative proposal for a tribunal.  Like him, what we are looking for is a commitment from the Minister, slightly different from the one he is giving.  In devising the tribunal to be included in this Bill, it is quite clear that the Minister is in the best position to do this, if he has the political will.  He has his expert advisers to assist him in drafting the appropriate amendment and he would get the full support of this House.  That could be done extremely quickly.</P>

    <P>Before I turn to the Minister's contribution, I should like to respond to the reference by Senator Eoin Ryan to the previous debate on the predecessor to this Bill and to the record of the House on that occasion.  I recall that occasion very vividly because I had to take a decision for which I had to pay a price on that occasion.  I recall that Senator Eoin Ryan moved an amendment to include in that Bill a fair rents tribunal.  He spoke eloquently and, indeed, strongly in favour of a fair rents tribunal.  I also recall being disappointed with the lack of a firm commitment in that regard by the then Minister of State who was in the House.  It was for that reason that I congratulated him on his honesty but could not congratulate him on anything else.  He, at least, did not pretend that he had had an early intention of introducing the legislation and I remember being disappointed at that.  But then, when Senator Eoin Ryan called a vote it is fair to say, as Senator O'Leary has done, he did it because he knew there were differences between the two parties because of the contributions made by, for example, Senator Ruairí Quinn, Senator Harte and myself.  When he called it, I recall that I felt so strongly about it that I abstained, which, as the Senator will know, is a very substantial step to take for a Senator on the Government side.  I hope to have reciprocity if this matter goes to a vote from Senator Eoin Ryan in the light of his eloquent commitment in the context of a Bill last December which was under <Col N="567" /> exactly the same time constraints.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that when that Bill was being debated exactly the same constraints were there.  The continuance Bill had been continued for a few months.  It was envisaged that the Bill would probably have to be referred to the Supreme Court.  The whole framework and the whole urgency of it were there and yet in this House, the Leader of the Opposition at the time, Senator Eoin Ryan &mdash; I think he is the longest serving Senator in this House, somebody who has been Leader of the House on successive occasions &mdash; proposed and eloquently argued for and called for a vote on having a rents tribunal in the preceding legislation.  The Minister has admitted a spokesperson in the other House, which we are not allowed to refer to except peripherally, put forward and fought for a similar amendment.  Does one rule apply if you are in Government and does one rule apply if you are in Opposition?  I suggest that this is a situation in which the Minister is hoist with his own petard.  If he was doing it as the spokesman for the Fianna Fáil Party last December, he must accept now that it is possible because surely he would not have put it forward and Senator Eoin Ryan would not have pressed it to a vote, if they did not believe it was possible and feasible to include a rents tribunal from the beginning.</P>
    <P>This is not academic.  It is very important. We will add to the strain and worry, worry to the point of sickness of some of the elderly tenants who have approached me on the matter, at the prospect of going into a court.  This may be difficult for some of us and particularly some of us lawyers to comprehend.  The idea of going to court is of itself terribly alarming. They would almost rather vacate their dwelling and go somewhere else or fall on the resources of Dublin Corporation or whoever the local authority is than go into court.  We must be concerned about that.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister would have a very difficult fortnight ahead of him, and his officials likewise, but he must have given considerable thought to the form of this tribunal when he proposed <Col N="568" /> it when in Opposition and the officials in the Department must have seen the writing on the wall for a considerable time.  For that reason, I believe it is possible in the context of the particular kind of private rented accommodation we are talking about, the controlled rents, to have an amendment made to this Bill.  Like Senator O'Leary, I would prefer if the Minister would introduce precisely the kind of amendment he is looking for.  But in the absence of that, the proposal to establish a rents tribunal contained in my amendments is a perfectly adequate one.  In perfect conditions, when we had plenty of time to consider these matters, I would not be in favour of giving the Minister the discretion which he will have to introduce by regulation but, as has been said on both sides of the House and by the Minister, frequently in the course of the debate on these measures this afternoon, we do not have the luxury of time.  However, we have the responsibility to bring in the best legislation we can in the circumstances, and we will not bring in the best legislation we can unless we face up to the need for a fair rents tribunal from the beginning.  This tribunal must be based on ministerial regulations pending the introduction of full-scale legislation on this on the basis of all-party discussion. The Minister has undertaken to do this before the Houses rise for the summer and I am glad to have that commitment on the record.  It is important and I welcome it.  I pay tribute to the Minister for the fact that he has given that expressed commitment and certainly he will have the support of the Labour Party in pressing for and advancing the general tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his response on the amendment that you cannot call it a fair rents tribunal because, following the judgment of the Supreme Court, there is no such thing as a fair rent in that sense. That is interesting and it brings me to what we will consider at much greater length later in relation to section 13 of this Bill.  What is the difference between a fair rent and, in the wording of section 13, a just and proper rent?  What is the difference between a fair rent, a just and <Col N="569" /> proper rent and a fair market rent?  We will have to go into these at great length because the Minister has put on the record of this House one of the great difficulties in that he appears to share the view, interpreting the Supreme Court's judgment in the case, that it is not open to the tribunal or to the District Court to ascertain what is a fair rent.  Yet section 13 of this Bill proposes that the District Court ascertain what is a just and proper rent.  Must we bring out the dictionaries in order to ascertain what words mean? What is the difference in the use by the Minister of the words &ldquo;fair&rdquo; and &ldquo;just and proper&rdquo;?  This would be crucial to the role to be played whether by the District Court or some other body if this amendment or Senator O'Leary's amendment is not accepted, or if the Minister will not bring in his own amendment. Some body, be it the District Court or a tribunal, will have to determine rents.  What language, what words are we using?  What did the Minister mean when he said that it is no longer open to all to consider fair rents because of the Supreme Court's ruling in the cases on this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rapheal Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little more to say on this because I have already explained clearly my position to the Seanad.  I have appealed for the understanding of the Seanad on it.  I do not want to be controversial or political on this, but Senator Robinson mentioned that the time constraints in this Bill are exactly the same as they were in the December 1981 situation.  That is not quite correct &mdash; in fact, it is not correct at all.  At the time the Senator's party were a part of the Government which came into power on 1 July.  The Bill was introduced on 9 December.  We have been in power for less than four weeks and I am trying to do what I can with what I have in the period available to me. The Senator makes the point that I put down an amendment at that time.  I accept that I did so, and I did it in good faith.  I stand over it.  On the basis of that amendment and the amendment that Senator Ryan had here in the House that divided the House, I give my unreserved <Col N="570" /> commitment to this House, as I did to the Dáil, that the rent tribunal will be set up after the Easter recess following discussions of all parties.  I do not want to go into that again.  However, I remind the Seanad that the new Dáil discussed this issue at great length last week and divided on it and a substantial majority were in favour of the Government's position on that.  The House might recall that the majority was eight or ten.  The Government's decision was confirmed and recognised and many Deputies who voted on that issue did so on the basis of the commitment given by the Taoiseach and myself with regard to the introduction of the rent tribunals after the Easter recess.</P>
      <P>With regard to the words &ldquo;fair&rdquo;, &ldquo;just and proper&rdquo; and so on, fair rents go back to the old British rents tribunals mentioned by Senator Harte in his contribution earlier and they are pretty well accepted to be 20 per cent or more under what would be the market rent.  We have here a just and proper rent with specific criteria set out for its decision in section 13 (2), which we will be discussing probably in five or six minutes time.</P>

We all know what we want to get.  We want to get a tribunal who will decide on rents. Whatever criteria are decided, we have our own criteria here which have been accepted by the new Dáil.  By the way, the House did not divide on it, it was accepted by parties on all sides of the House.  The only division in the Lower House was on the setting up or otherwise of rent tribunals and the new Dáil at that stage decided by a majority of about ten to accept the commitments given by both the Taoiseach and myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister puts us in a very difficult position, or at least he puts himself in a difficult position when he talks about the necessity for this legislation. He talks about not accepting an amendment as if it will put in jeopardy the position of the tenants.  I would not put anybody in jeopardy.  We have passed a Bill here today which, no doubt, will be signed by the President in due course and will extend the temporary provisions until 25 July.  It makes no difference to us whether the Dáil comes back next week.  That is not our business.  All we are interested in is the Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that dire consequences might be the result of this being referred by the President to the Supreme Court.  There might be a difficulty, but the introduction or non-introduction of a rents tribunal or private rented dwellings tribunal will not be the basis on which the President will refer a Bill to the Supreme Court.  Therefore, the acceptance or non-acceptance of either of them will not improve or affect adversely the possibility of the reference by the President. Appealing to the better nature of the Senators on the basis that a difficulty would arise in the event of a reference by the President to the Supreme Court is not relevant on this section of the Bill.  This <Col N="572" /> section does not give rise to any constitutional problems, so far as I am aware.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is aware of any constitutional problem that my amendment gives rise to, I would be anxious that he would tell me.  If it gives rise to a constitutional problem I would be very anxious to change my amendment to overcome that problem.  As far as I am concerned, the amendments in my name and that of Senator Robinson do not in any way conflict with the Constitution, do not in any way give rise even to a suspicion that a Bill containing either of these amendments should be referred to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality on the basis of these amendments.  If the President in his wisdom decides, on the basis of other provisions of the Bill, that has nothing to do with either of these amendments.</P>
    <P>I want to take up the Minister's suggestion that it is not a question of imposing a Fianna Fáil point of view or of our imposing a Fine Gael point of view.  We appreciate that.  I am not pushing this on the basis of seeking to defeat the present Government in the matter, because it is not a matter of us against Fianna Fáil; it is us against the administration, because the great deadening hand of the administration is to be seen in this.  The administration is a very powerful body and the administration is not happy with the concept of a rents tribunal at the moment. That is the real problem.  Both this Minister and the last Minister found themselves constrained by reason of the reluctance of the administration to produce the necessary legislation in the right time.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his contribution said that this was not the right time to introduce an amendment to set up the tribunal.  I do not know of any other except this present time because we are here, we are available, we can give the matter serious consideration and I do not believe we could give the matter any more serious consideration in six month's time.  There is really only one thing lacking and that is that the amendment has not come from the Minister.  The Minister might criticise my amendment &mdash; and I am sure he could point out many points of criticism in it &mdash; and he could criticise <Col N="573" /> the amendment put forward by Senator Robinson but his Department have all the necessary information to bring forward such an amendment now rather than in six months' time.  I am quite sure that is an accurate projection of the position. If the Minister really wanted to put forward an amendment, if he really wanted to upstage my amendment and have it withdrawn, he need only bring forward a simple amendment himself and it would be done automatically.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister should represent to the House that the courts will commence adjudicating on these matters on 26 April.  They will not.  Even if the Bill is signed by the President and comes into operation on 26 April, cases relating to this matter will not be heard by any District Court before the month of September.  That is reality.  First of all, there will be the process of the parties seeking to arrive at an agreement and that will be a fairly protracted business. Parties are not going to decide overnight to refer the matter to the court.</P>
    <P>There is another point with regard to when the courts will decide that the order will take effect and the clearing up of that problem is something we will be considering later on.  It can be assumed that there will be discussions between the landlord and the tenant, that the landlord will approach the tenant, that the tenant will approach his or her legal adviser, that the legal adviser will be in correspondence; they will both get valuers, they will discuss the matter, they will arrive at an agreement or they will fail to arrive at an agreement and that is going to take a matter of months.  Then the matter has to go before the courts.  The court is not going to list it the following day; it will have to take its place with a lot of other things.  The situation might be somewhat different in Dublin if they are going to set up special courts.  The cases might be heard in June or July, but in districts other than Dublin there is no way that the cases will get as far as the District Courts before the month of September.</P>
    <P>Therefore there is plenty of time for the Minister to recruit the chairman suggested in subsection (2) of my amendment. <Col N="574" /> There is plenty of time for him to recruit the five vice-chairmen and to appoint the 12 to 15 ordinary members, to bring them together and talk to them and get them to discuss among themselves the criteria which they are going to use.  There is plenty of time between that and the time they will actually be called upon to hear their first case.  What we are trying to do before 26 April is to make sure that there is not a legal gap between the expiration of one piece of legislation and the commencement of another which would allow landlords to get unjustified or exorbitant increases during that period of time, or to have tenants put out on the side of the road because of that problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite right in saying this if he is going to introduce this provision before the summer recess &mdash; there is no guarantee it will be passed before the summer recess &mdash; the actual tribunal would not come into operation until September or October, so there would be a necessity in those circumstances on the proposal of the Minister to have it temporarily referred to the District Court.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe, even with the best will in the world &mdash; and I know the Minister is 100 per cent honest in this &mdash; that established temporary district justices in Dublin are going to be unestablished after a period of two months work in this area and new people are going to be trained to take up the adjudications under the Act next September or October. It is quite obvious that if the District Court is operating and gathering expertise, the Minister will have an enabling measure in the Bill which will enable him to bring the Bill into operation as and when he thinks fit.  Even the Bill that would be introduced in July need not necessarily come into operation when it is passed and that is what I feel would happen.  If we establish temporary district justices in Dublin and if they get expertise, then they will not be easily disestablished. On the other hand, if we impose the load on the district justices throughout the rest of the country then it will be September or October before they deal with these cases.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister has not thought this matter through completely but the <Col N="575" /> establishment of a tribunal would still give him some period to recruit the necessary personnel, to make arrangements for the housing of the tribunal in the Dublin area and to make arrangements for places to visit and to sit outside Dublin.  The Minister should understand that he has plenty of time to make the tribunal operational and for that reason the amendments before the House are worthwhile.  I think the Minister should consider it carefully for a few days and put down his own amendments.  That is really the solution to the problem and honour is satisfied all around if the Minister does that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I had asked the Minister to clarify what he meant when he used the word &ldquo;fair&rdquo; in relation both to fair rents and to a fair rents tribunal and his answer to a considerable extent crystallises a great deal of the problem behind the fact that this is the fifth attempt to introduce legislation in this House to pick up the pieces of the situation following the Supreme Court judgment in June 1981.  As I understand him &mdash; and I do not want to say anything that is not paraphrasing what he said &mdash; he said that he used the word &ldquo;fair&rdquo; because he meant it in the context of the fair rents tribunal legislation in the UK, which is in existence for a considerable time and under which the rents fixed by the fair rents tribunal, bearing in mind all the social criteria and the matters that should be borne in mind, is, as he estimated, approximately 20 per cent below the market rent.  It is very interesting that in the context of a written Constitution which proclaims and protects the rights of the individual, which affirms that the courts are there to protect the individual, the Minister is of the view that we could not have a fair rent or a fair rents tribunal in that particular context in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes we refer to the British constitutional tradition as being less protective than ours because we have a written Constitution that protects the rights of people.  This appears to be an example, if the Minister is correct and I am sure he <Col N="576" /> has been advised on this, where the absence of a Constitution means that the Parliament at Westminster can establish fair rent tribunals which adjudicate on rents and which come up with rents which are below the market rent for very understandable and very proper social criteria and social priorities.  Is the Minister then saying that we cannot have a fair rents tribunal in Ireland because of the decision of the Supreme Court in one or other or both of the cases?  Is he saying that we cannot have a fair rent in the sense of a rent that is to any extent and to any percentage below the market rent?  If he is saying this, what is the difference between a just and proper rent, which is the language used in section 13 of this Bill that we will come to at a later stage on Committee, and a market rent?  Can he estimate whether the just and proper rent will be above the market rent, will it be equal to the market rent or will it be marginally below the market rent?</P>
    <P>I think these are issues that are of very real importance.  They reflect back to the principles we are discussing, to the role of the Legislature.  It is something we must ponder on, if it is correct, as the Minister appears to have informed the Houses, that because of the Supreme Court's decisions in these cases we cannot apparently have a fair rents tribunal in Ireland in the sense of a fair rents tribunal which can fix rents at a percentage below the market rent.  If I am wrong in interpreting what the Minister has said, I would be certainly pleased to give him an opportunity to clarify what he said.  It appears to be his interpretation that we cannot have a fair rent and a fair rents tribunal and that may be something which may have to come back to us in a legislative sense.  This time we may have to bite the bullet and decide that we do perhaps need an amendment of the Constitution itself if that is the advice that he has received on the outcome of the litigation. The Labour Party have always wished to have not only a tribunal that is accessible and less intimidating than a court but also as a social policy the possibility of fixing rents, bearing in mind social circumstances which would be to some degree below the market rent.  It is <Col N="577" /> fair rents in that sense that the Labour Party are pressing for.  It is important that this issue be clarified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister may feel that progress on Committee Stage is not going as fast as he would wish but the point that I raised, and on which I must press the Minister and hope he will respond, is directly relevant to the amendment that I have put forward.  This amendment is seeking to substitute a fair rents tribunal for the District Court.  Initially the Minister used an argument about time and about a promise to do this before the summer break.  He is now saying that in any case we cannot have a fair rents tribunal in Ireland because we could not have a tribunal which would fix a rent below the market rent.  He referred to the fair rents tribunals which have <Col N="578" /> existed in the UK for a considerable time and he pointed to the fact that the fair rents tribunals there fix rents at, it is estimated, approximately 20 per cent below the market rent.  It is crucial to my understanding of why this amendment is not acceptable and, therefore, crucial to this amendment for the Minister to explain what he meant when he said that you could not have fair rent tribunals in Ireland.  He specifically criticised the title of the tribunal which is the subject of this amendment.  He has not answered me on this point and I think I am entitled to a very clear explanation of why the Minister has said this and why the very name of the tribunal that I am putting forward in this amendment would not be acceptable itself.  The Government do not feel able to accept a proposal for a fair rents tribunal because following the judgments of the Supreme Court we apparently cannot have a fair rents tribunal.  It is of the utmost importance to clarify this, not at the later stage when we are talking about fixing the rent but at this stage when we are talking about an amendment calling a tribunal by a particular name.  I must ask the Minister to have patience with my concern in this matter and, as he has done I think very courteously and very liberally so far in this debate, to take the time to explain why the amendment calling a tribunal a fair rents tribunal would not be acceptable on that ground alone, on the ground of the title.  This is an extremely important point.</P>

      <P>I did not say that it would not be acceptable on the basis of just the title alone.  What I said was that there are two amendments: one is for a private rented dwellings tribunal, another is for a fair rent tribunal.  All I am talking about are titles.  I have given to the Senator and to the other Senators who have spoken, a commitment which was not there in December last when the Senator herself made a contribution.  She has referred to me as being forthcoming and gracious.  I do not see I am getting it back from the far side, but I do not expect a return.  If I could remind the Senator of what she said at the time that this legislation <Col N="579" /> went through last December, that it was reasonable at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I cannot go any further than that.  I have appealed to Senators for an understanding approach to it in the best interests of the tenants and landlords involved &mdash; that the type of tribunal we want to set up is the best tribunal possible, that it should not be done by regulation but should be done by legislation.  I honestly believe that I can go no further.  I honestly believe also that I am not going to satisfy the two Senators involved.  No matter what arguments I put up what I say will not satisfy the Senators.  If there is to be a division, let there be a division but for God's sake let Senators be sure they realise that the elected Members of Dáil Éireann, the Deputies elected by the people on 18 February last, discussed this issue in the Dáil last week and came to their conclusions with regard to the amendments down there.  Surely the elected Members of 18 February have a mandate and are entitled to expect some consideration on that issue.</P>

It is very clear to anybody who has been listening to this debate that there are serious problems in this legislation. As I said, we are trying, as far as possible, to avoid difficulties.  If we can succeed &mdash; the Minister, the administration and both sides of the House &mdash; in producing legislation which is workable, will not be challenged in the courts and will not cause all sorts of difficulties of interpretation when it gets to whatever forum it will be executed in, then we will have done a good day's work.  But if we rush through this legislation, as there is good reason to believe the other House did, we will only create nine times as much work for ourselves and for our seccessors. The Minister referred to two Senators but there are more than two Senators who are concerned about this and we are anxious to get a decision and proper legislation on this matter.</P>

      <P>I, too, deprecate any suggestion that this House is being obstructive, or that it is less conscious of its obligations in considering very sensitive and important legislation than the other House.  I am concerned about the argument of District Courts <i>versus</i> tribunals. I accept the Minister's commitment but I am a bit worried as to the volume of business that will descend on District Courts in the interim.  From what Senator O'Leary said, it seems that there will not be any interim, that it will be the Autumn before the courts come to consider any cases or before the Minister's proposed tribunal will be set up and functioning under legislation.  If there will not be any substantial time gap, what is the point in the amendments before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. S. O'Leary Mr. S. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reasonable point which I knew, when I mentioned it, would give rise to this type of discussion. It will take some months before the volume of work will come before the District Court.  There is no point in pretending it will come before the District Court in May because that will not happen.  The Minister's commitment, as far as I understand <Col N="581" /> it, is to introduce legislation in the Oireachtas during the coming session; it is not a commitment that the legislation will actually pass during that session. When the Minister introduces this legislation it will probably include many other things &mdash; rent tribunal type operations over and above the simple small section of the market with which we are concerned here today.  I can understand that the Minister's proposal, even with the best will in the world, might not necessarily reach the Statute Book before the autumn.  In the case of the Dáil and Seanad that means October or November, and the District Courts resume work in September.  This means there will be a period when the District Courts will be called on to do the work.</P>

      <P>I do not know how substantial it will be, but there will be a period during which they will be called upon to do a certain amount of work.</P>
      <P>There is a tradition in this House that we do not refer to the other House in a derogatory fashion or to the Members of the other House or their functions or duties under the Constitution.  Similarly, I would expect that a Minister, appointed by the other House and coming in here, would recognise that, within the limitations set out in the Constitution, we are a House of the Oireachtas and make our decisions on the basis of what we think is right, not on the basis of whether we think the legislation will ultimately be carried by the other House.  We may if we want, in our individual capacity, take that into account, but in my opinion that is not a proper matter for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am upset that the Minister should see fit to draw a distinction between the legislative authority under the Constitution of the elected Members of the Dáil and the Members of the Seanad, no matter how they come to be in Seanad Éireann. We are all Members of Houses of the Oireachtas, deriving our power and authority under the Constitution, adopted and enacted by the people.  We all have a democratic base.  It is most <Col N="582" /> unfortunate that the difference between the Houses should have been mentioned because we are as entitled to our considerations as the other House.  As the Minister quite rightly said, this matter was pushed to a division in the other House. It is not up to me to speculate why the other House voted the way it did, but I have reason to think that in a repeat situation the vote might not be exactly the same.</P>

      <P>If it is any consolation to the Minister I anticipate this will be my last intervention on this amendment. I feel it necessary to make it clear that the Minister introduced a particular problem by stating that it would not be possible to call the tribunal a fair rents tribunal &mdash; that is what it is called in this amendment &mdash; because it would not be able to do the same as in the United Kingdom where fair rents tribunals fix fair rents, that is, approximately 20 per cent below the market rent.  It may be very irritating for a Minister to have to spend time discussing points in detail, but it may be of very real interest to Threshold, the Private Tenants' Association and others to know that we cannot have fair rents in this country, that we cannot have, in that sense, rents which are below the market rent and that we cannot have a fair rents tribunal.  We are not just talking about titles.  I believe the Minister's last intervention dodged the issue.  He sought not to answer the very awkward question why he is advised and has reached the conclusion that we cannot have, in that sense, a fair rents tribunal and the fixing of fair rents under our Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of any explanation from the Minister as to why it is not possible to call the tribunal the Fair Rents Tribunal, and since it is clear that the Minister is not going to give an explantion this evening, I have no alternative but to press the amendment.  I believe we need a fair rents tribunal.  This has been a part of Labour policy for a number of years and is what most people, when talking about a tribunal, have in mind.  If the Minister will not explain at greater length and if he says we can debate this issue <Col N="583" /> when we come to section 13, then I will await that stage.  In the circumstances I cannot act reasonably and I suggest that I bring an amendment on Report Stage changing the name of the tribunal since I do not know, and the Minister has singularly failed to develop this point, why he would find the title &ldquo;Fair Rents Tribunal&rdquo; unacceptable.</P>

      <P>I would like clarification of the word &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; on page 4. Landlord is defined as meaning &ldquo;the person for the time being entitled to receive (otherwise than as agent for another person) the rent payable in respect of a dwelling&rdquo;.  It will be very important, for the subsequent provisions in relation to <Col N="584" /> the obligation to register the whole provisions in relation to safety and standards to which the Minister has already referred, and liability, that &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; be very clearly and fully defined because we are not always dealing with a person.  I say that knowing that &ldquo;person&rdquo; can and in this context may very well include a limited company.  Nevertheless, since the word &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; is being used in the context of pinning the accountable person, since we are not necessarily meeting the point simply by having the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; mean what it means under the Interpretation Act in the normal context of a person meaning a natural or legal person, we may want &ldquo;person&rdquo; in the form of a landlord to mean something more specific in the definition section because of the responsibilities being placed on landlords and the standards and regulations which the Minister will make.  The Minister has very wide powers to make those regulations.  Is the Minister fully satisfied that the definition of &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; will cover every eventuality in which the matter would arise?</P>

      <P>Does &ldquo;the court&rdquo; mean the District Court?  On the actual mechanism by which the District Court will be brought into this, could the Minister explain whether regulations are going to be made to enable the District Court to operate quickly in this regard? I am aware, in regard to the District Court, that in the past regulations had not been made which meant that the District Court had been unable to act even though they had statutory authority in the area and statutory responsibility.  You give a duty to the District Court and <Col N="585" /> unless you set in motion at the same time a process by which the court can put that duty into operation, the court is put in the position of not being able to do anthing.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like some explanation of the precise terms of this section because it appears to be quite a significant departure from the normal service of legal documents on persons.  It seems to equate a regulation made by the Minister with any legal document notice <Col N="586" /> or claim under the Act.  Perhaps there are examples of this but I cannot recall at the moment any other areas where this had happened.  It seems to depart from some of the existing rules in relation to service and the proof of service through an affidavit of service and provisions for substituted service.  To impose a new system could give rise to certain problems. For example, section 4 (1) provides that a notice or claim under this Bill or any regulations made thereunder &mdash; in other words, ministerial regulations, or statutory instruments &mdash; to be given or to be served on a person should be addressed to him and should be given to him or served to him in one of the following ways and so on.  Where it is addressed to him by name it should be delivered to him.  We ought to understand precisely what is meant by delivering it to him in this context.  Under (b) &mdash; by leaving it at the address at which he ordinarily resides or in a case at which an address for service is being furnished at that address &mdash; this appears to be some departure from the standards in relation to service which may apply in relation to legal proceedings, for example, the service of a notice to quit under present law.  Some of these notices would have parallel significance in regard to it.  The third possible alternative is sending it by post in a prepaid registered letter at the address at which the person ordinarily resides or, if the address has been furnished, to that address.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to explain why a decision was taken in this Bill to put on the same level as the legal notices and claims under this Bill ministerial regulations which are normally available to the Stationery Office or which a person, a lawyer, perhaps, might acquire.  Likewise, if Threshold wants to get hold of ministerial regulations or if individual landlords or tenants want to get them, they can obtain them from the Stationery Office or from the relevant Department or whatever.  This seems to be a departure from the pre-existing position and perhaps the Minister could explain what the background to that was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of the service of the notice under the regulation <Col N="587" /> and not the regulations themselves. This is the format used here.  It is the same as the Planning Acts and the landlord and tenant legislation.  So far as we are concerned in relation to the difficulties that might be envisaged with regard to finding the address, there is obviously no difficulty in finding the tenant because you know his address.  There will be no problem in finding the landlord because for the first time ever we will have a register of the landlords.  Before they can increase or set a rent they will have to register in the local authority offices.</P>
