      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House why we have not met for the last three weeks.  I know there has been a certain clog of legislation coming to the Seanad but there are at least nine motions in the names of Members of this House for debate.  I think it shows a certain contempt for the Members of <Col N="168" /> this House that we have not sat for the last three weeks, if only simply to debate these motions.  If the Leader of the House remembers, during the last session of the Seanad we sat for three days to debate a single motion put down by the Government on the constitutional crusade, which was certainly the best debate I have heard in this House.  I gather that last week we did not meet because the Grand Duke of Luxembourg had to have a drink in the ante-room here, which I do not think was a particularly good reason for not meeting.  There are motions on Seanad reform, on extradition, which is one I want to debate, on land and on many other matters and there is no excuse for the Seanad not meeting just because there is no legislation.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, it has worked out that so far in this session of the Seanad &mdash; we were elected on 21 April &mdash; we have been paid about £500 per day.  I would like to know what the plans are for meeting in the near future, whether we intend to sit once a week, or whether we will suddenly have a rush of legislation for debate, to the exclusion of motions, and what the actual legislative plan is before the summer recess.  How much legislation do we intend to get through?</P>

      <P>With regard to what Senator Ross has said, I think we would serve the image of politicians far better by working than by turning up every week to do various constituency work, as many of my colleagues do.  I would like to associate myself strongly with what Senator Ross has said.  I am getting fed up having to defend politicians, particularly to young people, against the charge that they are in politics for their own good, that they are all cynical and that they have no over-riding concern other than their own welfare.  If this House continues to be run in the way that it is being run, which is with a singular lack of regard for the fact that it is the second Chamber of the Oireachtas, then I will come to the view that most of the young people that I know express, which is that we should close the place down altogether and stop pretending that we are part of the Legislature because we are not. <Col N="169" /> We are a rump that meets when we have to and otherwise we serve no purpose.  If that is going to be the way then let us get rid of it and stop pretending that we have a second Chamber which serves a purpose.</P>

      <P>I support what has been said by my colleagues, Senator Ross and Senator Ryan.  Since I came into this House five years ago I have been making the same points, expressing the same complaints about the extraordinary arbitrary manner in which the Seanad is convened at irregular intervals and the failure to discuss substantial order of business.  I thank Senator Ross for reviving my flagging enthusiasm and for once again hoping that hope will triumph over experience.  I can anticipate one of the answers that the Leader of the House will give.  He will say that there is insufficient Government business to warrant the meeting of the Seanad.  There was at least one piece of legislation completed by the Dáil which would in itself have given us the authentic pretext for meeting earlier than this.</P>

      <P>I would like to associate myself with the remarks which have been made and I would like the assurance of the Leader of the House that we will not find ourselves in a situation, maybe next month or at the very end of next month, in which we are suddenly faced with a great flood of legislation from the other House and then have to face the dilemma of either giving it a perfunctory glance and ramming it through as fast as we can or of sitting endlessly into the dog days of summer.  I hope the Leader of the House can give a guarantee that as legislation becomes available from the Dáil we will be given a chance to consider it in a proper and detailed fashion and that we will not have to rush it.</P>

      <P>As a member of a political party I, too, feel that the motions put down by some of the speakers merit attention, are certainly worthy of debate and will merit a great deal of national coverage because they bring up very important subjects.  I, too, would like to know exactly where we stand in relation to future sittings of the House and, if possible, to have the programme outlined as far as the recess in as much as the Leader of the House is permitted to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason we did not sit last week was simply that we did not have any Government business.  It has nothing to do with the visit of the Grand Duke.  In general terms, it has not been the practice of the Seanad, going back for many, many years, to sit specially for a motion.  It in only called together for Government business and when it is called together for Government business a motion can then be taken.  That is not sacrosanct.  If the House believes that that practice should be changed then it is a matter initially for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which I hope will be set up today.  That can be discussed and the House can decide, perhaps, that that practice should not be adhered to.  There have been exceptions to the rule but, generally speaking, the House has never been called together especially for a motion and, consequently, it would not have been in order, certainly it would not have been in accordance with that practice, to have called the House together to debate some of the motions that are on the Order Paper.  I am not in a position to say when it is proposed to set up the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies but I will let the House know as soon as possible. If it reaches us from the Dáil of course we will deal with it immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say how much I welcome the introduction of item No. 4.  It is just too bad that at a time when the European Community has been experiencing so much difficulty that our Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation has been inoperative for almost a year now.  I hope that this task will be entered into with vigour so that an examination of the very many problems that affect our situation <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Community will be embarked upon with the least possible delay.  There is no doubt that the administration of the Community, as far as we are concerned, requires close scrutiny, even if it is only to try to keep abreast of the many and costly <Col N="176" /> frauds that are operating, especially in certain sections of the CAP and also in regard to such matters as the annual price review which have been slowed up.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we did not have an opportunity through the joint committee of giving our Ministers the value of the views of the representatives here who appreciated the problems of people who have been deprived of benefits as provided for them through the Treaty of Rome and various directives and regulations. I welcome the passing of this motion.  I hope we will have the appointments to the joint committee made next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the setting up of this committee and join with Senator McDonald in regretting that it has not been working for such a long time.  It is particularly important that we should have such a working, strong active committee for two reasons.  Very often, because we are physically divided from the mainland of Europe and because such emphasis has been put on the economic role of the European Community, we either forget, do not know or ingore the very important social role that legislation has played on the whole dimension of the European Community and particularly as it affects Ireland.  I welcome such legislation in so far as the Irish electorate should be made aware not alone of the legislation but the implications of such legislation.  The more detailed the discussions, the more active and positive our role is within this committee, then the greater will be our communication with the electorate.  A special effort has to be made regarding Ireland because, not alone are we physically divided from the mainland but very often we are separated from the mainstream of European thinking. However, I cannot stress enough the importance of such a committee and the need for positive discussion and, then, with the help of the media, we can communicate our ideas to the electorate in general.</P>

      <P>I wish to apologise for the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I share the <Col N="177" /> views expressed by Senators.  I feel very strongly that Irish thinking should be injected into legislation before it is enacted and that way we can influence it. Senators will be aware that steps involving the reconstitution of the joint committee are somewhat complex and cumbersome. It proved impossible to finalise the necessary procedures in time for the committee to meet during the lifetime of the last Seanad.  The Government are very conscious of the crucial importance of monitoring developments in Community affairs in a structural and effective manner.  We must rely on the co-operation of both Houses and all parties.  This has been the hallmark of the committee's work up to now and we are going to move with all possible speed to reconstitute the joint committee at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is because of our involvement with a particular Church that we have such an attachment to symbols and symbolism.  We talk at great length about development and developing countries and this committee is obviously an admirable and noble idea. However, I would like to speak technically against the proposal because it will serve no purpose and do nothing because we are part of the wealthy bloc of powerful countries who express platitudes about development.  In fact, there are no developing countries outside the Western bloc.  Most of them are going rapidly <Col N="180" /> backwards and it is a misnomer to describe them as developing.  They are not developing; relatively speaking they are getting worse and in some cases, in absolute terms, are getting worse.</P>
      <P>In addition, we talk about our concern for them.  In fact, we are part of the western and northern bloc of powerful countries and our major exports to those countries are arms.  If we were to live without the arms that the western world exports to these so-called developing countries, we would be more impoverished ourselves.  Apparently it is possible to export arms but not food.  These countries were ripped off of their resources, land and so on.  We still keep them in semi-colonial bondage, we are associated with it and gestures of neutrality here and there cannot separate us from that fact: we are part of the bloc which exploits most, if not all, of the Third World countries, whether we like it or not.  Notwithstanding occasional fine and noble sentiments to the contrary, we are recognised as such.  We are recognised as being part of the powerful, rich and wealthy section of the world which makes any concession grudgingly, always puts its own interests first, makes no real effort to understand the problems, attempts to impose political systems which are of our making, tries to sustain political systems which support our particular world view and make no effort whatever to contribute to real development and change.  We attach conditions to our aid which will benefit ourselves more than other people.  We then suggest that concern about political structures is not really part of our overall objectives.</P>
      <P>I would like to say this is a fine and noble motion but, in the context of Ireland's record, our overall identification of foreign affairs strategy and the record of the blocs with which we are associated, including the European Community, it is meaningless and pointless. We are still part of what is effectively an exploiting powerful group living off the poor and the wretched in two-thirds if not three-quarters of this world.</P>

I believe that this joint committee is necessary at this time in this materialistic age.  If we are to make any contribution to, or take any stand on the problems that beset, the Third World and the developing countries then at least it must surely be possible to have a vehicle, an organisation, a committee, a forum, call it what you like, in which our own legislators, the two Houses of the Oireachtas will have the opportunity, first hand, of becoming aware of the problems and perhaps meeting the representatives of the people involved and of seeing more closely the gigantic problem that faces anybody who is interested in paying more than lip service to the Third World, to the North-South dialogue, or whatever we want to call it.</P>
      <P>I believe that the joint committee as proposed will play a very important role in creating here in the Oireachtas, and through the Oireachtas in the people of Ireland, an awareness of our Christian responsibilities, of our economic responsibilities to bring about a greater shareout of the world's wealth.  During the years I had the honour of serving with the present Minister for Defence on the Joint Committee of the European Parliament, the Assembly of the ACP, we had the opportunity of meeting and having discussions with the representatives of some 52 developing countries in Africa and South America.  It is only through those contacts that we can appreciate the problem that is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also believe that the public should have an opportunity of seeing and appreciating the tremendous amount of work, progress and contribution made through our Department of Foreign Affairs, through the non-governmental agencies and through the church and other voluntary organisations that have been working quietly and consistently over many decades.  When one reads the Brandt Report, on which we had a very interesting debate here a few months ago, one appreciates the problem that exists. I have been interested in this particular aspect of development for a considerable time and during the lifetime of the second last Seanad we succeeded in having an <i>ad <Col N="182" /> hoc</i> committee on which a number of Senators from both sides of the House got together unofficially and had many discussions with members of the diplomatic service accredited to Dublin.  Many interested persons who were passing through Dublin came to speak with us at lunchtime or when we could fit them in.</P>
    <P>There is a problem here because there is a gap to be filled.  I feel very proud of the many highly trained young people who give very generously of their time and who go out and work in these countries with non-governmental services or through the development agencies.  The unfortunate thing is that there is no appreciation of their efforts.  If a teacher gives two years' service in developing countries it is not recorded or taken into account when the teacher is applying for a job on his or her return.  We need to create an awareness of this.  There must be recognition of people who are so generous with their lives and their time and who make such a contribution.  I know there are some agencies set up to assist these people but, nevertheless, it is not unusual to find that doctors, teachers and nurses, who have done two or three years in helping with the development of some of those nations, can be months before they finally settle back into a job when they return to our country.  There is a great deal of work to be done by this joint committee.  They should be able to underline the tremendous contribution that the State makes, even though it has not yet reached the United Nations target for our direct contribution.  Nevertheless, it is important that this work should be highlighted, that there should be pressure on the Houses of the Oireachtas and on the Minister for Finance of the day to ensure that our national contribution should be kept abreast of the target and that we, as a supposedly Christian country, should be able to give almost a lead in the kind of work that needs to be done if there is to be any kind of fair play in the world, and if the hope and trust of those people in the developing nations are to be maintained.  I welcome the setting up of this committee.  I wish its members well and I hope they will be able to <Col N="183" /> underline the tremendous work that is at present being and has been carried on, especially by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the establishment of the committee.  It is interesting to note that the concept or the idea for the setting up of the committee began during a meeting organised by some of my colleagues with representatives of the various agencies concerned with Third World development some years ago.  The idea was then picked up by the Minister of State in the last administration and has now come to fruition.  It is beneficial and good.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a number of points briefly.  Of particular regret to me is that the present Government have not seen fit to continue the post of Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for development co-operation.  That is a retrograde step and we are already beginning to see the results of it.  It was noticeable, in the couple of debates that have taken place in the other House on development aid, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was not in attendance and it is noticeable that he is not in attendance today.  I do not suggest for a moment that that is a matter over which he has any control.  I am sure he has other important work to do, but it is regrettable that the post of Minister of State in this area has not been maintained. I hope the Taoiseach may reconsider this matter when he comes to fill the remaining five posts at that level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also to suggest to the Minister &mdash; perhaps he would convey the idea to the Government if he thinks there is merit in it &mdash; that in the context of the proposed economic plan which I understand we are to have in a matter of months it should be possible to contain within that plan some concept of a time schedule for reaching the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP to be devoted to aid. If we are to have a plan which is concerned with various projections into the future, it seems to be sensible that we incorporate within that plan a target of this kind on a matter of such fundamental <Col N="184" /> importance about which there is widespread agreement in our society.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to ask the Minister &mdash; perhaps he may not be in a position to answer today but perhaps the Minister for Foreign Affairs at some other time may be able to do so &mdash; whether it is the Government's intention to have a White Paper on development co-operation which was in the course of preparation prior to the last general election? The concept of having a White Paper on this subject was welcomed widely, not only among agencies concerned with Third World problems but also among political groupings generally in the Oireachtas.  I hope that though we no longer have a Minister of State with responsibility in this area, the Government will see fit to re-open the files and to continue the work of producing this White Paper so that we will have, at the end of the day, some coherent picture of what it is we are trying to do in relation to Third World development and co-operation.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest, and perhaps this is a matter which the committee might take up in more detail, that we need to look at the proportions of aid devoted as between multilateral aid and bilateral aid.  The proportions at the moment are that 70 per cent of Irish aid goes through multilateral agencies and that only 30 per cent goes through bilateral programmes. Those proportions are wrong and although I would not suggest what the correct proportions should be, there is a need to increase the proportion of aid which goes through bilateral programmes because these seem to have the most beneficial effects in the beneficiary countries and I suspect that they go more rapidly to the people who most need the support they offer.</P>
    <P>Without in the least meaning to introduce a sense of acrimony into the proceedings, I would like to dissociate myself from some remarks made last week in relation to the operations of Trócaire.  I do so because while I have a great deal of respect for the intellectual integrity of the person who made the comments it is important since we are debating the matter that we in the Seanad make it clear <Col N="185" /> that we do not believe that the aid programme operated by Trócaire should be concerned primarily with food-aid to the detriment of socio-economic development or indeed consciousness-raising. The programmes undertaken by Trócaire, in so far as I am cognisant of them, provide a reasonable balance as between direct food-aid programmes and general development programmes.  It is not appropriate that we should think of our aid or co-operation with the Third World simply in terms of dealing with primary hunger.  Our primary responsibility is to assist in the development of those economies through the kinds of programmes that Trócaire are engaged in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">

      <P>I support the proposal and in doing so I would like to echo Senator O'Mahony's regret that the Government have not so far seen fit to appoint a Minister of State with special responsibility for developing countries.  If nothing else, the appointment of such a Minister in the last Government focused public attention on the importance of the subject and established a personal link between Ireland and the developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan's remarks were rather negative and dismissive.  I would support Senator McDonald's views that this is a resolution eminently worthy of support. I can see something in Senator Ryan's point, however, and I suggest that the members of the committee when they begin their work should keep two points in mind which might help to throw a different light on the problem and establish a different perspective.  One point they might keep in mind is that the term &ldquo;developing&rdquo; is perhaps misleading and that the countries which are developing are in their present plight because they have been exploited by the developed countries.  The relationship is an unfortunate reciprocal one, not the condescending paternalistic one that we think of when we look at the terms of the motion, that these are countries which through some innate backwardness are not as well developed as we are and we should help them along.  The members of <Col N="186" /> the committee would be well advised not to think of the problem along those lines but rather to consider that the developing countries are backward precisely because they have been exploited largely by the Community of which we are a member.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the second point which the committee might keep in mind, namely, that Ireland itself is in a sense a developing country, so that we should have a special <i>rapport</i> with the countries which are described in this resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to those who have welcomed the establishment of this committee.  One, indeed, has a sense of <i>déja vu</i> about the whole exercise because it seems such a little while ago since we gladly welcomed the establishment of this committee which, sadly, never got off the ground due to a whole range of circumstances of which we are all only too aware.</P>
      <P>Much of what I should like to say has been said by others, but I should like to repeat what I said while speaking on the International Fund for Commodities Bill &mdash; that I deplore the fact that there will not be a Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for development aid.  The last Minister of State with this responsibility shone at his task.  He injected an enthusiasm and a verve for the role and succeeded in proclaiming to the nation the importance of this function.  Since the last meeting of the Seanad, when we debated items of development aid, it was stated over and over again in relation to development co-operation and development aid that the plight of the people in the Third World is the second most important crisis facing the global community. The very least we could do is to appoint a Minister of State with special responsibilities for this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed with Senator Ryan's remarks.  I do not wish to be contentious, but I find them somewhat despairing and extremely dismissive of the whole notion of this committee.  I can understand how one can feel that no good is achieved by the establishment of committees of this nature, but this is an unnecessarily negative attitude to adopt. <Col N="187" /> I should like to refer to Waterford city and county where there is an active person-to-person Third World development programme in operation.  It started four or five years ago when the city and county of Waterford formed a relationship with the Kitui area of Kenya.  The people working in factories in Waterford make a monthly contribution from their wage packets to this concern.  Children from the schools in Waterford correspond with children in Kitui.  Factory workers, farmers and people right across the range of social and economic activity in Waterford are in contact with counterparts in Kitui.  The awareness of Third World development is higher in Waterford than in any other place in Ireland and there will be a great deal of interest in the Waterford region in the working of this committee.</P>
    <P>I should also like to dissociate myself from some remarks made by one of my colleagues.  I have respect for his intellectual integrity, but I feel that Trócaire is a development agency and not a relief agency.  This has been well and truly established and the public are supportive of the work of Trócaire and of all the development agencies.</P>
    <P>To get back to the appointment of the Minister of State at the Department, I would call on Trócaire, Concern, APSO, Comhlámh and all other agencies involved to make their voices heard and call for the establishment of such a Minister. I welcome the setting up of this committee, I wish it well in its work and deliberations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I associate myself with the remarks of Senator McDonald in the praise he gave to the various private and voluntary organisations, particularly those established and encouraged by the Churches, which are involved in the process of development.  They have made their objectives and methods very clear in their promotional literature and left nobody in any doubt about the purpose and methods which they use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found, as did some other Senators, that Senator Ryan's remarks were a bit <Col N="188" /> negative.  He said he wanted to make a technical protest against the committee in order to make certain points, but I found it peculiar that he aligned himself, particularly at the end of his remarks, with those public figures and politicians who seem to think that poverty in the world and in this country is a problem of such great magnitude that there is nothing we can do about it &mdash; that we should leave it to a few charitable organisations to make a few donations.</P>
    <P>Basically, this problem can be solved only by the dictum that you do not give a man a fish: you teach him how to fish. That is what development aid is about.  It is also true &mdash; this is why I found Senator Ryan's remarks negative &mdash; that the problem is of such magnitude and is so fundamental in its origins that to think in terms of solving it by means of a few perfunctory and detailed dilettante gestures is quite inadequate.  It is only by structural reforms, by looking at the problem as it is on the ground, that we will eventually deal with it.  I regret that somebody who has placed himself on the side of those who are deprived in our own society, should associate himself with those who think problems of this nature are either of such great magnitude that they should be ignored or that they should be dealt with only in a peripheral fashion.</P>
    <P>I support the calls for the appointment of the Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation.  The point has been well made with regard to the record of the previous Government in this respect, and it is only fair to mention that the Minister who carried out those duties showed his personal commitment to that work by the fact that he was prepared to visit many of the countries to examine and assess the work being done.  I ask the Minister to suggest that the Taoiseach, when he comes to fill those five positions, perhaps we should call them cars, carrots or sticks &mdash; I do not know how you fill a carrot or stick &mdash; which is what these positions are, according to the media, they are no longer constitutional positions but are tied up with the peculiar machinations of some political parties, should consider <Col N="189" /> the interests of the country and of people outside the country, and therefore appoint to one of those positions somebody who might do some work in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in calling on the Taoiseach to appoint a Minister of State, for all the reasons that have been given but also to tie in with what Senator O'Mahony said, that there is evidence in research that has been done regarding aid and development co-operation to the countries who are emerging and developing that what is given through bilateral aid is much more effective than that which is given through multinational aid.  Reference has been made to the great work being done by our organisations working from an Irish dimension. So that there will be control over the aid and the development co-operation we can give, there should be integration of our efforts not alone from a financial point of view but in regard to the technical skills we can contribute.  If the people of Ireland can relate to the people working in those countries and have evidence of the development that such funding is effecting, it makes sense that there will be far more commitment to it than if it is given through multinationals with whom people have no identity, and might never hear of the effects of the efforts. The evidence is that multinationals through their structure are filled with bureaucracy.  Sometimes the channels through which such aid is sent can be open to corruption.  Greater emphasis should be placed on bilateral rather than multinational aid, but co-ordination will be needed to make such bilateral aid effective.</P>

    <P>(1)  That Seanad Éireann concurs with Dáil Éireann in its Resolution communicated to Seanad Éireann on 2 June, 1982, that it is expedient that a Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas (which shall be called the Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries) be established consisting of 11 members of Dáil Éireann and 7 members of Seanad Éireann (none of whom shall be a member of the Government or a Minister of State) to examine:</P>

      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who is at a meeting in Bonn today.  That meeting was only arranged yesterday.  He is meeting the other Foreign Ministers of the member states of the EEC to discuss the situation in Lebanon, and afterwards the Minister will travel to the United States to attend a meeting of the United Nations concerning disarmament.  You will agree that if peace can be achieved in those areas it would be the greatest contribution we could make to developing countries.  I can assure Senators that their comments and questions will be brought to the notice of the Minister on his return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noted Senators' concern for the need for a Minister of State to deal with developing countries.  I can understand their concern because during the period of the last Government there was failure <Col N="192" /> to appoint a Minister from the west of Ireland, which caused concern.  I have noted the remarks of Senator O'Connell who could understand the filling of the car but wondered what you do with a carrot.  I am told the word you use to deal with a carrot is you &ldquo;dangle&rdquo; it, but when it is left dangling for quite a considerable time it loses its allure and ability to accelerate.</P>

      <P>I bow to the Senator's superior knowledge of carrots.  One might accuse him of giving them to an ass.  It was an interesting discussion and I would like to thank those Senators who contributed and who were anxious to help.  Senator Ryan appeared to divide the world into the haves and the have nots and classified Ireland as being among the haves.  He said our record has been poor and continues to be bad.  I cannot accept that, because we have the will to help others.  Ireland's record has been reasonably good and continues to improve.  Sometimes we may think that other countries that have had their wealth based on colonies and now give financial aid to developing countries are merely salving their consciences, but I do not accept that.</P>
      <P>I note what Senator McDonald said. During our term in Europe when we were both there, there was a heart-warming awareness among people of the need to help developing countries.  Ireland has always helped other countries not in financial terms but in human terms which may have been much more effective.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House is the second step in the procedure to establish a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas on Co-operation with Developing Countries. As the terms of the motion indicate, a similar motion of expediency, which is the first step in the procedure, has been approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee will afford Members of <Col N="193" /> both Houses a greater opportunity than has been possible heretofore to consider the whole range of issues in the field of development co-operation.  Up to now the principal occasions on which this has been possible have been the debates on the Vote for International Co-operation which covers many of the headings of our official development assistance.  These occasions, however, do not permit a detailed discussion of the many complex and interrelated issues which fill the development co-operation spectrum. The proposed committee will remedy this imbalance by providing a separate and detached forum for considering these issues.</P>
    <P>The need for this sort of detailed consideration is all the more urgent because of the increasing sums of money being devoted to official development assistance by successive Governments.  In a very short time we have made considerable strides in this area: in 1974 ODA amounted to less than £2 million; this year, the figure will be more than £26 million.  By any standards this is substantial progress and it is appropriate that Members of the Oireachtas should have an opportunity to monitor on a continuous basis the expenditure of these moneys.</P>
    <P>This monitoring of expenditure has become an issue lately.  It has made this committee all the more meaningful. None of us, either on this side of the House or the other, is likely to forget the advice that the angel gave to Séadna: ná déan dearmad ar an trócaire &mdash; do not forget mercy.  Ní dhéanfaimid ar an dtaobh seo nó ar an dtaobh eile dearmad ar an trócaire.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that the committee will also fulfil an indirect role in relation to development education.  Senators on all sides of the House I am sure will agree on the need for effective development education in order to increase among Irish people, interest in and awareness of development problems.  I believe that the proposed joint committee, by giving a focus to the authority and influence of Members of the Oireachtas in this field, will provide a clear lead to public opinion <Col N="194" /> which will stimulate others to follow their interest in this area.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the proposed committee are set out in the motion before the House.  The committee will be empowered to cover all aspects of development co-operation reflecting the variety and diversity of issues involved in this field.</P>
    <P>I hope that Members on all sides of the House will approach this joint committee in a spirit of co-operation and understanding. Our responsibility to the Third World is such that we must devote all our energies to evolving the best possible policies and approaches in this area.  I hope that this committee will make a significant contribution towards this end. There is a great deal of experience and expertise on all sides of this House and in the Dáil which I hope will be applied towards the success of this committee and the area of development co-operation to which it will address itself.</P>

      <P>The present authorised share capital of the B &amp; I Company is £35 million, which is held in its entirety by the Minister for Finance. The main purpose of the Bill is to increase the company's authorised share capital by £25 million and to enable the Minister for Finance to take up this amount in additional shares in the company.  The Bill also provides for an increase of £25 million in the maximum amount of the company's borrowings which can be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>As Senators will no doubt be aware, the B &amp; I Company is encountering severe financial difficulties.  The company recorded losses of £1.1 million in 1979 and £2.8 million in 1980 and, notwithstanding an increase in turnover from £66 million in 1980 to £73 million in 1981, the loss in 1981 jumped to £7.54 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trading conditions in which the B &amp; I has had to operate in recent years have been very difficult, given the depressed environment for tourism, the general economic recession and serious <Col N="196" /> cost inflation.  The B &amp; I's difficulties have been aggravated by a significant increase in borrowings and lease obligations resulting from an expansion of capacity from 1978 onwards.  Severe competition on the Irish Sea, which has forced the B &amp; I to hold down fares, has also seriously undermined the company's financial position.  Industrial disputes both here and in the UK have cost the company a total of £5.9 million in the years 1979 to 1981, inclusive.  In 1981 alone disruptions of one kind or another, many of which were completely outside the company's control, cost the B &amp; I in terms of net loss £2.6 million.</P>
    <P>The Government's reason for purchasing the B &amp; I from private UK interests in 1965 was basically the strategic one of having an Irish presence on the Irish Sea which would at the same time operate on a strictly commercial basis.  Following the take-over the company began an investment programme to replace old ships, introduce multi-purpose car ferries and to mechanise cargo handling facilities and since then the B &amp; I has made a major contribution to the development of modern and efficient transport services between this country and the UK.</P>
    <P>In 1977, the B &amp; I decided on a large-scale investment programme.  This programme was designed to meet the requirements of the company in the light of technological changes and expected growth in trade and tourism.  The total cost to the company of the investment programme, which has since been completed, was approximately £72 million. The main investments were: the replacement of two older car ferries; the introduction of the Jetfoil on the Liverpool route; the termination of the Dublin/Liverpool Load on/Load off service, which was being scaled down since 1975, and the introduction of a Roll on/Roll off service to Fleetwood; and the introduction of a new short-sea service on the Rosslare/Pembroke route.</P>
    <P>The new car ferries, m.v. <i>Connacht</i> and m.v. <i>Leinster</i> were built in Verolme Cork Dockyard at a cost of IR£40 million. The orders for these vessels enabled employment to be maintained at Verolme during a period of very severe <Col N="197" /> world-wide difficulties in the shipbuilding industry from 1971 to 1981, and brought the volume of business given by the B &amp; I to Verolme since 1967 to almost IR£60 million.  It was recognised at the time that, because of subsidies and incentives available to other shipyards, these ships could have been built abroad at significantly lower cost.  The Government, therefore, provided additional share capital to the company, £20 million in all, partially to finance the construction cost of the ships involved.</P>
    <P>A further part of the B &amp; I investment programme was concerned with the development of a short-sea route strategy. This had been a long-standing ambition of the company because of the inherent advantages associated with more intensive asset utilisation and lower unit costs &mdash; a factor which had become even more important with the increase in oil prices in the seventies.</P>
    <P>The introduction in 1980 of the company's short sea route, Rosslare/ Pembroke, involved the B &amp; I in capital development commitments for the construction of a ferry terminal at Pembroke in south Wales.  The introduction of its other short-sea route, Dublin/Holyhead, earlier this year did not involve additional capital expenditure due to a change in Sealink policy regarding the use of its port facilities at Holyhead by other operators.</P>
    <P>The current problems of the B &amp; I are due in large measure to the fact that the increased traffic and revenue budgeted for under the 1977 plan failed to materialise. In this situation the servicing of new debt has become a burden beyond the company's capacity to carry unaided. The company's financial charges increased from £2.6 million in 1979 to £7.6 million in 1981.  At the end of 1981, the company had term loans of the order of £27 million as well as obligations relating to leased assets.  The share capital of £35 million has been eroded by accumulated losses of over £12 million.  Furthermore, the company's cash flow position has deteriorated to the extent that an injection of equity working capital is now urgently required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> The B &amp; I has been pursuing a policy of retrenchment in an effort to reduce costs and improve its trading position. The company's strategy for 1982 is based, <i>inter alia</i>, on a rationalisation of services and is designed to reduce permanently B &amp; I cost structures, maximise the use of operating assets and realise saleable assets to alleviate cash difficulties.  The main features are: the commencement of a daily short-sea service between Dublin/Holyhead in conjunction with a Dublin/Liverpool nightly service; the operation of a forked service from Pembroke, servicing Cork and Rosslare with one ship; the cessation of groupage services in Cork and the sale of surplus assets involved; the termination of the Jetfoil service; the sale of one car ferry, the <i>Munster</i>; the overall reduction of B &amp; I personnel by approximately 200 people; the negotiation of a three months' pay pause; the raising of base revenue for tourism and freight to more economic levels; and the implementation of a cost reduction programme to cover all aspects of B &amp; I's operations.  This rationalisation plan is now being put into action and very good progress is being made.</P>
    <P>The company has terminated the Jetfoil service and is investigating the possibility of a sale or long-term charter.  The Jetfoil operation was conceived as a fast and comfortable passenger operation, linking as it did two major conurbations, Dublin and Liverpool.  It was unfortunate that the introduction of the service coincided with a contraction in passenger demand on the Irish Sea and that the viability of the service could not have been tested in more favourable circumstances. The company has also rationalised its services on the southern corridor and has been servicing the Cork/ Pembroke and the Rosslare/Pembroke routes with one instead of two vessels for some time now.  This move will help the company's finances to the extent that the surplus vessel is available for disposal and that there will be greater utilisation of the vessel on the combined route.</P>
    <P>As regards the reduction in staff, I understand that this has been effected by voluntary retirement and severance <Col N="199" /> schemes.  It is unfortunate that the level of jobs has had to be cut back but the measure is crucial to the overall viability of the company.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the deterioration in the B &amp; I's financial performance and I am glad to note, therefore, the steps which the company is taking to rationalise its operations with a view to achieving economies and improving productivity. I am in full agreement with the B &amp; I board on the need for these economy measures, which should help to improve the B &amp; I's trading results and create a more stable employment environment for the company's employees.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently discussed with the chairman of the B &amp; I the progress which has been made to date towards the implementation of the company's cost reduction measures and the need for further measures.  The chairman advised him that while there has been broad acceptance among employees of the action which is being taken, there are still some difficulties to be surmounted.  It is essential that these difficulties be overcome quickly in the longer-term interests of job security.</P>
    <P>I should mention that a detailed examination of the affairs of the B &amp; I is being carried out under the aegis of my Department.  The examination has revealed that the company cannot continue to operate without immediate assistance from the Exchequer.  In the circumstances, the Government have agreed that the Minister for Finance should take up additional equity in the B &amp; I, not exceeding £8.7 million, during 1982.  This should help to relieve somewhat the heavy burden of financial charges which represent a substantial proportion of the company's overall loss.</P>
    <P>While it will be necessary to disburse a portion of these funds as soon as the legislation has been passed to enable the company to meet its immediate obligations arising from the seasonal downturn in its cash flow, I expect the company to demonstrate to me that satisfactory progress has been made in the rationalisation of its operations before I shall agree to <Col N="200" /> recommend any further disbursements from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill to the House, I am concious of the representations made both to myself and my predecessor by representatives of B &amp; I workers setting out the company's record of good industrial relations and highlighting their participation in the affairs of the company over the years.  I feel sure that the general body of workers in the B &amp; I are as committed as the board of the B &amp; I to restoring the company to profitability as soon as possible.  I expect the company to make substantial strides towards this end in the current year.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the unofficial dispute which had led to the suspension of all B &amp; I services has ended.  Industrial disputes of any kind are not in the long-term interests of either the B &amp; I or its workers, and this latest disturbance was singularly ill-timed both by reference to the company's financial straits and the holiday season on which it is so dependent. I am glad that saner counsels have prevailed and that management and unions were able to arrange a speedy settlement.</P>
    <P>Because of the Government's general concern about the deterioration in the B &amp; I's position, I have arranged that the company's performance will be continuously monitored by my Department during the remainder of 1982 so as to ensure that the Government will be kept fully informed of the progress of the company towards the elimination of losses and a return to profitability.</P>
    <P>I accordingly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>While I agree with the Bill because of the situation within the B &amp; I, I do not fully agree with what the Minister of State said.  It was unfortunate that we had a situation early last week, which was created by the management of B &amp; I, when there were no services from the country.  I accept the marine officers created a situation in which there were stoppages on particular routes, but I fail to understand why the whole company had to close.  I do not accept that this had to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a Bill before us some weeks <Col N="201" /> ago dealing with Irish Shipping.  They are having a ship built in Verolme Dockyard. Compare the two companies: one is going back to shipping and making money out of it and the other is not.  The B &amp; I cannot compete with other companies on the Irish Sea.  The Jetfoil is now lying idle in one of our ports.  Is it possible that it could be used on particular routes during the summer months?  I understand there is a car ship for sale.  Can the B &amp; I tell us how much they are getting for it or is there anybody interested in it or in the Jetfoil?</P>
    <P>B &amp; I are now saying there will be a fork service between Rosslare, Pembroke and Cork.  Some years ago we were asked by B &amp; I to provide facilities for them in the lower harbour of Cork.  Five million pounds was made available by the Government of the day for B &amp; I and £9 million was given by the EEC.  The lower harbour in Cork is now 99 per cent idle. It was opened last Saturday week but unfortunately a French flagship was the first to come in &mdash; there was no sign of the B &amp; I.  They say they need fast services yet some years ago they pulled out of Swansea and went to Pembroke. When they were going to Swansea there was an all year round service.  It was always a busy one.  They now go to Pembroke. They said it would be a shorter journey.  A sum of £14 million was put into the lower harbour and now they do not want to use it.  That is a fact.  They refuse to go in there.  Now the management of the B &amp; I are looking for extra money.</P>
    <P>We all know that the management of B &amp; I are not capable of managing shipping. Between 1979 and 1981 they went from a deficit situation of £2.8 million to £7.5 million.  That is a lot of money.  I readily admit that there were times when trade was bad.  Let us compare ourselves with foreign shipping companies.  I fail to understand how the B &amp; I can ask for money.  Last week, coming up to one of our busiest periods, we had a situation where we were trying to get people to come to this country &mdash; a few weeks beforehand we said we did not want them and started talking about a place 8,000 miles away but then we tried to get them <Col N="202" /> back.  Suddenly, the management said they would close the whole of B &amp; I because there was a problem in one particular area.  That is bad management. How can they ask for an extra £25 million and look for more at the end of the year?</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I will not go into the lower harbour in Cork.  As a Cork Senator I know that we spent £14 million providing facilities in the lower harbour of Cork specially for B &amp; I and they will not use it.  Do people realise we spent £14 million on a massive complex and now B &amp; I are not going to use it?  The French use it once a week.  We are the laughing stock of Europe.  Yet B &amp; I are seeking an extra £25 million.  I do not see how they can get away with it and the Minister knows that they should not be allowed to do so. Between 1971 and 1981, £40 million was spent on building ferryboats in the Cork area.  I do not deny that.  I thank the Government for it.  We were not in a recession in 1971, 1973, 1977 or 1979 and yet the B &amp; I lost money.  There is very bad management in the company.  It is very unfair.  Why has this situation come about?  In the Cork area, the busiest part of the B &amp; I business now is the duty-free shops.  Is it not a fact that only for the duty-free shops on the boats the B &amp; I would be losing more money?  We have a situation where another State company, CIE, use foreign transport to bring people from this country to cities in Great Britain.  Why can the B &amp; I not carry CIE buses?  Why do we use foreign shipping? I fail to understand it.  Is it possible that we cannot do a deal with CIE?  It is a moral crime to say that a State company uses a foreign company and we do nothing about it.  Yet, we will give B &amp; I £25 million, no problem.  I do not say that we should not have our own shipping company. However, we should compare Irish Shipping and the B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>Relations between management and workers in B &amp; I are quite good but had we not a situation where the management &mdash; I put the total blame on management &mdash; of B &amp; I last week could have lost millions of pounds?  We know that tourism is our second biggest industry and is very important to us.  The B &amp; I say they are not prepared to use the lower harbour <Col N="203" /> and are cutting back on services in the south-west area, which is very unfair.  Yet they look for £25 million extra.  How can we justify this?  How can I say to hotel owners and to people in the south-west area who depend on tourism that the B &amp; I will come to Cork three times a week and perhaps once a week during the winter?  Ten years ago when they were not losing money we had a nightly service.  B &amp; I management are not fit to be there.  This must be looked into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's statement that the need to establish an Irish presence in the Irish Sea is still valid.  The need to continue the Irish presence in the Irish Sea underlies this regrettably necessary Bill.  I will confine myself to one point which I hope the Cathaoirleach will agree is relevant.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of various factors which have contributed to the difficulties in B &amp; I, among them the general recession and the depressed tourist environment. In that latter connection, it has been widely suggested that a recent factor in the fall in tourism in 1982 is what is alleged to be a universal climate of anti-British feeling in this country.  I dissociate myself from that view.  There are various factors which explain the recession in tourism &mdash; the general economic situation and the fact that we are not only an expensive country but an extremely scruffy one.  I hope to elaborate on that in the context of the Second Stage of the Litter Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real damage to the native British tourist market as distinct from the ethnic British-Irish market was done last year when there was an orchestrated campaign of hate against Britain and the British tourist.  Rather than moaning about anti-British feelings which are not widespread, we should look to consoling factors such as the return to Ireland of a group of anglers who were put off, and with good reason, last year by the bullyboy actions of the supporters of the Provisional IRA.  I do not think we can seriously talk about a widespread anti-British feeling as a reason for the drop off in the number of British tourists.  There are, of <Col N="204" /> course, isolated voices.  There are what I might call atavistic tribal voices.  One of them unfortunately is the Minister for Defence, and I am sorry that he is not here to take this Bill instead of the last one.  However, by and large, they are factors outside our control.  There is a virulent reservoir of anti-Irish feeling in Britain in certain quarters and it is whipped up from time to time.  I do not see what we can do about that except to reflect that, in the nature of things, these waves of feeling come and go.  It would be far more relevant to turn our minds to matters like prices and hygiene as a reason for the decline in the British tourist market than to talk about an imaginary anti-British feeling.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Bill is necessary.  I should like to know more about where the money is going.  I would hate to think that because B &amp; I need this money we would draw the moral that because it is a State company it is doomed to fail or to have problems.  The salutary contrast is there.  We have companies like Irish Shipping which are a great success story. Despite the extensive ministerial statement, it is not altogether clear how that extra money will be used.  I am glad that, at the end of the statement, the Minister said that a vigilant eye will be kept on the B &amp; I position, because it is a matter of great public concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichealCranitch" hpid="Mícheál Cranitch Mícheál Cranitch">
      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fitting that I should be third in the Cork triumvirate in view of the fact that one of the important links in the B &amp; I chain is the city and, indeed, the port of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this company was taken over in 1965 from the private company which owned it, everybody was delighted, particularly those living in the southern region.  We looked forward to great things in the future because as far as Cork people are concerned the old <i>Inisfallen</i> was something of an institution.  Week after week, day after day during the summer season thousands of British visitors came into the port of Cork and travelled from there all over Munster to see all our famous beauty spots.  As matters progressed new boats were purchased, at a tremendous cost, and the money that <Col N="205" /> could have been saved by giving the contracts to foreign firms was rather ploughed into our economy by reason of the fact that the new ships were built at Verolme dockyard.  Everybody was very glad that the money was being kept at home.  From a financial point of view it has to be seen as an investment for the B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>Looking at the years 1979, 1980 and 1981, the loss figures were absolutely frightening, ranging from £1.1 million to £2.8 million to £7.54 million.  These loss figures are totally unacceptable.  B &amp; I should be a money-making concern.  If Irish Shipping Ltd. can do it why cannot the B &amp; I?  Various reasons have been advanced by the Minister for this sad state of affairs, such as the depressed environment for tourism, cost inflation, industrial disputes, the general economic recession and so on.  To what extent could two other reasons have been advanced, firstly, bad management, secondly, unproductive work practices or a combination of these two?  There does not seem to be any reason &mdash; and I repeat this &mdash; that the B &amp; I should not be a healthy money-making concern.  Their operations prosper from year to year.  The passenger traffic is there, the need is there and I believe it will always exist.  I dismiss any suggestion that there is antagonism towards British visitors in any part of this country.  There is a hearty &ldquo;céad míle fáilte,' for visitors from any part of the world.  No exception is made in the case of British visitors because British tourists are people of goodwill &mdash; I have always found them to be very nice people &mdash; and we should not confuse the kindly visitor we get from Britain and elsewhere with people who are, shall we say, anti-Irish at heart in certain areas in western Europe.</P>
    <P>Three names have been uppermost in my mind while I listened to the debate. Those are Jetfoil, Ringaskiddy and Pembroke. I wonder on whose advice did the board of management of the B &amp; I introduce the Jetfoil service; was sufficient research done into it; did they look ahead and ascertain whether this was a suitable place in which to introduce such a <Col N="206" /> service?  Did they ascertain whether it was the right time to introduce such a service? It was a dismal failure and at this stage I think we must write it off.  There was then the Ringaskiddy terminal referred to at some length by Senator Cregan.  I agree with everything he said about it.  It was extraordinary that, despite the fact that the terminal there was erected to accommodate the B &amp; I, at its opening B &amp; I were noticeable by their absence.  I believe that Brittany Ferries are delighted with that terminal and will continue to use it.  It was a splendid job.  The terminal holds its arms open wide, so to speak, to welcome boats from any part of the world.  I cannot see any reason why the B &amp; I would not use it and make up their minds to do so.</P>
    <P>I come now to Pembroke.  Who advised the B &amp; I or why did they change and continue to change?  First they used Fishguard, then they changed to Swansea, then to Pembroke, which constituted the last straw that broke the camel's back.  I remember as a youngster travelling to and from Britain on the old <i>Innisfallen</i> using Fishguard, which was very convenient. When one arrived at Fishguard one just walked across a platform into the train and was taken to London or wherever one wished to go.  The B &amp; I then changed to Swansea, the stated reason being to make the overland journey shorter.  It did make one's overland journey that much shorter.  But one was put to the inconvenience of getting off the boat in Swansea, travelling by taxi or bus to the railway station and boarding the train there.  Finally, they went to Pembroke, a small place practically impossible to get out of with any speed because the roads are very narrow and twisty.  That was a major blunder.  I do not know how much money was invested in the Pembroke venture but it was a bad mistake.  Is it already too late to revert to Swansea or better still, to Fishguard?</P>
    <P>I make those few points.  I commend the Minister for his exhortation when referring to the unofficial dispute in the course of his remarks.  These disputes are becoming so common that one could be pardoned for wondering are we losing all sense of reality.  When avoidable a dispute <Col N="207" /> is a stupid performance and I have not the slightest doubt that most if not all of them could be avoided.  There are three possible causes &mdash; bad management, restrictive work practices or, what is even worse, a combination of these two.  The Minister says that industrial disputes of any kind are not in the long-term interests of either the B &amp; I or its workers.  This latest disturbance was singularly ill-timed by reference to the company's financial straits and the holiday season on which they are so dependent. It is a lamentable fact that many of our industrial disputes as far as transport is concerned occur in the peak season, holding holidaymakers up to ransom in a deplorable way.  The Minister said he was glad that saner counsels had prevailed and that management and unions were able to arrange a speedy settlement; buiochas mór le Dia.  I hope that, as was the fashion with the Skibbereen Eagle on Russia, the Department will keep a very watchful eye on the B &amp; I.  I hope also that the day will come when we shall have not a series of losses to report but that we shall have something left over and above which would repay us in some way for the extra money we are about to vote for the B &amp; I now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I agree with the Minister that B &amp; I cannot carry the burden unaided.  I also accept that their losses have been steadily growing since 1974 and that there are reasons for them.  On the other hand, the State and semi-State bodies &mdash; of public concern &mdash;should have all of our support in any endeavour to render them more economical, reliable and efficient.  Having regard to some remarks I shall make later I doubt whether such desire exists in Irish society or indeed on the part of the managerial staff we select from time to time to run our public bodies.  All of us in this House would like to see the B &amp; I become more efficient and successful.  We would also like to see the need for such extensive borrowing reduced substantially. But it is as well to remember that part of the problems of the non-profitability of the B &amp; I and other bodies is occasioned by the high rates of bank interest.  For <Col N="208" /> example in 1974 the B &amp; I had a loss of £452,000.  They paid the bank £430,000 in interest.  In my simple logic that trading loss amounted to £22,000 in that period and the interest constituted the other loss.</P>
      <P>Public bodies are established and militating against their profitability are crucifying interest rates engendered by our banking system.  For example, we are talking now about a £25 million loan to the B &amp; I.  That alone will cost £4.9 million to service.  Again, when the profit and loss accounts appear no regard whatever will be had to the heavy interest rates acting as an enormous deterrent to people entering into the viable profitable areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with other Senators that the increased traffic failed to materialise.  I agree further about the whole question of the tourist situation as has been mentioned. I believe also that when the Jetfoil was being introduced that had a little bit more homework been done on the question of its viability from the point of view of attracting passengers its technical ability to cope with the Irish Sea and so on, we might not now be experiencing that kind of loss.  While we in these Houses support the B &amp; I in their operations there is running alongside that a kind of benevolent indifference on our part.  This benevolent indifference means that we can at times be speaking with forked tongues whether it be with regard to the B &amp; I, ESB, or CIE because we are here dealing with the public sector.  If the B &amp; I get into a position &mdash; such as exists in Bord na Móna &mdash; in which they can really become competitive and start putting forward suggestions to expand and so on then I respectfully submit &mdash; and I do this from my experience looking back at some of the situations that developed in other State-sponsored bodies &mdash; that they will experience the same pressure as did CIE and some others from the private sector. In support of that contention I should make this point: in 1974 Mr. Rhatigan, who was then Managing Director of Bord na Móna, which made about £1,200,000 profit in that year, said he wanted to enter into the area of minerals and offshore oil. Arising out of that statement of his a <Col N="209" /> propaganda campaign was launched against the board.  At a press confernce early in 1975, sponsored by the Irish Petroleum Group, a Mr. John Lowe of Trinity Bank launched an attack on the ESB and Bord na Móna, all because Mr. Rhatigan, he felt, had the temerity to want to enter into more profitable areas. Mr. Liam St. John Devlin of CIE, on a &ldquo;Here and Now&rdquo; programme in 1975, said that as far as he was concerned CIE should run the buses and the trains but, when it came to the question of road haulage he felt that there was a potentially good private sector that could perform the task in this area and that CIE should play the role of complementing this task rather than become a monopoly. What that gentleman was doing was asking CIE and their employees to commit hara-kiri.  He was saying: &ldquo;You cannot make a profit on the rails, keep them; you can make a profit on road haulage but do not touch it&rdquo;.  This is the type of mentality throughout the public sector in the minds of a lot of people who are entrusted by various Governments to take charge of that sector.</P>
    <P>I make those points not in the context of any ideology or anything like that.  I make them in the context that we talk about the B &amp; I not being able to carry their burden unaided and about the type of mentality running alongside while there are people who want to see public concerns remain the non-profit making areas of no value to this House, the country or anything else.  Such attitude will be of no value in rendering them more economical, efficient or reliable, which is our whole purpose.  In the broad sense, success can be achieved only if we apply the right mentality to such matters.</P>
    <P>Again in the context of borrowing, bank loans cause me a lot of worry, not in the personal sense &mdash; somehow one manages to cope with that aspect &mdash; but in the sense that profitability enters into it.  CIE hotels were making a profit and the only reason they had to close was that they could not withstand or pay the bank interest.  Here we have a private sector bank operating under a private system that is crippling the public sector providing <Col N="210" /> anything up to 64,000 jobs in one sense and 10,000 in another sense.  It is a sad state of affairs that we rely on the public sector to create jobs, to generate employment, we rely on bodies like AnCO, the Industrial Credit Company, Fóir Teoranta and so on to subsidise and assist these private people.  Then we rely on CIE, the B &amp; I and so on to issue contracts to these private people out of their grant moneys.  Yet the mentality runs alongside: do not start; you are going too far into the profit area, that is sacrosanct to the private sector, do not go in too deep in the competition stakes. This is very worrying.  The banking system and interest rates present a problem. For example, in 1974 the situation in CIE was that they had outstanding loans of almost £42 million.  Their losses for that year was £11.6 million and interest amounted to £3½ million.</P>
    <P>I want to support the Bill.  I want to see not alone this Bill but others dealing with the public sector supported and encouraged. I want all State-sponsored bodies to be more successful, reliable and so on. But our banking system acts as a deterrent to such public bodies entering the profitability areas because of its extremely high interest charges.  I would remind many people who indulge in attacking the public sector of the very profitable and many good bodies that exist.  I appeal for an understanding that before anyone rushes into print he take a look at the whole State situation and carry out a long overdue analysis.  In so doing they will discover that there is a great contribution to be made not only by people like the B &amp; I and so on, but by many other public bodies that suffer considerable harassment without having had a full in-depth study from the public point of view.  I do not regard some reports as in-depth studies because many are weighted heavily in favour of the public sector.  I am not suggesting that the private sector is the be-all and end-all; I believe it is necessary that the two work together.  Certainly there is no reason why the private sector should have any more right to enter into the profitability or efficiency stakes than the State-sponsored sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Transport on his appointment and wish him well in his office.</P>
      <P>This is a rather peculiar Bill.  Over the years we in this House learned a good deal about the B &amp; I Company.  They were taken over in 1965 because they were not a paying proposition.  They were experiencing some difficulties at that stage, not too serious.  During the period 1965 to 1969, dealt with here, what was happening the B &amp; I?  Were they continually losing money?  Some people seem to be of the opinion that during that four-year period they were making money.  I hope the Minister in replying will be able to give us some information on that.</P>
      <P>According to the Minister, for the period from 1979 to 1981 there was a total loss of slightly over £10 million.  Approximately half of that money was lost on account of industrial disputes.  I am not the best mathematician in the country but that is the figure I arrived at.  It is a desperate situation if half of the money lost by the company for that period was occasioned by industrial disputes.  This seems to be a general phenomenon.</P>
      <P>Senator Harte is inclined to blame bank interest rates, which is a fair enough comment because in recent years they have risen enormously, particularly on money borrowed at a fluctuating interest rate.  For example, people who borrowed money some five years ago at a fixed rate did so at approximately 14 per cent.  At that time the variable rate was in the region of 11½ per cent, and that was a short five years ago.  The variable rate has now moved to approximately 21, 22 or 23 per cent.  The present average bank interest rate &mdash; which I am sure is what would be applicable to the B &amp; I &mdash; would be in the region of 20 or 21 per cent.  It is difficult for such a company to meet their commitments.  But I say to Senator Harte &mdash;in all sincerity &mdash; that people in the private sector suffer the very same hardship; it cuts both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the radio yesterday evening it is even more surprising to hear that United Kingdom interest rates are <Col N="212" /> now down to 12¼ per cent while ours are practically double.  Surely there is an answer somewhere.  Somebody is getting away with murder in this country. But that is not the Minister's problem.  It is one for the Department of Finance. Somebody must examine this matter at some stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about rationalisation of the B &amp; I's services and outlined them, one of which was the commencement of the daily short-sea service between Dublin/Holyhead in conjunction with a Dublin/Liverpool nightly service.  In replying, perhaps he would give us a breakdown.  For example, if they are going to increase the profit on the first mentioned service, how much will it be increased by or what effort is being put into it?  With regard to the operation of a forked service from Pembroke, servicing Cork and Rosslare with one ship, will the Minister say whether there will be a saving and, if so, how much.  Perhaps he would say also how much money will be involved in the termination of the Jetfoil service.  Perhaps he would tell us what will be the amount of saving involved in the negotiation of a three-months' pay pause.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the raising of base revenue for tourism and freight to more economic levels.  By how much will that base be raised and how much money will it yield for the B &amp; I?  We would be interested in a breakdown of all the services mentioned by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>The company has also rationalised its services on the southern corridor and has been servicing the Cork/Pembroke and the Rosslare/ Pembroke routes with one instead of two vessels for some time now.</P>
    <P>Does that mean that there were two vessels operating on that route when there was one only needed, or has the number of passengers dropped?  I do not think they have &mdash; it is not long since I used that service &mdash; but according to those remarks it appears there were two boats operating that service when one would have sufficed and that there was work for <Col N="213" /> only one.  If that is the situation I should like to hear the Minister's views.  Indeed, if that is the situation it is no wonder they are now looking for more money.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>While it will be necessary to disburse a portion of these funds as soon as the legislation has been passed to enable the company to meet its immediate obligations arising from the seasonal downturn in its cash flow, I will be expecting the company to demonstrate to me that satisfactory progress has been made in the rationalisation of its operations before I shall agree to recommend any durther disbursements from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Does that statement mean that the officials in the Minister's Department have told him that still more money has to go into B &amp; I?  Are we going to have this thing again next year?  If we are we should know it now.  There has been a substantial amount of money put into this company and one wonders how much further can this go on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my appreciation to the Senators who have contributed to this very important debate and indeed for the many constructive points which they made in the course of the debate.  I want to clarify as many points as I can in relation to matters raised by the Senators who spoke.</P>
      <P>Senator Cregan mentioned the transfer situation to Ringaskiddy in the port of Cork from the existing point at Tivoli.  I had the pleasure of inspecting Ringaskiddy landing point on Sunday in the company of Mr. Liam French, the chief executive and Mr. Bryan Foley, the Chairman of the Cork Harbour Commissioners. I was very impressed by the facilities which the port of Cork is presently offering right throughout its services. I wish to compliment them on their fine work in the southern region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the transfer to Ringaskiddy, no decision has yet been taken by B &amp; I.  They are still discussing conditions with Cork Harbour Commissioners regarding the rates and who will carry out <Col N="214" /> the stevedoring, and dock working in relation to this area.  The arrangements are of considerable financial significance to the B &amp; I.  The performance of all the company's servicing will be subject to an overall review at the end of the season. A decision by the company on the transfer is being postponed until this review has been completed and the question of manning the terminal and agreement on rates has been negotiated.  I can add no further to this statement at present.</P>
    <P>I want to say at this stage that the B &amp; I have a very good service in Cork area with three sailings per week all year round.  Prior to 1982 there were six sailings per week for the peak three summer months but this was reduced to three as an economy measure.  That is the journey from Tivoli docks to Pembroke, which lasts seven and three quarter hours.  I appreciate the interest and concern of Senators and Deputies from the Cork region.  I know the Minister and the Government are considering this matter. It is a matter for the board for further discussion.</P>
    <P>In relation to Córas Iompair Éireann and the use of vessels for transportation, we have no direct control over the operation of CIE.  CIE are a semi-State body and naturally they will use the vessels which will give the best possible rates and at times may have to use certain services to their advantage.  I appreciate that B &amp; I are working closely with CIE.  I would certainly encourage closer connection between both organisations.  I have no doubt that, where possible, CIE use the services of B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recent strike this is a matter for the board and the management of the company and it would not have been appropriate for the Minister to intervene.  The company had no option but to cease all services when the officers went on strike.  The Minister and I are glad that this matter was settled so quickly.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy mentioned the question of anti-British feeling.  I think that Senator Cranitch has, quite rightly, pointed out that no anti-British feeling exists in this country.  I would like to contradict any type of innuendo in reference <Col N="215" /> to my colleague, the Minister for Defence, who in no circumstances has expressed any anti-British feelings at any time.</P>
    <P>I believe that this so-called anti-British feeling is being conjured up by some of the British media and, fortunately, as far as I know and from my contacts in Britain, this is not working.  I had discussions recently with people in Britain and people in business, in transport and other fields, and they have got no indication whatsoever of any anti-Irish feeling in Britain, which also is important.  As Senator Cranitch stated, we have always given a céad míle fáilte to all our British tourists, who are very welcome.  I must say that we are delighted with the numbers coming to our shores at all times, and I know the good services and attention they get from our people.</P>
    <P>In relation to the possible sale or leasing of the jetfoil I would like to say that it has come in for severe criticism.  As the Minister stated in the Dáil, he used the facility on some occasions.  I went on the jetfoil service from the Dublin docks to Liverpool and I must say that I found it an extremely efficient and comfortable service.  Unfortunately circumstances have not allowed this service to continue. I regret this because I thought it had great potential at the time.  I know the board made that decision in the best interests of transport.  Unfortunately it did not work, but if it had worked I am sure that we would be all complimenting the board of B &amp; I at this stage.  As Senators are aware, the possibility of leasing or chartering this ship is at present under discussion. In relation to the <i>Munster</i> the estimated cost is in the region of £3 million. The vessel is now on charter until October to a Norwegian firm.  Contrary to any point being made by any Senator, it is being utilised at this stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy mentioned the equity of £8.7 million being made available to the board used as working capital.  The combination of working capital and the economies being introduced with the company, as stated, should improve the financial performance and should enable it to break even by 1985.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> Senator Cranitch mentioned the question of the change of terminals.  My brief in relation to this is that the company had to change terminals from Fishguard to Swansea and finally to Pembroke. Agreemnt to use Fishguard terminated in 1969 and was not renewed.  The company moved to Swansea for a period of ten years and the move to Pembroke was decided on because of the tidal conditions at Swansea.  This reduced the travelling time as well and, as a result, there was a saving of fuel.  That is the reason why any changes were made.  There were operating difficulties at Swansea regarding narrow docks and time restrictions.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that most shipping companies have suffered in the present recession.  B &amp; I had also to contend with other factors in relation to the Northern crisis over the years.  It certainly has had a very depressing effect on tourism. This has affected the projections by the company.  To compare the B &amp; I with Irish Shipping is not a fair comparison, because we must bear in mind that Irish Shipping are engaged on a different type of project in relation to deep sea and the B &amp; I are generally working in the Irish Sea.  This is something which should be borne in mind.  I wish to thank Senator Reynolds for the welcome he extended to me to the Seanad.  This is my first time to speak in the Seanad and I am delighted to have had the opportunity.  I look forward to having another opportunity at another time to speak in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Senator Reynolds mentioned the overall years of losses.  There was, going back to the start of 1965, a net loss of £88,000. In 1966 there was a net profit of £83,000 and then there were losses in 1967 and 1968 of £398,000 and £54,000.  Then, in 1969, 1970 and 1971 there was a profit situation going from £9,000 to £159,000 and £386,000.  In 1972 and 1973 the company were in a loss making situation of £614,000 and £1,180,000.  Then, for the years 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1978 there were profits ranging from £281,000 in 1974 to £1,353,000 in 1978.  As Senators are well aware in 1979 there was a loss of £1.148 million, 1980, £2.807 million and 1981, £7.54 million.  The industrial disputes in relation to losses under <Col N="217" /> this heading over the years predominantly we can attribute to the port of Liverpool.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered the majority of points raised by the Senators in relation to this debate.</P>

Section 2 of the British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company Limited (Acquisition) (Amendment) Act, 1971 and amendments thereto of 1976 and 1979 gave the Minister for Finance power to purchase not more than 33 million additional shares of £1 each in the company, making the present total authorised share capital 35 million shares of £1 each.  All the shares have been taken up by the Minister for Finance, and capital injected into the company has been used in the following manner.  I will give the details here. Amount subscribed by the Minister for Finance, £1.6 million in 1965 subscribed in total on takeover of company in 1965; <Col N="218" /> £3 million in 1971 and 1972 used totally for development of Dublin and Liverpool terminals, containers, equipment etc.; £15 million in 1975 to 1979, £10 million for the car ferry <i>Connacht</i>, £5 million working capital; £15.4 million 1979 to 1981, £10 million for the car ferry <i>Leinster</i> and £5,400,000 for working capital.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this Bill I would ask the Senators to recognise, as I do, that it is a very small Bill.  It is largely technical in nature and deals with only a small number of matters each, perhaps, important in itself, but it does not try to effect a major reform of company law nor is it intended as such.</P>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, the Companies Acts, 1963-1977 are the basic statutes governing the operations of different classes of companies in Ireland.  As such, they have a vital importance in that they provide the framework within which a very substantial part of the economic activity of the country is conducted.  The basic statute, the Companies Act, 1963, although nearly twenty years in existence on the whole has stood the test of time and has served us well.  However, there have of course been considerable changes in the meantime such as the rapid growth in industrialisation and, as a consequence, the extent and complexity of the activities of commercial entities.</P>
      <P>The period has been marked also by our entry into the European Economic Community.  It will be recognised that substantive revision of the Act is now necessary to keep pace with the changes brought about by those developments. Only minor changes have been made to date, first in a regulation in 1973 to give effect to the first EEC directive on company law about the publication of documents and information on companies generally.  Then there was a short Act in 1977 which dealt with the method of transferring securities on the stock exchange.  Therefore, I would like Senators to view the present Bill as a first instalment of an extensive legislative programme which will up-date our code of company law to cater for the corporate circumstances of the latter part of the 20th century and will enable us to fulfil our obligations as a member of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EEC company law harmonisation programme alone will necessitate the preparation of a number of extensive and highly complex legislative proposals and I expect to introduce the first of these <Col N="220" /> very shortly.  I intend also to introduce as soon as possible a further measure arising from domestic considerations, the intention of which will be to attempt to remove abuses which are far too frequent in commercial and business activity.  In addition, there are various other EEC measures, including the Fourth Directive, to be implemented shortly.</P>
    <P>It is important that Senators should have regard to that background when considering this Bill and that they should not be unduly disappointed at the size and scope of this first step of a major company law reform programme.</P>
    <P>I would now like to summarise, on general terms, the provisions of the Bill. They comprise the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a number of minor adjustments to facilitate the more efficient operation of the Companies Registration Office,</P>
    <P>&mdash;an amendment to the provisions in relation to persons who may act as company auditors and public auditors,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the amendment of a particular provision rendered unconstitutional by a Supreme Court decision,</P>
    <P>&mdash;improving, in the interest of employees, the provision about preferential payments in the winding-up of companies,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the removal of the restriction on the number of partners in the professions of accountant and solicitor to enable them to broaden the scope of their services,</P>
    <P>&mdash;increasing fines to take account of inflation and revising the provisions in relation to certain legal proceedings in the interests of more effective implementation of the Companies Acts,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the repeal of sections 29 and 30 of the Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1961, to enable service, as opposed to industrial, companies to use the word &ldquo;standard&rdquo; in their names.</P>
    <P>The provisions dealing with the Companies <Col N="221" /> Registration Office will speed up some of the processes used in that office in the carrying out of the registrar's functions and will strengthen his powers in enforcing the law.  It is also necessary to tighten up some of the procedures to ensure that maximum information under the relevant clauses will be available to the public at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>As Senators know, registration of a company with limited liability confers considerable advantages on the promoters and shareholders.  By comparison, the corresponding obligations in regard to filing of returns are not onerous. It is only reasonable, therefore, that these obligations should be observed to the maximum extent, so that people dealing with such companies will have adequate information about them readily available.  One of my principal aims in sponsoring this Bill is to secure more regular and faster filing of annual returns and much improved observance of the law in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would refer, for instance, to the new procedures governing the striking off of companies no longer trading and companies which fail to furnish annual returns for three consecutive years.  This provision should help to update considerably the records of the Companies Registration Office.  So too should the availability, prior to incorporation, of information as to the directors, secretary and registered office of a company.</P>
    <P>In addition to these statutory measures, I am also arranging for the introduction of a programme of mechanisation of methods and systems at the Companies Registration Office.  This combination of improvements should be welcomed by practitioners and the business community in general.  Moreover, the volume of work involved for the Companies Registration Office in securing lodgment of returns of defaulting companies will be reduced to some extent by virtue of these new procedures.</P>
    <P>Accountants will be especially interested in changes proposed in section 6 of the Bill which substitutes a new section for section 162 of the Companies Act, 1963.  The new provision has two main <Col N="222" /> objectives.  The first is to end, six months after the commencement of the Bill, the arrangement under the existing provision whereby the Minister may authorise a person for appointment as auditor of a company on the basis of having obtained adequate knowledge and experience in employment by a member of a recognised body or as having practised in the State as an accountant, in either case prior to the operative date of the 1963 Act.  It will be generally accepted that persons satisfying those provisions have had long enough to establish that fact and that the provisions are no longer realistic.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to the fact that the provision whereby authorisations may be granted on the basis of similar qualifications otherwise than from a recognised body still stands.  This is an arrangement which enables us to grant recognition, in appropriate circumstances, to accountants from abroad and by so doing to enable, in some cases, Irish people who qualify abroad to return home.</P>
    <P>The second objective of the provision in section 6 of the Bill is to give statutory force to what has been the practice, since 1967 of making appointments of public auditors by reference to the same criteria as those for auditors of companies.  The phasing out of the knowledge and experience criteria, which I have just mentioned, will also apply to appointments of public auditors.  In addition, there is the ending of the present administrative arrangement under which public auditors must apply on a continuing basis for reappointment.  Authorisation of all public auditors will, in future, be on a permanent basis and members of recognised bodies will be automatically entitled to act as public auditors just as they are now entitled to act as company auditors.</P>
    <P>I should explain that public auditors are those who audit the accounts of industrial and provident societies and of friendly societies and they have, up to now, been appointed on an individual basis under the provisions of very old legislation relating to such societies.</P>
    <P>Because of a Supreme Court decision of some years standing it is necessary, for <Col N="223" /> constitutional reasons, to amend section 168(3) of the Companies Act relating to obligations on officers or agents of a company to make statements and produce books or documents to any inspector investigating the affairs of that company. As I am including this provision on the advice of the Attorney General I trust that it will be generally acceptable.</P>
    <P>Employees will no doubt welcome the changes I propose in section 285 of the 1963 Act which deals with preferential payments in a winding-up.  I am improving, considerably the position of employees in that I am extending the preferential list to include pension fund payments owing by a company whether in respect of its own contribution or of contributions deducted from its employees.  I am also improving the provisions in so far as they relate to sick pay accruing to employees.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am increasing from £300 to £2,500 the sum to which priority is given by the same section for employees' salaries or wages in respect of services rendered during the four months prior to winding-up.  The Bill, as originally published, included £1,500 as the revised figure but following discussion in the Dáil I amended it to £2,500.  In addition I also amended the Bill, as originally published, to provide power to vary by order the sum of £2,500.</P>
    <P>It would be as well to recognise that there are limits as to what can be achieved by legislating for the position of employees in relation to preferential payments in a winding-up.  If the assets available for distribution are minimal, a preferential right under statute confers little advantage.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains features which should be welcomed, in particular by the accountancy and legal professions.  I am removing the limitation imposed by section 376 of the 1963 Act which prevents the formation of partnerships consisting of more than 20 persons.  I accept the argument that firms of accountants and solicitors may wish to expand so as to identify and concentrate on appropriate areas of specialisation with a view to improving and extending the range of services to their <Col N="224" /> clients.  I recognise, too, that these firms may wish to provide organisational structures which will encourage and provide advancement opportunities for their more outstanding practitioners.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was published strong representations have been received from professions other than those of accountant and solicitor to be relieved of the limitations of section 376.  Accordingly, the Bill before this House provides for power to extend by ministerial order, the relief granted to accountants and solicitors to other professions.</P>
    <P>A general measure which strikes at all aspects of the Companies Act, 1963 and which, it has to be admitted, is overdue, is the provision at section 15 of the Bill to increase all fines to reflect the fall in money values and thus increase their deterrent effect.  These are the penalties for failure to comply with all the requirements of the 1963 Act including matters such as the filing of documents, returns and statements, holding meetings and providing other information to the Registrar of Companies.  This is another measure, which, it is envisaged, would effect some saving in the resources of the Companies Registration Office which are taken up in pursuit of companies failing in their obligations.</P>
    <P>In concluding I would emphasise again that I recognise that this Bill is a relatively small measure &mdash; a first step &mdash; in a series of amendments of company law.  These will reflect the need for change arising from developments in commercial activity generally and, more immediately from the necessity to translate into Irish law the provision of EEC Directives already adopted.  The next Bill, which will give effect to the Second Directive, about the formation of public limited companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital, will be introduced shortly. Work is proceeding on a Bill determined by domestic considerations and on the measures necessary to give effect to the Third and Fourth Directives, and proposals on these will be made as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>This is the general background against which I present this Bill.  I consider that <Col N="225" /> the amendments it proposes are worthwhile and accordingly, I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and I also welcome this Bill, while, like the Minister, recognising its limitations. As he rightly said, it is a very short Bill and, considering the amount of change that has occurred and has been outlined by the Minister both within the European Community and our own economic situation, a major overhaul is urgently needed.  I welcome the Minister's promise to introduce such legislation quickly and urgently.</P>
      <P>I question the delay in some of the more urgent areas.  At present here there is a facility for some shady fly-by-night companies to operate which, as far as I can gather, does not happen in the UK. For example, companies can set up here with an address and can advertise to give mail order business on receipt of money. Too often they literally fly-by-night. When they receive the money they do not deliver the goods.  That is an example of the need for proper legislation.</P>
      <P>I welcome section 3 which gives an indication of the officers of the company and who is promoting it.  Sometimes searches in a company's office merely show the names of law clerks or two typists within the office, and the background of the real shareholders or of the company's viability, can be shielded behind that small amount of information.</P>
      <P>The Minister has dealt with section 6 and with the qualifications of persons for appointment as auditors to companies. We all welcome the fact that people working abroad and returning will get an opportunity to work here.  I also note that the conduct of an auditor shall be looked at and if an auditor is convicted of a criminal offence in connection with the performance of his duties or his conduct as an auditor he shall not be qualified for appointment as auditor of a company.</P>

    <P>When the Minister is undertaking the complete overhaul of the Companies Act I would like him to consider whether persons should be precluded also from acting as auditors if they continuously report on accounts in a negligent <Col N="226" /> fashion, without making due inquiry into the validity of the accounts laid before them and see them as merely something to be signed at the end of the page.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for revised procedures and penalties in the case of an agent or an officer of a company refusing to co-operate with an inspector investigating the affairs of that company.  Given the very difficult and delicate situation within our economy and, as a result of that, a lack of confidence among the public with regard to the collapse or the rumoured collapse of companies, everything that can be done should be done to secure such confidence, to examine the companies and make sure that we are not open to collapse after collapse but might have some warning signals that would avoid some of the very damaging consequences. Following such collapse I would ask the Minister to give some thought to broadening the scope within which inspectors can be appointed.  If we have not enough inspectors to look into this and protect the public and the people within the company it will give rise to cynicism that will damage confidence in the economy.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the sections in the principal Act dealing with the inspection of companies without the number and the strength of the inspectors would be mainly geared towards the protection of the shareholders of the company, too little with the right of the creditors and not at all with the rights of the employees.</P>
    <P>I will comment later on the fact that the rights of employees have been strengthened through this Bill.  However, section 7 could be looked at again.  The whole provisions of the Companies Act, 1963, should be geared for an age that must take cognisance of the fact that not alone must shareholders be protected but that the employees and the creditors will be safeguarded as far as possible.  I do not know whether one can legislate for this but I would like to believe we can. This may have to be a holding situation until further fundamental legislation comes in.  Such legislation should take into consideration the fears of the creditors, and particularly of the employees within such companies.  Knowledge is a <Col N="227" /> great remover of fear.  I cannot stress strongly enough or with more emphasis that we must keep the employees of the company fully informed.  We must involve them as far as possible in the day to day working of the company.  If there are profits to be shared, they should be the first to share them.  If there is a company coming under stress or in danger I believe that, without damaging confidence too much, the workers should be appraised of this.  Too often, tragically and destructively, the employees are among the last to hear that their livelihood and the skills they have given to a company are to be wiped out.  I would like to feel that, with the use of inspectors, with more confidence shared between management and employees, we could work much more constructively to saving the businesses through the participation and the co-operation of the employees and also to remove the fears which are no help to industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said he was improving considerably the position of employees and extending a preferential list to include pension funds claims owing by a company.  The Minister also said it would be well to recognise that there are limits as to what can be achieved by legislation for the position of employees in relation to preferential payments in a winding up.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer again to it on Committee Stage, but I believe that we can achieve more by legislating for the position of employees.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, the situation has changed very dramatically since 1963 when the Companies Act was first set up. One of the principal ways in which it has changed is that many additions have been made with regard to the schedule of preferential payments, for instance, PAYE, social welfare, sub-contractors' tax, VAT, corporation tax, capital gains tax and other assessed taxes, redundancy, minimum notice and unfair dismissal.  All these additions affect the rights of the employees and the rights of the State. While the provisions in relation to the rights of the employees are increased and are to be welcomed &mdash; I again emphasise <Col N="228" /> that &mdash; the right of the State to claim preferentially in a winding-up has also increased.</P>
    <P>This is detrimental in a number of respects.  For the State to claim VAT as a preferential creditor enormously increases the take of the State in a winding-up situation at the expense of unsecured creditors and holders of floating charges.  This has three effects: first, as preferential creditors rank before a floating charge holder, the financial institutions are now very reluctant to lend funds on a floating charge.  The ability of the company to borrow necessary working capital is very often severely impaired.  Secondly, financial institutions are increasingly endeavouring to secure fixed charges on book debts, chattel mortgages and stocks and by other legal strategems to endeavour to overcome the problems they face as a result of the increase in preferential creditors. Thirdly, unsecured creditors, who are the last to be paid in a winding-up, are now sceptical of the results they can achieve and the moneys they will receive in a winding-up.  The net result of this is that the State is decreasing the ability of companies to continue to supply goods when they are in any way doubtful about a customer's viability.  It would appear to be manifestly unfair that the suppliers of goods and services should be asked to take last place after the State when the State is slow in collecting taxes.  Again, I ask the Minister to perhaps limit the State to rank as a preferential creditor for a period of three months rather than the 12 months which it has now allowed.</P>
    <P>It is unfair and unjust also &mdash; and this applies right across the board &mdash; in a democratic society but which also has the privileged and unprivileged, that the creditors with the best legal advice and knowledge rank ahead of other creditors who have not got the same financial or expert advice to enable them to place themselves in an advantageous position. I would like to acknowledge the Minister's commitment to amending company legislation that will, I hope, guarantee the rights of everybody concerned.  However, up to now and even under the 1963 Act, there was an advantage to shareholders <Col N="229" /> and management and, as I explained, the emergence of the different State demands on companies in a winding-up situation also affect the State. It has led to a tremendous lack of confidence when, as we do tragically today, get so many companies in receivership. There is panic by all the groups concerned and naturally, each group tries to grab, to put it crudely, as much as it possibly can.  This is not conducive to the group concerned in that winding-up situation; they have enough problems, psychologically and financially, to cope with.</P>
    <P>With regard to the whole economy and the public confidence we have and should have in a well-run economy, it certainly is not helpful.  I know the Minister will agree with me and the Members of this House that this is a particularly sad time for us to be introducing legislation because we went through a period of entry into the EEC of what could and should be described as a boom time in our economy.  Then we went into a very bad recession and companies are now coping with this.  What Government have to do, particularly in striving towards a just society, is to take cognisance of and control situations, whether they are good or bad.  Therefore, it is all the more urgent that every possible safeguard be given to people involved.  It is with that in mind that I have touched on some of the considerations I would like the Minister to have on the areas and sections which he has already worked on.  I hope to go into it in more detail on Committee Stage next week.  In the meantime, I emphasise once again the urgency of the more fundamental legislation needed in the face of the many great and almost overwhelming changes encountered worldwide, but particularly here in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate you, a Chathaoirligh, on your appointment and I wish you every success. I would also like to be associated with Senator Barnes when she welcomed the Minister to the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome any change in the Companies Act and therefore I welcome this Bill, however limited it may be.  I am a <Col N="230" /> believer in the philosophy of worker-democracy. Therefore I am against the law that states that the sole duty of directors is the protection of shareholders. The law should state that the duty of the directors is to the employees first and the shareholders second.  If this were achieved, an equal sharing would be acceptable.  If this were adopted and written into the Statute Book, the decision regarding the closing of many factories causing many redundancies would not be taken so lightly.</P>
    <P>We have thousands of limited liability companies.  Nearly 99 per cent of them are private limited companies.  The majority of these companies are owned by two people; normally and in a lot of cases they are owned by a husband and wife.  They cloak under the protection of limited liability and more and more the argument must be whether limited liability companies are havens or shields for crooks and gangsters.  We have cases of builders going broke and taking with them the lifesavings of many young marries couples in the form of their deposits. Then the same builders, under a different name, start up in another place.  The law should be amended to protect these young couples and prohibit the taking of deposits by builders.  Instead these deposits should only be taken by the auctioneer or the solicitor and should not be given to the builder until the house and transaction are completed.  As far as bank facilities being awarded to the builder are concerned, the bank will, in effect, accept the security on the strength of the deposit taken, so that argument does not hold.</P>
    <P>I also appeal for far more disclosure in dealing with companies.  There is no reason why accounts should not be registered with the annual return.  Each company has a legal responsibility to produce annual accounts to the tax inspector. There is no reason why the accountant at that stage should not furnish a copy of his accounts to the company's office.  This disclosure would be of major benefit to employees and to other companies dealing with that company. They would be in a position to see the good side as well as the dark clouds gathering on the horizon.  This disclosure <Col N="231" /> should be linked with a report on the other companies owned by these directors. An index of the companies owned by these directors should be shown in the company's file.  There are, in a number of cases, as many as 15 companies owned totally and run by the same directors. Ninety nine per cent of all companies are private companies and directors tend, in many cases, to be husband and wife. There is also a grave and important position in the movement of funds from one company to another but still remaining within the law.  Disclosure of accounts and the linking up on an index basis would highlight this.</P>
    <P>In recent months the name of the liquidator has become a household name. The way small private limited companies are financed at the moment, the cash flow funding, liquid assets against liability of any company, is maintained by non-payment of VAT and PAYE.  The VAT will come to a head in September with the introduction of VAT at the point of entry.  This will force many companies into liquidation as the banks have a stated policy at the moment that no credit is to be given for this purpose.  After September the number of liquidations and the number of people out of work will be increased.  The companies office has for too long been a rest place for some civil servants from the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism and other Departments.  It should be one of the most important Departments in the Ministry. The setting up of an inspector of inquiry, who would have his or her own staff with the power to investigate companies, is urgently needed.  The setting up of a consultancy unit with the power to investigate the accounts of companies would be of major importance to the Government as well as to other individual companies trading with these organisations. It would be in a position to report to the Government how much funds are in these companies owing to PAYE and VAT.  In my opinion they are enormous.</P>
    <P>The Companies Act should take into account large payments made to political parties.  There should be a separate heading in the same way as audit and accounts <Col N="232" /> are marked out charged with this disclosure. This would affect and limit the vast amounts of money flowing from businesses to political parties and would hasten the day of direct State financing to public parties and the control of money spent on elections, as the State would pay for elections on the basis of each vote received by that party or individual at the last election.  Therefore, the political parties would be subject to the court of auditors appointed by the State.  On setting up the company, the names of the principal directors should be submitted before the company commences trading. The registration number given to each company should be linked to VAT, PAYE and income tax registration. VAT, PAYE and income tax registration tend to be the same nowadays.  The registration office would have a direct link with the number given to the company. Therefore it would be of much benefit when trying to investigate various companies. Personal liability of directors is present in the case of fraud but not in the case of bad management.  If two small electrical businesses go broke because of bad management and one has the word limited after its name and the other has not, the person with limited liability is protected but the one who has not got limited liability is hounded by creditors, by the bank and by the Government for VAT payments.  One is let off scot free and the other one is hounded, put out of business and his life destroyed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's acceptance of the proposition to increase the claim for outstanding amounts to employees from £300 to £2,500.  This is a welcome achievement and is long overdue.  On the question of penalties, a fine on companies is not an incentive to give the information to the companies office.  If the methods used in the construction industry by the issuing of a contractor's certificate applied in the building industry, were in some way linked to trading companies by means of the issue of a trading certificate, it would be of enormous benefit to companies in making sure that all their affairs are in order.  The certificate of trading should be withdrawn if the Minister finds irregularities in the company, if the <Col N="233" /> affairs of the company are not in order, or they have failed to register their proper papers with the companies office because a fine is of no great consequence. I do not know of any case where the fine was actually imposed.</P>
    <P>The case of limited liability is central to this whole problem.  The Minister spoke about the registration of a company and said limited liability confers considerable advantage to the promoter and shareholder.  In the case of limited liability, I have yet to be convinced that the largest contribution to trade in this country has been marked by protection of limited liability.  Many businesses would still be in operation but chances taken by the directors under the cover of limited liability have injured in many cases their employees who have given their services to the company and in many other cases, by their risks, have injured many companies dealing in good faith with that company.  The situation of limited liability is one which should fundamentally be looked at.  The advantages and disadvantages should be weighed up. The cover which limited liability gives to individuals should be looked at and investigated as a matter of urgency.  We have the youngest population in Europe facing many problems on every front.  Employment is our major problem.  On the other side, we find with the blessing of the law people of very doubtful purpose operating against the common good and with the protection of limited liability.  It is no wonder that many young people find no hope in this country and no relevance in the institutions of the State.  I welcome however this move to strengthen the Companies Act.  It is long overdue.</P>

      <P>I preface my remarks by congratulating you on your new office and, as a fellow county woman, we in Clare are very proud to have you in the Chair.  I also welcome the Minister to his first meeting of this Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is particularly interesting.  As the Minister said it is the first of a series of such Bills he intends to put before the House.  It is generally acceptable in so far as it is at least an improvement in the area of company law as it at present <Col N="234" /> exists.</P>
    <P>There are some sections in particular that are very welcome.  Section 10 proposes to amend section 285 of the 1963 Act.  I refer in particular to the pension payment fund for employees and to the preferential sick benefit payments.  I would hope that at a later stage the Minister may be able to consider these in a more serious light and extend them further than what the present proposal intends to do.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill is also welcome because in the past it has been common for companies to be defunct for six or seven years and to be still on the register in the Companies Office, an unsatisfactory situation.  This is a very good improvement.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is also a major improvement in so far as it amends section 376 of the principal Act.  It removes the limit of 20 persons in partnership of accountants and solicitors, and I was pleased to hear the Minister state in his speech that he intends to have that extended in the matter of properties.  This can be done by ministerial order.  It is important in the type of industrial times we live in to have this extended.</P>
    <P>Section 15, which increases the penalties to keep in line with modern inflation, is also very welcome because they were very outdated and it was very often more expedient to commit the offence and pay the fines than to do what one was obliged to do according to the Act.  There are, however, some areas in company law which need examination, and I refer in particular to what I feel is the very essence of company law, that is the area of limited liability.  Basically, a company that has limited liability is given a licence to form a company, to go out and deal with the public, incur debt and responsibilities to the public in general, and yet if they go into liquidation the public in general have often little comeback.  Debts are paid only to the limit of the liability of the company, and often people who have their companies liquidated, at a future date go into business again in the name of another company to operate a different product.  It is very difficult for the public to see this <Col N="235" /> happening and to see themselves being victimised.  Such people can re-establish a position in high finance in the country. This is an area that the Department should look into urgently.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals mainly with the technicalities of company law, and we have to get to the very soul of company law, which is the actual company itself and the actual type of liability that company has. There are some areas in particular that should be examined, and I should like to highlight a number of areas in which people are badly hit by limited liability. You have companies manufacturing goods and they go and sell them on the open market and they give a guarantee maybe for a year or two years, or whatever. In the meantime the company may go into liquidation and the purchaser then has no guarantee.  The directors of such a company should have their liability restrained and personal responsibility imposed on them to some degree to ensure that the consumer will be protected.</P>
    <P>At the moment, despite the recent consumer legislation that was introduced, there can be still serious damage by companies going into liquidation.  In recent times it is becoming more and more blatant in relation to building companies and development companies.  Such companies usually have to maintain and provide services on housing estates until the local authorities take them over.  If companies which develop housing estates go into liquidation the purchasers of the houses in the estate find themselves with increased overheads to maintain the roads and the services in their estates until the local authorities take over. When these companies give guarantees to maintain services, the people affected should be more familiar with their financial situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider having personal responsibility imposed on directors of companies at the time that the guarantees are given.  Normally development companies have to give to the local authority or the building society who give a loan a guarantee that the house will not suffer from defects for a <Col N="236" /> certain time.  If the company goes into liquidation the houses may suffer from defects and the purchasers have no comeback on the company from which they bought the house.  This problem has to be examined and personal responsibilit has to be put on the directors who give the guarantees.</P>
    <P>When somebody is buying a house it is normal procedure for the solicitor of the vendor to hold the deposit as a stakeholder until the purchase is complete and if something happens in the meantime the purchaser will get the deposit back, but companies seem to operate their own type of rules, laws and regulations, and often they get the deposits and it is not the company's solicitor who holds the actual deposit payment or the various payments which can follow.  These go right into the hands of the company.  If that company goes into liquidation a very serious problem arises, and in most cases you are talking about young couples who are trying to purchase houses.  They lose their deposits and may lose not alone their deposits but the stage payments, depending on the type of liability the company has.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious situation.  At the moment there are a number of young people in the country who are in fear that they might find themselves in this position, and I feel that the Department should treat this matter as urgent because there is a danger that more and more young people will find themselves never to have houses because of the serious experience they would have on the first occasion when they pay their deposit, money that they have been saving for years, and their various stage payments after that.</P>
    <P>In general there is public lack of knowledge about companies and how they operate and the type of laws that govern them.  Companies who have debentures should show this in their various communications, be it advertisements in the public papers, their receipt books, their letterheads, whatever.  Something should be done to ensure that all communications made by a company with any person or groups of people should have on the paper on which the communications are, <Col N="237" /> or any other form of communications, a note of the fact that it has debentures the same as the registration number of the company is evident on the letterhead.</P>
    <P>These are a few areas that I feel need serious and urgent examination.  In general, the Bill is to be welcomed because it is a move in the right direction, and I hope that the Minister and the Department will be able to move pretty fast on the other areas that he proposes.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Senators who have spoken for their welcome for the Bill and its provisions. A number of Senators said they look forward to some of the things being done which I mentioned.  Much of what was talked about by them in the debate are things one would like to see in forthcoming company legislation.  It is very frustrating to realise in practice how excruciating it is to get this legislation moving.  Even this, a minor Bill, has been going the rounds for about 18 months.  I had hoped to have a Bill published within a few weeks on the Second Directive.  I passed it about three weeks ago to go to the Government and I am told it arrived back today from the printers.  It takes three weeks even to print the Bill, which gives us an idea of how frustrating it is when you want to get on to do things, and these things are necessary in terms of amending company law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Barnes said more inspectors should be appointed under the 1963 Act. I am probably the first person who ever used inspectors, and I have appointed two sets.  As far as I can recall, I appointed both sets of them about three years ago and neither of them have yet completed the inspection.  It is not the fault of the inspectors but of the people into whom they are endeavouring to carry out inquiries.  Quite obviously the relevant sections of the Act need to be strengthened in order to give the inspectors greater powers to enforce their investigations or their right to investigate.  At the moment I get the impression that they are being laughed at and, as is so often the case, the courts take the view that the rights of somebody being investigated are <Col N="238" /> superior to everyone else's rights and superior to the rights of the community as a whole.  The only way that I think we can change that situation is by trying to change the law in relation to it.  Unhappily that cannot happen as rapidly as one would wish.</P>
    <P>Senator Barnes made the point that she felt the State's preference in terms of a preferential creditor is too great as against the employees.  The truth of the matter is not like that.  The employee preferences are not just those that are set out in the section in the 1963 Act.  We have to look at all the preferences that employees have under modern legislation which puts them in a stronger position virtually than anybody else: we can think of all their rights under the social welfare Acts, the redundancy Acts, the health Acts, the Unfair Dismissal Tribunal and many other Acts that have been passed in recent times.</P>
    <P>The State has often found itself in the position of being an unwilling financier, almost, of companies in trouble.  I saw a report by auditors on a series of companies that went into receivership about a year ago and to my amazement I saw that the Revenue Commissioners were owed £650,000 by that group of companies in respect of the PAYE deductions which were made from the wages of the employees and which were not paid over to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is only right that the Revenue Commissioners should have equal priority in that case to get their money.  What is remarkable is that they could allow an amount of that kind to remain outstanding for so long when frequently they seem to put enormous pressure on individuals for small sums of money, like £500 or £1,000.  I think that the State's preference would have to be maintained at its present level, but in practice the State is not really competing with the employees: the possibility of an employee being owed any significant amount of wages is negligible because he simply would not work more than a week if he was not to get paid.</P>
    <P>Senator Conway made the point that many of the fines are not adequate.  They are being increased five-fold in this Bill. In particular, the fines for not lodging <Col N="239" /> documents are not adequate, even though they are being increased five-fold, but the registrar will have power to strike the company off the register after three years, and I think that is more effective than the level of fines.</P>
    <P>In the other House, Deputy Kelly made the point that there is a very finely drawn hierarchy of fines in the 1963 Act and he did not see much point at all in all the distinctions between all the different levels of fines.  I agree with him and I hope we can abolish the distinctions and have just one set maximum fine, say £5,000 or £10,000 or some such figure in the Bill to be published shortly.  It is meaningless to have some of the figures that are in these Bills where companies are concerned.  The difficulty is apparently arising from a ruling of either the High Court or the Supreme Court some years ago that in their view £500 was the maximum fine which a court of summary jurisdication should be allowed to impose.  It seems a very low figure, but that decision was given about ten years ago.  I would hope that a corresponding figure, which today would be about £1,500, might be substituted.</P>
    <P>Senators Taylor and Conway raised the whole basic question of limited liability and the abuse of it.  I spoke on that in some detail in the Dáil as something that one would wish to tackle.  Unfortunately we cannot tackle it in this Bill, but in one of the up-coming Bills I would hope we can.  The instances of abuse of the privilege of limited liability generally given in this and the other House were, unhappily, of some house builders who have frequently, deliberately and consistently set out to abuse the privileges that the 1963 Companies Act affords them to the detriment of unfortunate customers.</P>
    <P>So far as house building is concerned, the kind of reform that I suggest is desirable is that if a building company were liquidated it would not mean the end of the company's and its directors' liability, but that the liability would remain in a personal way with those who were in effect directing the company.  Very often they are not the directors, only typists in a solicitor's office, or people like that, <Col N="240" /> who have been put as the shareholders and the directors, and they do not know the first thing about the company.  If a building company was liquidated in circumstances when it had not fulfilled its obligations, for example to lay out a housing estate or to remedy defects in a house, then the operators behind it would become personally liable for the obligations of the company.  It is remarkable to see in Dublin in a half mile stretch of the same road, the same people building three different sets of houses under three different names, having formed three different companies, and each one saying it has no connection with the others.</P>
    <P>Senator Conway spoke about the need for more disclosure.  That is appropriate for the Bill which we hope to introduce shortly and which will be related to the implementation of the EEC Fourth Directive.  It might be more fruitfully debated on that Bill, which will be dealing with those matters and with the degree of disclosure that will be needed, rather than on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I think that these were most of the points raised in the course of the debate, and I would like once more to express my thanks to the Senators for their remarks in relation to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I understand the urgency with which the Bill has to go through and the slowness that the Minister and his Department are up against regarding any piece of legislation.  With that in mind, I will withdraw a consideration I had for Committee State to push for an amendment on section 10.  However, I reiterate that I believe that in a situation where <Col N="241" /> there are insufficient funds to meet the preferential creditors the Companies Act provides that where there are insufficient assets to meet all creditors in full they must be shared in equal proportions.  In some cases this can be unfair to employees, who obviously should be paid their debts before tax is paid to the State.  I take the Minister's point regarding the horrific situations when the employees have their tax deducted and it is not their fault, and I therefore feel that the employees should not be penalised.  I make a plea to the Minister that when liabilities must be paid in equal proportions the rights of the employees be the first to be safeguarded.  However, I will allow the section to go through.</P>

      <P>I am obliged to the Senator for the view she takes.  Perhaps I slightly misunderstood the point she was making earlier when she talked about the question of preferential payments being abated, or a <i>pari passu</i> arrangement.  I can accept that if there is a very substantial amount due to the State, and unhappily it occurs that sums of up to £1 million are sometimes due to the State, it can create some difficulty for the employees.  In practice, normally employees are very vigilant and I would not envisage a situation where the amount of wages or other sums due to them as a result of an abatement of this kind would be significant.  If, for example, an employee was owed £200 and the State £1 million and there was a 20 per cent abatement, the employee's loss is relatively negligible.  It may be significant enough to the individual but even to the individual it is relatively negligible. It is a point we could look at between now and further Bills which I hope to be able to introduce in the next six months or so.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady, Dublin South-East) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady, Dublin South-East)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-East</i>): The main purpose of the Bill is to improve the law relating to littering and, in particular to strengthen the hand of local authorities in dealing with litter offences and indiscriminate flyposting, graffiti and slogan-writing by means which include a fine-on-the-spot system for litter offences and stiffer penalties all round.  The Bill also introduces new provisions relating to abandoned vehicles and unsightly accumulations of vehicles and disused articles.</P>
      <P>I am sure it will be agreed that these are areas in which we badly need to improve standards in the interest of the environment and the enjoyment of outdoor life.  Unlike many other environmental issues a solution to the problem of litter, graffiti, flyposting and the like does not call for the application of special skills or for a lot of expenditure.  The remedy lies in our own hands.  When people decide that they prefer clean surroundings to littered and untidy conditions and are prepared to make the small effort required to achieve this the problem will be solved.</P>
      <P>The present position, in addition to reducing the enjoyment of outdoor facilities and amenities, has economic implications affecting, as it does, both tourist and development prospects, and it does nothing for our reputation abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To change the position, as it must be changed, calls for a radical change in public attitudes.  It would be consoling to think that litter conditions are the work <Col N="244" /> of a few, or even of a minority.  The conditions which confront us all can only come about from widespread carelessness and indifference.  Many blame the young but even casual observation will show that many adults are blameworthy.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains no magic formula, but what I am proposing should go a long way to ensure a cleaner and more enjoyable environment for everyone.  The Bill is limited in scope to litter and some related problems, including abandoned vehicles.  The limited scope is intentional. Work in reviewing the statutory provisions relating to other environmental matters is under way and I envisage further legislation in due course.  That will be another day's work.</P>
    <P>There has been a noticeable worsening in recent years in regard to littering, indiscriminate postering and graffiti &mdash; writing on public and private property. The writing of objectionable slogans is offensive to the vast majority of people and to visitors.  There is no reason to suppose that existing trends will alter unless firm action is taken to bring about change.  Conditions are especially bad in the urban areas &mdash; the bigger the area the worse the conditions generally.  But these are not merely urban problems.  In the countryside and everywhere people congregate for entertainment or recreation, litter mars the scene.  Scenic areas, picnic places and beaches are scattered with consumer debris &mdash; paper, plastic, tins, glass and all the rest.  Slogans and graffiti are found on walls and roads even in remote areas.  Another serious aspect of the problem is the extent of roadside dumping of rubbish in suburban areas, on the outskirts of towns and even in the countryside.  I should point out that the main impact of this legislation will be to obligate local authorities to play a very active role in clearing up this problem without delay.</P>
    <P>In these matters we seem to have neither sense not sensibility.  We should be able to do better and we must.  The entire community suffers when the habitat is degraded.  It is bad for the morale of people that they should be constantly confronted by litter and dirt as they go about their daily business.  Neither are <Col N="245" /> such conditions an attractive setting for enterprise and economic advancement. It is not surprising that litter and related conditions are among the most common causes of complaint by tourists and visitors.</P>
    <P>Abandoned cars which disfigure the landscape in many areas are an environmental eye-sore as well as a resource loss, since scrap-metal can be recycled.  A related problem is that of unsightly accumulations of vehicles and disused articles &mdash; household, agricultural or industrial &mdash; in prominent locations along important roads or in scenic areas.  I am sure that all Senators can readily call such situations to mind &mdash; sites on which there are old cars or other vehicles, abandoned vehicles, old cookers, washing machines and the like; ancient tractors, cranes and other agricultural or industrial plant are kept in conditions in which they constitute a serious blot on the landscape or are a prominent eyesore.  They may be intended for disposal as scrap, or for use as spares, and these are legitimate and important purposes.  But it is reasonable to expect that some account will be taken of the environmental impacts and some effort made to minimise the adverse implications for the local community, as well as for tourists and visitors.  With a little thought and a small amount of effort the worst effects of many of these sites could easily be avoided.</P>
    <P>There is particular concern with the unsightly conditions that are associated with the increased trading in vehicle scrap and spare parts in and around the large urban centres.  The condition of some sites, and their extent is a disgrace, but local authorities lacked adequate powers to take effective action in all cases. Again, it is commonplace to see vehicle repair and maintenance operations being conducted on or adjoining public roads and streets and leading to seriously objectionable conditions.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provisions enabling local authorities to deal with conditions in all the cases to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I believe that the problem of litter and untidyness must be tackled at local level mainly and that local authorities should be the principal agencies for dealing with <Col N="246" /> them and for encouraging the necessary community interest and support.  In line with this approach, there will be a duty on all local authorities under the Bill to take measures for the prevention, reduction and the removal of litter in section 2.  Apart from collection and disposal work the local authorities will be empowered to encourage and assist public participation and to undertake publicity and educational measures of an advisory nature.  These are very positive and very important powers, but it would be quite wrong to regard litter as simply a matter with which local authorities have to deal. The influence of parents, of schools and of community organisations of all kinds in supporting and complementing the efforts of the statutory bodies, and indeed, in pursuing their own initiatives, will be of decisive importance.  I would like also to say, that the example that children can even give their parents is of vital importance because after all children are being taught civics in schools and it is the impact of such programmes in schools that children can teach their parents a lot in this respect as well.  With this in mind local authorities have again been asked this year to promote campaigns of environmental care and improvement, seeking maximum co-operation and involvement from local community groups and business interests.  There will be special emphasis in the campaigns on measures to control litter and on environmental clean-up operations, together with parallel measures for bringing about positive environmental improvements.</P>
    <P>The littering offence as defined in section 3 is a re-inforcement and extension of the provision in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>In future, littering caused in the course of carrying on a trade or in loading, transporting, unloading or otherwise handling or processing will be clearly an offence. Illegal dumping of refuse from a vehicle can be a major source of litter, and there are problems in identifying the culprits. The Bill provides, that where a vehicle is involved, the registered owner or other person having use of it at the time will be guilty of an offence, apart from the guilt of anyone else.  It will be an offence to <Col N="247" /> leave out a receptacle such as a bin for collection in such a way that litter is likely to result.</P>
    <P>At present the maximum fine applicable on conviction for a littering offence is £10.  The provision has not proved a deterrent.  This is partly because of the impact of inflation on the fine but partly also because of the lenient view which the courts have tended to take of litter offences, as reflected by the imposition in many cases of a nominal penalty.  The time has come for a more serious view to be taken all round of littering, and this should be reflected in the penalty provision and, hopefully, in its application.</P>
    <P>The new limit under the Bill will be £800.  This is a maximum penalty.  I am hoping that in the early stages of the implementation of this legislation justices will mete out heavy penalties to perpetrators of littering offences.  Example must be shown to get this legislation away to the start that we would all like to see our environment.  A litter offence may range from dropping a wrapper in the street to dumping a lorry load of rubbish in an amenity area.  It will be a matter for the courts to fit the penalty to the offence in a particular case, but I hope that substantial penalties will be imposed in all cases involving serious offences under the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, local authorities will have a duty to take measures to prevent, reduce and remove litter. It is just as important that occupiers should keep free of litter any land to which the public have access, or land where the litter would be seen from public areas.  The Bill provides for this in section 4.</P>
    <P>Much litter can occur in the immediate vicinity of business premises.  It is reasonable to expect that persons engaged in business should keep the footpath and immediate environs of their premises free of litter, as indeed is done in shopping centres and by many individual shopkeepers. This is a problem that may be greater in some areas than others and is one where local knowledge and conditions should be considered.  Under the Bill local authorities will have power to <Col N="248" /> make by-laws requiring occupiers, specified classes of occupiers, or those in specified areas, to keep the immediate environs as defined in the Bill, free of litter. I hope, that the business community would go further, especially in the case of shops and premises which are a direct source of street litter, by providing suitable accommodation for the litter which they generate and by posting signs to encourage people to use the accommodation. The Department has already written to various trade organisations seeking the co-operation of their members in this matter.</P>
    <P>The prosecution of litter offences through the courts is costly and time-consuming for local authorities.  To ease the difficulties and to facilitate more speedy and more effective enforcement, the Bill makes provision in sections 5 and 6 for a fine-on-the-spot system.  Under this system an offender may be given a notice by a litter warden employed by a local authority and would have 21 days in which to pay a fine to the local authority office.  The fine initially will be £5 but this may be adjusted by regulation.  If the fine is paid there will be no prosecution.  It will be a separate offence for a person to obstruct a litter warden or to refuse to give a proper name and address when asked for it.  Such a person will also be liable to arrest without warrant by a member of the Garda Síochána.  These are necessary provisions to ensure the co-operation of suspected offenders with litter wardens.</P>
    <P>I would stress that no one will be obliged to actually pay a fine.  If a person who receives a fine-on-the-spot notice would prefer to take his chances in court, he may exercise an option in that direction simply by failing to pay the fine within the prescribed period.</P>
    <P>Littering, as I have said, is primarily a local problem and it is right that there should be a degree of local discretion and some room for experimentation as to the most appropriate and effective enforcement procedures to adopt in local circumstances. It will, therefore, be left to each local authority to decide whether to apply the fine-on-the-spot system in their area <Col N="249" /> or to deal with offenders by way of court prosecution alone.</P>
    <P>There are practical difficulties of course in applying a fine-on-the-spot system to littering which do not arise, for example, with car-parking offences.  I have taken full account of the difficulties. I believe the stage has been reached when most people want effective action to be taken to deal with this problem.  The proposed system can make an important contribution in that direction, that it is a fair and reasonable system, and most importantly, that it will have the support of the general public.</P>
    <P>The existing provisions in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 have not proved adequate to deal with the problem of fly-posting, graffiti, slogan writing and the like.  Those provisions are directed only against the person who puts up posters or writes graffiti, slogans or whatever and, as this can be done at night, offenders are difficult to apprehend.  In addition, no penalty is incurred by those responsible for the advertisements or those who benefit from them.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the person on whose behalf an advertisement is exhibited or, in the case of an advertisement for a meeting or other event, the person promoting or arranging the meeting or event, will be liable for prosecution as well as the person who actually does the damage.  The range of offences is being extended to cover the exhibition of articles such as banners or flags put up without permission.  These provisions are in sections 7 and 8.  There is an exemption for advertisements for public meetings and public elections provided the advertisements are subsequently removed. Likewise, advertisements that are exempted development will not be liable to prosecution under this provision.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will be able to take action directly to remove offending material, or to have it removed.  The local authority may deal with the matter by arrangement with the occupier and on agreed terms.  Alternatively it can serve a notice requiring remedial action to be taken, and if this is not done the local authority itself may remedy the position <Col N="250" /> and recover any expenditure reasonably incurred.  It will be an offence not to act on a notice or to obstruct the local authority if it is enforcing a notice.  An occupier will have a right of appeal to the courts where a notice is served, and certain other defences are provided for.</P>
    <P>The effective use of these provisions by the local authorities will, I believe, go a long way in eliminating unsightly fly-posting which is now so widespread, and will facilitate the removal of graffiti and slogans in future.  It has always been the problem with local authorities that they felt they had not got sufficient power behind them to act in identifying perpetrators of these awful offences.  But this is all now enshrined in this new legislation.</P>
    <P>I turn now to abandoned vehicles. Local authorities will be obliged under section 9 to provide places where vehicles and other metal scrap may be abandoned. There will be no excuse in future for abandoning those in unauthorised places.  It will be an offence under section 10 to abandon a vehicle on land without the occupier's consent.  Provision is made in sections 11 and 13 for the removal of abandoned vehicles from land, if the occupier consents or does not object and for their disposal in accordance with specified procedures.  Vehicles abandoned on public roads or car-parks will continue to be dealt with under existing road traffic legislation.  There is provision in section 13, however, to enable local authorities or road authorities to dispose of an abandoned vehicle, which is removed, without having to store it or go through procedures of publishing a notice etc, provided, in effect, they are satisfied that the vehicle is gone beyond repair.  This will enable local authorities to avoid having to store useless hulks as they do at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision in section 12 for dealing with vehicles or disused articles if it is in the interests of amenity or of the environment of an area.  This could arise, for example, because of their unsightly condition or arrangement and their prominence.  Very often, the necessary improvement in these situations can be brought about by relocating or <Col N="251" /> rearranging the vehicles or articles or by providing suitable screening or fencing. Local authorities will be enabled to deal with such conditions by arrangement with the occupier or the person keeping the vehicles or articles on terms to be agreed. Alternatively, the local authority may serve notice requiring specified steps to be taken, including, if necessary, the removal of the vehicles and other articles. There is provision for a right of appeal against such a notice to the District Court.  The local authority will have power to enforce a notice which is in operation and may recover costs and expenses.  It will be an offence not to act on a notice from a local authority or to obstruct the local authority if it is enforcing a notice.  Procedures are laid down for the recovery by the owner of the vehicles or articles removed and, if they are not reclaimed, for their disposal by the local authority.  In order to avoid a clash of controls this provision, in effect, will not apply where land is being used in accordance with the terms of a planning permission.</P>
    <P>The powers which the Bill will confer on local authorities regarding vehicles and other articles will greatly improve their capacity for securing the removal of eye-sores and improving the quality of the environment in urban and rural areas. For all offences under the Bill, except for the fine-on-the-spot for littering, the maximum fine of £800 will apply.  This figure is fully warranted considering the extent of the problem that now exists.</P>
    <P>I have explained the context in which I am putting forward this Bill and the main provisions.  I recognise that there are other ways in which our environmental legislation needs to be improved and modernised and that work to deal with those is being advanced.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill, confined as it is to litter and certain related problems, is well worth while in its own right and is urgently needed to deal with the problems which are immediate and should be tackled without further delay.  The Bill is in the nature of a first instalment of new environment legislation, and I have confidence <Col N="252" /> in recommending it to the House in that spirit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him well in his appointment.  I believe the Bill will be better dealt with on Committee Stage rather than on Second Stage because it is new and we will only get to the nitty gritty of it on Committee Stage. The Bill has my support and the support of this side of the House in every way. We know that the aim of the Bill, from listening to the Minister's speech this evening, is to keep our towns, villages and countryside tidy and clean.  I am sure the Minister is much more aware of the conditions in urban areas than I am, but quite recently I had the experience of spending a short time in Dublin city and travelling from house to house in it.  I have no doubt about the fact that the bigger the urban area is, the greater the litter problem. Only last night I walked across O'Connell Street and at the end of O'Connell Bridge there were nine, 10 or 11 bags of litter lying around for collection, I presume this morning.  It was hardly late last night.</P>
      <P>It is a great pity that we have to pass legislation to get people to do what they should be doing.  If we had sufficient self-respect and respect for our built-up areas, rural areas and our country generally, we would be in a much better position, but, as the Minister has said this evening, the situation with regard to litter is worsening.  It is desperate to think that we must have penalties as high as a fine of £800 imposed on people to try to get them to do what they should.  It is equally bad to have to have an on-the-spot-fine of £5 and wardens appointed in each local authority to issue documents or vouchers to enable them to collect the fines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking back over the years, one would have thought that the Bord Fáilte Tidy Towns Competition would have been more effective than it has been.  One often wonders if the Tidy Towns Competition is operated in a way that lends itself to keeping a village or town clean, but I will come to that later.  In my own county we have a scheme where the local authority of the area give a prize every <Col N="253" /> year to the cleanest and the best kept national school.  There is keen competition for it.  Practically every school in the county enters.  As the Minister said, it encourages younger people to keep the country clean.  One often wonders if it would not be better had we less legislation and more support from local government, local community action, committees and so on.  If those people could be encouraged by financial means it might be better.  Take the cost to local authorities of refuse collection, which is increasing for each local authority annually.  In my county people in some villages and rural areas are seeking this service and we cannot afford to provide it.  There should be more community involvement. People generally should be more sensible about their responsibilities with regard to litter.</P>
    <P>The penalties under the 1963 Act were ineffective.  But those under this Bill, when it is enacted, will be much heavier and should bear results.  Local authorities must appoint litter wardens.  Even if they do appoint such litter wardens, will difficulty be experienced in getting people to come forward to give evidence in a court?  I doubt that people will come forward. The provisions of the Bill cover all public places, roads, lakes, beaches, picnic areas and so on.  What remedy will be available to the farmers whose land is situated beside beaches or picnic areas if people dump plastic bags, tins or whatever on their land?  It will be their responsibility to have such litter removed.  As the Bill stands I cannot see how such problems can be overcome.  Nor can I envisage any other way of framing the Bill to so do.  Not alone will such people who dump litter cause hardship to the farmer by his having to clean up after them but one must remember than some of the rubbish thrown on his land may be dangerous to his livestock.</P>
    <P>Another matter not covered by the provisions of the Bill is uncovered lorries carrying offal from slaughterhouses which pollutes the whole atmosphere because there is a spillage of waste as they move along.  The Minister will have to insert some clause in the Bill to solve <Col N="254" /> that problem.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that billposting is included in the provisions of the Bill as this constitutes one of our greatest problems. Indeed, we in this House contribute to it from time to time.  We seldom get back to remove posters when a meeting or an election is over.  There is hardly a town in Ireland where one does not see somewhere abandoned cars, lorries or machinery.  These are very unsightly.  I am glad to see that something is being done about that aspect.  It would not appear that to date local authorities will have to provide dumps.  Indeed the recycling of scrap or abandoned vehicles would be more advantageous than the provision of dumps in the middle of bogs for such vehicles.  Refuse dumps are very unsightly.  People come in cars at all hours of the night and dump their refuse.  Next day the local authority may or may not remove it.  All known refuse dumps are infested with vermin.  Something must be done about those.</P>
    <P>With regard to the removal of abandoned cars, the Minister referred to the registered owner.  But most of these abandoned cars bear no registration plates.  It then takes a long time to establish who owns them.  In the long run it would probably be much cheaper for the local authority to remove them.</P>
    <P>Refuse collection in my county cost £120,000 last year.  One of their vans collects refuse every day of the week and the cost escalates weekly if not daily.  I have no doubt that the cost will be £200,000 next year.  For that reason there must be some financial assistance forthcoming from the Department for this purpose so that they can at least maintain this source.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>May I welcome the Minister and wish him success in his portfolio?  I welcome the Bill, which is an essential one and long overdue.  There may be some problems encountered in its implementation.  My interpretation of this Bill is that it is the duty of local authorities to provide sufficient dumping facilities within their districts, affording local people an opportunity of using central dumps or else to provide them with <Col N="255" /> overall refuse collection.  This does not happen at present in most counties.  I would not like, from a legal point of view, to have to defend anybody prosecuted under the provisions of this Bill as they stand.  Unless local authorities provide adequate dumping facilities what access will people have to dumps for old cars, tractors and other unwanted vehicles?  It is not easy for any individual to provide a dump in his backyard.  If local authorities provided such accommodation, whether at a central dump or collection depot, most people would utilise such service to the full.</P>
      <P>With the ever-increasing number of unwanted vehicles for disposal resultant on the ever-increasing number of new vehicles coming on the market, there is no provision by local authorities for getting rid of the former.  I cannot see any prosecution proceedings succeeding until such time as we, at different local authority levels, provide a central dumping place to which people of a county can take their old vehicles or, as the Minister said, provide some facilities for recycling. There are agencies for the recycling of old car bodies.  Some provision should be made for the collection of these vehicles. As Senator Reynolds pointed out, they are to be seen all over the country.  They are dumped on commonages.  While individual owners of lands may be prosecuted, it is very difficult to prosecute a number of people on a commonage where cars and other refuse are dumped both in daylight and at night.  It will be difficult to bring a number of tenants, perhaps 50 or 60, to court and prosecute them for having that type of refuse lying about in open spaces on their commonages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much reference has been made to public places throughout the Bill.  If a person dumps on an individual's land what protection has such private owner against such dumping?  There is no provision in the Bill for that type of dumping.  In most rural parts of the country local butchers and victuallers do not have access to abattoirs.  There is no provision in the Bill for the dumping of offal from slaughterhouses. I know of many local butchers <Col N="256" /> who provide a service in their own right throughout the country but who have no positive or identifiable place of dumping for their offal.  Some of them dump in the sea, more dump in rivers, yet more dump on their own land.  In this type of weather one can imagine the stench emitted from that type of dumping.  There is no provision in the Bill, or no provision to be made by local authorities for dumping their offal.  Such butchers will be prosecuted if they dump in central dumps; they are not supposed to dump offal from a slaughterhouse.  I can foresee difficulties arising from the prosecution aspect. Where rivers flow onto the beaches along our coasts a lot of dumping takes place upstream resulting in a lot of refuse ending up on our beaches.  Quite recently when asked by people in my county to provide additional refuse collection I was bluntly told that if the local authority did not provide such collection they would dump on the beaches.  I am totally against that community spirit &mdash; dumping refuse on beaches &mdash; because it is dangerous for people having access to the beaches, people bathing and so on.  Several accidents have occurred as a result of broken bottles and various other refuse left on beaches.  It is the duty of local authorities to provide local people with sufficient dumping facilities.  Some counties are better than others in this respect.  More moneys must be provided for the provision of such facilities before one can prosecute people who are unable to dump their refuse or old vehicles.  Unless there is provided a central dump or some other location where people can get rid of such vehicles we cannot implement the relevant legislation.  From time to time in our local authority we hire people to collect refuse.  We also hire open pick-up skips. They have no lids, birds peck at the refuse and they are very unsightly if left for any time.  I suggest that that type of skip be abandoned.  I suggest the use of a more modern type skip into which people could dump their refuse without access to birds, dogs and other animals on our public roads where such skips are located.</P>
    <P>Education in our schools and at community level constitutes the only means of curbing this continuous problem.  In an <Col N="257" /> affluent society, with practically every commodity packaged in tins and various plastic containers more and more dumping facilities will have to be provided by local authorities.  I suggest to the Minister that the question of commonages, abattoirs and that of people dumping on individuals' land should be examined before the provisions of the Bill are implemented and before people are brought into our courts and fined.  As I read its provisions one could be fined £800 for dumping a wrapper just as one could be fined for dumping a vehicle. There is no relationship between the severity of the fine and an article dumped on our public highways or wherever.  I suggest that local authorities be provided with more moneys for refuse collection and the provision of identified locations to which people would be able to take their refuse.  I am sure most people would be only too willing to use central dumps were they made available within a reasonable distance of say 20 or 25 miles. I do not think anybody would mind travelling that distance in order to get rid of some unsightly object in his vicinity or perhaps even in his backyard or on his land.  Farmers have a lot of unwanted machinery that could be dumped or recycled. Some guidance and education must be provided for these people.</P>
    <P>I know the Bill is necessary.  In a tourist country like ours it is unsightly to see so much waste dumped along our public roads.  Nowadays one can take waste from one county to another.  One can put one's refuse into one's car boot, drive across the border into the next county and dump it at night on any commonage, which is happening on a large scale throughout the country.  Probably it will be innocent people who will be caught as a result of the implementation of this Bill. But before people are brought into our courts for dumping or prosecuted the Minister should take cognisance of the absence of facilities for the dumping of offal by, say, butchers, dumping taking place upstream in rivers and that on individuals' private land.  I have read the Bill but as far as I can ascertain there is no protection for landowners if people come at night and dump refuse on their <Col N="258" /> land.  I welcome the Bill or indeed anything that would help to clean up our countryside.  Being a tourist country everybody should contribute.  I wish the Bill every success in its implementation. But I feel I should mention these loopholes. I feel also that the Minister should take a decision to provide the dumping facilities about which I have spoken.</P>

      <P>First of all I should like to welcome the Minister.  The last time he appeared in this House had something of a controversial nature about it, but that was the last Seanad so he is very welcome to this one, particularly with a Bill which is non-controversial except perhaps in some matters of detail.</P>
      <P>Anyone in public life must be concerned about the problem and must welcome any attempt to alleviate it.  The appropriate comment about the Bill is that it is overdue &mdash;&ldquo;más maith is mithid&rdquo;.  May I congratulate the Minister on supplying, for once, a good Explanatory Memorandum.  By &ldquo;for once&rdquo; I mean that in my experience Explanatory Memoranda are generally a waste of time and paper.  They simply repeat, unimaginatively, the complex phrasing of the Bill itself.  This one does try to tell us what the Bill is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would make a good subject for perhaps a sociological or history seminar to discuss why it is that we are such an exceptionally scruffy people.  It is something I do not like saying because I am committed to this country.  But it is as well to recognise its faults.  When we return from abroad, for example, from a western European country, the tendency is to shudder at the all-prevailing filth.  It may well be that we are in this respect, as in some others, marred by the historical process, that we have come through history in a slightly maimed and crippled way.  It may be that we are litter louts because we are anti-authority or perhaps because we were for so long, a rural people where littering did not matter very much in the sense that the litter was, so to speak, natural litter.  The problem is &mdash; as Senator O'Toole mentioned &mdash; that we are now an affluent society; we are indeed an effluent society as well.  The <Col N="259" /> problem is caused by the detritus of modern technology.  But if other countries can solve, if you like, the overflow of the consumer society there is no reason why we should not.  I think we lack a sense of identification with public property.  We do not readily identify with parks and roadways as belonging to us, as imposing an obligation on us.  There is a sense of alienation here, a sense of contempt almost.  It is by no means a class or locality phenomenon, because one sees middle-class louts as negligent in this area as are people from what one might call deprived areas.</P>
    <P>What has failed is the voluntary campaign which has been at work intermittently for some time.  We are all aware of the slogan but being aware of it is about all, we do not really implement it &mdash;&ldquo;Don't be a Litter Lout&rdquo;.  Perhaps one other possible cause of the phenomenon is that we, in Ireland, lack any real sense of the visual, we are not horrified by visually repulsive things.  Apparently we can take in our stride enormous obscenities of buildings, violations of the line of streetscapes and so on.  I think the litter problem is related to the lack of visual education.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Reynolds who said that the problem is particularly noticeable in urban areas &mdash; that is true &mdash; and he instanced seeing several plastic bags in O'Connell Street last night.  Perhaps the litter problem was on my mind coming into Leinster House this morning, but outside the gates of Leinster House itself there was an unsightly distribution of rags, papers and cigarette ends which certainly would not have impressed the Grand Duke of Luxembourg last week; presumably they were swept away for him.</P>
    <P>By the way, I am glad the Minister suggested in his explanatory memorandum &mdash; though I could not see it borne out in the sections of the Bill &mdash; that the problem of, shall we say, unwanted flags and so on would be dealt with under sections 7 and 8.  I take it that that means local authorities will have immediate power to deal with such offensive displays as marred Cork city centre for the greater <Col N="260" /> part of last summer.  I refer, of course, to the unsightly and sinister black flags put out by the supporters of the H-Block campaign and which apparently for a long time the local authority was powerless to do anything about.  Perhaps they were afraid to do anything about it.  But, whatever the reason, here was a newly developed amenity area in Daunt's Square in the centre of Cork city marred by such display.  I hope local authorities will have new teeth to deal with that kind of problem.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the litter problem which do not seem to be dealt with specifically in the Bill, though I notice the Minister has promised that there will be further Bills to deal with other nuisances.  We have in our streets in recent times handsome new CIE double decker buses in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere and the upper deck of these buses is already defaced by graffiti and by cigarette ends.  The habit of cigarette smoking &mdash; I speak with all the fanaticism of a convert &mdash; has, as one of its lesser but still serious manifestations, a very grave litter problem.  I do not know if this can be dealt with under the Bill.  I hope it can, but if not it should be dealt with in a further Bill.  It is enough to make you weep when you see how underdeveloped CIE are in terms of rolling stock and then when they get new buses to see them almost immediately being vandalised in this unsightly and unhygienic fashion.</P>
    <P>I come now to another matter which does not seem to be specifically referred to in the Bill.  Perhaps the parliamentary draftsman was too genteel to deal with this, but since I do not suffer from the same gentility I have no such inhibitions. I hope you will not think it is too indelicate. I refer to the unsightly, unhygienic and nauseating sight of canine excreta all over our towns and our suburban pavements. This is intolerable.  It brings up the larger issue of why we suffer such a proliferation of dogs in this country, which are nuisances in more ways than one.  It is an example of the selfish individualism that we manifest as a people.</P>
    <P>Other countries face up to this embarrassing problem, sometimes in ways that <Col N="261" /> strike us as quite comical.  In certain European cities the dogs are accoutred as babies are at home.  In the United States it is my experience of going for a walk at night with my American friends and colleagues that they take their dog along on a leash, which is virtually unheard of here.  They also bring along their little implements to deal with whatever process of nature may occur in the course of the walk.  Why we cannot do that is beyond me.  As the Minister suggests in his memorandum it would not cost a penny.</P>
    <P>We will have to deal with the canine threat sooner or later, particularly if rabies come into this country, which is a very strong possibility.  I have seen the most astonishing contrasts in this regard. I will leave it at this point.  I have seen well heeled ladies and gentlemen presiding serenely over Fido's open defecations on our public pavements.  A stiff fine should be imposed on them.  I strongly urge the Minister, if this is not covered by the Bill, to bring in a Bill very quickly to deal with this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the penalties in the Bill.  The whole point of the Bill is to update the present ineffectual penalties.  Like Senator O'Toole I hope there will be a distinction between the penalties, since some offences are much more heinous than others.</P>
    <P>On the matter of dumps we all welcome the new responsibility and powers which have been given to the local authorities under the Bill.  Are the local authorities always responsible in this area?  What happens if the local authorities ignore their obligations under the Bill?  Will there be a penalty for local authorities?  I do not think, with respect to the local authorities, that they should have waited for this Bill to deal with such eyesores as the dump between Dingle and Ballyferriter, which is an exquisite introduction to the Kerry Gaeltacht, an area of unrivalled scenery.  The other day I stopped driving on a scenic and lonely, beautiful mountain road through the mouth of the glen called Béal a Gleanna, between Reenaniree and Ballingeary in west Cork.  I stopped precisely at the point in the turn of a road which affords <Col N="262" /> you a marvellous view eastwards through a great valley and there underneath at this point were the substantial beginnings of a new dump.  It would be wearing to give further examples of this kind of thing.  One welcomes the provision for penalties in the Bill and one hopes that the enforcement will be systematic.</P>
    <P>There are at the moment provisions for companies like Córas Iompair Éireann to enforce existing litter laws in buses and trains but they do not seem to have any real sanction.  The Bill will be worse than useless unless it is determined to enforce it systematically.  I welcome the Bill, which is not before its time.</P>

Measaim féin go bhfuil sé thar am go gcuirfí Bille mar seo faoi bhráid Thithe an Oireachtais.  Táimid, mar adúirt an Seanadóir Murphy, ag féachaint ar bhruscar agus ní fheicimid é.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill because for too long we have turned a blind eye on the whole problem of litter in this country.  Fly posting has been done <Col N="263" /> indiscriminately all over the country not just in urban areas but in rural areas.  In my 20 years as a member of a local authority I have argued and fought that something be done about fly posting. Eventually we have it in this Bill, and I am very glad of it.  Most of the fly posting is done by people who are earning a substantial amount of money by the free advertising and publicity they get from fly posting.  I hope that those who are engaged in running functions in which fly posting is done, when they contravene the law and the law is enforced, are heavily fined.</P>
    <P>There is only one little worry I have about the complete banning of fly posting. It will affect those who travel around, giving quite an amount of pleasure to the young and to those who may be still young at heart.  I refer to the circuses. Could there be some clause inserted that circuses could have a special type of bill posting they could put up and take down as they go from one village to another and one town to another?  Since I was a boy and I suppose since all the rest of the Senators were children there was nothing we looked forward to as much as a circus coming to the village or the town in which we lived.  Maybe those who were born in the larger urban and metropolitan areas would not appreciate the circuses as much as those in rural areas did.  One of the pleasures I had of reading bill postings was when a circus came to town. Maybe the Minister might be able to help these people, who have a very hard life and still give an immense amount of pleasure to people of all ages all over the country.</P>
    <P>We will have to get much more strict on dumped vehicles, because they are really the new defacers of rural Ireland. Not alone are those who dump cars defacers of rural and urban Ireland but the garage owners who leave their cars in the forecourt of their garages are defacing the country with this terrible type of litter. It should be incorporated in the Planning Act that any new garages that are built have enclosed compounds in which all those cars must be kept so that it will be an offence for a garage to have all these <Col N="264" /> wrecks dumped where they are really an eyesore and where they catch the eye of not alone the local people but of visitors and tourists.  I would be very grateful if the Minister would ask the Minister for the Environment to incorporte a clause in a Planning Bill so that this type of litter and defacement of the country would be forbidden.</P>
    <P>There is another type of littering of our streets not alone confined to the larger towns and the larger urban areas but which has now come down into the smaller rural areas and even on to the roads, that is mobile shops, mobile markets, mobile fish and chippers.  It seems to me that there has not been any attempt at all to curb the activities of those people.  The people who are in business on their own account pay very high rates to the State for the luxury of providing themselves with a living, but those who are going around in mobile shops in market places and with their mobile cafeteria and fish and chippers only need a licence which costs something in the region of £5 or £10 per annum and they can trade almost wherever they like.</P>
    <P>I believe a clause should be introduced so that anyone who wants to street trade, to run a mobile shop, or to run a mobile cafe should be made pay the local authority area in which they are trading a sum of money equivalent to the amount of rates the average shopkeeper pays.  Not alone would they not be putting the shopkeeper at a disadvantage but this would curb the way in which they litter and destroy the streets and the roads of our towns and our countryside.</P>
    <P>We will have to get much more strict with these many open lorries which are driven through our country and through our towns with a lot of offensive material. A lot of the liquids from those materials seem to start flowing out as soon as a lorry starts off after being stopped in a village or a town.  It is really not alone an eyesore to see this stuff pouring along the road but I am sure it is a health hazard.  It is offensive not alone to the eye but is offensive to the nostrils.  The amount of penalty up to now for this sort of thing was so small that it was cheaper for the people who were providing this <Col N="265" /> service of removing offal from one place to another to take the chance that they would be fined in court the maximum fine than to take suitable measures in order that their lorries were watertight and closed so that the offal could not fall from the top of the lorry and the odour could be got right through the towns and villages of the rural areas they were passing through.  We have been far too lenient with these types of offenders.</P>
    <P>There is another type of litter, which does not appear to be so bad, that we get from open lorries, that is the lorries that go along with their large loads of gravel and stone.  In order that they can bring as much as they can they pile it up.  This falls off the lorries along the roads.  This is litter.  It may not be the litter of plastic bags or fish and chip bags, but it is litter. It is ruining a lot of our roads and a lot of our countrysides.  It is dangerous.  I have often been driving along the road behind one of those lorries when the driver decides that 45 or 50 miles an hour is not fast enough to get to his destination and he goes at 60 miles an hour.  As soon as he starts to go to 60 a layer of the stuff comes off.  When you are driving behind him you wonder if your windscreen or your radiator will still be there when you get home.  These are other areas in which we should be a little more strict.</P>
    <P>One thing that particularly worries me is that while we are bringing in legislation to prosecute the offenders of dumping and to make the fines and the penalties more realistic we have not, as yet, properly tackled the provision of public dumping places.  Any Senator who has served on a local authority will know that each week there are extra demands on local councillors to provide garbage services to rural areas and to outlying rural areas. Because many of us feel that these people are as much entitled to a service as their counterparts in the urban and semi-urban areas we are sympathetic towards their requests.  If we accede to all those requests we then have another problem, where to put the stuff.  We come along and say, &ldquo;right, there is a quarry that has been used up and is no longer of commercial value and the owner of the quarry <Col N="266" /> is prepared to lease it, rent it or sell it to the local authority&rdquo;.  The engineering staff of the local authority put it to the county council that this would be a suitable place in which to establish a dump. The next morning or maybe that night when the local councillor arrives home from the county council there are at least 60 cars outside his house with the petition that the dump is not put in that area because it is in their area.</P>
    <P>Maybe at times they are right.  Maybe the standards that are laid down for dumps are not sufficient.  I do not think there is a national standard for dumps.  I think that the Department of the Environment should have consultation with the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards and say to them.  &ldquo;Look, we need a standard for the places in which we are going to dump the household and commercial refuse of this country.  We need those standards to be so high that at no time will the places in which we have these dumps be of an offensive nature to the people who are living within half a mile of where they are set up.&rdquo; Until we tackle the problem of the actual area in which we are going to dump we may be talking a little bit pie in the sky about penalties for dumping.  If we do not have official dumping places of a sufficiently high standard that will not be offensive to anybody we will not be allowed by the public to put in those dumping places and there will be no place in which to dump refuse.  There are counties where there are no places to dump refuse.  The local authority of which I am a member, are finding it more difficult day by day to find places where we can dump ordinary household refuse.</P>
    <P>When this Bill has passed into law it is important that the teeth be shown.  There is no point in passing a Bill if it is not enforceable or enforced.  This is what has happened with a lot of laws.  While superficially they are good, they are not enforceable or have not been enforced. If we had enforcement of litter fines, that people become public spirited, it might help us in the great problem we have with ordinary law and order.  If this small thing was tackled at an early stage and if people got used to the fact that they do certain <Col N="267" /> things in order to be members of society, they would not resort to other types of law breaking and disorder.  When I was young and going to school in Naas there was a story told about a young man who was up for stealing a sheep.  He was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged.  The executioner asked him had he one last request.  He said: &ldquo;Yes I have, I would like to whisper something into my mother's ear.&rdquo;  His mother was brought up on to the gallows.  She stood beside him and he whispered into her ear but she screamed and stood away.  When she did this the people discovered that he had bitten off her ear.  They asked him why he had bitten off her ear and he said: &ldquo;If she had punished me the day that I brought home the penny I had stolen I would not be here today for stealing a sheep.&rdquo;  We should do the same thing with our laws.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa, os é seo mo chéad uair labhairt sa tSeanad nua, treaslú-leat as ucht do ghradam nua agus, freisin, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an tUasal Ó Brádaigh.  I would like to welcome this Bill because it sets out to control the whole problem of litter which is causing such ill-effects in our community, our countryside, and is a source of annoyance to many people.  I would like to qualify my welcome for the Bill not in a contentious manner but, as a member of a local authority, certain aspects of the Bill touch me.  A certain word has been used a lot in the debate here today, that is the word &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; in connection with abandoned vehicles.  In some sense, this Bill is like an abandoned baby foisted on local authorities to implement without any mention anywhere in the very fine introduction to it by the Minister of the money to pay for its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We read in the Bill that it provides for measures to be taken by the local authorities. We read elsewhere that steps should be taken by the local authority.  Again we read that the local authority should introduce a system of litter wardens.  All this effort will cost money, and I am sure members of local authorities will appreciate the point that I am making.  Unless <Col N="268" /> adequate funds are made available to local authorities, this Bill will not bear fruit.</P>
    <P>As we all know since the derating of houses and the subsequent grant-in-aid system carried out by subsequent Governments, local authorities throughout the country are floundering under increased costs and costly bank deficits.  They are becoming increasingly frustrated by the efforts to provide even the statutory demands that are imposed on them.  Each year Bills are passed in this House which impose further financial strains on local authorities.  For instance, the recent Fire Services Bill, which passed through the House in the last term, made no provision for funds to be made available to local authorities.  I appeal to the Minister to look into this matter of making sufficient funds available to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of litter we all know that litter is one of the side effects of a consumer-orientated society. It is a side effect of the disposable system of packaging goods.  This is causing great annoyance to our whole countryside.  It is unfortunate that Bills have to be drafted to enfore cleanliness in our community. It is unfortunate that people should be forced under the shadow of a penalty to keep their community clean. Down through the years various efforts have been made by different organisations, local authorities in particular, to keep our communities clean.  Our county council workers in rural Ireland deserve great credit for their contribution to keeping our streets tidy and clean.  Local authorities have provided dumps, with their problems afterwards, and problems still to be faced in many areas.  They provide litter bins and they have played their part with limited resources down through the years.  Likewise, Bórd Fáilte and the regional tourist boards have been concentrating tremendous effort on focusing attention on the need to present a clean country to our visiting tourists. Local organisations, community councils, and tidy towns associations have played a tremendous part in this effort.  Apart from drafting legislation to deal with this problem there should be a more intense publicity drive to promote <Col N="269" /> the concept of cleanliness and tidiness.  A more thorough campaign should be carried out through our schools to ensure that school surroundings and village surroundings are kept clean.  It is only by inculcating in the minds of our youth that we can get the message across that it is important to keep our country clean.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillaHannon" hpid="Mrs. Hannon Mrs. Hannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate you on your election as Cathaoirleach and to wish you every success.  I would also like to welcome the Minister to the Seanad and to congratulate him on this excellent Bill.  I welcome it because it is a positive approach to the very serious litter problem that now exists, and sets about giving powers to local authorities, litter wardens and the courts to remedy the situation.  Most of our towns are a positive disgrace.  I was walking through a country town recently and two little girls were playing a game &ldquo;I spy with my little eye something beginning with L&rdquo;.  It was not difficult to make out what they were talking about.  The word was litter.  It was to be seen everywhere. Our countryside is now infested with litter. A favourite pastime for some city motorists appears to be not just to take a nice drive in the country but also to get rid of unwanted litter.  I am delighted to see that this offence is covered under the Bill.</P>
      <P>A guild of the ICA in my area had a project to clean up their neighbourhood and they collected several tons of rubbish deposited in this fashion.  There is a saying that you never get a second chance to make a first impression, and I dread to think what some of our tourists think about our country.  They must think us very careless, slovenly and dirty, and I am sure this is the impression they are bringing back to their own countries about us.  We must do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Abandoned and burned out cars are a common sight on many roads and the environment of many areas is destroyed by an unsightly collection of dismantled vehicles.  It is dreadful to see businesses dealing in scrap and spare parts being carried out in residential areas causing as one would expect, great annoyance to <Col N="270" /> their neighbours.  Again many buildings have been defaced by unsightly slogans and notices.  I am glad that all of these offences are included in this Bill, and the sooner it is put into operation the better. To make it a success it will need a positive approach by local authorities and all those concerned with its implementation. I was also glad to see in section 2(d) that the local authorities would be undertaking the provision of facilities and services, including publicity, advisory and educational services.</P>
    <P>Education in this area is of prime importance.  It is important that some sort of programme be devised for our schools so that our young people will realise that the indiscriminate dumping of litter that now exists will not be tolerated in the future.  They should also be reminded that it is every citizen's duty to see that our country is clean and beautiful.  Why not a school art competition for an anti-litter poster that will be used in a national campaign?  This would get our young people involved and thinking about the subject.  The few litter wardens that now exist should be supplemented.  A large number of our young people are unemployed, and they are the people who should be trained as litter wardens.  There may be money available through the 1 per cent youth unemployment levy and the local authorities should go after that because this could be an excellent job for them.  Their job should not be just imposing fines on the spot.  They should also be involved in this school programme and have talks where any large crowd congregate. Have any of you looked at a hall after a meeting and noticed the amount of litter on the floor?  After a football match, race meeting, on our beaches and so on, the place is left in a mess. Announcements asking people to deposit litter in the litter bins provided should be made at public meetings.  More litter bins must be provided and emptied very regularly. There is not much sense asking people to deposit their litter when bins are overflowing.  I am very fortunate living near Trim and the people have a great pride in their town.  They have won the Tidy Towns Competition on two occasions. They have been runners-up on several <Col N="271" /> occasions and they have always been in the reckoning.  That is because every citizen in that town is an unpaid litter warden.  If you were so foolish as to drop a paper on that street you would get a nice tap on the back and be told to pick it up and put it in the box.  They say it in such a nice way that you could not be offended.  If more towns had this attitude, there would be no need for the Bill.</P>
    <P>We are indeed a throwaway society. Bottles, jam jars and so on which used to be returnable in the past now have to be disposed of.  There is a great need for re-cycling facilities, especially in rural areas.  Hundreds of tons of articles suitable for re-cycling are dumped every year because no facilities exist.</P>
    <P>In section 7 of the Bill it is stated that no prosecution will be initiated for electioneering posters and so on provided they are removed within seven days of polling taking place.  Here is where we should lead by example.  The by-election is now over for 14 days but in the by-election area there are still plenty of posters and they should be taken down immediately.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for this Bill and I sincerely hope it will achieve the desired result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. T. Conway Mr. T. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be associated with the many Senators who congratulated the Minister on his appointment and welcomed him to the Seanad.  I would also like to welcome the Bill.  It is an uncontroversial Bill, which has the support of all sides of the House. Contrary to what other Senators have been saying about the state of the counttry as far as litter is concerned, it is my belief that there is a growing national pride in small towns to keep the countryside clean.  That is in no small measure due to the efforts of Bord Fáilte for the promotion of the Tidy Towns Competition. I pay tribute to them for their efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill for the many provisions it has for dealing with the abuses in the form of abandoned vehicles on our roadsides and streets in our towns.  We have a particular problem in the bogs <Col N="272" /> where cars and old vehicles are dumped indiscriminately and left there for many years.  I presume this Bill gives power to local authorities to move vehicles from our bogs and roadsides.  I would also welcome the Bill for the manner in which it gives power to litter wardens to impose fines on the spot for leaving out bins with no lids and for having torn bags with refuse spilling all over the street.  I am a member of the local authority, and on the Naas Urban District Council we have a bin staff which are claimed to be the best such staff in the county.  They have a system whereby they dispose of any bin they feel is not adequate.  They take it up and throw it on the refuse collection bin. At times this has caused annoyance to certain individuals but, on the whole, it has served to remind residents to keep their bins in a proper state of repair.  It also gives power to the local councils to deal with graffiti and slogan writers and with the people who, in effect, cause the annoyance, because it is high time that this problem was dealt with and that the councils had power to remove this slogan writing from the walls of the towns.</P>
    <P>Fines are important and the on-the-spot-fine is a good way of enforcing the law.  When working in England I often had to walk over a mile to deposit an empty cigarette package for fear of incurring a fine, so the fine, if imposed, would act as a deterrent against future offences.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to Senator O'Toole's contribution in which he referred to the problem of the odour coming from uncovered trucks going through towns.  They leave a dreadful odour and I agree they are the major cause of pollution in towns.  The local health authorities should investigate this situation and find out what effect it is having on people's health, but I think it should be incorporated in the Bill that these lorry owners should be fined for having uncovered lorries.</P>
    <P>The canal which runs through County Kildare is the property of CIE and is at most times choked with weeds and all sorts of articles.  I think CIE should be prosecuted for allowing the canal to develop into such a state.  The only way <Col N="273" /> to deal with the massive problem affecting the beauty of the countryside to which Senator Murphy so poetically referred, is to legislate and educate.  We have the legislation and I believe that the idea of the fines to which I have referred before may not be the way in which to deal with the litter problem.  The only way is to get the backing of the people, and you can do that through education.  Great example is being shown by tidy towns committees and by residents' associations and the wonderful job they have done in many areas.</P>
    <P>I would urge that this important Bill be circulated to schools and, as far as possible, time should be brought on radio and television to promote the concept of tidiness.  A tidy society is a caring society and, therefore, I welcome the Bill and accept its limitations.  I would also like to be associated with Senator Murphy's remarks about the explanatory document, that it was very good and brought us through the Bill very simply.</P>

      <P>As this is my maiden speech I would like to congratulate you Sir, and wish you well in your new post. I would like you to pass on the same sentiments to the Cathaoirleach.  I would also like to welcome the Minister to the House and to congratulate him on this Bill.  I am glad to hear that this is the first in a series of Bills dealing with environmental hygiene.  If the Minister appointed a person with a third level qualification to the post of environmental hygienist to each significant local administration area, it would help in the problems ahead.</P>
      <P>The growth in the fun foods and fast-foods industry and also the phenomenal increase in the number of outlets in which such products are sold has created an almost volcanic source of litter.  It should be possible to have specific conditions relating to the control of litter in planning permissions for these enterprises which would help in that area as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte should be congratulated for organising the Tidy Towns Competition. Like Senator Hannon, I believe that it creates a sense of awareness and pride when one does well in that area.  It has <Col N="274" /> made everybody aware, where organising committees are involved, of the problem of litter, and Trim and Malahide are better places because of the competition.</P>
    <P>In view of the careless manner in which events are publicised by way of bill posting in public places, section 7 is most welcome.  However, it is useful at times to promote community events of bill postering and local authorities by tastefully designing some display boards and also selecting the places where they should be placed, could allow some controlled advertising of community events.  It might help Senator Conway's circus posters if this was done.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 to 13 are of exceptional importance, as abandoned vehicles are both a visual affront and a physical danger. As in Dublin North, many people, especially the farming community, are having their fields destroyed by these abandoned cars and they could do with some help from the authorities.  I am delighted that this Bill will give the local authorities the power to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>Like the rest of the speakers here I hope that the moneys will be available for all these provisions and if that is forthcoming I am sure this Bill will be very successful.  This Bill has far reaching consequences all of which are beneficial to the public interest.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and I would like to welcome the Minister to the Seanad.  I am sure he must be fed up listening to comments on litter.  I would like to congratulate the Minister, as Senator Murphy did, on his fine explanatory memorandum which has gone a long way in clarifying the Bill.  The provisions are praiseworthy and any attempt to improve the overall cleanliness of our countryside in whatever way possible is to be admired and welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In improving the law &mdash; and it has been mentioned by previous Senators &mdash; it is useful in so far as it can be fully and <Col N="275" /> forcibly implemented.  If a law is ignored it becomes useless.</P>
    <P>The various areas of litter have been well dealt with right across the board, and I am not going to go into that, but there is one area that I would like to draw attention to and there is a special provision made for it in the Bill, an exemption for advertisements for public meetings and public elections.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that aspect of it and make billposting at election time illegal.  I do not think it achieves any worth-while purpose, and sometimes long after the election is over these posters are left there. They are distasteful, not only to the local persons who are sick looking at the same old faces and names, but also to the tourists who come into the country.  The experience in other countries is that they do not go in for that type of election advertisement.</P>
    <P>There should be some procedure monitored by the local authority whereby proper display boards would be made available in certain strategic locations.  It is not necessary to have every telegraph pole and every wall sign posted for miles of the road in one area with one type of poster and a similar one in some other area.  At the end of the day they are torn and I do not think they are of any value.</P>
    <P>There is increasing difficulty in finding dumps in local authority areas.  Local authorities have been less than responsible in the past in maintaining the dumps they have.  For that reason there are innumerable objections from people living adjacent to dumps.  Whilst it has been raised by members on numerous occasions, nonetheless they do not have the power to get involved and ensure that proper handling of dumps is maintained. For that reason there will be additional difficulties in finding suitable places for dumping, and that leads to the major rural problem of having no proper dumps.  When people create their own dumps how do you enforce the law?  You have to have witnesses to enforce the law. That has been the experience that we have had in my local autority.  If somebody is not prepared to come forward and say that somebody was seen dumping <Col N="276" /> in that area then it is very difficult to enforce the law or to bring about the type of situation that is provided for in this Bill.  There are many difficulties there that need serious consideration.  It is fine to introduce something on paper but we need the wherewithal to enforce it and that brings us back to the cost of implementing some of the provisions.  It has been mentioned that local authorities already have serious financial constraints imposed on them and any additional moneys which will be necessary to implement this Bill will have to be provided separately, over and above what is already available within the ambit of the financial schemes.</P>
    <P>Another important point is the transport of cattle and the various types of lorries and the way they are used.  They leave a terrible discharge on many of our country roads and sometimes even passing through towns and cities.  The effluent from them needs to be dealt with.  Apart from the unhygienic aspect and the danger it creates to health and road users, there is also the awful possibility that it could spread disease.  We have pursued that matter in our own areas and the gardaí have been useful to us.  Unfortunately, fines are so small that people ignore them.  I see that as an area that demands immediate attention.</P>
    <P>The Tidy Towns competition has been in operation for a long number of years and has been very successful.  The areas that have promoted that type of tidy town development have been successful in many cases.  This is where the family, schools and all forms of educational programmes and advertisements have value. It would be unfair to say that the publicity given on television for the litterbugs has not been successful.  It has been successful, and has created in the minds of young people an awareness of the problem of keeping their towns, schools and their own homes clean.  This is an ongoing thing.  Prevention of littering is more important than punishment as a result of depositing litter.  I hope to see a programme which will make people aware of the need to put sufficient money into youth schemes, cleaning up certain areas and trying to prevent fining people and <Col N="277" /> make them aware of what is necessary.  I have been to America and have found the cities and countryside exceptionally clean.  The same is true of Great Britain, and yet when you come back into your own country, as Senator Murphy said, you find graffiti and all sorts of ugly and distasteful slogans.  Having said that, I hope the Bill will be successful.  I congratulate the Minister on having gone into all the different aspects of it and I would also like to congratulate the people who drafted the Bill.  I hope it will be a successful beginning to a cleaner Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I would like to compliment the Minister on the introduction of this long overdue Bill.  I cannot see why it has taken so long for such an important Bill to reach this stage.  I hope the Bill will have the unanimous support of this House and that it will prove to be noncontroversial. For far too long local authorities have been hindered in their efforts in dealing with litter offenders and in particular their efforts in bringing individuals who abandon cars and such like to justice.  This Bill will strengthen the hands of local authorities, as they have been hampered for too long.  To travel the countryside and see the number of abandoned cars and likewise is nothing short of a national scandal.  It is nothing for the image of Ireland and the Irish people abroad.  We are going to suffer in the long run and it does nothing for the morale of our people.  The sight of an accumulation of disused vehicles located on main roads which are being used by the people who own them for the purpose of selling spare parts is nothing short of a disgrace.  I hope the Minister, through his Department, will send a directive to each local authority informing them of the powers which he has given them in this Bill and asking them to enforce them, so that this country can be cleaned up and made a little more accessible to foreigners.  As a Senator has <Col N="278" /> pointed out already, it is patently obvious when we come back from foreign parts that the first thing that strikes us when we leave the airport is the amount of litter. We have a lot to answer for.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy in his address stated that he is a recovered smoker.  At this stage smoking has become socially unacceptable through advertising and the efforts of the health boards and other authorities.</P>
    <P>If the proper effort was put into the implementation of this Bill, the problem of litter around the country could also become socially unacceptable.  Anyone who is out early enough in the morning and drives through towns, particularly on a Sunday or a Monday morning before the local authority, urban district council, refuse collection trucks get around will be amazed how so much litter can accumulate, particularly in streets where there are fast food take-aways.  I am delighted that the Minister has in the Bill a provision that such establishments will be held responsible for litter which accumulates outside their premises.  I am also glad that he has empowered the local authorities to enact by-laws whereby they can force such establishments to ensure that their frontages will be kept clean.  I wish the Minister every success in his office, and he has my full support for this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points that I should like to make.  The Minister said the business community do not go far enough as regards keeping their areas clean and premises in a proper condition of cleanliness.  Being a member of a local authority, I am very conscious of the fact that the planning departments of our local authorities are not being stringent enough as regards our new shopping complexes.  These areas, being quite new <Col N="279" /> as regards planning, are quite dirty with regard to litter.  There is one thing which always seems to be missing in these complexes, and that is an incinerator.  I fail to see why we cannot make a ruling that in a complex with about 30 shops there should be an incinerator.  I know of no complex where that has been recommended by the planning departments. The blame lies with the local authorities and the planning departments of each authority.</P>
      <P>One cannot blame the people with premises in these complexes for the fact that there are 50, 60, or maybe 100 bags of litter every second night being discharged from these complexes.  I know of the existence of this situation in the Cork area and I am sure it must be the same in the Dublin area.  I do not know of any such place where there are incinerators, though they are quite cheap.  Incinerators can generate heat and in other countries, I understand, where dumps are not available in some cities or big towns large incinerators are in use as heat generators and a saving is made by burning what is not needed.  Has the Minister been looking at this type of idea?  Are the planners being told about it and if so why is it not being implemented?  I imagine that the cost of eliminating the rubbish from these complexes would be higher than the cost of supplying incinerators..</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his speech, said that cars dumped in fields can be moved if there is no objection from the owner of the land where the vehicle is dumped, but vehicles abandoned on public roads or car parks will continue to be dealt with under existing road traffic legislation.  We are giving some rulings to the local authorities to implement and the other rulings stay with the road traffic legislation, in other words the police.  If there is a car on the side of the road which is not mobile, how am I or anyone else within the local authority to say that it is or is not mobile if the law says that it must stay there?  That car might not have wheels but at the same time it could be mobile.  Would the Minister clarify those two points?</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, whose concern about environmental matters is not recent: for some years past he has had an extensive and great interest in environmental matters. It is appropriate, therefore, that the measure before us today is something in which he has had a long and continuing interest.</P>
      <P>As a student of history I cannot help thinking that we are historically, whether we like it or not, an untidy race.  There are only a few towns that were deliberately planned and laid out by individual planters who came to our country.  I think of one on my way home, Tyrrellspass, which was laid out by Lady Belvedere many years ago.  There are roads and a green and houses in a ring and it is perfect, something resembling a painting in a child's book.  Other such towns around the country which were laid out in that way have remained so.  They are easy to maintain because they were laid out in a structured way.  I do not wish to praise one and denigrate another.</P>
      <P>Many of our forebears had to live in very poor circumstances.  They lived in villages that started perhaps as just a couple of cottages and then grew and grew and straggled upwards and downwards with no plan.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a general way on the environment, I think that many of the faults which we find in our towns and villages can be traced to our historical background. I am not taking the blame away from us as a people but I am saying that it is in some way due to that fact.  Some of the unplanned towns, like Topsy in &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo;, just growed and growed and growed and suddenly were practically out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers here today referred to the Tidy Towns Competition and the great work that local committees initiated and funded.  This has been of great worth in many villages and towns in Ireland, but the worthwhile effects have been of a scattered and spasmodic nature.  Where there was an energetic chairman, energetic committee and an energetic secretary those committees worked very well. But as is the way of all committees, sometimes they work and sometimes they do <Col N="281" /> not, and in any event it was all too much of a scattered and voluntary nature.  The voluntary nature must remain, because legislation of this kind will not be effective unless it is backed by very dedicated voluntary effort.  I would like to pay tribute to those various groups who down the years have played their part and will continue to play their part in this very worthy effort.</P>
    <P>The Minister quite rightly said that the obligation will be on the local authorities. On one hand I welcome the devolution of extra power to local authorities.  As members of local authorities we sometimes bemoan the fact that there is an erosion of our powers and we find ourselves with less responsibilities when we want more.  With latter-day legislation like the Water Pollution Act and various Acts passed in recent years, we have more powers accruing to us.  The implementation of this Litter Bill will require, along with its mandatory instructions to local authorities, directions as to the funding and financing of the litter warden service.  As the Minister said, he means the Bill to have teeth and that is a correct line to take.  There is no point in saying that in the beginning we will relax and then we will work up to severity.  If the people are to believe in this Bill we will have to see that the fines will be imposed and if offenders should be brought to court that the courts will treat them with severity.  The people will then take it seriously.</P>
    <P>There is a point in the Minister's speech about political slogans.  Senator Dowling cited a European habit whereby political parties do not erect their visages at election times and if everybody did that nobody would want to do it.  It is a very necessary and acceptable part of campaigns here that posters are erected with either the names or photographs of the candidates.  I agree that they should be removed later.  If we are to be seen to have veracity and validity in what we are doing by promoting this Bill, we will have to be very vigilant when the next election, which I hope will not be for a long time, comes up, and that we remove the posters which were erected.</P>
    <P>Increased consumerism has brought <Col N="282" /> great advantages.  Everything is packaged in pretty packages, from household articles to cosmetics to food, and it has become a way of marketing that the more striking and presentable the package the more that article will sell.  These packages have to be disposed of.  As an ex-teacher and a parent, I think the children can have more influence on the parent than <i>vice versa.</i>  Most teachers try to inculcate in their pupils habits of general discipline which has as one of its offshoots general neatness and tidiness of themselves and the environment.  Children could be the great bearers of the message from the Dáil and the Seanad of this Litter Bill. When this Bill becomes law there should be a very comprehensive publicity campaign launched with it, and this should be aimed particularly at young people, not that they are the offenders but that they would carry the message back to the adults who are the offenders in many ways.</P>
    <P>Those of us who live in scenic and tourist areas, and Athlone on the River Shannon is one of them, find ourselves daily offended by the graffiti and slogans, particularly those of an anti-other-country nature.  I refer in particular to the slogan &ldquo;Brits Out&rdquo;.  I cannot see what good this will do.  I certainly would not like to go to England and see a massive slogan as I alighted from my train or car saying &ldquo;Irish Out&rdquo; or something to that effect.  Graffiti have a long and honourable tradition throughout the centuries, but I refer to graffiti of a humorous and poetical nature.  I once read that in the old Roman baths there were graffiti, but of a humorous nature.  The graffiti we see now are hateful and offensive.  Apart from this they are affecting our pockets. One would not want to be very sensitive to take exception to some of the graffiti that adorn our tourist areas.  I welcome this Bill.  It is imaginative as well as structured. There are great areas for scope in it.  I wish the Minister well in the implementation of it.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, fáiltim roimh an Aire Stáit.  Is fear fiúntach, cumasach é, fear go bhfuil anshuim aige in a chuid oibre.  Chuir sé an <Col N="283" /> Bille iontach seo os ár gcómhair anocht agus guím fad saol dó agus gach rath ar an iarracht íontach atá á dhéanamh aige chun deireadh a chur le fadhb an bhrúscair sa tír seo.</P>
      <P>May I highly commend the Minister for the excellent speech he gave today.  I only wish that a copy of that speech could be read, studied and digested in every household, school, church and headquarters of every sporting establishment.  This will have to be done, because the magnitude of the task before the Minister and before each and everyone of us who detest litter of any form is something that the country has not faced for years.  It is a colossal task and cannot be carried out unless we get the people behind it.  The toleration of litter apart from its creation is one of our national sins.  It is a failing that seems to be endemic in us.  That has been there for a long time and especially nowadays with the advent of new materials. I refer in particular to plastic bags which are practically indestructable unless they are put into an incinerator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had to face a litter problem many years ago in the school in which I taught. I attacked it in two ways, and I think if the Minister follows the same lines we may get results.  First, I got the schoolchildren and parents behind me.  I got them all thinking that we had to get rid of this menace around the schoolyard.  I had their goodwill and total co-operation. Second, I indicated how this would be done and laid out the penalties if it was not done.  We made war immediately on paper of all kinds &mdash; paper is the most offensive in any school.  We ostracised sweets, bars of chocolate, anything wrapped in paper &mdash; these were completely outlawed.  The plastic bag problem was quite simple: children were instructed to fold their papers and their plastic bags neatly when they had their lunches eaten, put them back in their bags or satchels and take them home for tomorrow's lunch.  If they did not abide by that instruction they had a choice of two things, and the senior children always saw that one or other of these things was done.  It might seem draconian, but it was done.  They had a choice of (a), swallowing <Col N="284" /> the papers or plastic bags, or (b) putting them into the waste paper basket. They invariably put them in the waste paper basket.</P>
    <P>Following on those lines, I suggest that the Minister will have to spearhead a campaign, involving the co-operation of every sporting organisation, of every school and of every factory.  It can be done.  Every political party through its organisation should get every cumann imbued with the idea of making this a healthier and a better and a cleaner place to live in.  That would have a great impact as far as our tourist industry is concerned, because I know from travelling on the Continent, as I am sure other Senators do, the difference between the countryside on the Continent and here: it has to be seen to be believed.  Parties in other countries will have their picnics, their sporting fixtures and so on, but they clean up after then.  There would be no unnecessary stuff left around.  Here it is the opposite.</P>
    <P>The co-operation of the churches should be sought.  We have the name of being a religious people and I suppose we are, but on the other hand if cleanliness is next to godliness then I am afraid we are far from being a godly people.  These are suggestions I put to the Minister.  A national campaign will have to be initiated. We must get the goodwill of the people behind it because if we do not we will not succeed no matter what the penalties are.  I hope the penalties will be enforced.</P>
    <P>We should provide dumps for ordinary litter and dumps for toxic waste, and I would like to hear the Minister's views on this when he is replying.  There seems to be no definition of &ldquo;litter&rdquo; in the Bill. Maybe that has been done deliberately. We are left in no doubt as to what litter means.  It was a very good idea not to define it absolutely because in the context of an earlier reference to the canine tribe it might be difficult to define litter as covering the things that Senator Murphy was referring to, because if you refer to the canine tribe you will also have to refer to the tribe: whatever about Mr. Murphy's dog, there will be Mrs. Murphy's <Col N="285" /> cat and there will he Mr. Jones's donkey and there will be somebody else's horse. All these things will be categorised.</P>
    <P>I would make a special appeal to all public representatives of every party to get together in this and use their undoubted influence to make a colossal effort to rid the country of this scourge of litter.  It is a shameful thing to have to say about our beautiful country.  We have this toleration of this scourge, and I can only ask the blessing of God on the Minister in his campaign which I hope will be 100 per cent successful.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Minister's speech with interest.  There is no doubt that its provisions are very good but I am somewhat pessimistic.  It is an excellent Bill, if it works.  Is this Bill really workable?  I am dubious, because its success is dependent almost entirely on local authorities.  I have been a member of two local authorities for more years than I care to admit, and I feel that the record of local authorities as far as filth, dirt, litter and squalor are concerned is far from good.  One has only to drive along local authority housing schemes in many parts of the country to realise that what I am saying is true, yet this is the body that is expected to dictate to others as far as litter is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the domestic refuse collections. In many villages and many towns, open tractors are still in use and the covered wagon for refuse is more the exception.  Vehicles of this kind do more to spread litter than anything else.  Itinerants move from place to place leaving behind them a lot of dirt, and local authorities in many instances fail to do anything about it.  But the greatest offenders in this regard are not itinerants. There are also travelling business people <Col N="286" /> who sell mattresses and furniture, recognised as wealthy people, who move around the country leaving litter behind them in car parks, roads, villages and towns.  I wonder how can they be dealt with under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us in his speech that the fine for littering up to now was £10. I would be very interested to know how many people have been brought to court on a littering offence in the last ten years. The success of the Bill would seem to depend a lot on litter wardens.  I know the Minister has been asked this question before but I ask it again: who pays these litter wardens and what happens the on-the-spot fines that are collected?  If the local authority can keep them, then obviously this would be a perk and an encouragement to local authorities to ensure than on-the-spot fines take place. But litter is not just dropped between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. from Monday to Firday. I wonder how many litter wardens would be required in any average-sized town? Obviously, to be successful, wardens will have to be on duty seven days a week, 14 hours a day, after dances, outside fast-food shops, restaurants and so on.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the provision in a section whereby the establishment is held responsible if litter is found outside it.  But this will be very difficult to prove in any court of law.  The onus will be on the prosecution to prove that at three o'clock on a Sunday morning the litter that was dropped came out of a particular establishment.  That is why I am a little dubious, not about the Bill but about its operation.  The Minister has gone as far as he can go to ensure that it is a success provided he produces the money to pay the litter wardens, because if the Minister does not produce the lolly, local authorities will not employ the wardens.  Many people on the other side and many people who are members of local authorities know that what I am saying is correct.</P>
