      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Senator Tras Honan be elected and do now take the Chair of the Seanad as Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>I have much pleasure in proposing Senator Honan for election as Cathaoirleach. She has been a Member since 1977.  She has shown herself to be an active, effective and dedicated Member of this House and I believe she has all the experience and qualities to fill this position with credit.  If elected, she will be the first lady to fill this position, but I would like to point out that she and her family have a long association with this House.  Her husband, Derry Honan, was a Senator for many years and before that Senator T. V. Honan was a Member of this House for almost 20 years.  Therefore, there is an association and a tradition which I am sure will help her in the position if she is elected.</P>
      <P>Before concluding I would like to pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach in the outgoing Seanad, Senator Charlie McDonald, who carried out his duties with dignity and impartiality and upheld the high standards of his predecessors.  In this context I would like to express my regret that his immediate predecessor, the former Senator Séamus Dolan &mdash; who again upheld these traditions very well &mdash; is not amongst us today.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I move that Senator Tras Honan be elected and do now take the Chair of the Seanad as Cathaoirleach.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas ormsa, a Chléireach an tSeanaid, cuidiú leis an moladh sin.  Is rud nua é bean a bheith mar Chathaoirleach ar Sheanad Éireann agus is ceart agus is cuí sin sa saol atá ann <Col N="10" /> inniu, agus mar sin tá áthas orm cuidiú leis an rún seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Níl mise chun aon ainm a mholadh mar Chathaoirleach ach ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá i dtaobh na ceiste.  We have neither in Dáil Éireann nor in Seanad Éireann a firmly established custom with regard to the election of the Chairman of the House. We have over the years wavered between two approaches.  We started off with &mdash; and at times have since followed &mdash; the practice of the United Kingdom parliament, from whom we derived many of our procedures, in first of all taking care in choosing the speaker and then not allowing this choice to be affected by change of Government.  On the other hand, we have at times followed the Continental custom whereby the presiding officer in any House of Parliament is nominated by the largest party in that parliament.  It is important above all that elections to the Chair of Seanad Éireann should not be matters of controversy. Accordingly, it is my personal opinion that we should attempt in the Seanad to follow a procedure under which there can be no real element of ambiguity.  Therefore, it is appropriate that the nomination for the Chair should come from the largest party in the House and that it should not become a matter of controversy.  This is not the only instance, I might remark in passing, in which we could in this House initiate the transition from some of our older methods of procedure to procedures which are common and indeed standard in Continental parliaments and which are more suitable to the situation we all face today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am certainly personally gratified that a woman has been put forward as the candidate of the largest party for the position of the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann.  I was happy indeed when perhaps the first move towards that position was made when Senator Evelyn Owens was appointed as Leas-Chathaoirleach in 1973.  We had also in 1981 a further move towards women achieving office in this House, not just because they are women but because in their own right as being the persons thought best fitted, when the <Col N="11" /> former Senator Gemma Hussey became Leader of the House in 1981.  I am also happy when I look to my right to find here on the Opposition front bench that both Fine Gael and Labour have thought fit to choose among the people to take their seats on the front bench are women in the persons of Senator Katharine Bulbulia and Senator Mary Robinson.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, for all the reason I have given it is entirely appropriate that we should not enter a name for election and that we should not contest the nomination of Senator Tras Honan whom we are sure will be an excellent Chairman of this House and continue the good traditions which we have in this House whereby we have respect for the Chair.  It does not guarantee that Senators will never go out of order.  It does not guarantee even that they will immediately come back into order when the Cathaoirleach wags a finger at them.  We have had in this House a tradition that even if we are occasionally disorderly it is always in a minor sense.  I hope that that tradition will continue and I wish Senator Tras Honan well during her period as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in the remarks of Senator Dooge on the nomination of Senator Tras Honan for Cathaoirleach and would agree totally with the remarks that he has passed both in trying to establish a precedent in this House and ignoring the precedents that are often broken in the other House.  We have in this House in the past always tried to stick to relevance in ensuring that the business of this House is run in a fair and proper manner.  I think Senators on all sides of the House have always established a principle among themselves of fair play.  It is appropriate that the Government in this House should have the prerogative of nominating their Senator as Cathaoirleach.  I certainly will go along with that precedent.  I would like also to feel in establishing that precedent that the Government would agree that the Leas-Chathaoirleach should come from the Opposition side, but that is a matter for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="12" /> It gives me great pleasure that the Government today have chosen Senator Tras Honan to fill this exalted position of Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  I have known Senator Honan for a number of years.  She is a person of tremendous ideals, a very warm nature, tremendous character and great spirit.  The fact that she is a woman is important, particularly as she is the first woman to be nominated for, and I hope will successfully fill, the Chair of this House.  It is history in the making for our fair sex who have joined us in the political field and who have not alone held their fort in politics &mdash; which is to say the least a tough game &mdash; but have proved they are as good if not better than men at all stages in their performance in this House.  Apart from that she has been nominated to be elected to this House by a most important organisation who cater for the mentally handicapped. They have chosen a stalwart to fight on their behalf.  She has never flinched from this commitment down through the years in this field.  For that organisation &mdash; many of us have had close associations with them &mdash; today must be a red-letter day.  Finally, on a very parochial note, while extending to Senator Honan best wishes on my behalf and that of my party, I must remark that in the news this morning and last night when her name was mentioned the banner county claimed her as a Clare woman.  She is from my own County &mdash; Tipperary.  We are proud of her and she is the pride of Tipperary. She is not just &ldquo;the darling girl from Clare&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Is tábhachtach an ghnó é an post seo a líonadh.  Cathaoirleach a cheapadh.  Tá súil againn go mbeimid anseo ar feadh trí nó ceithre bliana ar a laghad agus san am sin beidh an-teangmháil againn leis an gCathaoirleach. Tá gradam agus cumhacht ag baint leis an bpost sa Bhunreacht agus leis an té a líonann an post.  Tá mise sásta &mdash; agus lán sásta &mdash; go mbeidh Tras Bean Uí Honáin go hiontach don phost.  Nach breá sásúil comónta an téarma &ldquo;Cathaoirleach&rdquo;. Ní bheidh aon ghá le Madame Chairperson ná aon tseafóid mar sin.  Is bean tíriúil, cumasach í.  Is tírgráthóir go <Col N="13" /> smior í agus thar aon rud eile is é an Seanad Teach a rogha.  Tá sé seo antábhachtach. Is annsa léi an Seanad ná an Dáil.  Ni fhéachann sí ar an Seanad mar chúlbóthar go dtí an Dáil.  Glacaim leis chomh maith go bhfuil sí líofa sa teanga Ghaeilge.  Chun an ghnó seo a stiúrú ba chóir go mbeadh Gaeilge ar a thoil ag gach Cathaoirleach i dtreo is go mbeadh ar a chumas an teanga a úsaid sa Tigh féin agus sna coistí éagsúla a bhaineann leis an Tigh, i gComhairle an Stáit agus i gcomhrá lena chomh Sheanadóiri.  Is é a deir Riail 16 de Bhuan-orduithe an tSeanaid: Déanfar imeachtaí uile an tSeanaid trí Ghaeilge nó trí Bhéarla; agus dár ndoigh is é a deir Bunreacht na hÉireann féin, Alt 8.1: Ó is í an Ghaeilge an teanga náisiúnta, is í an phríomh theanga oifigiúil í.  Tá stadas na Gaeilge sa tír seo an-lag i láthair na huaire, go mór mhór sa chóras oideachais agus sa saol poiblí trí chéile.  Dá gceapfaí Béarlóir ina Chathaoirleach ag an bpointe seo, go mór mhór i gcomhthionól chultúrtha mar seo, céim síos millteannach a bheadh ann do chúis na Ghaeilge.</P>
      <P>Seachas sin ar fad, dar ndóigh, tá Fianna Fáil, thar aon phairtí eile, díograiseach i gcúis na teanga &mdash; nó sin mar a éalaíonn siad.  Ní bheadh de dhánaíocht nó de chur-i-gcéill iontu &mdash; tá mé cinnte &mdash; duine do ainmniú don ardphost seo a bheadh balbh ina theanga dhúchais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have been saying, I welcome Senator Tras Honan's nomination as Cathaoirleach. I am a firm believer in the principle and practice of putting a woman on top for a change.  She is a person of integrity, as has been said, possessing competence, honesty and patriotism.  She has, moreover, a qualification for this office which is not necessarily shared by all her Senatorial colleagues in Fianna Fáil or indeed in the other two parties, and that is that Senator Honan is committed to Seanad Éireann as the Chamber of her choice.  She has made it quite clear in public contribution and in private conversation that she does not sit in this House as someone who condescendingly puts up with inferior lodgings, but who is prepared to use its amenities in order to secure accommodation by and by in a <Col N="14" /> more <i>de luxe</i> establishment.  Neither is she being put out to pasture for services rendered.  To borrow a succinct phrase of my own, she is neither sharpening her teeth nor licking her gums in this House.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to what I consider a very serious matter, that is the importance of having a knowledge of Irish for this exalted office.  I take it for granted, of course, that Senator Honan is fluent in the first official language. Article 8.1 of the Constitution makes no bones about the primacy of the Irish language and Standing Order No. 16 of this House draws attention to the fact that the business of the House shall be done in both official languages.  Remember that we are talking about the business of the Seanad in the House, in Committee, in the Council of State and in the whole network of contact between Senators that adds up to the whole experience of the Seanad.  I am convinced that the Fianna Fáil Party, one of whose two national aims is to restore the Irish language, the spoken language of the people, the party who in the steps of their founder are so unflaggingly and unremittingly devoted to the Irish language, would never be so audaciously hypocritical as to nominate a candidate to this high office who is not equally fluent in the two official languages. Mar sin fáiltím go croíúil roimh ainmniúchán Tras Uí Honáin mar Chathaoirleach agus gura fada buan í i mbun a cuid dualgas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from the same county and the same town as Senator Tras Honan, I would like to say that once fate and circumstances decided or ordained that the next occupant of this Chair would come from the Fianna Fáil side of the House, I am glad that that honour has fallen on her shoulders.  I believe that she will bring to the Chair the same measure of dedication and commitment that she has brought to the many positions that she has filled in Clare and elsewhere.  I believe that she will also preserve the same measure of impartiality and fair play that we have had from her predecessors in that Chair.  I wish her very well indeed.  I expect that she will add a measure of colour and excitement <Col N="15" /> to the House which, in fact, might be a good thing.  Because of that and because, as I said, I come from the same county and town, I indeed welcome her nomination for the position of Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>I would like to join in the tributes that have been paid to her predecessor, Senator Charlie McDonald, for the fairness and impartiality that he extended to all of us during his occupancy of the Chair. I would like to pay a tribute also to former Senator Séamus Dolan who was always equally fair and impartial to all of us.</P>

      <P>As Senator Murphy has remarked, I cherish this House, its work and its traditions. I am delighted to see so many of my old friends back here today on all sides of the House.  I welcome the new Senators, particularly the two Senators from across the Border.  I hope that they will find their work here rewarding.</P>
      <P>I ask for your co-operation so that I can carry out my duties as Cathaoirleach in the manner which those who went before me have done so well.

      <P>Before commenting on the Order of Business, may I take the opportunity of extending my personal congratulations to you as An Cathaoirleach. I recall your contributions on both sides of the House and that is an excellent training ground for being a very fair and helpful Cathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like at this stage on the Order of Business of the first sitting day, as I did on the first sitting day of the last Seanad on 8 October 1981, to ask the then Leader of the House, as I now ask Senator Eoin Ryan as Leader, when it may be possible to have the necessary motion to establish the Joint Committee on EEC legislation.  I urged this on the last occasion because I pointed to the fact that when the first joint committee was automatically dissolved at the general election in May 1977, the new committee was not re-established until late December 1977 and did not begin work until end-January 1978 and I was anxious that <Col N="17" /> the committee should be established at the first opportunity.  Although we did pass the motion through this and the other House, the committee was not established before the general election this time.  Now we have the position that there has been no joint committee scrutinising draft EEC legislation since May 1981.  Neither has there been scrutiny of the implementation here of EEC law.  When we look at the scope, the penetration, the importance and the way it affects every aspect of our lives, it is a matter of great urgency.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a direct appeal to the Leader of the House, having been a distinguished member of the Joint Committee on EEC legislation, to take it upon himself to seek actively the tabling of the necessary motion so that the committee can be formed.  I hope he will ensure that this committee will be working before the Houses rise for the summer recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">

      <P>On the Order of Business, may I point out that I and some of my provincial colleagues received the Order of Business only yesterday in the post: though the results of the elections for Seanad Éireann were known nearly three weeks, it is extraordinary that we got such derisorily short notice.  Of course this is not the fault of the officers of the House but one hopes that it will not set the pattern for the session of this Seanad. It has also been customary for some of us on the first sitting day to express our hopes for the House and that it will be a more significant forum in public life than it has been up to now.  Earlier I was glad to pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach's commitment to the House.  May I make the same point about the Leader of the House, Senator Eoin Ryan.  I renew an appeal I made last July that the Government should make whatever contribution they can, and soon, towards a better performance of this House in the role allotted to it by the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public do not know or care very much about the existence of this House. We all know that it has fallen from the high role which was originally allocated to it under the Constitution.  I hope that the Cathaoirleach will preside over a <Col N="18" /> reformed Seanad, or a Seanad in the course of reform, during her term of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator Robinson's observations, it is hardly necessary for me to point out that the primary responsibility during the last eight or nine months for getting this joint committee into operation was not on those who were in Opposition at that time.  I share her concern that this joint committee should be set up as soon as possible, particularly in view of the fact that it has not been in operation for so long.  I will do everything to ensure that it is set up as soon as possible and that the necessary resolutions will be passed in this House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the observations of Senator Murphy, I share his general views about the importance of giving this House as much work as possible and enabling it to play an important part. Again, in so far as it lies in my power, I will ensure that that will be done.</P>

      <P>Disagreement on Seanad amendments are rare and insistence by the Seanad in the case of disagreement are rarer still.  We, in the Seanad, can be gratified at the fact that many amendments are made in this House and accepted by the other House. There are, however, occasional disagreements and the procedures are there for dealing with the reconciliation of the disagreements. In this instance it would not be appropriate that the Seanad should attempt to insist on the amendment that <Col N="19" /> it made to this Bill on the last sitting of the old Seanad.  It is true it would set in motion an interesting procedure in regard to reconciliation but I do not think that invoking this procedure, which could turn out to be quite lengthy, is appropriate in regard to this Bill.  Despite all the debates on the Bill in both Houses I have personal doubts about its constitutionality and in my opinion, the sooner it gets to the Supreme Court the better.</P>
      <P>I do not want my failure to urge the Seanad to stand by the decision with regard to the Bill as indicating that I accept that the Seanad has no right to insist on amendments when it thinks fit or that the Seanad has no right to reject a Bill which comes to it from Dáil Éireann.  There is a tendency from time to time to say that there is something inferior in the mandate of Seanad Éireann.  That is something which this House cannot accept.  In my time in the Seanad there have been few cases of outright disagreement.  I remember one case in 1964, when on the Pawnbrokers Bill the Minister for Justice of the day became somewhat irked by what had been said on the Second Reading debate and refused to reply.  On that occasion the Seanad, quite rightly in my opinion, the Minister having refused to reply to the debate, refused to pass the Bill and sent it back to Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>There is another case which I wish to recall in making these remarks, a case which is important in the political and parliamentary history of this country.  In January 1959 Dáil Éireann passed the 1959 Referendum Bill by a majority of 19 votes.  In March 1959 the Seanad, which is supposed to lack the popular mandate of Dáil Éireann, rejected the 1959 Referendum Bill by one vote.  The subsequent referendum which took place because Dáil Éireann had the parliamentary power to insist that the Bill would ultimately pass, the Referendum Bill rejected by the Seanad, having been passed most comfortably by the Dáil was rejected by the people by 33,667 votes. In this case the Seanad Éireann mandate proved to be in line with the popular will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that insistence would be <Col N="20" /> appropriate on this amendment at this time but there may well be times in the future when I would be arguing cogently in a different direction.  I will always argue cogently that this House should maintain its right to examine legislation with due preparation and care, taking an appropriate time for the job and making up its mind as a collective House of the Legislature on the merits of what is before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the Senators who participated very actively on Committee Stage and supported the amendment put forward by Senator O'Leary, I would like to take this opportunity when we have a motion proposing to disagree with that amendment adopted by the Seanad, to take strong issue with the Minister for his reaction to the adoption of the amendment by the Seanad.</P>
      <P>On the evening that that was done he issued a public statement, and a few days later, at a Fianna Fáil meeting in the Dublin West constituency, he issued a further statement.  He accused Senators who had participated on Committee Stage of the Rent Restrictions Bill, and particularly those of us who had supported the amendment, of being mischievous, childish and irresponsible.  It is important to take an opportunity to refute that categorically.  I believe that the record of the debate on Committee Stage in this House refutes it.  Anybody who looks at the record of the debate will have no doubt at all, not only that that was a serious and conscientious debate but that it was an extremely necessary debate, because it was very worrying indeed to see the number of serious issues on which the Minister did not know what was the position: for example, how the whole mechanism for rent subsidy by the Minister for Social Welfare was going to work or how the detailed regulations in relation to standards of rented accommodation were going to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the amendment, the Minister attempted to add to the public alarm and apprehension on this whole issue by suggesting that Senators had put tenants at risk by adopting that amendment.  He knew that was not so because there was <Col N="21" /> already passed and signed by the President a continuation Act which continues the position until 25 July.  There have been doubts expressed, including doubts by the Minister, about its constitutionality, but the reality is that it is already in operation and it would be doubtful whether it could be challenged in that intervening time.  He also knew that it would be a much earlier date, 13 May, by which time the Dáil would have had an opportunity to consider the Seanad amendment and the Seanad would have this opportunity to consider what the Dáil had done.  He was deliberately adding to apprehension, and I know that it had an effect on a number of tenants.  They were worried that their position was not legally secure, and it was perfectly legally secure.  That was an abuse of his position as a Minister in purporting to suggest that Senators had acted in an irresponsible manner.  We had not acted in an irresponsible manner.  We acted in a manner in which I hope we will continue to act, which is to look at legislation, to point out areas where it is defective and to seek to improve it.</P>
    <P>I stand over my belief that the amendment was an improvement on the section, which is a very difficult section to apply. As it stands at the moment, the section is going to give rise to great inequities and unequal treatment around the country. There are so many subjective elements in it which individual district justices are going to have to try to apply.  It may be, as Senator Dooge has suggested, that it will be referred by the President to the Supreme Court and will be determined at an early stage whether that section is compatible with the Constitution. It may be signed by the President but will await the threat of subsequent challenge as to its constitutionality.  It is a bad reflection on the Seanad, for which we heard some support in the earlier speeches here this afternoon, that the speech by a Minister, repeated a few days later, made allegations in the manner in which he did, which were not in conformity with the reality of the debate, which was a very serious and constructive debate in which there was no attempt to introduce irrelevant material.  When we <Col N="22" /> had that debate in the Seanad it was clear that Senators on both sides of the House were deeply concerned about the tenants affected.  We wanted to secure the position at the earliest possible moment and to bring in legislation to create the best balance between the rights of landlords as established by the Supreme Court and the position of tenants who hitherto had been in sheltered and protected tenancies.  Many of these tenants were very vulnerable and very old.</P>
    <P>The worst aspect of the statement issued by the Minister was that it aggravated and exaggerated their fears and created an impression in tenants that they were once again without legal security and that this was the fault of Senators.  If we, as I hope we will, adopt the approach suggested by Senator Murphy that we regain for this House some of its standing and stature then it must be on the basis that this House can and should look at legislation on its merits and be prepared, even at the inconvenience of Ministers &mdash; and I certainly accept that it was inconvenient for the Minister to have to go back to the Dáil &mdash; to look at things on their merits and to propose amendments if they are warranted.</P>
    <P>If Senator Dooge does not wish to press this, then we in the Labour group will not press it as it was a Fine Gael amendment put forward by Senator O'Leary, but I want to make it clear that the Labour Party believed that that amendment was an improvement on the Bill, that we are less happy with the section to fix rent restrictions without that amendment, that we believe it is a worrying section &mdash; worrying because it is possibly legally defective and may be so found by the Supreme Court, but worrying also from a policy basis because there are no parameters, no ceiling on the rent that a district justice may fix.  A district justice in deciding on the eight or nine parameters he has to take into account in deciding what is to be a just and proper rent may fix the rent at any level.  There will be no ceiling on the amount.  Considering the location of some of these rent restricted properties, it could give rise to great inequity, unfairness <Col N="23" /> and further worry to the tenants whom we are trying to protect.</P>
    <P>I believe that the good faith of Senators was called into question by the Minister, and I wanted this opportunity to refute categorically that there was any substance in what he was saying.  I believe that his statement contributed to the apprehension and fears of very vulnerable members of our society.</P>

      <P>Listening to Senator Robinson, I was brought to my feet to remark that I do not think it is quite right to put the case in the way in which she has put it.  By her remarks she more or less insinuates that the Minister had made the statement as though he was the person who was absolutely and totally guilty on this issue.  The circumstances in which this motion was brought before the Seanad should be made known.  In actual fact this very day in the making of a little programme on RTE I remarked about that issue.  It is a fact that the previous Coalition Government were in the majority in this House at that time: I think it was 16 April if my memory serves me correctly.  This new Seanad had not been elected.  The old Seanad with the previous Taoiseach's nomination of 11 Senators was sitting in this House at that time.  There was a Fianna Fáil Government then in existence. I think that Seanad and the mover of that motion in the Fine Gael Party in particular were quite wrong to take upon themselves the right to object at that time, at the point where we were &mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have now a Taoiseach who has sacrificed the right in this House of a political majority.  I listened for many years to many of the Independents, and University Members in particular, talking about the way in which this House has been brought into the realms of party politics, how it should be stopped and the Seanad should be separate.

      <P>As a University Senator, though not really of the university, I was not here when this amendment was put. Many people presumably would have expected that I would have been a great supporter of that amendment.  I would support many things that members of Fine Gael particularly tend to aspire to, often when it is safe to do so, and when there is no possibility of them having to pay for the consequences of their actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke here when the first Rent Restrictions Bill was put before this House and so did at least one supporter of the Government at the time, Senator Quinn, and pointed out the inadequacies of that particular piece of legislation.  The then Government rammed that legislation through this House with their safe majority, without any concern for rational debate, rational amendment or anything like that.  To be fair, Senator Robinson was the one exception on the Government side who abstained on at least one vote on that particular Bill. What I find fascinating is how people rediscover their social consciences when they are distanced from office but their social consciences disappear when they have the burden of office on their shoulders. I speak as one who came into this House with a view to defending the interests <Col N="26" /> of those whose interests are rarely heard.</P>
    <P>This particular piece of legislation is extremely important to a relatively small, uninfluential but extremely vulnerable group in our society.  I, for one, deeply resent a lot of the party politics that came into this because it must have been known that the amendment would not be accepted by the Dáil.  It must have been known that there was no possibility of that amendment being accepted.  I do not understand the motivation for an amendment when the previous legislation left tenants in those properties open to unqualified, blind market forces.  There was a minimal period of adjustment but effectively rents were to be determined by blind market forces.  I fail to see the consistency of those who advocated this amendment which has now been rejected by the Dáil but who could not even find time for a couple of days to consider rational amendments to that particular piece of legislation when it came before us in the early days of the last Seanad.</P>
    <P>I think the Bill is appalling.  It is an appalling reflection on our society that we cannot legislate about property without having to give deference to an antiquated Constitution and to rulings of the courts which I suspect are influenced as much by the class background of the members of the Supreme Court as they are by anything else.</P>
    <P>As one who has a strong commitment to the poor, the voiceless and the deprived, I resent the way a piece of legislation, which is extremely important to the welfare of the most vulnerable in our society, seems to have become a political football.  Social justice is a safe issue as long as you do not threaten powerful interests and as long as you do not have to take the consequences for your good ideas.  I wish to God that people had not played politics with the poor, which is what they did with this piece of legislation.  I wish to God that people who did not see fit to take exception to the initial legislation did not claim then to rediscover their social conscience when they were in a temporary and obviously ineffectual majority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to follow Senator Ryan in the attribution of motives of one kind or another in the discussion here on the Bill.  The French have a saying &ldquo;The absent are always wrong&rdquo;.  I have a great affection and regard for Senator Sean O'Leary who I think graced the House while he was in it.  I believe, knowing him, that the amendment which was his brainchild was put forward in good faith.</P>
      <P>It was an amendment with which I did not happen to agree.  I said it was his brainchild, a kind of complicated actuarial brainchild, but I did not believe that it would achieve the purpose, if implemented in the law, which he hoped it would.  His point was that it would help to fix a limit to rents and, therefore, favour the tenant and by extension the people who Senator Ryan calls the under privileged, the poor and deprived.  I thought that it could equally be interpreted as giving the landlords the benefit of a generous and statutory provision for a maximum value.  Therefore, I thought that the amendment was ambiguous and I voted with the Government against it.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Eoin Ryan's motion that we do not press the amendment.  At the same time, I must support Senator Dooge when he said that this House has its rights and its obligations under the Constitution to put forward amendments to legislation.  It would be neglecting its duty if it did not do so when it saw fit.  While I take Senator Killilea's point, I think the point the Minister had in mind when he made a speech which offended Senator Robinson and others, was that it was the lame duck nature of Seanad Éireann at that stage which made the amendment objectionable.  The Constitution says nothing about lame duck Seanads.  Here is a House of the Oireachtas, legitimately constituted, doing its business with responsibility, and it had every right to pass that amendment.  I support Senator Dooge, in principle, and I share some of Senator Robinson's resentment at the Minister's speech.  The principle I accept, but at the same time I support Senator Eoin Ryan's motion.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome Senator Honan to the Chair.  I regret not your presence in the Chair at the moment, sir, but her physical absence because I would have liked to express to her my hope and belief that she would bring to that position the dignity and elan and the impartiality we would expect of her, and to express to her the belief that if it should happen that, by accident or otherwise, my conduct would not be totally orderly, it would not be in any way a personal affront to her, but might arise from other matters.  I would like also to rectify an omission, since much reference has been made to the previous debate and the previous House.  On that occasion I omitted to observe the normal courtesies and to welcome the Minister on his appointment, and I would like to rectify that omission now.  The fact remains that the Minister chose to make a public issue of the right of the Seanad to consider any legislation that goes before it.  Senator Murphy made the point that it was the right of the Seanad, whether it is a lame duck or whatever it happens to be, to consider legislation in an adult and mature fashion.  A rather convoluted reference, which I did not fully understand was made by Senator Killilea, as to whether the Seanad was political, to the occasions when the Seanad could be political, could not be political and should not be political.  So far as most of us are concerned, when there is serious legislation before the House, the Seanad is political, and whether he meant party political or not is irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much reference has been made here to the part played by ex-Senator O'Leary. In fairness since he is absent, reference again should be made to that.  All I can say is that as I listened to the debate &mdash; to Senator O'Leary and Senator Robinson who were the leading speakers on the matter &mdash; it became clear that the legislation we had before us was unsatisfactory in a number of important respects, and furthermore that this legislation was likely to lead to legal action, and possibly to be questioned in the Supreme Court. It seemed to me and to all on this side that we would be failing totally in our responsibilities as legislators and in our responsibility <Col N="29" /> to the people, if we did not make this point very clearly and underline the fact that we believe this legislation was unsatisfactory and it should be amended &mdash; it must be remembered that all the speakers asked the Minister to amend it. It was an intelligent, mature and adult debate in which the speakers in this side of the House pleaded with the Minister to reconsider this legislation and, as I said at the time, &ldquo;let us try and tease out this legislation and make sure we do not have to come back again with yet more legislation to deal with these problems&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary, I believe, made very important contributions on a few occasions &mdash; in mentioning his name here in this context I would like to say that as a colleague I much regret his absence from this House and hope it will not be a permanent one &mdash; and the people of Ireland and this House have much to regret in his absence.</P>
    <P>So far as this House is concerned, it is our duty as elected representatives under the Constitution to consider any legislation or motion that comes before us in a responsible fashion and to deal with it in a responsible fashion.  I am not totally in agreement with the decision that we should allow this Bill to proceed without some form of constitutional objection to it, but, on the other hand, we can say that our confidence that this is not a satisfactory Bill and that it will be challenged will be vindicated, and the sooner it gets to the Supreme Court and the sooner it is challenged and clarified as to whether it is effective legislation, the better for all.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to say that it is a pleasure to be here in the Seanad today.  I would like to congratulate Senator Honan on her appointment as Cathaoirleach.  I would like to congratulate each and every Senator on their elections, some of them for their re-election and others elected for the first time. In particular I would like to welcome Senator Robb and Senator Mallon from Northern Ireland and wish them well in the Seanad.  I know they will have many fine contributions to make to the work of <Col N="30" /> the Seanad.  Finally I would like to wish the Seanad a longer term than the last Seanad, and I know that I am echoing all their prayers for that particular thought.</P>
      <P>I would also like to thank the Seanad for agreeing not to press this amendment, but to accept the decision and the judgment of the Dáil in this matter.  As to the issues raised by Senator Robinson with regard to the rights of the outgoing Seanad or the rights of the Seanad, I do not want to get into controversial debate on it, but could I say that that debate took place on 16 April and this is now 13 May. If this Bill is to be referred to the Supreme Court by the President, the Supreme Court has 60 days in which to make their judgment and the existing temporary legislation which everybody will admit is of a very dubious constitutional nature in character, runs out on 25 July.  If the previous amendment had not been pressed, and if the President had referred it, we would have had nearly a month of decision-making and consideration by the Supreme Court over at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill with a single purpose, namely, to clarify the provisions of the electoral law in relation to the offence of personation in the case of a person who votes or attempts to vote more than once in his own name at the same election.  The offence is defined in section 3 of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1923.  The relevant part of the section reads as follows:</P>
      <P>...every person...who having voted once at an election applies at the same election for a ballot paper in his own name, shall be guilty of the offence of personation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has emerged that there may be difficulty in proving that a person has actually voted and in a recent prosecution it was <Col N="31" /> held that, to do so, it would be necessary to produce and identify a ballot paper marked by the person concerned.  The Bill proposes to overcome the difficulty by providing that the offence shall exist if a person having obtained a ballot paper at an election applies at the same election for a ballot paper in his own name.  A saver is included in relation to the situation where a person who inadvertently spoils his ballot paper may return the paper to the presiding officer and obtain another ballot paper in place of the spoilt paper.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a very brief and simple one designed to make good a possible defect in the electoral law.  Since the matter first arose there have been different suggestions as to the precise way in which it might be dealt with.  Having considered various possibilities the legal advisers and the parliamentary draftsman recommended the approach contained in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>In deference to the wishes clearly expressed on all sides, this measure has been brought forward as a matter of urgency to clarify a specific provision in relation to Dáil elections.  I know that this House will agree with the view of the Dáil that it is desirable that any doubt which exists should be removed before polling day in the Dublin West by-election. I trust, therefore, that Senators will give a speedy passage to the Bill, so that it can be enacrted as early as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is introduced because of an incident in the last general election on 18 February, polling day.  Seemingly a Mr. O'Connor, a solicitor, went into a polling booth in Malahide accompanied by his daughter and requested a ballot paper which he duly received.  His daughter also requested a ballot paper which she duly received. They went into a screened off place with the ballot papers, spent some few minutes there and, in my opinion, voted in that booth.  He then walked to the box with the ballot paper, and placed it in the box.  If he did not place the ballot paper in the box, he placed some other piece of paper in the box.  We are not talking <Col N="32" /> about somebody who did not understand the procedure.  Let us keep in mind that this man is a solicitor, an election agent for a particular candidate.</P>
      <P>He then left that polling booth and went to Kinsealy.  His daughter accompanied him again.  He walked into the polling booth, went up to the presiding officer, produced a card which is sent out to each individual elector and, in return for the card, he received a ballot paper. If he did not produce a card he gave a number, or a name and an address.  His daughter did likewise.  Again they proceeded behind the screen, spent some time there, came out and placed a piece of paper &mdash; in my opinion a ballot paper &mdash; in the box.  Ultimately there was a court case held, I think on 20 April.  District Justice Kearney presided at the court and his decision was: &ldquo;I am ruling that the prosecution has not proven, and could not prove, that the defendants or any defendants committed this offence of double voting&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Again let us keep in mind that we are talking about a solicitor, an individual who was an election agent for a particular candidate during the campaign.  I have no doubt that man knew what he was doing. Admittedly, it would be impossible to trace the vote.  Some years ago the number on the register was put on the ballot paper.  The secrecy of that was questioned in the High Court and it was held to be against the Constitution.  For that reason there is no way to trace that vote. Even if we went through the total number of votes cast &mdash; in the region of 70,000 or 80,000 or whatever the figure was &mdash; it would be utterly impossible to find out where these two ballot papers went to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally I do not want to be critical of any judge.  I do not know this man at all.  The question about the daughter is more serious.  Was she encouraged by her father to personate in this election or in any other election, or did she do it on her own accord?  If she did it on her own accord it is peculiar that she did not arrive at the polling booth on her own.  She arrived at both polling booths with her father and did exactly as he did.  There could be some doubt about her because, if she was influenced by her father, she <Col N="33" /> could have gone into the second polling booth and not cast a vote.  Perhaps she went into the first polling booth and did not cast a vote, and cast her vote in the second polling booth.  Certainly there could be some doubt about her guilt, but there is no doubt in the world that her father personated.  As I said he is a solicitor, an election agent for a candidate, and he knew what he was doing.  How many more people did he encourage to do this type of thing?  I do not know, but it sounds very peculiar.</P>
    <P>I am not a legal man.  I know nothing about the legal end of this but I read in the papers that Mr. O'Connor and his daughter were tried and acquitted, and even the Director of Public Prosecutions cannot bring on another case.  This is the situation.  The Minister has produced this Bill, a very short Bill, a Bill to deal with this problem.  From now on if a person demands a ballot paper in Kinsealy and goes to Malahide and demands another ballot paper, he is committing an offence according to the Bill.</P>
    <P>This offence has been committed before.  I can quote a number of cases.  I can quote the case in my own constituency of a presiding officer in a local election. He voted in three names and this was proved beyond any doubt in the court &mdash; one was in America, another in hospital and the third was dead.  This man was acquitted in the court.  Six months later I went into the Department of Agriculture, and the same man had an appointment in that Department.  Was that in recognition of what he had done for the party he was supporting?  This is far more serious than people think and there is nothing in this Bill to stop this. We have this very serious situation.  A number of district justices apply the Probation Act.  They can do that because it is within their rights.  When other district justices meet this problem they sentence them for a period of not less than two months and not more than 12 months, and fine them £100.  I do not think it is unreasonable to ask the Minister or his draftsmen to put into this Bill a direction to these district justices telling them what to do in this situation: that the law says that any person who collects two ballot <Col N="34" /> papers, in the one booth or in different booths, commits an offence of personating, and is liable to be sentenced to six months in jail, one month in jail, fined £100 or whatever the decision may be. There are many other points which should have been brought into this Bill.</P>
    <P>In my honest opinion a polling card is a licence to personate.  Everybody knows that in smaller constituencies there are people who go around collecting polling cards.  Maybe they are not advised by political parties but they do it.  If somebody is dead or away from home or not available to vote for some reason, these people go to the polling booth, produce this polling card, collect the ballot paper, walk in and vote.  That is bad enough, but they probably have collected one polling card in every street and voted in other polling booths.  There is nothing in this Bill to prevent that.</P>
    <P>Reports from the Garda superintendents, sergeants and garda meetings, show that there is no point in the gardaí preparing cases and bringing the culprits to court when the justices are letting them off.  That has happened very often in this type of case.  Unless the Minister remedies the situation it will continue.  The Minister must add a lot more to this Bill before it could be accepted by this House.</P>

      <P>In the absence of the newly elected Cathaoirleach I wish her well and a very successful tenure of office, and I ask through the Chair to have these wishes conveyed to her.  I would like to welcome again to this House the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Raphael Burke and to pay tribute to him for the speed and celerity with which he has introduced the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Bill 1982, to both the Dáil and the Seanad.  As he has said in his short speech on the Bill, it is in response to requests from all sides of the House &mdash; and I would like to put that on the record &mdash; that the Government have moved to bring in this Bill so that what may be defined or seen or perceived by some people as an abuse may be corrected. Senator Reynolds appears to have magical or occult powers because he was able to re-enact, in his own very <Col N="35" /> vivid imagination, what happened outside screens, inside screens, outside polling booths, inside polling booths, between fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters and daughters, at the last election. It is amazing the prowess and very vivid imagination people adopt when they get up in a do-good fashion and proceed to point the finger at all sorts of people.  Fingers can be pointed in lots of other directions as well.  It is galling to hear what I would call sanctimonious talk issuing from the other side of the House.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is short and to the point and its brief is very clear.  It proposes to overcome the difficulty by providing that the offence shall exist if a person having obtained&mdash;and the operative word is &ldquo;obtained&rdquo;&mdash; a ballot paper at an election, applies at the same election for a ballot paper.  I do not think you require a degree, or anything but plain common sense to see this Bill makes plain common sense.  I applaud the swiftness with which it was introduced.  I favour this Bill and I hope it will be ready for implementation prior to the Dublin West by-election.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a simple point.  Firstly, judgments handed down by courts can vary considerably in this and other instances.  In the O'Connor case, to which reference has been made a certain judgment was made.  At the same time in Limerick there was a person before the courts for an identical offence. The person in question, however, was less informed and less influential and the consequences were that the judgement he received was two months imprisonment and a fine of £500.  I would just like to make the point that the case in Limerick was identical in all respects with the O'Connor case, with two different justices trying the two cases.</P>

      <P>I too should like to refer <Col N="36" /> to this Bill.  I was appalled by Senator Reynolds' contribution.  He adopted an attitude of a court of law &mdash; he was solicitor, defendant, judge, and jury and he threw out questions as if this were a court of law.  I do not think that was a right type of speech; it was more an interjection. I object to it strongly.  He seemed to imply that his party are free from any type of abuses.  He clearly indicated that people on the Fianna Fáil side were involved.  I personally can give instances where members of his own party have been involved in abuses in the past.  The whole purpose of this short Bill, as the Minister has said, is to rectify electoral abuses.  It has been welcomed by all sides of the political divide.  It should get a fair hearing and not the type of verbiage we had from Senator Reynolds to which I totally object.  It was wrong and he has done his party and this House no credit.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said &ldquo;The Bill proposes to overcome the difficulty by providing that the offence shall exist if a person having obtained a ballot paper at an election applies at the same election for a ballot paper in his own name&rdquo;.  How do we prove he obtained any person's ballot paper and how can we prove he got it in his own name?  If he applies for a ballot paper in another name, what can we do about it?  How can it be proved that he did not apply for the ballot paper in another name?  Is that what happened with Mr. O'Connor and his daughter? Again, as Senators on the other side of the House have said, Fianna Fáil now recognise and admit it was one of their party members.  It is not fair to be saying that it was one party or another.  I am here to discuss the Bill and to try to improve on it.  But there is not an improvement here.  I would like to ask the House is it an improvement?  How can we prove it if a person claims a ballot paper in another name?  How can we prove it or not prove it?  That is the question I would like to put.  It is quite serious and a little bit of thought should go into it.  A Senator has now put before the House the question of a person being found guilty.  Is it a fact that the person <Col N="37" /> who was not found guilty has now a case against the State?  Has the person who has got two months irrespective of who it is, a case against the State?  Was the summons before the justice against Mr. O'Connor wrong?  These are questions which must be put.  Was the justice in fact wrong?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is supposed to close off a loophole for election abuses.  It may not close off all loopholes, but let us wait and see how it works out.  There is a curious contradiction in popular attitudes towards the matter of personation and other electoral incidents.  In a sense personating at an election is an integral part of our political culture.  It was one of the weapons perhaps which our people had to use to make proper use of their British legacy, shall we say.  The election which lies at the basis of this State &mdash; the 1918 general election &mdash; was characterised by massive personation.  The advent of the Irish to power in America also made effective use of the weapon of personation.  At the same time people are understandably cynical when someone who is charged with personation and in whose case the burden of evidence is overwhelming has his case dismissed.  The popular attitude compounds the cynicism which is already gathering force in this country as a result of the events at the beginning of the year. People had been genuinely shocked by the perverse and scandalous miscarriage of justice in the O'Connor case.  It would be very hard to blame people for drawing the conclusion that the defendants in question got off because they were the friends of the mighty and powerful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested by various legal luminaries &mdash; and the point has been made in the other House &mdash; that what further aggravates the situation in that particular judgment is that for every offence there is also an attempted offence. If through the mind-boggling technicality which the justice had used to dismiss the case if the offence itself could not be established, then the massive weight of evidence would have established the attempted offence.  Yet that does not seem to have been invoked.  The <Col N="38" /> point has been made that this legislation is therefore unnecessary.  But I welcome everything that purports to close the loopholes in electoral law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister and the Government on moving expeditiously on this and bringing forward legislation which will help to clarify the matter.  Senator Fallon was critical of Senator Reynolds' contribution, and one might be tempted to attempt a reply in a similar fashion, not necessarily on a personal basis.  But it is part of the central theme of what I intend to say on this, as shortly as possible, that nothing is to be gained by any of us indulging in that kind of interchange. The fact of the matter is that none of the established parties can afford to be sanctimonious about this particular affair. Senator Murphy has already eloquently testified from a professional point of view to the importance of these or related practices in our political culture.  Each one of us who has been in politics for any length of time has his or her favourite stories about these matters.  We cannot afford to be sanctimonious on two counts; first because we all know &mdash; and it should be said here and a spade should be called a spade and not an agricultural implement &mdash; cases of people known to us and in many cases respected and admired by us who have had, shall we say, a connection with this particular area and who possibly could be said to have flourished as a result in this and other institutions.  We cannot afford to be sanctimonious about the practice.  It has been indulged in by people who would claim in other contexts to be agents or supporters of all the established parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that we cannot afford to be sanctimonious about the question of the register.  It is to the register I would like to refer in a few hurried remarks.  Particularly in the cities and particularly in those areas of the cities which have multiple dwellings the register is a farce.  We know it to be a farce and our parties have in effect done nothing about it.  The method by which the register is compiled and put together and published is, if I may use a reference from <Col N="39" /> another area, a mockery, a snare and delusion.  Senator Murphy will know of the reference I am making.  We know that this document which appears is more often to be described as something fitting for the obituary pages or the natal announcements than as an accurate description of those entitled under the Constitution and law to participate in the electoral process.  I would ask the Minister to move expeditiously on this.  It is something which requires careful thought and requires recourse to what modern technology can offer in this area.  I would ask him to do something about the method by which the register is compiled.</P>
    <P>Here I would like to deviate slightly from whatever facetious atmosphere might possibly have attached to my previous remarks.  If we are dealing with the compilation of information of a personal nature, we are dealing with an extremely serious area, an area in which the whole area of personal privacy, the right of individual citizens to that privacy and the right which we have not yet confronted in this country &mdash; the right of persons to information about files and so on held on them.  We have not yet addressed ourselves properly to this.  We know that there are organisations, some of which have an official backing, which compile very substantial files of personal information about citizens.  It is not easy and it is sometimes impossible for those individuals to find out what is on those files.  In the process of compiling a register by modern, up-to-date methods the Minister and his advisers might be tempted, from the point of view of efficiency, to use methods or machinery which would invade privacy, which would require substantial investigation of individuals. When one considers the practical problem that we have all encountered on the doorsteps of trying to find out who actually does live in a house, who has not yet been interred according to the rites of Holy Church or otherwise and who has, in fact, been baptised or not and whose name may appear on the electoral register, we know that it would require a considerable amount of investigation and the pursuance of this invasion <Col N="40" /> of privacy.  This is the kind of problem that the Minister would have to address himself to.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of it is that if this is to be done efficiently and effectively it is going to cost money.  The present system by which we have possibly one or two officials in any area following up this kind of business and trying to compile the list will not suffice.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the appointment of a committee to advise him on this matter and to try to find a method of compiling the register which would meet these problems in regard to individual civil rights and so on, which would not be too expensive and would also lead to the compilation of a register which would eliminate many of the abuses that we have had in this area.</P>
    <P>There is, I think, even among political people, a difference in their attitude to the two main kinds of personation.  Most political people with whom I have had contact would be in no doubts about the moral difficulty of seeking a ballot paper in the name of some other person.  It would be quite clear to most people in that situation that there is something approximating to fraud involved.  With regard to situations in which the same name may occur on a register, there are, I believe, many people, and even political people who should know better, who would have the view that there is no harm in ensuring that those votes are not left dormant and stagnant with the cobwebs and dust gathering upon them for the brief period they would be on the table.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister when this Bill is passed &mdash; because certainly I believe that on this side of the House we will do everything to facilitate him &mdash; to take some time on television and radio and also some space in other media to  people and to clarify for them what precisely the offence is.  Obviously, there has been a great deal of discussion of this particular case and the issues involved, but I believe that people are not yet totally clear about this and there is a case for some further publicity to make clear to people what the situation is.  By doing so, the Minister will have done a great <Col N="41" /> service to parliamentary democracy in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I too, like many of my colleagues, welcome the provision of this Bill, but nonetheless I have to mention that I am not totally happy with the wording of it.  I have not a legal mind and perhaps the Minister will enlighten me and the House about the position where a person applies for a ballot paper in his own name having allegedly previously voted.  As has been previously suggested by Senator O'Connell the question of fraud may come into that case.  Nonetheless, in view of the facts which brought about this legislation I think that, as Senator Murphy pointed out, in the initial stage of the history of this State massive personation took place.</P>
      <P>As he has suggested it took place in other areas also.  We have had an electoral law which has been in effect since 1923 and it has taken the present situation to bring about this amendment.  I must admit to the House that I was aware of various alleged personations having taken place and I am sure that all politicians and all political parties must have at some stage heard of various cases where people have suggested or boasted that they had voted two or three times. Indeed, some people have said that in the initial stages of this State when our political parties came to power you voted early and you voted often.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Bill as it is put before the House will rectify the situation which has existed down through the years.  I think that 99 per cent of the people of this State would not wish to be associated with any form of personation.  They would like to vote once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to what Senator O'Connell had to say about registers and the compilation of registers, we know that the abuse of compilation in the larger urban areas is far greater than it may be in rural areas.  Nonetheless, this is something to which the Minister in view of his responsibility in this area should give serious consideration and bring in some competent persons to ensure that people who are entitled to vote would, at least on the <Col N="42" /> day of voting, have their names listed for that purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing that comes to mind in relation to the unfortunate case which precipitated this particular piece of amending legislation is that there is a grave danger that it would engender in the minds of the public a contempt for legislation preventing people from voting more than once.  This in turn could bring about a situation which would lead to mass personation at elections in the future.  I am not making a political point here &mdash; I think we should all ponder on it &mdash; if one ponders on what is alleged to have happened in the cases referred to by Senator Reynolds in the last general election one must remember that any person who goes into a polling booth, having allegedly voted once before in that election, and seeks a ballot paper certainly does not do so just to give an autograph or something of that nature.  I do not wish to be frivolous but I must point out that any persons, whether they are followers of a political party or not, who do that knowingly, having voted previously, must be aware of the consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the point which is the most important point &mdash; I will address myself through the Chair to the Minister at this time &mdash; this has already been referred to by Senator Cregan, and that is that we are now left with having to prove that the vote has been taken previously or that the person concerned has voted either in his or her own name or in somebody else's name previously.  To my mind there was already in existence sufficient machinery to ensure that a person could not do that if we are to resort to the proof that will be required in the future.  I was always under the impression that a Bible was placed before the presiding officer in each polling booth to ensure that if there was a query in relation to identification the person or persons concerned could be sworn in.  This would lead us to another avenue, that of having to prove at some future date whether or not the person had in fact committed perjury.  Again, we will have to arrive at the point of proving whether or not the offence took place.  In that case one could <Col N="43" /> not possibly prove in a densely populated area that an offence had been committed by a person who had voted, for instance, in the morning in one polling booth and proposed to vote in the evening in another polling booth, unless the personnel at the polling booth were in a position to positively identify the person or persons concerned.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome but to my mind it does not eliminate the loopholes that were there in the past.  I think they are still there.  The unfortunate consequences of the decision in that case &mdash; I have no wish to criticise any judgment &mdash; are that the general public will see that it is now necessary to have ample proof that the offence took place before they are liable to prosecution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the House for their reception of this Bill.  It was indicated that it was designed to deal with a single specific situation.  A number of Senators felt free to comment on a particular case.  I am advised that the case is <i>sub judice</i> and therefore I am precluded from commenting on it.  It would be fair to say that there has been a certain indulgence by members of the Fine Gael Party, both here and in the Dáil, in hypocrisy.  In the 1981 election, for example, there were 51 reported cases of personation. What, may I ask, did that administration do about the personations which took place when they were in power after the June, 1981 election? There is need for this Bill: there is general agreement on it and it is desirable that it should be enacted at this stage in order to close off a loophole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points were raised with regard to the compilation and deficiencies of the register.  My Department have received numerous complaints from around the country of the defects in the register in the last election, and every politician is aware of the condition of the registers in his or her own area.  The one in County Dublin leaves a lot to be desired.  I announced in the Dáil on 29 April that I intend to set up a working party to bring about a real improvement <Col N="44" /> in the standard of the register to close off the deficiencies, the omissions and the errors which have occurred in the past. The working party will comprise officials from the local authorities as well as from my own Department and returning officers. They will start work immediately and report back to me within three months so that we can tackle the register for the coming year.</P>
    <P>The working party will also look at other areas related to the running of elections, for example, access to polling stations for the disabled.  We are all aware of cases where the polling station is the traditional polling place in election after election and there has been no thought given down the years to improving access to these polling stations or to moving them into new buildings where there would be access for the disabled.  This is one item which will be looked into by the Working Party, as well as many others.</P>
    <P>A number of drafting points were raised in relation to the wording of section 1 of the Bill.  I appreciate the concern of the House to ensure that this revised section should be as watertight as possible. I would like to advise Senators that the parliamentary draughtsman has advised me that the present wording of section 1 of the Bill is adequate to meet the kind of situation that was mentioned.</P>
    <P>The question of the punishment for personation was raised.  Section 6 of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act provides for a compulsory jail sentence, but in most cases it appears that jail sentences are suspended.  There are good reasons for leaving the section stand as it is at the moment.  I am grateful for the welcome given by the Seanad to the Bill.  This was a measure which was submitted by agreement to the political party whips prior to its introduction in the House.  The proposed wording now in the Bill was agreed by the political parties involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Clare</i>): The purpose of the Bill is to approve the terms of the agreement establishing the Common Fund for Commodities and to enable this country to honour its financial obligations as a signatory.</P>
      <P>The concept of a common fund arose from a very real concern about the manner in which primary commodities are traded.  At present the trade is subject to repeated fluctuations of price and supply. These fluctuations not only affect developed countries, including Ireland, which consume the commodities but, most seriously, the fluctuations affect the developing countries.  In some cases their entire economies depend completely on the production and export of a few basic crops or raw materials for industries.</P>
      <P>Another very important aspect is the need to aid and encourage developing countries to exploit their production capacity more fully through additional processing within their own territories and better approaches to marketing.</P>
      <P>With these considerations in mind, the Fourth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD-IV) adopted an integrated programme for commidities in May 1976.  The programme named 18 commodities of particular interest to developing countries. Examples are rubber, cocoa, coffee and tin.  It was further agreed at UNCTAD-IV that a Common Fund For Commodities should be a key factor in the integrated programme.</P>
      <P>The negotiations which followed resulted in the present agreement, which was adopted in June 1980.  Ireland signed the agreement in February 1981.</P>

    <P>The Common Fund is designed specifically to tackle the two issues which I have mentioned.  It will have a First Account with a resources target of $400 <Col N="47" /> million to be used to facilitate stability of price and supply It will also have a Second Account of $350 million.  The First Account will operate by lending money to International Commodity Organisations (ICOs).  These are organisations set up to oversee international commodity agreements.  It is hoped that establishing a Common Fund will not only help existing ICOs but will facilitate the conclusion of more commodity agreements.</P>
    <P>Money borrowed from the fund by ICOs will be used solely for purchasing buffer stocks.  The fund will promote the joint financing of such stocks by producers and consumers, a development which will foster greater international economic co-operation.  Buffer stocks are used to stabilise price and demand.  Stocks are acquired by the ICO when a commodity is in abundant supply to stop the price falling below a floor price which is equitable to both producers and consumers. Alternatively stocks are released onto the market when the commodity is in short supply and the price is beginning to rise above an equitable ceiling.  Buffer stocking is a means of preventing or, at the least, curbing disruptive speculation which damages both producers and consumers, and can be particularly damaging to the economies of some of the least developed countries.</P>
    <P>The First Account will be financed from directly contributed capital, in other words members' subscriptions to shares in the fund, and also from capital guarantees and cash deposits from ICOs associated with the fund as well as borrowings from the financial markets.</P>
    <P>In addition to the First Account, there is, as I mentioned earlier, an amount of $350 million in the Fund's Second Account.  The Second Account is designed to assist in research and development of commodity production and marketing and it is hoped that it will encourage developing producer countries to diversify and expand their commodity trading and develop further processing of their commodities rather than relying solely on export in the raw state.</P>
    <P>The Second Account is financed by means of an initial allocation of $70 million <Col N="48" /> from the share subscription to the First Account, by additional voluntary contributions from members and by borrowings by the fund on the financial markets.</P>
    <P>Membership of the fund is open to all States who are members of the United Nations or of any of its specialised agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  It will be managed by a Governing Council and an Executive Board.  Each member state will appoint one governor to the council which will elect 28 executive directors to the board.</P>
    <P>The agreement also makes the customary provisions for legal status of the fund, immunities from judicial proceedings, interpretation and arbitration procedures, process of amendment and provision for entry into force.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitments to the fund will consist of $1,000,000 for the purchase of shares in the First Account.  The Bill provides a higher ceiling so that we can take up additional shares if additional capital is required.  We will also provide a voluntary contribution of $250,000 to the Second Account.  Payments will be spread over the two years after entry into force of the agreement.  In addition, we will have certain commitments arising out of our membership of ICOs associated with the fund.  We make a small annual membership subscription to the ICOs at present.  Under this agreement we would also provide guarantees to the Common Fund as part security for borrowings by the ICOs.  These guarantees would replace payments that we currently make to ICOs for buffer stocking.</P>
    <P>I would like to give Senators a brief example of the importance of commodities in this country.  Ireland is a member of the present International Natural Rubber Organisation.  It is in our interest to have stability of price and supply.  Industries related to this commodity employ 3,300 people in this country.  In 1981 we imported over 7,000 tonnes of raw rubber at a cost of around £6 million.  Our exports in that year came to 33,000 tonnes of raw and manufactured rubber products which were worth some £52 million.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the provisions of the <Col N="49" /> Bill, I would like to draw Senators' attention to an aspect of the Common Fund which I feel to be particularly relevant. We all appreciate the necessity, both moral and practical, of aiding, and cooperating in the development of, Third World countries.  The Brandt Report in particular demonstrated the pressing need to assist such countries in a practical, long term way rather than by measures providing only temporary reliefs which must be constantly supplemented, leaving the Third World depending largely on the fickle goodwill of the industrialised nations.  There has also been much concern and adverse comment about the misdirection and abuse of aid, where assistance is diverted from its intended recipients or is inequitably distributed. We are hopeful that the Second Account of the Common Fund will do much to improve this situation by aiding projects aimed at improving the structural conditions in market research and development, productivity improvements and processing development.  In other words, we are seeking to improve the capacity of developing countries to exploit their own natural resources for the benefit of their economies and their people.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I will summarise briefly the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 defines various terms and section 2 provides for approval of the agreement.  Section 3 contains the financial provisions for payment of subscriptions for shares in the fund's First Account, and contributions to the Second Account and for borrowing guarantees, required by reason of participation in international commodity organisations associated with the fund. Sections 4 and 5 relate to the disposal of any moneys received under the agreement and to payment of administration expenses.  The Schedule contains the text of the agreement.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome Bill.  It is a Bill which must be looked at not for what is on the face of it but in the general context of the relationship between ourselves and other developed <Col N="50" /> countries and the countries of the developing world.  If we do look on the face of the Bill we find that it has a most peculiar face.  We have a Bill the text of which is less than two pages in length, accompanied by a Schedule which is 44 pages in length.  It makes it a very difficult Bill to discuss and it becomes still more difficult when we find that actually the Schedule has Schedules of its own.  Consequently, references become quite difficult. What I propose to do is to talk on the general nature of the Bill on this Stage since it is the appropriate thing to do on the Second Stage and defer until the Committee Stage the discussion of some of the matters that would be more appropriately discussed on the Schedule.</P>
      <P>This Bill is part of a larger pattern.  The Minister in his opening speech made reference to the Brandt Report.  Certainly this Bill is compatible with the Brandt Report and indeed the question of a need to do something on international commodities is mentioned in that report so that the Bill is entirely along these lines. I quote from the Brandt Report on page 271 of the PAN edition of it:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Earnings from commodities must be strengthened so they can contribute more adequately to the development of Third World countries, most of which are still heavily dependent on primary commodity exports.</P>
      <P>It then goes on more importantly to say, and this is a key factor, and I am again quoting:</P>
      <P>They should be enabled to process their own raw materials locally and to participate in their international marketing, transport and distribution. Commodity process should be stabilised at a remunerative level to become less vulnerable to market fluctuations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this Bill does provide the machinery through the operation of stock buffers in making primary products from developing countries less subject to fluctuation, one wonders whether the Bill as drafted, more particularly whether the agreement as implemented, will in fact go through the Second Account and really tackle these questions of local processing, of transport, of participation in <Col N="51" /> marketing, because if that is not done, then the expenditure under the First Account will be largely wasted.  If we think it is merely a matter of buffering, merely a matter of smoothing out fluctuations, we will have a continuance of what we have had over the last two decades: some effort on the part of the developing world but effort of such a nature and to such an extent that in fact the gap between the developing and the developed countries merely continues to grow larger and larger.  So what we have here is something which can be considered as a move in the right direction.  That something will be entirely powerless to solve the problem unless it is accompanied by many other actions as well.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the Brandt Report, it is usually referred to as the report on North-South relations.  But the title of the Brandt Report is &ldquo;North-South: Programme for Survival&rdquo;.  And this is what it is, not merely a programme for the survival of the people in the developing countries, though it is a question of survival there, of individual life and death. But the main message of the Brandt Report is that what we are concerned with is survival of our world.  It is the dilemma that faces us so often in politics, the choice between reform and revolution.</P>
    <P>While we can agree with this Bill we must say that it can be only a part of a larger pattern, a part of a larger effort. As the Minister of State has said in introducing the Bill, it arises from the deliberations of the UN Conference on Trade and Development.  That particular organisation &mdash; UNCTAD &mdash; was created almost 20 years ago.  Its objectives were to produce convergence in policies concerning both trade and aid.  Its objectives were in matters of trade to produce remunerative, equitable and stable prices for primary products.  And yet it takes us 18 years until we can get a simple agreement &mdash; I withdraw the word &ldquo;simple&rdquo; when I think of the 44 pages of the Schedule &mdash; the first agreement which attempts to get the countries of the world together to that objective.  The secondary objective established 18 years ago was to <Col N="52" /> ensure access to markets in industrialised countries, to ensure access of finance and of technology in the form which would benefit the developing country not in the form that will develop the country which is exporting its technology.</P>
    <P>We can say with regard to this whole effort that the seventies was a decade of much dialogue and of little action.  Long ago, at the beginning of that decade at the UNCTAD conference in 1972 in Santiago there was a fund established for special measures to deal with such problems as transport costs for specially disadvantaged developing countries.  That problem still remains unsolved.  So much so that one begins to wonder if multilateral action is an efficient way of achieving the objectives that have been put forward, often in good faith, so many times for trying to reduce this gap between the developing and the developed by both multilateral and the bilateral means.  It seems to me that the record of multilateral action by UN organisations and other international organisations, has not been a good one.  We can certainly criticise the developing countries as the Minister of State has said, because in some instances the aid has been diverted and has not reached its original target area or target group in the population.  That is not the only case where there has been waste.  There has been waste in the organisation of the multilateral agencies themselves. It is not only that when aid arrives in a developing country that it gets diverted in order to suit individuals or the friends of individuals.  We have multinational Government agencies which are inefficient because they are staffed by the friends of powerful individuals.  Indeed, as a result, their overhead costs are far greater than they would be if they were staffed on merit alone.  This is a very serious problem for us because if all the aid which we give&mdash;and which we do not grudge in giving to developing countries &mdash; we are at the moment giving about two-thirds of this in multilateral aid and only about one-third in bilateral aid over which we ourselves can have more direct control.  This is about the reverse of our other partners in the EEC.  This is something which we should look at most carefully. <Col N="53" /> The examination of this is something that was initiated in the study which Deputy Jim O'Keeffe initiated in regard to the review of our aid policy and the preparation of a White Paper.  I hope that work will be pressed on with and that all of our aid proposals, multilateral and bilateral, will be examined with great care.</P>
    <P>What we are asked to approve today is the creation of this particular fund.  As has been indicated, this arose from the fourth UNCTAD Conference in Nairobi in 1976.  I am afraid that we already see a dilution of what was agreed in Nairobi in 1976.  If we look at the actual text of the resolution, and I am quoting from the proceedings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the fourth session in Nairobi, volume 1, page 7, it gives the objectives of the integrated programme for commodities.  We have here seven objectives.  The first two of these objectives only are concerned with the question of the actual avoidance of excessive price fluctuations and the question of fluctuations in export earning for developing countries.  We have further objectives here set out in great details. For example, No. 5, and I quote:</P>
    <P>To improve the competitiveness of, and to encourage research and development on the problems of natural products competing with synthetics and substitutes, and to consider the harmonisation where appropriate, of the production of synthetics and substitutes in developed countries with the supply of natural products produced in developing countries;</P>
    <P>Now a shadow only of this objective appears under Account No. 2 in the present legislation.  Research and development are still mentioned but the full force of objective No. 5 has been watered down.  And equally in regard to objective No. 6 which talks not about marketing but about the improvement of markets structure.  Objective No. 7 which talks about improving marketing distribution and transport systems for commodity exports of developing countries, including an increase in their participation in these activities and their earnings from <Col N="54" /> them.  I would fear that in fact even though we have had here already six years of attempts to set down and to implement the resolution made in Nairobi in 1976 that we do not have a full implementation of what was agreed there.  We have had our organising sessions of the members, over 1,400 of them, all the UN organisations, specialised agencies, various governmental organisations and non-governmental organisations and what comes out in the end is in fact something less than what was intended when the original agreement was made.  The details of this agreement are probably better discussed one by one on Committee Stage when talking about the Schedule.</P>
    <P>There is one further point I would like to mention at this stage.  It is to ask the Minister with regard to the 18 commodities which were taken as being within the scope of the original agreement how many of these is it intended should be the subject of the formation of commodity organisation and the establishment of commodity boards immediately on the coming into force of this agreement?  I would like further to ask how many of these will be existing agreements?  There are, of course, many existing agreements already.  Sugar is one which is giving rise to difficulty in recent times.  How many of these will be absorbed into the new organisation and what will be the manner in which the existing organisations will be absorbed?  A further question I would like to ask the Minister is whether in fact the agreement has already come into force?  Have the required 90 countries ratified the agreement or will there have to be a special vote required because, as I understand it, ratification was required by 31 March this year which has now passed.  I would ask the Minister in particular how many countries of the Community have ratified and whether the Community itself intends to become a member, as it is entitled to do as an organisation, in addition to its own individual members.</P>
    <P>My main point on Second Stage is that this Bill is certainly one with which we will agree.  It is, of course, a Bill which was introduced by the last Government <Col N="55" /> in November 1981.  It was totally in harmony with our whole attitude to the question of aid to developing countries.  I am glad to see that the Bill has been introduced. I will be gladder still if I find out over time that the approach to aid of the present Government also matches this Bill.  Indeed, not only matches the Bill but accepts it not as something which is sufficient to be done but something that is necessary to be done and something to be done as part of a general vigorous approach to this most important problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My reservations about the Bill are less detailed but more fundamental than those expressed by Senator Dooge.  Because I like to think they are more fundamental I suggest that when I outline them it may well explain why the position is unsatisfactory, why the plans whether at multilateral or bilateral level simply never had the success they were intended to have.</P>
      <P>This subject is nothing new to us in this House.  We had a long discussion on the Brandt Report and at fairly frequent intervals in the context of discussing reports on the European Communities we discussed the relationships between the EEC and the Third World.  I think that our assumptions about all this are erroneous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's speech we have a general statement of intent, that the purpose of the Bill is, among other things, the need to aid and encourage developing countries to exploit their production capacity more fully.  He refers to the fact that in some cases the entire economies of these countries depend chiefly on the production and export of a few basic crops.  We use words such as &ldquo;developing&rdquo; and &ldquo;undeveloped&rdquo; and related words like &ldquo;underdeveloped&rdquo; and of course the &ldquo;developed nations&rdquo; and all this terminology I suggest is a piece of self-deception.  It suggests that there is a linear spectrum and in one end of the spectrum there are the developed countries which are prosperous and through a range of intermediary stages there are the very poor countries which are under-developed <Col N="56" /> and in between there are developing nations.</P>
    <P>The further assumption in all this, whether you approach it bilaterally or multilaterally, is that all the countries along the line belong to the same global community of interest, a vast world fraternity in which the wealthy brothers help out the less fortunate brothers.  This is the whole concept between aid and encouraging the underdeveloped nations.  The differences of emphasis, in my view, are of relatively minor importance.</P>
    <P>What I mean is that we are frequently told that what the so-called underdeveloped countries need is not money but expertise and there are all kinds of homely analogies about not giving them fish but teaching them how to fish and so on.  That kind of detail is in my view unimportant because it simply shores up the erroneous assumptions that by aiding the underdeveloped countries, giving them a pat on the back, making encouraging noises, they will in time move progressively along the spectrum towards the developed end.</P>
    <P>Really what we should be considering is whether the developed countries develop at the expense of the undeveloped. Is that why they are developed?  I believe that it is.  I believe that our present hypothesis of developed countries and undeveloped is simply not satisfactory. It is not somehow that the western world came first to industrial revolution and discovered the blessing of technology first and that these other countries are lagging behind but that they will catch up on us.  I suggest that there is a more feasible model or hypothesis to explain the North-South imbalance which is so crucial to the world and which is at the heart of the Brandt Report.  That hypothesis or model I suggest is that these so-called underdeveloped countries are in a neo-colonial condition.</P>
    <P>Before anyone will start saying &ldquo;jargon&rdquo; let me assure the House that I am not a doctrinaire Marxist &mdash; I am not even sure that I am a socialist &mdash; but that does not prevent me from taking from Marxist theory the valuable insights to be <Col N="57" /> found in that ideology.  The facts of history, geography and economics make it absolutely indisputable that these unfortunate countries are unfortunate because the West exploited them in their pre-independent days and continues to exploit them in their nominally post-independent days.  In all that context the notion of aid is a cosmetic exercise.  It is conscience money, and we might lull ourselves into a false sense of security if we believe that it is going to work.  It is not going to work.</P>
    <P>Let us take some of the other ideas in this Bill.  If we consider that poor countries rely, for example, on the export of primary commodities, that their food products are generally unprocessed and that we can somehow do something about this, we should also take into account that they have no real control over world credit or exchange, they have little control over transport in the matter of exports, and in general they are at the mercy of international finance.</P>
    <P>Is there a country nearer home which exports its most valuable commodities in an unprocessed condition, which exports and has exported its minerals in an unprocessed state and has been allowed to do so for 15 or 16 years, whose export of cattle on the hoof is an absolute scandal, which has no control over its credit and which is at the mercy of international finance?  If there is and you can name it, then you will have to concede that we are a kind of classic neo-colonial country.  We act and look and proceed in the international field as if we belonged to the developed countries but we really are not a developed country.  We have been historically a colonial country and are still a neo-colonial country.  We have a particular interest in all this, not because we have joined with our EEC partners in giving aid but because we have more in common with the countries at the wrong end of the spectrum than we have with the robber barons who have retired perhaps from their robber-barony but whom we now call our partners and whose aid to the Third World has a very poor record indeed.  I am, of course, in favour of realising the United Nations target of aid as a certain percentage of the gross <Col N="58" /> national product, but it is ultimately no solution.  We must recognise the underlying realities of the world order that really account for the low living standards of the so-called under-developed countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirleach, permit me first of all to congratulate you most warmly on your elevation to the Chair of this House.  It gives me particular pleasure as one who was inspired to enter politics with the firm belief in and commitment to further the equality of women in society.  It gives me enormous pleasure to see you in that chair, and I wish you a most successful term of office.</P>
      <P>Permit me also to welcome the Minister of State to this House and to offer him my best wishes for a successful term.</P>
      <P>I will now address myself to this Bill which has come before us.  Its purpose in giving effect to a proposal from the Fourth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development &mdash; UNCTAD-IV &mdash; held in Nairobi on May 1976 is to be lauded.  Nothing more eloquently testifies to the bureaucracy involved in bringing good ideas such as this to fruition as the fact that it has taken six years to bring this proposal from Nairobi to Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  The prospect of further delay in order to secure further ratification alluded to by Senator Dooge is disturbing.  The purpose of the fund is set out on page 1 of the explanatory memorandum.  It is designed to achieve stability in commodity prices and markets.  Primarily the fund will help international commodity organisations by providing credit to purchase buffer stocks of their particular commodity. The ICOs will buy stocks when the price is falling due to abundant supply, thereby benefiting exporting developing countries.  Conversely, the ICOs will sell on the market when prices rise due to a shortage of supply and this will benefit in turn consumer countries.  The fund will also provide loans and grants for research and development in the field of commodities, and this will apply mainly to the developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this can be achieved in the interests of the Third World it will have been a <Col N="59" /> worthwhile exercise, but I would stress that it is vital that all the actions and decisions of the fund be taken with the interests of the Third World in mind and not merely those of the developed world. From a national budgeting viewpoint support of this venture involves making financial commitments for years ahead, and I am pleased to have heard details of Ireland's financial obligations in the speech which the Minister of State made at the start of this debate.  The proposed legislation envisages a situation in which deficits can occur on either or both First and Second Accounts.  If this situation arises it will impose further financial resposibilities on the fund's members, and I would ask the Minister of State whether these potential financial burdens have been quantified.</P>
    <P>Over and above all the technical minutiae of this worthwhile Bill &mdash; and I question whether the drafting of the legislation had to be so complicated; indeed, it is one of the most complicated pieces of legislation that I have seen since I joined this House &mdash; the fundamental fact remains that what this legislation is about is commitment and sensitivity to the reality of life as experienced by those people who live in the Third World.</P>
    <P>Let me place on the record of this House some very telling facts which point out the necessity of helping and assisting the under-privileged nations.  Life expectancy in the Third World is on average 50 years.  Here in the west we can expect to live to 70 years.  In the Third World there is a doctor for every 9,000 people and a nurse for every 8,700 people.  Here we have a doctor for approximately every 630 people and a nurse for every 220 people.  In the Third World only 28 per cent of the people have access to clean drinking water.  Here there is 100 per cent water availability for our people.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there are anomalies in the situation, and it takes courage and commitment to persist in bringing forward the importance and significance of our participation in development aid. Senator Dooge in his contribution has referred to some of the more glaring <Col N="60" /> examples of mismanagement and graft which can occur in Third World situations. It is very easy to become impatient when you see with your own eyes the gigantic mismanagement of some official aid programmes and the prodigious scale on which graft, larceny, indolence, ignorance and sheer incompetence can permeate everything and indeed, at times, the devastating waste.  Then there are the more obvious indecencies, and I use that term advisedly.  India has its nuclear programme and oil-rich Nigeria has kwashiorkor still rampant in certain areas. Gambia lacks a CAT scanner; inappropriate technology provides colour television, for example, but no running water. The inequalities between the rich and the poor world are becoming even more obvious.  For example, even more germane to the International Common Fund for Commodities Bill, in 1965 it cost Tanzania five and a half tons of cotton to buy a tractor.  By 1972 an equivalent tractor cost eight tons of cotton.  Today that same tractor costs about 30 tons of cotton. Therefore, the poor really do become poorer and it was in an effort to exert some control over that situation that the International Common Fund for Commodities Bill was instituted.</P>
    <P>A note of warning must be sounded and we ignore it at our peril.  The poor become poorer despite major efforts such as this Bill, but it seems unfair to adopt a negative attitude to it prematurely before the fund has actually been set up. At the end of the first decade of development of the United Nations it was found that of all the new wealth developed over that ten years 80 per cent had gone to the First World and only 6 per cent to the poorest countries.</P>
    <P>Here I would like to develop a point made so eloquently by Senator Murphy. Much of the poverty in the Third World has come about by the economic oppression which the rich world exercises over the Third World.  This has its roots in the colonial period when trading structures of the colonised countries were shaped to suit the needs of the colonisers.  Thus we can account for the importance of jute to the economy of Bangladesh and of tea to Sri Lanka.  However, although the <Col N="61" /> colonial period has now ended, many Third World countries remain locked in what is a virtual one-crop situation and the markets for these crops lie in the rich world which effectively dictates prices, and so the cycle of poverty is ensured and continues.  The ex-colonies remain producers of basic materials while we in the rich world do the manufacturing which, of course, is where the added-value lies. This International Common Fund for Commodities Bill is a brave attempt to break that cycle of poverty by aiming for stability in commodity prices and markets. We must also face the fact that while we here in Ireland were developing we had access to cheap oil, but, as we all know only too painfully, this is no longer available.  The problems which the poorer countries faced 20 years ago have not diminished since.  Rather they have increased.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to a point which I made earlier in relation to this Bill: that it is vital that all the actions and decisions of the fund be taken with the interests of the Third World in mind and not those of the developed world.  It has happened in the past and it still tends to occur that our use of trade agreements and conventions is so designed as to ensure our dominance in the market place.  I put it to the House that this attitude is just as shameless as was the naked force used by earlier generations in their exploitation of the riches of the colonies.  If we were serious about the Third World we would embrace the principles of a whole new international economic order which proposes to replace aid with trade, the transfer of resources, including technology, to the Third World, a monetary reform which would allow the Third World the security of an international reserve currency which would be used for the benefit of all nations.</P>
    <P>This International Common Fund for Commodities Bill represents a step in this direction and, as such, is to be warmly welcomed.  However, it must be clearly recognised that we all have a grave responsibility in relation to the Third World and international economic equity both as individual Members and particularly as Members of the Oireachtas and <Col N="62" /> therefore in some way leaders of the communities which we represent.  We must expose ourselves to the problem, we must inform ourselves, we must learn and understand, because unless we do we will not generate the political will which is necessary to make the changes that need to be made.  Johann Pronk, Deputy Secretary-General of UNCTAD, from whence came this Bill, has spelt out the importance of political will.  He said, &ldquo;We need political will to change, we need knowledge of the issues involved but above all we need a political climate within the West, within which it pays to change&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I must at this point express my own indignation and utter disappointment at the throw-away response of the Taoiseach to a question in the Dáil yesterday from Deputy George Birmingham which was reported in today's daily papers.  The Taoiseach referred to the disastrous experience of the previous Government in having a Minister of State there who was quite superfluous and a supernumerary. This, sadly enough, was not followed by any statement of policy or general intent or indeed any commitment on the part of the Taoiseach to pursue with energy and firmness of purpose the Government's bilateral and multilateral aid programmes.</P>
    <P>Thinking people everywhere in this country, particularly those concerned with the development aid, welcomed with enthusiasm the appointment of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for development co-operation.  Deputy O'Keeffe applied himself to his task with enthusiasm and verve and this was recognised by all who have an interest in Third World development aid.  I call on the Taoiseach to make a statement of interest and to reaffirm Ireland's commitment in this area and I urge all development agencies to make their voices heard lest there be any diminution of purpose, any complacency or self-satisfaction on the part of the present administration whose record in the past on development co-operation unfortunately has been so weak.  I would remind the House that the Coalition <Col N="63" /> Government adopted the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP as an overseas development aid target, but more important, they adopted a specific timetable for the attainment of that target by the end of this decade.  In addition to this in the 1982 Estimates we in the Coalition provided for an increase in overseas development aid from £18 million in 1981 to £26.335 million in 1982, putting this objective directly on target and rendering it achieveable.  I warmly welcome this Bill establishing the international fund for commodities as it recognises that major international initiatives are needed if mankind is to survive.  Willie Brandt said in his <i>North-South: `A Programme for Survival'</i> that reshaping worldwide North-South relations had become a crucial commitment to the future of mankind, equal in importance to counteracting the dangers of the arms race.  We believe this to be the greatest challenge to mankind in the remainder of this century.</P>

      <P>Before I make my few brief remarks on this Bill I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and wish you every success in your very onerous task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly, I welcome this Bill the purpose of which is to approve the terms of the agreement establishing the common fund for commodities and to enable this country to honour its financial obligations as a signatory.  The setting up of the Common Fund such as it is proposed is seen as a means of stabilising the market for the supply of certain commodities. Examples given for these commodities include rubber, cocoa, coffee and tin. The fluctuations experienced in the marketing of these commodities at present are bound to have an adverse effect not only on the developing countries that produce them but also on the developed countries including Ireland.  The importance of encouraging developing countries to exploit their own production capacity more fully cannot be over-stressed because too often developed countries honour their commitments to <Col N="64" /> the undeveloped countries by the allocation of financial assistance when in fact they could often provide more valuable assistance to those countries by providing expertise to enable them to exploit their own natural resources.  It is important that we help developing countries to improve their economies and the setting up of this fund will do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his brief indicated that Ireland was at present a member of the International Rubber Organisation.  It is in our interest to have stability on price and supply.  He also indicated that this industry employs 3,300 people in this country.  That is a very important consideration for us at this time, particularly when we have such a high rate of unemployment. We imported 7,000 tons of raw rubber in 1981 at a cost of about £6 million. I was glad to see that our exports in that year amounted to 33,000 tons of raw and manufactured rubber products which were worth £52 million.  That clearly indicates the importance of this fund particularly to this country &mdash; and I suppose everybody examines the situation in their own country.  I am happy to see that the fund has been set up even at this late stage.  Ireland's commitment to the fund will consist of £1 million.  I understand it is for the purchase of shares in the First Account.  I welcome the Bill and hope it will proceed through the House as soon as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill to the House and I hope it gets a speedy passage.  I have been watching the progress and development of this legislation since the mid-seventies during the period I served on the Executive Committee of the ACP Joint Assembly when it was the major topic of many of the international meetings of that body.  Our country should be a signatory to this very important international agreement.  It has evoked a tremendous amount of comment, thought and study.  At the same time our people <Col N="65" /> must be very clearly aware of what exactly is involved.  While I subscribe to this, nevertheless I can see that as large numbers of these countries develop &mdash; most of them with philosophies and policies very far removed from the system under which we work &mdash; they are going to offer tremendous and very serious competition to our producers in certain of the light industry areas.  This is something we must live with and compete against and, at the same time, we must help these people.  The difficult problem is accepting that in many of these countries, especially countries who may very well themselves be in famine situations, their order of priority is a long way away from ours.  In the past few years one country in particular was spending more on armaments than the Allies spent at any one time during the Second World War and yet that country had millions of people in a situation of acute starvation. We must not look at that kind of a situation but look forward to the common good.</P>
    <P>Many people during the course of the preparation of this document looked very closely at the common agricultural policy of the EEC as a guideline for what could be achieved &mdash; I do not mean in minute detail but as a general idea of what they were aiming at.  This international convention will be of tremendous benefit to the smaller countries, especially the smaller land-locked countries throughout the developing and under-developed world that are solely dependent on one crop.  It is important that they should have help and be able to see the benefits of self-help.  It is only through assistance such as this that the weaker one-crop economies will be able to get some sort of guarantees and safeguards either against multi-national monopolies or indeed be able to survive against the larger economies that are inclined to dump goods and who do not care about areas that are under severe stress.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope it will live up to the ideals and the aspirations of the people who worked so hard over so many years to draft this and bring it to fruition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join with the other Members who have already given you our best wishes and congratulations and wish you a very fruitful chairmanship.  I hope that this forum will be fruitful and exciting from the point of view of discussing legislation.</P>
      <P>I agree with much of what has been said but I could not allow a Bill and an issue of such importance to go through without commenting on it.  Some years ago I read a sentence that burned in my brain.  It was from a report on the work of development in the Third World.  It was stark, simple and true.  It said: rich countries are rich because the poor countries are poor.  We know it was the exploitation and the ripping-off of the natural resources and the people of those countries that kept them poor and helped to make the developed world rich and still helps to make it rich.</P>
      <P>Enough cannot be said about the Brandt Report.  It highlighted what we owe in conscience, not in charity, to the countries who have been allowed to remain poor, underdeveloped and exploited, and it also warned that if the more developed countries do not take this seriously, do not out of their own development and technology contribute now to these countries, there will be a violence within those countries that the North can look out for.  At the most practical and selfish level this Bill goes part of the way towards what we should go doing.  I hope we will have further discussion on it.  This country, as Senator Murphy and others have said, has a special and unique position in so far as we are a member of the EEC which is the richest bloc in the world.  However, we remain on the periphery in so far as we can be seen in EEC terms to be a developing country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us here share a collective folk memory of the damage that was done to us as a country by our power being removed, by the fact that for centuries we were not allowed to use our resources properly but had to export them to a country or countries who would make use of and profit from them.  Let us not misuse that experience.  It has taken us long enough to come out of it ourselves; as <Col N="67" /> Senator Murphy said, we have not accomplished what we should have done.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald referred to the fear of competition from the developing countries. Let us think about it in a positive way and let us try to use our technology for our resources.  We ourselves know &mdash; and Senator Murphy made reference to it &mdash; that we are not developing our own natural resources to the extent we can and should.  Then, in turn, we will be able to allow the countries who have their own natural resources to keep them, process them, develop them and so, in fact, to build up their own economies That is what the need for aid and development is about, not hand-outs.</P>
    <P>There is a very grave concern among people who are working in the developing world that we will impose our technology, our thinking and our ideas of success and richness on people in those countries.  There is the obscenity to which reference has been made, of having armaments and tanks in deserts where there is no irrigation.  As a country we contribute funds but we should make sure that in extending aid we do not rob the people of their traditional ways and their own independence.  Instead, we should add to and enrich that.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about this in so far as to a great extent many of the traditional crafts and skills that are within the country, but not technologically progressed yet, are and have been done in small villages and communities and particularly by the women there.  When we start development work we are inclined to impose on them a new order, a new tradition that can impoverish them, spiritually and emotionally.  For women, it can deny them the small share of economic independence they had before.  I ask the Minister to ensure that we continue the programme that has been started by the Coalition Government, and particularly by the former Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe.  We should realise it is not just a matter of hand-outs. We may have problems in Ireland but we should not forget we are still the 26th richest country in the world.  When I was growing up it was a question of giving a <Col N="68" /> penny for the black babies.  In the global village in which we live we should allow the family next to us to develop in their own way.  We should help them with our resources but leave them their independence. That programme, accompanied with our increased aid, would I hope also help to bring about an end to rockets in the desert and armaments on the dry, sandy wastes of more than half of the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Clare</i>): First, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election to the Chair.  I wish you a very successful and long stay in the post.  I wish also to thank Senator Bulbulia for her kind remarks and good wishes to me.</P>
      <P>There is very little controversy as far as I can gather about this Bill.  We are all agreed that it is worthwhile and worthy of support, but a few questions were asked which I would like to answer.</P>
      <P>One question was with regard to what commodities were involved.  The fund is available for any of the commodities for which there is an international commodity agreement.  The core commodities are coffee, cocoa, tea, sugar, cotton, rubber, jute, sisal, copper and tin.  The principal existing commodity agreements relate to cocoa, coffee, tea, sugar, wheat, rubber and tin.  Any of these commodities, as well as additional commodities, are welcome to avail of the fund.  Much will depend on their existing financial arrangements; for example, the International Sugar Association was mentioned. They have said that they might get along without the fund and that is their view.  With regard to the question of whether potential burdens over and above those provided for have been quantified, the answer is no.  The agreement provides for reviews of resources. In so far as we in Ireland are concerned, the Bill places a ceiling on our share of contributions.  Any guarantees which may have to be given will have to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of when the point of entry comes into force was raised.  At the <Col N="69" /> moment only 26 counties have ratified the agreement.  Of these two are members of the EEC namely, Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Those who have ratified the agreement will meet this month to discuss extending the date of participation. They will, in all probalility, extend the date from 31 March 1982 to 31 December 1983 in order to ensure that by that later date there will be an increase in the number of ratifications.  So far, many countries have been dragging their feet about the ratification.  They were the principal points which were raised and I have endeavoured to answer them.</P>
    <P>Senator Barnes spoke about helping people with our own technology and so forth rather than in the form of hand-outs. We have been doing that in other fields.  From my own experience I know that Foras Forbartha and the ESB have been giving the benefit of their know-how and technology to some of these countries, and one in particular which you would describe as a desert country has been helped with regard to water and sewerage schemes.  That has been going on for some time by some State agencies.</P>
    <P>As has been said, it is a start.  As Senator Dooge knows from his own experience, there is much talk at the conferences which take place before the agreement is agreed to about the desire to help all these nations we have been talking about.  Some nations are very loud in expressing their wishes and desires and so on, but when it comes to putting up the money many of them do not put their money where their mouths have been in the past.  This has been the experience as far as I know but I hope it will improve. I hope that most of the money involved in this agreement, as in other agreements, will not get lost on the way from its source to the people who are supposed to benefit from it.  This has been happening in the past with big international agencies: whether in administration or in other areas, a big percentage of the money gets lost or wasted and the amount we would like does not find its way to the people who are really in need.</P>
    <P>It should also be said that we in the western world through all these agencies were very good at creating big cumbersome <Col N="70" /> bureaucracies, but it must also be said that the Third World countries are quite adept at doing that also.  It should not have to happen to an administrative agency such as this.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions. I will convey the points they have raised because they have been very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned, the Schedule is very long.  It is 44 pages in all and what I propose to do is to raise the points I want to make chapter by chapter. Perhaps when I raise the points on one chapter the Minister will respond and other Senators may wish to contribute so that we do not get a confused discussion. If we look to the Schedule, which is given legislative effect by section II, Chapter I is largely concerned with definitions and raises no difficulties.  When we come to Chapter II we are dealing with objectives and functions.  I have a real difficulty here that I did mention in the course of my Second Stage speech &mdash; as to whether all <Col N="71" /> seven objectives adopted at UNCTAD-IV are properly included.  In Resolution 93, of UNCTAD-IV, we have spelled out in considerable detail seven specific objectives.  While these objectives are agreed in article II one finds afterwards in the actual implementation that there seems to be emphasis only on the first few objectives.  Can we take it that the instrument is adequate to carry out all seven objectives in Resolution 93 of UNCTAD-IV?</P>

I do not think it can fully carry out the objectives of UNCTAD-IV.  My remaining worry is that if it has taken us six years to get this instrument, it will be another six before we have the second instrument.

Chapter IV deals with the relationship of the various international commodity boards to the fund. I would like the Minister to give some more information about what is proposed in regard to the pre-existing boards.  The Minister did indicate that, for example, under the International Sugar Agreement they may not wish to refer to the fund, but what happens if they want to refer to the fund?  Does the present sugar organisation have to become an ICB under Chapter IV or can there be dealings without this having to happen?</P>

I express the wish that we would be all better off if there were far less ICBMs, far more CBMs and far more ICBs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Chapter V of the Schedule we run into some difficulties.  I want to refer here to Schedule A to the Schedule.  Schedule A appears on page 38 of the Bill.  I note from Schedule A to the Schedule that while we have adhered to this agreement, which is the very least we could do, we have adhered at the lowest level.  Senator <Col N="73" /> Murphy might be gratified that we place ourselves firmly in the neo-colonial area, that our contribution will be the same as that of the Solomon Islands, the same as that of Nepal and Mali, and democratic Kampuchea and such countries as Botswana and Albania.  While I am not urging any additional expenditure, I would express the hope that once this operation is going, we would find it possible in this country to get up off the floor of the absolutely minimum subscription.</P>
    <P>I have a couple of queries regarding Chapter VI which deals with operations. Is the Minister satisfied that merely by having a governor as a member that we will be able to satisfy ourselves in regard to the level of administrative expenses and the efficiency of the operation of this international body?  Various international bodies, whether they are UN agencies or not, vary very greatly in their efficiency.  Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann are being asked to vote moneys here and may be asked to vote more money later.  What information will we have back on which we could make some sort of judgment about the efficiency of operation?</P>

This is a Bill for the establishing of funds and so has properly been introduced by the Minister for Finance, who appoints the governor to the board on our behalf.  I would like to ask what steps will be taken <Col N="74" /> to ensure that the points of view of Government Departments, other than the Department of Finance, will be taken into account in any representations the governor makes?  I note that there is room also for an alternate and I wonder if in view of the fact that while this Bill is concerned with the fund and the fund is concerned with the question of development, which is the concern of the Department of Foreign Affairs, whether in fact while one would accept that the governor would be from the Department of Finance, whether the alternate who would accompany that governor would come from the Department of Foreign Affairs or some Department, other than the Department of Finance.</P>

In attempting to find out from this Bill about voting strengths, it would appear that the voting strengths are &mdash; for example, the developed countries will have a voting strength of 42 per cent &mdash; I am trying to find out how that is related to their subscribed capital.  I have seen <Col N="75" /> two different figures.  One figure I found in some material indicates that the developing countries will get a 42 per cent voting strength and subscribe 68 per cent. Another source gives me 51 per cent for the voting strength.

We have here buried away in a Schedule to a Bill an immunity for individuals and even when we come to Chapter X, if we have the stamina to get that far, we just find reference to similar immunities in regard to similar funds.

It is slightly worrying that privileges are being given here in a way that if somebody wanted to look up the statutory authority for it, he would find it extremely difficult to locate it.</P>

      <P>I understood the Minister to say that it is now likely that this agreement will not come into force until 31 December 1983.  This means it will not come into operation until 1984.  We will therefore have an eight year lapse from the time of the agreement.  I think this is most unfortunate and I suggest to the Minister that we should urge our EEC colleagues to move on this.  I was aware that the UK had already moved.  I had been under the <Col N="77" /> impression that Denmark had moved, but from what the Minister has said this may not be so.  I think that having ratified this agreement, even if we did not do it before 31 March last as we should have done, we should now do everything we can to see that there is no further delay.</P>

      <P>I understand we will be taking the Irish Shipping Bill on that day.  I would ask the Leader of the House if he would exert his best endeavours to see if there is any other business in the form of a motion or otherwise which could be taken.  If this is proposed, I would be glad if we could be informed beforehand.</P>
