      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael Ferris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for a decision in relation to compensation for reactor cattle.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>Before we go on to the Order of Business, I would like to say a few words because at a later stage when we will be announcing the Adjournment of the House for the Recess, some of my colleagues may have left the Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my judgment it would never be out of order for me to express my gratitude and thanks to all Senators in this House for their help and kindness to me as Cathaoirleach in my first session of my five <Col N="1272" /> year term of office.  I would like also to thank Mr. Tobin and Mr. Geoghegan, the senior Ministers and the Ministers of State, the press, and all the staff of the House for their courtesy to me at all times.</P>
    <P>I would like to add that we will be going into recess until October and that will be noted with great publicity, but I would like to point out that Senators go on serving even during the recess.  Therefore I would advise everybody here to take two weeks leave and try to get away from it all, as they say, with their families, because they pay a high price too, for serving and backing us up.  I thank you sincerely and I hope to see you in the autumn.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, may I suggest that this House express its abhorrence of the savage slaughter carried out in London last Tuesday and that it puts on record its profound sympathy with those involved? Some days ago on the Order of Business Senator West proposed that we express our pleasure at the great performance of the Northern Ireland soccer team in the World Cup.  It is sad that, following the same precedent we have today to deal with a very different and tragic matter.  It is said that expressions of shock and sympathy at outrages like this are useless, but what choice have we?  If we are silent it will be regarded as being despairing and fatalistic.  That we must never be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Provisional IRA in their statement following the atrocity in London on Tuesday spoke about the sovereignty of the Irish people.  Their &ldquo;Irish people&rdquo; is a mystical entity.  They have no respect for flesh and blood Irish people.  It has been said that they represent a new kind of republicanism, a new kind of unscrupulous Irish nationalism.  I wish that was so.  There is a malign strain in Irish republicanism and the only thing that marks off <Col N="1273" /> what happened in London last Tuesday from things attempted in the last century is simply that the Provisionals have at their disposal the cruelty of modern technology. Their purpose is to embitter Anglo-Irish relations, to revive the dying embers of Anglophobia and to embroil our Government in conflict with the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The aim of terrorists is to create terror. They want to have their way by putting the fear of God in people and by putting pressures on people in Government to yield to their will.  They must not be allowed to do so.  Public opinion must take every opportunity to express itself as I hope the House will today.</P>
    <P>Expressions of sympathy, such as I hope the House will back, are of no use unless we encourage positive developments and positive political stirrings, no matter how imperfect they may be; no use, unless we have the courage to face up to questions which have hitherto been taboo questions, no use if we keep on indulging in cheap irredentist rhetoric for political purposes and no use if we threaten unilaterally to slacken Border security.  If we slackened Border security we would be cutting our own throats, literally.  Make no mistake about it, the only reasons why the Provisionals do not engage the Army and the Garda in our State is for purely strategic reasons.  They cannot carry on the so-called liberation struggle on two fronts.  When they get their way in the North by such horrible deeds as last Tuesday they will not bow out gracefully and hand over to the Government in Dublin.  Their avowed aim is to destabilise, which is a euphemism for &ldquo;to destroy&rdquo; this State.  We are their next target.  Some of the shock and horror we all felt when we heard the news we were feeling ultimately for ourselves and for our children.  We can indeed adapt the poet's famous line and say: &ldquo;Ask not at whom the Armalites point, ask not for whom the bombs explode, they explode for us.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Murphy's well-chosen words.  This House should express abhorrence at the <Col N="1274" /> crime perpetrated in London on Tuesday and sympathy for the victims and their relatives.  We should pledge our determination to do everything we can in concert with the British authorities to bring these criminals to justice.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party and on my own behalf I would like to add my voice to Senator Murphy's well-chosen words.  I certainly offer our sincere sympathy to the immediate relatives of the people who have been killed and seriously injured.  I come from a part of the country from which emigration is high.  Unfortunate people who emigrated from my county will suffer because of this unfortunate incident last Tuesday which should never have happened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I should like to be associated with the condemnation of this savage and dastardly act carried out in London with such a dreadful loss of human life and, indeed, animal life.  A short time ago when we debated the question of extradition I pointed to some desperate acts carried out by people who claim to be Irish and purport to do these deeds in our name. Since the foundation of this State no Irish man has stooped to such a cowardly, terrorist act with such dastardly consequences. We must join together to condemn these acts and not allow this kind of intimidation to prevent joint efforts to reach a solution to this problem.  Terrorists like these have no support or even justification for their deeds.  Indeed, the cause they purport to serve will never be served like this.  Our efforts in peaceful discussions over the past decade to find a solution to the problem have been set back by this act.  It is a tragedy that these people should try to undermine the democratic political institutions of the State. I join in the condemnation of this terrible act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMallon" hpid="Mr. Mallon Mr. Mallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the condemnation of this particularly obscene slaughter of people going about their recreation and their business on a fine day.  There are two elements to the tragedy.  One is that a very dramatic event of this nature captures attention not just in Britain but <Col N="1275" /> throughout the whole world.  It is tragic, however, that the catalogue of killings one by one in the North of Ireland does not grab these headlines, the type of killings which have resulted in almost 3,000 people dead on a normal scheduled basis, without publicity, and without dramatic effect.  We should bear that in mind.  While recognising the dramatic and obscene nature of this act, we must also relate it to all the other killings within this island.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I could extend the quotation from John Donne which Senator Murphy used and plagiarise it, as he did, by saying that no island is an island.  This particular killing brings that home to us very much. What happens within this group of islands will have an effect, be it in Britain, the North of Ireland or the South of Ireland. If no island is an island, surely no part of an island can be an island.  As I said in the debate on extradition, in the last analysis there is no security solution to the problem; there is no military solution to the problem; there is a political solution to the problem.  Unless we try consciously and with all determination to get that political solution, unfortunately the circumstances within which this type of act can be perpetrated will continue.  That is a harsh reality.  It is a harsh fact, but it is one which we as politicians must face up to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While recognising the way in which people have felt revulsion at this killing, and indeed by the other killings which have taken place over this past 13, 14, 15 years &mdash; you could say 60 years; indeed, you could extend it to say 800 years &mdash; we must also realise that our job as politicians, as people who represent constituencies within the whole of Ireland, is to work towards a political solution which will make it irrelevant for the people who did these deeds to operate, which will show that the political process itself is working towards a solution.  I keep repeating the fact that, while the political process is failing to find a solution to our problems, while the political process is seen not to be terribly interested in finding a solution to our problems, the situation is wide open to the gunmen and the <Col N="1276" /> bombers.  If that has any political relevance to us, apart from our revulsion at the deed, surely it must be that the united aim of all the political parties, the legitimate political parties in this island, must be to find a solution which will not be confined simply to one little part of these islands, but which will recognise the fact that, however much things change in the future, we are linked together.</P>
    <P>Our problems can only be solved by a concentrated effort within the type of Anglo-Irish framework which will prevent not just the killings and the slaughter in the North of Ireland but what has been happening in the North of Ireland for so many years.</P>
    <P>I repeat that no part of this island can be an island.  No part of a solution can be confined simply to one part of this island. Unless a solution is found, we will have to continue for another ten, 15 or 20 years to make these condemnations which become almost ritual.  Until we work for and find a political solution, there will be no let up because we will leave the way wide open to the men of violence.  We will stand condemned if we do not work wholeheartedly in conjunction with all of the other factors involved towards finding a lasting solution.  Could I emphasise that again?  A settlement is not what is being sought because settlements are, by the very nature of the word, temporary. What we want is a lasting solution which will recognise the needs, requirements, fears and aspirations of all sections of the community within this island, a solution which will last and make this type of slaughter a bad dream.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, it is appropriate, since this is the only House of the Oireachtas sitting at the moment, that you should have allowed these contributions on the Order of Business.  I regret that they had to come from the Independent benches and that they did not come from the Government.  These vile murderers who commit these crimes are claiming to act in our name.  It is important that we pass this motion unanimously so that the people of the United Kingdom and people of Ireland know that we dissociate ourselves from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> I am a little tired of people shedding crocodile tears over murders.  It is very easy to condemn murders time after time. It is a very easy way of absolving oneself. Time and time again Ministers, parties and bodies condemn murders and say they are wrong.  When it comes to action, we are found lacking.  We are very good with words.  In this House two weeks ago all the political parties decided to funk the issue of taking action on this very subject, and avoided having a vote on this important matter.  If these men have any sense they will have crossed the Irish Sea by now, because they will be much safer here than they would be in London. There is a great deal of ambivalence in this House with people standing up and saying how dreadful these murders are but are not prepared to do anything about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse the words of my colleague, Senator Mallon. Perhaps above all the people in this House I have had cause to see the end result of the type of carnage which was described so graphically and vividly in the national papers only two days ago.  I well remember ten years ago being moved to become politically involved in the situation in Northern Ireland from the evidence before my eyes following the Abercorn disaster in Belfast.</P>
      <P>I should like to pursue the matter a little further than that and to say that, while such acts as these are totally reprehensible to all men of humanity, it ill behoves any of us to stop at the point of condemning them.  We must all do as Senator Mallon suggested.  As Irishmen, North and South, of whichever tradition we belong, we must seek a solution which will endure and which will have the possibility of relegating this barbarous activity to the history books once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seriously indict both the London and Dublin establishments for their failure to deal with this last element of the Anglo-Irish dilemma.  This violence has continued since the shooting in Belfast on 14 August 1969.  I remember going home after a most terrible night with the first 13 bullets in bottles.  In my opinion it is an international disgrace that the combined <Col N="1278" /> minds, hearts, actions and thinking of the people living in this island and living on the other island across the water, through their Governments, have not yet produced a resolution to this age-old problem which will allow us to move about Northern Ireland in peace and will also encourage us to focus on the real and great social issues which at present confront all the people of Ireland, both North and South.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>For somebody who is not normally at a loss for words, this situation is one in which words are almost inadequate.  I do not want or intend to get into an argument with Senator Ross on the question of extradition.  I would merely like to point out that we will have to get things done.  It was the opinion of this party that extradition as such is not an effective solution and that the other measures we proposed in its stead would have a much more adequate response in action to the situation than extradition itself.</P>
      <P>Two points I would like to make very briefly are &mdash; first, that violence is no moral solution to any of the problems which face the human race.  When that violence is directed cold-bloodedly and with deliberate forethought in order to create publicity and is directed at innocent victims and bystanders, women and children going about their normal business, then there is less morality about it. Secondly &mdash; and this is something we in this House have a particular duty to emphasise and to underline &mdash; those who claim the right to carry out acts of this kind are acting without any mandate whatsoever, be it legal, constitutional or moral, and if we continue to tolerate a world in which people can act in this way, the future is bleak indeed.  I would like to associate myself with Senator Murphy's remarks and hope that we can look forward to a world that is more ordered, more peaceful and just.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, condemn this cowardly and dastardly action which all right thinking Irish people, and people all over the world, should condemn.  I also support Senator Mallon because in my opinion it is not enough to condemn those <Col N="1279" /> actions; we must seek a solution to this old problem.  This kind of action should force governments and the people of this island to work together towards finding a lasting solution.  In the absence of finding a solution some people perpetrate acts in the name of this country, and in the name of all Irish people, which none of us could ever stand over and within our limited powers we should work towards resolving this problem.  Let us hope we will not be faced with another ten or 20 years like the last decade or with the tragedies experienced here by people in the North and by those living across the water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course what happened in London was an obscenity, but as, I suspect, the only Member of either House of the Oireachtas who questioned the principle of armaments, armies and militarism, I believe there are a couple of things which need to be added to what has been said.  I have publicly articulated the philosophy that joining any army, legal or illegal, brutalises the person who does so.  I believe all warfare is cowardly, dastardly, brutal and obscene, and not just terrorist warfare.  It is worth recalling that there is no weapon, no device, no technique which is available to terrorists which has not been initially devised, planned and conceived by the legitimate armed forces of countries and parliaments who quite rightly denounce terrorism and terrorist activities.  All warfare is wrong.  All warfare is an obscenity.  It is an attack on humanity, and it is one-sided and unbalanced to identify the activities of terrorism as being in a particular way obscene.  They are no worse than the plans, schemes, tactics and weapons that every legitimate armed force in the world has at its disposal and is willing to use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While what was done was an obscenity, may I urge that reaction to it will not produce yet again excesses by security forces North and South of the Border and in Britain which will inevitably bear heaviest on the unfortunate community in Northern Ireland, who have to carry the burden of having these so-called liberators in their midst and in addition have <Col N="1280" /> to carry the burden of security forces who are anything but sensitive to their needs? What was done was obscene, wrong and callous but the reaction must not be to make the lot of those who have suffered most in Northern Ireland tragedies &mdash; and everybody has suffered &mdash; suffer more in the name of a law and order solution which will not work and which has not worked to solve anybody's crime problems, North or South.  What happened in London was wrong, but it was only one more manifestation of the obscenity that is all war, illegitimate or legitimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sympathy and horror have already been expressed by the Taoiseach and by leaders of the other parties. Their views, and the views expressed here today, have the support of the vast majority of the people of this country, and certainly have the support of the people on this side of the House.  We are all outraged by the appalling events which happened in London a few days ago and we offer our sympathy to all those bereaved.  Everybody agrees that not only is this or any kind of violence not a solution to the problem but it makes the problem far worse each time something like this happens.  We are all satisfied that violence is not the answer but we must all acknowledge that to find an acceptable solution is very difficult indeed.  We must continue our efforts to find a solution by peaceful methods and no matter how difficult it may be or how long it may take, it is our duty, as members of political parties, to endeavour to find an acceptable solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must reject the suggestions that have been made that in some way by not taking certain measures, the Government are at fault or are indirectly responsible for what happened.  Once again extradition has been pulled out of the hat as being the magic formula that will bring an end to violence.  It is not a magic formula and we discussed that at some length a few weeks ago.  As I said then, if I thought that extradition was the answer then I would have to consider it very seriously. It is not the answer; it will not stop violence. On the other hand, every possible <Col N="1281" /> avenue must be explored to find a solution, to find a way of stopping violence and bringing to an end the unhappy situation which exists not only in the North of Ireland but exists for all of us on this island.  I support the expressions of sympathy and I hope a solution will be found.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four general areas covered by this Bill.  The first and most substantive area is the ESB's powers and duties in relation to financial matters, and, specifically, expenditure and borrowing for general or capital purposes. There is a limit on capital expenditure by the board under the legislation as it stands.  This is extended, by amending Acts, from time to time.  The present limit, which was set in the Act of 1981, is fixed at £1,400 million.</P>
      <P>This limitation will be reached in the latter part of this year on the basis of expenditure on approved capital projects now in hands.  An increase in the statutory limit is, therefore, necessary. However, I am proposing also in the Bill to change the nature of the limit from one based on expenditure to one based on borrowings.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons for doing this.  A large proportion of the board's capital expenditure must now be financed by borrowings.  Currently, the proportion stands at about 80 per cent. A change to a borrowings limit will, therefore, more accurately reflect this commercial reality.  In the same way as an increase in the expenditure limits came before the Oireachtas as a Bill, so will any change in borrowing limits, thus continuing the practice of a regular review of the ESB in both Houses.  The change to a borrowing limit will also bring the ESB legislation into line with more recent legislation affecting other semi-State bodies such as the Gas Act, 1976 which covers Bord Gáis Éireann.</P>
      <P>The limit which is specified in the Bill is £1,600 million, in aggregate, of borrowings which have not been repaid by the board.  At present the level of the board's unrepaid borrowings stands at £840 million. After taking account of money, which can be allocated from internal resources, it is estimated that the amount of new borrowings required to meet the capital programme up to 1985 will be £735 million which will bring the total to just under £1,600 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board's capital operations up to the early part of 1985 will be provided for in the limit set by the Bill.  At that stage <Col N="1285" /> it will be necessary to review again the financial requirements of the board and, if necessary, to seek the approval of the Oireachtas for a further increase in the limitation on borrowings.</P>
    <P>The statutory requirements relating to guarantee of ESB borrowings by the Minister for Finance are also being updated in the Bill.  Again, the objective is to bring them into line with more modern practice.  A limitation of £1,600 million is proposed to the total amount of such guarantees to coincide with the limitation on the board's total borrowings.</P>
    <P>Even with the foregoing provisions on borrowing limits, I consider it is desirable to formalise the arrangements for ministerial control over the capital expenditure programmes of the board.  It has been the administrative practice that the board submit for ministerial approval their proposals for the construction of new generating capacity and the estimated capital outlay thereon.  In the annual budgetary context, the annual capital programme of the ESB is included in the capital budget. The capital expenditure programmes of the ESB are very substantial indeed and they impact on the economy both in specific and general ways.  Therefore, I believe the principle of ministerial review of such programmes should be formally covered in the statutes governing the board's operations.</P>
    <P>Senators may feel that the provision proposed in subsection (1) of section 2 of the Bill is too all-embracing.  However, the provision as it stands has the merit of simplicity.  Senators will be aware that the capital expenditure programmes of the board in relation to new generating plant cover a period of many years.  In certain cases it may be necessary to give broad approval in principle tied to a provision for a review of the project in the light of changes in demand for electricity. A substantial element of flexibility would, therefore, be necessary in relation to the giving of ministerial approvals.  It will also be necessary to look at the board's capital expenditure proposals on an annual basis, and in the context of general economic policy.  Furthermore, there may be relatively short-term proposals for capital expenditure by the <Col N="1286" /> board which would need to be considered on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Senators will appreciate that if an attempt were made to draft legislation which would comprehend the variety of circumstances which I have mentioned the result would be unduly complex.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the matter with the ESB and we are satisfied that arrangements can be settled between us and with the Minister for Finance which will enable the provision in the Bill to be operated satisfactorily without inhibiting in any significant way the day-to-day activities of the board in regard to capital projects and expenditures.</P>
    <P>These are the principal elements in the financial provisions of the Bill.  In addition a number of minor, technical financial amendments to existing legislation are also proposed.  These will improve administrative efficiency, from the viewpoint of both the board and the Minister for Finance.  For instance, the requirement on the board, under the Act of 1954, to create a &ldquo;form of security&rdquo; when borrowing is being removed.  Delays in the negotiation of loan agreements have been caused by differences of legal opinion over the interpretation of this obligation on the board.  It is proposed to remove the obligation on the board to create a form of security, although the option of doing so will remain open to the board if lenders insist on it.</P>
    <P>The second area covered by the Bill relates to annual payments to be made by the board to the Minister for the Environment in lieu of rates on the board's generation and distribution plant.  The board are exempt from the payment of rates on such plant under existing legislation. In their consideration last year of departmental Estimates for 1982, the previous Government decided that the ESB should pay £10 million this year as a contribution in lieu of rates.  Accordingly, provision for the receipt of this sum was made in the Estimates for the Department of the Environment.  This was to be regarded as a temporary arrangement for 1982, pending official valuation and rating of the board's exempted property.</P>
    <P>The Government have, however, <Col N="1287" /> decided that in the special circumstances of the ESB there are arguments in favour of the concept of a payment, fixed by the Government, to be paid annually by the board in lieu of rates.  This Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>The third area covered by the Bill relates to amendment of certain provisions in the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942.  The objectives here are two fold &mdash; firstly to remove any doubts which might exist about the powers of the trustees of the board's superannuation committee to invest in real or personal property and, secondly, to provide for the removal of the existing requirement on the board to consult with the Minister for Finance before investing funds in securities already authorised by law.  This brings the relevant ESB superannuation provisions into line with those applicable to other State bodies.</P>
    <P>The final area dealt with in the Bill is the involvement of the board in fisheries activities.  These activities stem directly from the generation of electricity from hydro-electric stations on rivers which are the habitat of migratory fish such as salmon and eels.  Legislation in the past has given the board the authority and responsibility to acquire, manage and preserve fisheries affected by their hydro-electric schemes.</P>
    <P>At first, the ESB carried out this responsibility by the construction of salmon hatcheries.  At present the ESB produce over 80 per cent of artificially reared young salmon in the country.  At the beginning of last year in response to a Government request the board agreed to increase their overall salmon smolt production with the aim of producing two million smolts annually.  These fish will be released into salmon rivers in need of restocking on an annual basis and will contribute significantly to the salmon catch.  To do this the ESB require the freedom provided in the legislation, and the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, encouraged by the success of the ESB to date in their fishery activities, supports the Bill.</P>
    <P>The board operate two salmon hatcheries, one at Parteen on the River Shannon <Col N="1288" /> and the other at Carrigadrohid on the River Lee.  These two hatcheries are being expanded and a further hatchery is being constructed on the River Erne. This development on the River Erne follows a recommendation of the Erne Catchment Study on Cross-Border Cooperation and is receiving financial support from the EEC.</P>
    <P>It has been recognised for some years that farming of salmon in the sea would be of benefit nationally.  Work to date has shown the need for a breeding programme, disease control and integration of fresh-water hatchery activity with the rearing of the caged fish in the sea.  This important work is carried out in conjunction with the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, NBST and the universities.</P>
    <P>In addition, the ESB intend to support the mariculture industry around the coast by making salmon smolts available to the industry in order to boost salmon production. Currently the ESB are supplying salmon smolts to Bradán Mara for their commercial salmon farming in Connemara and on an experimental basis to Comhar Cumann na nOileán in Lettermore and to a private fish farmer in Kilmacillogue, County Kerry.</P>
    <P>The board propose to bring their own farmed salmon production initially to 100 tons per annum.  This will be done as rapidly as possible giving direct employent to ten people with a revenue, principally in foreign currency, of over £300,000.  The main outlets for this salmon are France and Britain.  Other markets are being explored.  The success of this operation will be followed by further expansion by the ESB in their own right and/or in conjunction with co-operatives and other salmon farming interests. Of course, these developments would be subject to the consent of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
    <P>The ESB are the prime eel exporter of the country assisting the State and other eel fishery owners in marketing their catches with their own.  The board, in the last season themselves produced 41 tons of eels and exported almost 80 tons to Germany and Holland.  The total value of these exports was £¼ million.  There are eight full-time employees of the board <Col N="1289" /> involved in eel fishing.  An intensive study on the use of warm water from power stations in eel culture is being carried out. The objective of this study is to develop a profitable eel farming enterprise by shortening the time taken to bring the eels to maturity.</P>
    <P>The ESB have ownership of extensive areas of freshwater, including fishing rights.  They are aware of the social benefits in making these available as amenities to the public in general and anglers in particular.  They have, apart from providing other amenities, successfully carried out cage culture of brown trout in reservoirs for release for angling, greatly enhancing the quality of the fishing. Some 120,000 fish up to one lb. in weight were released in Pollaphuca in the last year.  The board currently employ 50 fisheries staff and envisage employing 12 extra staff in the next year as a result of the development programme already outlined.</P>
    <P>The legislation which I an now moving is intended to enable the ESB to carry on and expand their work in aquaculture.  It also takes cognisance of the ESB's decision to expand, with Government support, their production of young salmon by threefold over the next few years.  This will benefit national salmon stocks, the netting industry, salmon angling, and assist the emerging salmon farming industry.</P>
    <P>The ESB occupy a position of very considerable importance among public sector institutions.  Their operations and the service they provide affect the entire economy and every citizen.  They are a major source of employment and their expenditure budgets are very substantial by any standards.  For example, in 1982 the total expected capital expenditure by the board is estimated at over £230 million of which some £125 millions will be spent on generating plant and about £87 million on transmission and distribution networks.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, right and reasonable that this House, and I as responsible Minister, should be concerned with reviewing the overall activities and the trend of policies of the ESB, without inhibiting the board's freedom to pursue their <Col N="1290" /> day-to-day business.  Before concluding, I should like to refer to two broad policy issues which are related and which I know are of as much concern to Senators as they are certainly to me.  Firstly, the fuel mix of the ESB's generating capacity is of vital importance because it affects our balance of payments and the use of certain valuable indigenous resources.  It also has a major effect in the second area to which I would like to refer, namely, the level of ESB charges to consumers.</P>
    <P>A main element of strategy on ESB fuel use must be to diversify away from oil as a primary energy source.  Apart from the volatility of oil costs, the risk of major disruption of international markets is always present.  In this context the coming on stream of the new coal burning facility at Moneypoint will be a major diversification.  The proportion of our installed generating capacity that depends on oil has been decreasing in recent years.  This trend will be maintained. The oil generating capacity, which stood at 54 per cent a year ago, now stands at 51 per cent.  By the end of the decade it will be about 35 per cent.</P>
    <P>The other element of our fuel strategy is to maximise the proportion of native fuel used by the ESB.  1,362 megawatt capacity has been approved for commissioning between now and the end of the decade.  Of this 88 megawatt will be fired by peat, including extensions to Shannonbridge and Lanesboro generating stations. A further 45 megawatt station will be constructed at Arigna using local low grade coal.  Native natural gas is already being used by the ESB in some of their power stations and while the premium domestic market is building up for natural gas its use by the ESB is helping to stabilise electricity prices to the consumer. It is also creating savings on oil imports which assist the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>Electricity tariffs have been in the news lately.  Over the past two years or so these have increased quite substantially.  These increases were granted on the basis of allowable cost increases incurred by the board, including fuels, salaries and other unavoidable increases in overheads. However, the level of increases has been <Col N="1291" /> disturbing, not only for domestic consumers but also, and especially, for industry. The most recent increase granted to the board has been limited to 5 per cent which is the most moderate for some years.  I was also glad to announce that, while allowing this increase for general purposes, there would be a reduction in the night-time electricity tariffs which would be of benefit to industry.  Furthermore, the fuel variation charge on ESB bills, which had become a source of confusion &mdash; and, indeed, some annoyance &mdash; to electricity consumers, has been removed.</P>
    <P>I will be concentrating my efforts to ensure that this desirable moderation in electricity increases will be maintained in the immediate future at least.  Recently the Government decided that the position on electricity prices generally should be fully reviewed.  The proposals for this review are well advanced in my Department. The outcome of the review will, it is hoped, help to throw light on recent allegations that our electricity prices compare unfavourably with prices elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Finally I should like to take this opportunity to state clearly that I have a high regard for the professional and technical competence of the ESB which has served the nation well over the years.  I would emphasise, however, that I consider the broad policy objectives of the board and the means of achieving these as major areas of direct concern to me.  I have a very satisfactory working relationship with the board and senior executives of the ESB and have every confidence that I will have their full co-operation in seeking to achieve the paramount objective of providing all consumers with a safe and continuous supply of electricity at the absolute minimum cost to them and to the economy.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill and I do not propose to delay the House with my contribution.  When the ESB is mentioned one automatically thinks of it as being one of the most successful State or semi-State organisations. <Col N="1292" /> In fact, it could be said the ESB is the most successful enterprise.  When such organisations are being discussed in the House it is a pleasure to talk about one that has been as successful as the ESB.  There are a number of areas where the ESB over the years have blazed a trail and proved that their proposals to diversify were well-founded.  They have shown that the diversification has also been profitable, which is essential if, for instance, a firm is to diversify and as a result try to bolster its finances from another source.  Then, obviously, there would be a grave danger that in regard to a company such as the ESB, which has interests abroad as well as at home, we could find ourselves supporting diversification abroad with cash from the home market.  This is not happening with the ESB and I hope it will never happen.  I mention that particularly because at some stage in the future there might be a danger, with fluctuations in the economy and in marketing generally, that home consumers would cast a very suspicious eye on diversification if they felt they were in some way subsidising that diversification.  The bottom line must be that all aspects of the board's diversification must be seen to be profitable, particularly those abroad.</P>
      <P>I would also refer briefly to something which the Minister has no control over, and that is that capital expenditure must be greatly financed from borrowing. Interest rates have a great effect on the cost to the board in this sense and we can only hope that interest rates will be sufficiently acceptable to allow the board to continue to make a profit and to give the consumer the kind of service that he has enjoyed over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that something has been done to try to resolve the one or two areas that have caused concern to domestic consumers, and I would suggest that the Minister might mention them to the board.  In rural areas when connections are being made to individual consumers, punitive charges are being placed on them.  This particularly affects young couples building houses for the first time, who have striven to provide the finance to build their homes.  They are then lumbered <Col N="1293" /> with a charge of £2,000 or £3,000 to lay on electricity.  This, coupled with the provision of other services, creates very severe and serious difficulties for them.  I understand that moves are afoot to bring about some type of resolution of this.  It is essential that there would be, because a great deal of hardship has been caused to young couples by that charge. I am aware that the ESB have to operate on the basis of profit and that it is also essential they be able to recoup the expenses incurred by them in laying on power to houses.  At the same time, the charge should not be so punitive as to make it almost impossible for those concerned to meet the charge.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the board for their encouragement to the fishing industry and the very important part they have played in assisting in particular salmon fisheries and in later years eel fishing.  I mentioned on a number of occasions in the past that all enterprises, whether State or in the private sector, which at this time are flourishing and are in a position to expand and to take on more employees, should be given every encouragement.  I was delighted to hear that the Minister seems to be proceeding to do that in another area.  It is absolutely essential that those firms, of whom the ESB is one, who have been operating efficiently and satisfactorily and have been showing a profit and providing good service should, in these times of recession, be encouraged to expand, to take on more employees.  At least we will be assured that when this is done we will not be throwing good money after bad.  Our investment will be secure and the return from that investment will be enhanced, as in the past.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to replacement of generating plant.  I am aware that it has not been the policy of the board to ensure that as much home produced plant as possible is used.  I accept that a great deal of generating plant, for obvious reasons, has to be imported, but I should like an assurance that in the future, wherever possible, generating plant that is home produced will be used in any up-dating that the board undertake.</P>
    <P>The use of fuel requires greater attention <Col N="1294" /> in the future.  I should not like to see a relatively cheap fuel being used to produce power, for the Electricity Supply Board or any other State or semi-State company, to such an extent that efficiency would be decreased as a result.  I am thinking in terms of natural gas and other resources.  There is no danger of this at present but there could well be in the future.  A lot depends on the efficiency of all the companies involved in the production of power.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as far as I am aware, did not refer to the other sources of fuel that the board propose to use.  He spoke of coal and peat burning but he did not refer to wood burning.  That is one area that requires more attention than it has been getting.  Many people are extremely worried at the amount of timber being exported which is suitable for use as a fuel in electricity generation.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned by reports I have heard that some native wood is being exported at the ridiculously low price of £1 per tonne.  Admittedly, a considerable amount of employment is given in the carriage of the product to the port and so on, but it would be counter-productive if we were to approve of a policy to export a very valuable fuel which at some later stage would be re-imported, processed, at a considerably higher cost. It would be ridiculous to allow this to happen and I would ask the Minister to pay particular attention to exports of wood which would be suitable for use as a raw material for electricity generation in wood burning generating plants.  This aspect has worried me for some time and I have had a number of people in touch with me who are very concerned about the exports that are at present allegedly taking place.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the elimination of the fuel variation charge which has been in operation for the past couple of years.  In many cases the fuel variation charge matched the charge for consumption of electricity within the two month period.  It seems ridiculous to have a fuel variation charge when ink could have been spared by including this in the charge for units used.  With the removal <Col N="1295" /> of the fuel variation charge also came a price increase.  But we cannot expect semi-State bodies to operate efficiently and give a good service without giving them the opportunity of paying their way.  The ESB have had a very good record.  They have been seen to be a healthy company over a long number of years.  They have shown by their diversification that they have picked the right areas and shown that they are profitable and have also given considerable assistance to fishing and various other sporting areas and helped in various other promotions. It is my great pleasure to welcome this Bill and I would now like the Minister to reply to the various issues that I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill.  I have a feeling that in some way I should make a small contribution. I have lived with the ESB from a very early date.  My father was one of those who pioneered the ESB and, indeed, our house in those early days was very much an ESB house.  The people who worked in the ESB at the start of the campaign stayed with us in Athlone and they travelled from Athlone to Longford, to Roscommon and to Borrisokane by bicycle. These were great men of the past who built the ESB and made them what they are today, a great organisation and a great employer and in many ways one of the finest organisations that we have in this country.  I would like to congratulate them for the work they have done down the years for the people of Ireland.  We are now living in a changing world.  They have diversified in the past.  They will continue to diversify in the future to meet the changing demands of the future.  That is where the ESB have shown much of their competence down the years.  As employers they are excellent giving excellent salaries and good conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally the professionalism of the ESB is to be totally and absolutely praised in this House and anywhere else. That is not to say that from time to time we should not criticise them.  Certainly we should do so because they have a monopoly situation and if they are doing <Col N="1296" /> wrong or if their charges are too high then it is right that they should come in for some level of criticism, and they do from time to time.  I would like, as the previous speaker did, to welcome the fact that the Minister has removed the fuel variation clause.  As he said himself, it was a cause of annoyance.  I think perhaps he is being very nice there.  It is certainly something that many people felt should not be there and I am glad it has been removed.</P>
    <P>On the question of connection fees, I would like to appeal to the Minister that where there is an old person, a pensioner who has not yet got electricity &mdash; and there cannot be too many such people around &mdash; every consideration should be given to giving that person a reduced rate or perhaps making no charge.  It is something the Minister should examine.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of high rise flats that are totally dependent on the ESB.  We have schemes here in Dublin, in Athlone and in other towns.  As far as the Athlone scheme is concerned the ESB sought the business, they got the business and they informed us that it would cost no more than 15 shillings a week at that time.  I accept that conditions have changed, that oil prices have gone out of all proportion to what was expected and that is the reason for the increases.  I would hope that in an area like this a special rate would apply and that great consideration will be given to those people who are now paying colossal rates.  Monthly or two monthly bills of well over £100 are usual.  Certainly we should not allow that situation to continue if we can stop it.</P>
    <P>Overall I welcome the Bill.  The Minister said that the objective is to provide consumers with a safe and continuous supply of electricity at the absolute minimum cost to them and to the economy. This is a clear and real objective that has to be pursued, it is admirable and it is something that we should all work towards.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few points on the question of the fuel variation charge.  Like my colleague, Senator Durkan, I do not agree that the <Col N="1297" /> charge should be removed from the bill. It has been readily admitted that the charge has been added to the bill.  There is going to be no difference in the bill. There could be extra increases that nobody would know about.  But perhaps I should say why I think it should be left as a fuel variation charge.  The reason is that the ESB are using a fair amount of natural gas now.  I understand that they use 125 million cubic feet per day, or they were to use that in the Cork plant.  It is now nearer to 200 million cubic feet per day.  The gas line is on its way to Dublin and I understand that the Ringsend station will use gas as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we all know, gas is going to the ESB at a very low charge.  Nobody has denied that.  More and more of our natural gas will be used by the ESB yet people will not know what their variation charges are.  For example, if £60 million is saved by the company in the buying of oil, how can we indicate to people that the ESB are now charging the right price?  I feel that we are giving them the go-ahead to do what they want to do.  The Minister has rightly said that people throughout the country are annoyed.  People are seriously concerned at the way the ESB are treating them.  ESB increases have been higher than the consumer index rate.  We will allow for that because of oil prices.  But, at the same time, in comparison with everything else, ESB charges have been much higher.  Yet nobody can honestly and sincerely explain why.  The only thing they said they would do is take away the fuel variation charge.  But this has been added to the bill.  The bill will not be less at the end of two months.  It can be increased now and nobody will know the reason for it.  I will give an example.  The Post Office have now come out with a good bill which specifies the details exactly.  I see no reason why this type of bill could not be issued by the ESB.  The Minister must agree that the removal of the fuel variation charge is not the answer.  It is still in the bill. Nobody has said that the Bill is going to be less.  In fact it could be more and we will not know why.  In 12 months time the ESB will be using more gas because it is now on the way to Dublin.  Will the bills <Col N="1298" /> be less because of that, and if so, how is this to be indicated on the bill?  Are they going to come to the National Prices Commission every month and say they used so much this month so they will charge less?  It is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the fuel variation charges are being removed while the amounts are still being included in bills. The ESB are to be given more gas but it might to better used elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The ESB are now prepared to give night consumption at a lower rate.  The vast majority of our factories are closing earlier every night now because there is no work available for them.</P>
    <P>Since gas has been provided to the ESB in Cork, I understand that something in the region of 60 per cent of the heat thus generated has been wasted.  Why was some project not set up by the ESB so that the heat from that gas could be used elsewhere to heat something else?  Perhaps heating could be provided at a lesser charge for people living in flats.  That is a lot of wastage.  Is the same thing to happen in Ringsend?  I hope the ESB are planning now that the heat which is being wasted can be used elsewhere.  These wastages should not happen.</P>
    <P>I get afraid at times that our semi-State bodies are inclined to do these kinds of things without any concern at all for anybody within the State.  Yet it is the people's money.  I feel that the semi-State bodies at times are not responsible to the people.  A perfect example of that is the annoyance caused to the public by the so-called &ldquo;removal&rdquo; of fuel variation charges.  The charges will still be included in the ESB bills but the public will not be told about it.  That is a very serious thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification relating to something said by Senator Cregan, I was not suggesting that the fuel variation charge should not be removed. In fact, I agree with its removal entirely. The point I was making was that although it was removed, which is a good thing, the unfortunate part of it was that there was a subsequent price increase which will erode the benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to this debate.  I share the concern of both Senator Cregan and Senator Durkan and I can understand the case being made by Senator Cregan, but I think we have to appreciate what the reality of the situation is.  We would all welcome the removal of the fuel variation charge which in effect means that the ESB cannot now seek sanction for price increases from the National Prices Commission every quarter as they have been doing.  It is now a once-off application in the year.  While we would all like to think that there would be no price increase in any particular year, we all fully realise that that is not possible, not realistic.  We must put in context the price increase of 5 per cent this year as against the consumer price index and the inflation rate. The ESB have their share of increases in cost inputs.</P>
      <P>Taking all aspects into consideration, including the input of natural gas into the ESB system, a price increase of only 5 per cent this year is reasonable and that increase has not been imposed on night tariff users.  The reduction to industrial users who are on the night tariff is an effective 16 per cent which, when one looks at the comparisons of energy cost that have been made in recent times with competitors in the EEC, does give a measure of relief, and hopefully that measure of relief can be sustained and improved over the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is precisely for some of the reasons raised here that the Government have instigated a review of the total pricing policy and of the reasons why certain aspects of the ESB costings appear or are alleged to be out of line with others. Nevertheless one has to compare like with like.  There is no point in comparing our energy costs with those in a specific region in France where all their energy is supplied by hydro-electric power stations or looking at a region in Germany where all their electricity is supplied by nuclear stations.  We have to compare like with <Col N="1300" /> like.  It is precisely to get the matter into proper perspective that this review will be carried out and I hope it will be informative.</P>
    <P>A question was raised by Senator Cregan in regard to the use of natural gas by the ESB.  That should also be taken in the proper perspective.  If the ESB were not a customer for natural gas then the building of a gas pipeline from Cork to Dublin would not have been a viable proposition.  We can produce various arguments as to whether the most effective use is being made of it, but when we get down to the finer points, the difference is not great.</P>
    <P>The pipeline project from Cork to Dublin can make an impact on the balance of payments and on the total economic development of the country and I believe the right decision is to use it to the maximum national economic benefit.</P>
    <P>There were other points made in the debate in relation to the cost of connecting new consumers to the electricity supply. The present position is that the ESB now pay 50 per cent of the connection charge.  The other 50 per cent can be paid on a deferred payment basis over a period of up to five years.  For people in the 12 western counties who can take advantage of the FEOGA scheme, the only contribution would be 20 per cent, the balance of 80 per cent being made up between the EEC and the Government.</P>
    <P>I note the compliments that have been paid to the ESB and I want to voice my appreciation of the people who pioneered this great national project, worked on it in the thirties and brought it to the present level of success.  The diversification in which the ESB have engaged right through the 1970s and up to today has been very successful.  As Senator Durkan rightly commented, it is companies like this, whether in the private or semi-State areas, that should be encouraged in these difficult times to diversify.  The ESB are successfully doing so.  They have engaged in consultancy work, both in the Third World and elsewhere. Last year they had 40 full-time engineers employed in projects that they have developed in countries like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Bahrain.  At the <Col N="1301" /> same time they are providing training facilities here for technicians.  They are good earners of foreign currency and have shown profits on these projects.  The expansion and diversification that have taken place is to be commended and perhaps expanded in the future.</P>
    <P>In relation to wood burning, this is an area in which the ESB have engaged and they have sown something in the region of 125,000 acres in Offaly and other midland counties.  They are burning a certain amount of wood mixed with anthracite in various places.  Senator Durkan was probably referring to thinnings from the forests.  If more of the wood-anthracite mixture can be used it certainly will be done because as the Irish forests develop through the eighties there will be much more of it coming on stream.  We must also bear in mind that there is a new plant being built in Clonmel which is already stock-piling the waste from the forest and they will be ready to go into production in about 18 months' time.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan raised the question of the wastage of heat.  I helped to pioneer a project in Lanesboro some years ago related to hot water pouring out of the ESB station into the Shannon.  While it did help the local anglers to some extent, nevertheless better use could have been made of it, and several acres of glass-houses have been built beside the ESB station.  Young entrepreneurs have become involved in market gardening. The energy cost for the production of vegetables and potted plants has been halved.  That is an area the ESB should look at in the light of the development at the Lanesboro power station and see where it can be developed further.  I agree totally with the sentiments expressed by him that energy must be conserved and better use made of it.  In fairness to the ESB they have conducted many pilot schemes in relation to the consumption of energy.  They are in control of a pilot scheme which has been sponsored by the EEC and delivery vans around the city of Dublin are being run on batteries instead of either petrol or diesel over a three-year period.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the ESB and a few other <Col N="1302" /> semi-State bodies are involved in piloting many areas of conservation and in the development of biomass.  I am sure every Member of the House would like to see them continue to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (1), page 4, lines 6 to 44, and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The principal functions of the Agency shall be&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to examine the extent and sources of inequality in all its forms in Irish society on an on-going basis;</P>
      <P>(b)  to undertake action aimed at combating poverty and to evaluate such action;</P>
      <P>(c)  to appraise critically existing policies and programmes in so far as they affect poverty and to recommend modifications in policies or programmes where such are necessary to combat poverty;</P>
      <P>(d)  to suggest effective new policies and programmes against poverty and to test out new programmes on an experimental basis;</P>

    <P>(f)  to promote greater co-ordination of the programmes of statutory and voluntary agencies against poverty and social deprivation.</P>
    <P>(2)  In addition to the functions set out in subsection (1), the Agency shall have the following functions&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to advise the Minister, in relation to social and economic planning, on matters which relate to poverty and social deprivation;</P>
    <P>(b)  to advise the Minister and to make recommendations to him regarding community development policies and community development programmes in relation to self-help, poverty and social services;</P>
    <P>(c)  to advise the Minister on the development of community-based services, including in particular improved training and the supply of community development staff;</P>
    <P>(d)  to draw on and evaluate research on self-help, poverty and social deprivation by third-level educational and other bodies, and to promote research from time to time on specific projects;</P>
    <P>(e)  to promote through community information centres specifically and by other means a greater public knowledge of statutory entitlements and services;</P>
    <P>(f)  to collect and disseminate information on community development, self-help.  poverty and social deprivation;</P>
    <P>(g)  to promote greater public understanding of the nature, causes, and extent of poverty and social deprivation and the measures required to alleviate them;</P>
    <P>(h)  to perform such tasks and submit such reports as the Minister may from time to time direct.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is to substitute a series <Col N="1304" /> of functions for the agency in place of those contained in the section.  I referred during the course of a short contribution on Second Stage to the origins of the agency which is now proposed and I should like to repeat those briefly.  The proposed agency will replace the National Social Service Board in its entirety.  It is also seen by the Government to be an alternative to the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty.  It is no secret that the Government of the day were not enamoured of the work of that committee since its inception and sought any opportunity they could to place obstacles in the way of the committee and its employees.  They had it in mind to eliminate the committee and its work at the first opportunity.  Now the Government and the Minister have taken the opportunity afforded by the proposed new agency to wipe out the committee and its work and the philosophy which lay behind that work, under the guise that this new agency will in some way carry on the same kind of programmes and tasks.</P>
    <P>I read carefully the functions proposed for the agency in the Bill.  Apart from the fact that they are unduly vague, they are in no way a substitute for the philosophy behind the national committee to combat poverty.  They do not provide an opportunity for a national programme directed specifically towards the elimination of poverty.  Poverty, of course, is mentioned in the Bill on many occasions but there is no question of the Bill containing any philosophy behind the causes of poverty or any set of objectives to come to grips with those causes or to move towards the elimination of the scandal of 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the population living in poor circumstances.</P>
    <P>What I am trying to do in the amendment is to provide an alternative set of functions.  Some of these are already in the Bill but I have tried to make more explicit the concept that poverty exists, that it is a result of inequality, and to make more explicit the obligation on the agency to combat that poverty and to act against it openly and clearly and without equivocation.  We cannot write poverty off the agenda irrespective of how difficult <Col N="1305" /> the economic circumstances we find ourselves in.  We cannot wipe out at a stroke our knowledge of the scale of poverty or the embryonic anti-poverty programme which has struggled to survive during the seventies in difficult political and economic circumstances.  I believe strongly that if this agency does not have specific terms of reference which oblige it to act on behalf of poor people, to analyse the scale and causes of poverty and to help them to organise explicitly against it, the agency will be no more than the National Social Service Board is at the moment and, valuable though its work is, it is no substitute for a national anti-poverty programme.</P>
    <P>I have retained in the amendment before the House many of the ideas contained in the section in the Bill but I have attempted to make it clear that the agency's primary function is to act against poverty and on behalf of poor people. Therefore, I have suggested, for example, that the agency should undertake action aimed at combating poverty and evaluate such action.  That is a fairly straightforward and simple concept.  It means essentially that the agency will be a buttress on behalf of poor people against the State.  If the State does not give them equal opportunities it will have the obligation to stand on their behalf against Government agencies or private institutions when necessary.  It will also, as suggested further down in the amendment, have the function of modifying existing programmes or suggesting new programmes by agreement with statutory and voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>The section as proposed in the Bill is vague.  It does not appear to accept the reality of poverty or make suggestions about an explicit programme to combat it.  Assisting community development projects and self-help projects are valuable aids which I have included in my proposed amendment, but unless there is a clear unequivocal commitment of funding an agency which will act explicitly and clearly on behalf of poor people, where necessary, then we have effectively wiped out eight years' work and eliminated skills which have been accumulated during that time and which will take many <Col N="1306" /> years to reaccumulate if they are not used on an ongoing permanent basis now. Therefore I move the amendment, not with any great sense of antagonism to the Government which proposed it, but because it incorporates the good functions in the existing Bill and adds to them an explicit set of commitments in relation to the people whom the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty were trying to help, and retains that philosophy inside our legislative system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the points made by Senator O'Mahony in relation to his objective of providing the funds and resources to continue and develop the work for the poor which was initiated in the combat poverty pilot schemes.  These pilot studies indicated the possible directions for the future. Based on these, on the work of the National Social Service Board and on the experience generally otherwise, together with the developments which have been taking place in our society, this Bill proposes to meet all those requirements in what we believe to be the best way possible.  I would like the Senator to recognise that there is no intention to wipe out the combat poverty work or concept but in fact to enshrine this work in the kind of organisation which these pilot studies have ultimately led to.  Senator O'Mahony said we should not write poverty off the agenda but there is no intention to do this.  All through the Bill, including this section and the original Bill as it stands, poverty and social deprivation are highlighted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Senator raised the question of economic circumstances, £250,000 was to be provided for the national committee on poverty.  In the Estimates this year this body will have £2 million.  In economic <Col N="1307" /> terms, it is quite clear that the Government's intention is to put markedly greater resources at the disposal of this new body.  I am satisfied that all the Senator's proposals are already adequately covered in the Bill as passed by the Dáil. Subsection (1) (a) refers to inequality in all its forms and this is a very broad and ambiguous term to enshrine in legislation. The substance of this paragraph is adequately covered in the present provisions. It is obvious that the agency, if it is to fulfil its statutory obligations, will have to examine all aspects of poverty and social deprivation including the extent, sources and effects of social inequality. In addition, the agency will be empowered to engage directly in research.  Here again it is obvious that the relationship between poverty, social deprivation and inequality will come up for consideration.</P>
    <P>The essence of subsection (1) (b) and (1) (d) is contained in section 4 (1) (a) of the Bill, whereby the agency is empowered to undertake programmes on an experimental basis.  The agency will also be required to evaluate such action. It is not, however, my intention that the agency should become involved in the operation of programmes on a long-term continuous basis.  Once the agency identifies an unmet need, arrangements will be made to have it tackled by the appropriate statutory bodies.  Senators will agree that this would be the logical development. Once that need is clearly identified and long-term action is required, it will be a case of ensuring that that action is taken by the appropriate statutory or voluntary bodies.  I accept the essence of subsection (1) (c) but it is adequately covered in section 4 (1) (a), (b) and (e) of the Bill and this amendment is, therefore, unnecessary.  Subsection (1) (e) is already adequately covered in section 4 (1) (d) of the Bill.  I agree with Senator O'Mahony that the agency should concentrate its attention on communities which are most deprived and most in need of support.  This has been spelled out clearly in the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>However, it is important to bear in mind that pockets of deprivation exist <Col N="1308" /> throughout the country even in the most prosperous and well-developed areas. We all know very well that the study commissioned by the former combat poverty pilot scheme on the elderly and the old alone in Ireland showed quite clearly that loneliness was one of the major problems and that this existed irrespective of the particular community in which the elderly people lived.  In other words, they might live in a community which was not normally regarded as a deprived community, but for them there was deprivation in that sense.  This is the concept we have of community here and it is vital that the agency should not be unnecessarily restricted, that they should be able to offer their support wherever this is needed.  The use of the word &ldquo;particularly&rdquo; in section 4 (1) (d) will, while ensuring that the agency concentrate on the most deprived communities, allow them the flexibility to work in any area with any group which they deem to need assistance.  It will be up to the agency to identify these communities which will not be solely tied to areas.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) (f) is already adequately covered by the provisions of section 4 (1) (b) of the Bill.  My proposals require the agency to promote and co-ordinate the work of statutory bodies and voluntary agencies so as to achieve more effective action in relation to self-help, poverty and social deprivation.  I would point out here that in the proposals in the Bill which has been accepted in the Dáil, it will now be possible for any Minister to direct an agency which is under his control to co-operate with the new agency which are setting up here today.  This is a new and very important development and one which will be very valuable in ensuring that the maximum co-operation takes place.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (a) is already contained in section 4 (1) (e) of the Bill, subsection (2) (b) is already covered by section 4 (1) (a) of the Bill, subsection (2) (c) is covered in section 4 (1) (f) of the Bill; subsection (2) (d) is covered by section 4 (1) (g) which also includes provisions for the agency to engage in research.</P>
    <P>Before engaging in research the agency will be required to obtain the approval of <Col N="1309" /> the Minister.  The purpose of this provision is twofold: first, to ensure that there is no unnecessary duplication of effort between the agency and other research bodies.  Senators will recognise that the intention is that the bulk of the research could be done on a contracted-out basis but in specific instances it may be necessary for the agency itself to engage in research but we would hope these would be limited instances and that the bulk of the work could be done by persons or bodies on a contracted basis, which is the way most of the work of the pilot studies was done originally.  Research undertaken by the Medico-Social Research Board, the Economic and Social Research Institute, the National Economic and Social Council and in certain cases An Foras Forbartha, and An Foras Talúntais may be very relevant to the work of the agency and it is obviously desirable that the agency should not duplicate their efforts.</P>
    <P>The second reason for requiring ministerial approval to engage in research is to ensure that the agency does not become too research-oriented.  I am anxious that the emphasis should be on action rather than research.  The agency's primary and most urgent objective is to take steps to provide community development and to promote it and to initiate action against poverty and social deprivation. This is the primary intention in the Bill and we do not want the agency to become over research-oriented in itself.  There is great scope for action, for making use of the information which is available there and which can be obtained from existing outlets.  I do not intend that the agency should devote a large share of its resources to research to the detriment of other more practical activities.  Research will have its place and I want to ensure that it is kept in proportion.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (e) of the amendment is already contained in section 4 (1) (h) of the Bill.  I do not consider that it is necessary to specify community information centres.  The agency is empowered and obliged to continue the work of the National Social Service Board.  The present section 4 (1) (a) of the Bill <Col N="1310" /> requires the agency to advise the Minister on the development of social services. Section 4 (1) (d) of the Bill is wide enough to enable the agency to continue the work of the Board in relation to support and promotion of voluntary groups and activities, while section 4 (1) (h) has been expressly included to enable the agency to take over the board's functions in relation to community information centres. Subsection (2) (f), (g) and (h) correspond exactly with subsection (1) (i), (j) and (k) of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that the Minister is endeavouring to take the points that are being made to him, but I fail to understand how he will ensure particularly that the agency will concentrate the greater proportion of their funds and efforts in what he has himself identified quite clearly as their major functions in the area for combating poverty. It is not in the functions as listed in the Bill.  There is no provision for principal functions and other functions in the Bill. Will he change the functions by regulation after the Bill goes through the Oireachtas?  What is the mechanism by which he proposes to ensure that the agency do what he clearly is indicating to us that he wants them to do, that is to concentrate the greater part of their efforts and resources on the combating of poverty and in the major objectives he has named?  One of the important aspects of the amendment, and one to which he has not alluded too much is the identification of principal functions and then other functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the Minister's intention is that the principal function should be to combat poverty, but it is not clear from the Bill that that is what the function will be.  Ten functions are listed there and nothing in the Bill in any way suggests that one function is or will be more important than the other.  There is a slight suggestion that if the Minister is going to say on a day-to-day basis which of those functions is more important than the other he will effectively be running the agency.  If the agency are to have a special primary function it ought to be written into the legislation or it ought to be done <Col N="1311" /> by regulation.  It should not be done by indications, pressures and suggestions from the Minister.</P>
    <P>That would not be a satisfactory method of running an important independent agency which, as I said on Second Stage, ought to have a role which could technically be defined as subversive of the established order.  They ought to be challenging accepted views, conceptions, ideas and structures.  They cannot do that if they are to have day-to-day regulation by the Minister of their functions. The only proper way to ensure that the agency do what they are supposed to do, which is to struggle and work to combat poverty in all its manifestations as their principal function, is either to accept the amendment or by the Minister giving a commitment to amend those functions by regulation subsequent to the passing of this Bill through the Oireachtas. Otherwise the agency are left wide open to day-to-day interference by the Minister in office determining how they work and that obviously would not be acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Ryan's view that there appears to be too much possibility for ministerial intervention in the work of the agency.  On the matter of the functions proposed in the Bill and the amendment, the Minister quite rightly indicated, as I myself did, that a number of the functions proposed in the amendment are similar to the functions proposed in the Bill itself.  That is quite true because what I attempted to do was to draw out of the original set of functions those which I thought could be beneficial in any kind of programme designed to help people in either deprived groups or deprived communities.  However, what is very worrying with the original set of functions proposed is that they seem to move away clearly from any kind of commitment to the concept of a national agency which will act nationally on behalf of poor people.  The functions are to promote and co-ordinate programmes in relation to self-help, poverty and social deprivation with the objective of achieving more effective action by <Col N="1312" /> statutory bodies and voluntary agencies. That is something we would all agree with as being a desirable objective.  It is a different objective, however, from an objective set down in the amendment before us which in clauses (a), (b) and, indeed, (c) are very explicit and clear.  Subsection (1) (a) is &ldquo;to examine the extent and sources of inequality in all its forms in Irish society on an on-going basis&rdquo;.  That is a very explicit proposed function which is essential if we are to have any serious long-term attack on the problem of poverty and social deprivation.  It is not contained in the original set of functions in the Bill.</P>
      <P>More importantly, perhaps, subsection (1) (b) in the amendment suggests that the agency should &ldquo;undertake action aimed at combating poverty and to evaluate such action&rdquo;.  That, too, is quite simple and short but it is very important because what it attempts to convey is the idea of a national agency which will act in its own right directly on behalf of poor people against whatever set of structures or institutions are keeping them in the conditions in which they find themselves. In other words, that is a significantly different function in itself from the range of functions proposed in the Bill which are concerned with advising the Minister, with suggesting modifications to policies. In fact (d) is &ldquo;to foster and assist... projects of community involvement and activity, and to facilitate the mobilisation of self-help particularly in communities in which there is a high degree of poverty and social deprivation&rdquo;.  That is good in the sense that it will have merit and value on the ground in selected communities but compared with the recommendations contained in the final report of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty, the difference between the two is that that final report recommended a national institution which would act on behalf of poor people and which would be funded by the State so to do and which would act for them at a national level, clearly, explicitly and in its own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the combat poverty programme was merely pilot schemes.  That is true.  He went on to say <Col N="1313" /> that this agency now derives from the results of those pilot schemes.  That is not the case.  The results of the pilot schemes suggested a different kind of agency which would incorporate some of the functions proposed in the Bill in relation to self-help and community development and so on, but which would also have as a central function that of representing poor people and poor communities, centrally, explicitly and openly and which would be a national institution there to act on their behalf against all other institutions which sought to keep them in their existing situation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I agree with the Minister when he says that a number of the functions proposed in the amendment are already included in the Bill.  That was deliberately done because there are good functions proposed in the Bill but what is missing from the Bill is a commitment to a national agency which would act on behalf of poor people and be their voice in the myriad range of institutions we have at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read with great interest the National Community Development Agency Bill and having done my best to digest it I would like at this juncture to say that it seems to me that it does cover in a very broad way many of the outstanding difficulties and needs there are with regard to the increasing number of deprived people living in our community. However, I would like to say that I share some of the reservations which have been expressed by Senator O'Mahony.  He has clearly indicated that the Bill lacks, perhaps, the cutting edge which is really required if we are to have effective action and effective action requires raising awareness because it seems that it is only by raising public awareness that we can become politically agitated sufficiently to get action rather than words and good ideas.  I wondered just as I read through the Bill if in fact there does not appear to be a little too much of over-centralised control coming through it.  I would ask the Minister how he envisages the local awareness, at local community level; how does he envisage the voluntary bodies, the statutory bodies <Col N="1314" /> and the people who are politically involved plus the consumer at local level coming together to define the local need and how this, in the context of his Bill, is to be translated from local level into the agency so that the agency can effectively respond to what is needed locally?  Different localities will have different needs but I do not want him to conclude that I am suggesting that we should fragment the organisation.  There is need for national organisation but there is need also for some balance.  I would be very worried about the question of the control element rather than the need for increasing the people's awareness of the problem so that they can put the pressure on the agency and in turn further pressure on the Minister through his Ministry to produce results.  I am not sure that that has been adequately dealt with and therefore I would be very much inclined to support Senator O'Mahony's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I also share the concern expressed by Senator O'Mahony and by the other Senators who have spoken. What we are endeavouring to do is get at what has to be fundamental to this agency if it is going to be effective and that is that its powers and authority will have to be defined.  Likewise, I find that within the functions as written into the Bill that definition is not there.  Such definition is absolutely essential in such a Bill because if we are talking about seriously combating poverty we are not just talking about including the word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; in the Bill or even the word &ldquo;deprivation&rdquo;.  What we have to include above all in the Bill is inequality because that is basic to poverty and we have to tackle inequalities if we are serious about removing poverty from our society.  If, as Senator Robb said, and I agree, that it would seem from the reading of the Bill now that the emphasis is on control, particularly centralised control and the total communicating of everything to the Minister and to the Minister's Department, it is really more an advisory agent rather than an active positive agent in its own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk about combating poverty, and hopefully removing it, we really <Col N="1315" /> have to talk basically about giving people a set of, first, their own rights but, secondly a sense of how to go about achieving them and that will come only through an agency having the power and authority to challenge the established structures. There is no way to remove inequality without challenging and changing those structures.  If the whole force and thrust of the Bill is centralised through the Minister who keeps the <i>status quo</i>, how can the agency have any power in their own right?  I would like a clearer definition of the agency's functions and authority, without which they will not be effective.</P>
    <P>The National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty Report shows clearly that what is needed is not centralised advice, or hand-outs, or getting involved with organisations which help and assist people.  What is needed is to give people control over their own lives and choices.  That is really what the removal of poverty is about.  We must not just talk about self-help, but promote it, and when we actually promote self-help we take on a real challenge.  We have to hand back to the people some of the power already vested in the established structures, including this, and, particularly, the other House.  The greatest root of poverty is the lack of control over one's life.  To release that power to a vast number of people one must give them authority, which means that the agency which will bring this about must have the authority to do it in the first place.</P>
    <P>The functions of the agency are bland and not couched in strong enough language. For instance, the agency are to foster and assist, including by financial or material aid, projects of community involvement.  What is meant by that?  We should not be fostering and assisting, but positively helping to establish, in the development sense, community projects with the people, within their own authority.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Mahony's amendment is an attempt to define more clearly and more positively the functions of the agency.  I would be very unhappy if the present wording of the Bill were let stand.  I am <Col N="1316" /> not taking away from the Bill &mdash; I know and admire the commitments therein &mdash; but we are talking about a Bill that is to help to remove not just poverty but the sense of powerlessness from which a million of our people suffer.  We cannot come out with a bland Bill.  That would not be the answer.  We must produce a strong, positive, challenging Bill and be prepared, in bringing out that Bill, to be willing to hand over some of the power we hold and some of the wealth we hold. Only in that way will this agency work.</P>

      <P>There is much confusion about the functions of the agency.  In the Dáil, there was a different situation, particularly on this section.  Everybody seems to have a different idea about what should be included in the Bill.  If we came back next week we would find another hundred different people with different ideas about what should be included in this section.  We have a tradition of semi-State bodies which has served us very well.  We are here setting up a semi-State body and giving them the kinds of functions, support and backing which were given to other semi-State bodies.  This is the first time that such a body has been established, irrespective of all the talk that has gone on for all the years.  Here we are spelling out the functions which will be comprehensive and flexible.  Irish men and women as members of the board will run this agency for the poor.  We specify the functions clearly in all the sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went through the points raised by Senator O'Mahony and I want to go back over them to show whether they are encompassed in the Bill as it stands, without the need for primary and subsidiary functions.  Senator O'Mahony would have the advising of the Minister &mdash; and, obviously, the Government of the day &mdash; as a secondary function.  I would see that as a very central function.  The body will not do all that we want done, as the combat poverty group did not.  The latter group gave an indication of the right direction and it was up to the Government of the day to take up these indicators and act on them.  This body will be central to Government policy.  They will <Col N="1317" /> be in a position to advise publicly.  People have suggested that there is hidden control, but it is spelled out quite clearly in the Bill that the agency will publish their reports.  They can publish at any frequency they like, but they must at least publish annually.  This is regarded as very important.  We are in no way trying to hide poverty or put it aside.</P>
    <P>On the whole question of dealing with poverty, successive Governments have made great strides.  We should recognise that fact.  We are here planning an agency which will be a semi-State body in the full sense.  There are restrictions on staff, of course.  All semi-State bodies have similar restrictions on staff.  There is now no such thing as setting up a body and leaving it to its own devices, although there might have been in the past.  Wide, well learned and hard learned experience has shown that it is necessary to have some control over the numbers of staff to be appointed.  I come to the same Opposition Senators on another question concerning the health services and they tell me to control the staff, that staff numbers are too high in some areas and not sufficient in others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator may reply in a minute.  This is a standard function in all the bodies which are set up now.  Let us be quite clear that there is nothing unusual being suggested here.  We are not trying to encircle this agency.  We are trying to establish it on a sound, practical, effective basis.  I believe that it will be effective.  We in this House cannot dictate how exactly this agency should function. That has never been the purpose of this House in relation to our semi-State bodies. We have given broad functions to those bodies.  We have put people on the boards who were interested and involved in the country and in the development of the areas concerned.  They have had to work out the direction which that will take.  These people are not in single figures. North, south, east and west they are engaged actively in the voluntary <Col N="1318" /> agencies and the statutory agencies.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Mahony puts forward a clause (a) that we should have instead of the existing functions in the Bill.  Clause (a) would be to examine the extent and sources of inequality in all its forms in our society and on an ongoing basis. Clause (j) in the Bill as it stands is not only to examine but also to suggest the measures which are needed to alleviate such poverty as it discovers it.  In this Bill we have been through the legal framework and the parliamentary draftsman. The previous Bill was only a draft Bill. The heads of the Bill had been circulated but had never gone through the parliamentary draftsman.  The Bill had never had that test, which is a very important test when one comes down to being quite clear and specific.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (j) includes the phrase &ldquo;to promote greater public understanding of the nature...&rdquo;  That is a separate function. I refer back to what Senator Robb said.  The function is there to promote greater understanding.  How the agency do that is their own business.  Among our semi-State bodies, for example, An Foras Talúntais publish reports about anything they regard as important to agriculture. They also give reports to the Minister and advise the Minister, but they are totally free to publish their own reports in these areas.  The function as stated, &ldquo;to promote greater understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty and social deprivation and the measures required to alleviate them.&rdquo;  Therefore that is widely embracing.  This is why I said in my reply to this amendment that the functions which Senator O'Mahony would wish to see included in the Bill are included but just in a different way.  I do not want to create primary and secondary functions.  I believe it is up to the board at a given time to decide themselves which ones are more important or less important.  There is no way we can do that here.  That is a functional matter for the board once established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Mahony said also that the combat poverty studies recommended that the body should be one at national level to act for the poor.  There is no way we can set up a body other than a full <Col N="1319" /> statutory one at national level having a comprehensive set of functions, powers and authority in that area.  If the House or the Government feel that there is an area not being covered which is important in relation to the objectives of the Bill &mdash; an area of social deprivation, difficulty or hardship &mdash; the Minister can direct the body to undertake studies in such circumstances and which might otherwise be neglected.  As I see it, the provisions of the Bill will meet that requirement following on the combat poverty pilot schemes.</P>
    <P>I had been involved in re-organising the National Social Service Council to give it more teeth, more strength.  I had completed that before we went out of office around May, 1981.  It was my intention at that time to proceed from there, making that council a statutory body in a form which would be indicated by various other elements.  The Government changed and we were out of office for some time.  We are back in office and what we are now doing is giving teeth, money and power to this area, subsuming the National Social Service Council which has become the National Social Service Board within the overall agency.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb was concerned about the cutting edge.  I am afraid we cannot specifically include the cutting edge in the Bill if the cutting edge is not in the people when they come to implement it.  There is plenty of scope for them within the provisions of the Bill.  Our purpose here is to provide the broad functions, authorities and powers which they can use.  I do not want to divide them into two separate levels of functions.  It really is a matter for the board once established. People will decide very quickly whether the board are doing a good job.  It will be a matter for the Government of the day to decide whether the board are doing a good job or not.  There are plenty of people who will indicate clearly to a Government or any Minister whether they believe the board are doing a good or bad job especially in this area.</P>
    <P>On the question of raising public awareness, one of the functions of the Bill is to increase public awareness and <Col N="1320" /> to promote and co-ordinate programmes. I already mentioned paragraph (j), which reads:</P>
    <P>to promote better public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty and social deprivation and the measures required to alleviate them.</P>
    <P>Then paragraph (h) reads:</P>
    <P>to promote greater awareness, accessibility and co-ordination of social services;</P>
    <P>That is the awareness of which the Senator spoke.  They can interpret that any way they like.  That is just to promote awareness.  It is not merely awareness of co-ordination; it is awareness standing alone.  I can assure the House that our semi-State bodies are particularly good at promoting awareness of the things they believe to be important in their fields. Certainly I would have no fear in that respect.  Indeed, to talk about establishing a body and stepping up funds from £250,000 to £2 million suddenly, because it is now so late in the year discussing it here in the Seanad &mdash; I am not blaming the Seanad for that &mdash; affects us this year. Everybody appears to be so worried about poverty.  The Second Stage was debated in the Dáil on 2 June.  We were delayed in the Dáil with other business and so on.  We have £2 million available in the Estimates for this year.  There is no way that body will be able to sort this out in the short time remaining.  Certainly they will have an opportunity of having a dynamic and strong developmental effect on our society &mdash; the point Senator Barnes made.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb was concerned also about too much centralised control.  Control relates only to the fact that the Minister and the Government will require a report per annum.  That is one control. They will also provide the money.  Therefore certainly at the outset the body is doing very well.  The question of the numbers of people employed is a control which applies now to all our semi-State bodies.  That does not affect the normal day-to-day spending of the moneys which have been allocated already.  It is only if <Col N="1321" /> the body wants to expand its activities into new areas or recruit extra staff that this would require the approval of the Minister.  Indeed on the question of numbers of staff in all bodies throughout the public service there is now the requirement that the Minister would have to get clearance for such additional staff from the Department of Finance.  In any event we do not visualise this as being a body with a large staff.</P>
    <P>We want to keep the body small, dynamic and do spending on a contracted-out basis through local agencies and through engaging people for specific research where this is proved necessary. We have provided the facility within the provisions of the Bill to engage in research where this is seen to be necessary. We would hope that that would not be too often.  Therefore I consider the control is overbearing.  It is different if one sets up a body that does not have statutory powers; then it does not need the same relationship with the Government and with the Dáil.  But here we are setting up a formal statutory body, giving it the responsibility of looking after this whole area for the first time on a statutory basis.  That obviously entails a certain amount of reporting and control.</P>
    <P>How will the local voluntary bodies become involved with the agency?  Here we would hope that the voluntary bodies will be built into the work of the agency through the projects they are undertaking. Of course the agency will be empowered to grant funds to local voluntary bodies for activities which relate to their functions and priorities as they see them at the time.  We have emphasised in the Bill that the areas and communities of high social deprivation must be the first priority.  That is spelled out particularly in the Bill as it stands.  On this basis they will be empowered to give both capital and current expenditure type grants to voluntary bodies.  This is what these voluntary bodies are starved of.  They are doing their work and additional resources are needed to get them under way.</P>
    <P>There will be the question also of having seminars and working together with these bodies.  This is something which the National Social Service Council have <Col N="1322" /> been doing in so far as their power and authority would allow them.  The new body will have a much wider brief and there is much more scope for them in that respect.  We would be concerned particularly that the activities be well related to the people involved on the ground in particular areas in many instances.  There will be some instances where there is no activity on the ground.  They will have to go in and get that activity under way. Once under way we would then like to see them relating back either to the local community or others.  This was one of the problems encountered and discovered earlier in some of the pilot schemes, that in some instances schemes were started but remained separate from the community. Despite a wish to become involved in the community that just did not happen.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Barnes that this is a very important element.  The biggest dynamic is in the community about the local area.  Senator Barnes also spoke about tackling inequality.  She was concerned about the question of the body being so centrally controlled and being there, more or less, to feed the Minister, which is not its purpose.  Certainly, in terms of advice in relation to Government policy, this will be a central agency for advising the Government on policy. The former Government had a proposal to have a section in the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; we considered it earlier on &mdash; which would act as a monitoring and controlling section.  We are now giving the agency the responsibility to advise the Government on their direction on policy matters in relation to combating poverty generally and social deprivation. In that sense I certainly hope this body will feed the Minister of the day with reasoned ideas and arguments which they would have.  In that way this body would have a very important role as they would look at existing schemes and systems, compare them and say where real genuine weaknesses are and suggest how these might be tackled.  That, however, would not be their sole role.  This body's function would be to do their own work as the principal agency to deal with poverty, <Col N="1323" /> self-help and community development.</P>
    <P>Senator Barnes also raised the question of fostering and assisting.  They sound like words that are not too strong, but when one comes to the parliamentary draftsman this is the kind of wording which is comprehensive.  I am concerned about fostering new agencies, setting them up and getting them under way. The dynamic way in which the work is done is then a matter for the board and their staff.  It would not be appropriate for us to put in here &ldquo;to foster dynamically&rdquo; although we may feel like doing that.  We will have to leave it to the body to be dynamic in their day-to-day operations.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Senators in relation to this section that it is not a bland Bill, as Senator Barnes feared, but it has real teeth in the functions which it has and it is up to the body to use those teeth effectively.  They are given the enabling power and authority in this Bill. It is really a question of how they go about doing that job subsequently.  Senators can be assured that the power and the authority are there for them to act as a statutory semi-State body in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to apologise for speaking across the House.  It is not a habit of mine and I apologise to the Minister for that and particularly the Chair. If the functions of the Bill are not set right and if they do not work the whole purpose of the body fails.  This is why there are arguments and concern.  For example, if the agency have no access to the other Departments, for example, Education, and so on and do not have a feed-in to the social and economic plan of the Government, and, indeed, to the Taoiseach's planning officers, there are difficulties there.  This is not only an agency responsible to the Minister for Social Welfare and Health.  It is a debatable fact whether the Minister for Social Welfare and Health is the person to be in charge of this body.  We are concerned that when the functions are set down they are representative of the whole question of dealing with the social and economic problems that go with alleviating <Col N="1324" /> and making less acute the problems of poverty.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that if you did something in one direction you would have many people coming in with other ideas. Of course, you will have people with other ideas.  Is that not what democracy is all about?  Perhaps if the Minister had initiated the Bill in this House he would not have had many problems in the other House.  Particularly, in view of the volume of work that had to be dealt with there, this was an ideal place to start the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister was concerned about the question of delays.  We are not unduly delaying the Bill.  I lived in and with poverty in the late twenties and the thirties. It is still to be found in the same locations. There has been no great haste by any Government party to get to real grips with this problem.</P>
      <P>It is very important that when we talk about the question of how this will function, we do it right, even if it means a little delay.  It is not an intentional delay. The Minister says they have the power and the authority, but they have not the flexibility and the freedom that go with the power and the authority to do the job the way it should be done.  We had the Heritage Bill before this House recently and one wonders if the council in that particular area which looks after statues, museums, pictures and parks were not given a lot more power and flexibility than these functions appear to give to people dealing with human misery.  This is what we have to tease out.  We may be wrong in the final analysis, but we will tease this out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House either but I would like to make a very few brief points to finish my contribution to this amendment.  The Minister raised a matter which he felt was of concern, that is, that I put the various functions in relation to advising the Minister in a secondary position.  In a sense I did, more for tidiness sake than for anything else.  There is another purpose as well for putting them in a secondary position, that is, advice is not the problem. We have gone through that period. <Col N="1325" /> Advice is available at the drop of a hat or at a fee in relation to most matters concerning social policy.  I wanted to try to get the advising functions out of the way down in a separate subsection on their own so that we could begin to see more clearly what the real functions should be.</P>
      <P>The fundamental problem still remains.  When we accept the functions proposed in the amendment in relation to advising the Minister, when we have accepted the functions relating to projects of community self-help and community development and so on, and when all of us agree that these should go ahead and should be funded, none of us, of course, believes that £2 million in a year will do very much for poverty although it is an improvement on anything we have had before.  Let us face it that with £2 million we will not solve the problems of one million poor, but it is still good and it is important that these community development projects should go on. However, at the end of the day it seems that what is important is that these kinds of projects have been going on to a greater or lesser extent over a decade, and in parts of the country, through Muintir na Tíre and other organisations they have been going on for many decades and they will not solve the problems of poverty by themselves.  The problem of poverty is a problem of powerlessness; it is a problem of a failure to have proportionate access to the political decision-making system.  Because people are subject to that inaccessibility to the system they end up poor.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it seems to me to be critically important that we add in this third function, that is, to give the agency the function of representing poor people at national level.  That is what I am proposing in subsection (1) (b): &ldquo;to undertake action aimed at combating poverty...&rdquo; It is clear and simple, and it means the agency have the authority to come to a Minister, or a local authority, or a private industry, or a semi-State body, and say: &ldquo;We represent one million poor.  This is what we want done.  We are their political voice until they have direct access to the political system.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> Therefore, I have no difficulty with the advisory roles proposed in the Bill.  I have no difficulty either with the community development roles proposed in the Bill. In my amendment I tried to put them into slightly different categories, but basically they are the same.  The Bill itself does not contain this fundamental commitment to an agency which will act on behalf of poor people at national level. Unless they have that commitment and function we just have an additional sum of £2 million available for deprived communities, together with AnCO programmes, youth employment programmes, and so on.  I certainly would not suggest that these communities should not be given £2 million, but we must have a central national agency which will speak out on behalf of poor people who are powerless in a system which continues to deny them that power.  This is the only way we can get a breakthrough on behalf of poor people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Harte suggested that if the functions of the agency are not right, this will be a bad Bill.  I certainly agree with him.  I have mentioned the different views which can be held in that context.  I tried to point out that, if 60 or 80 people were asked to draw up a Bill, they would all come up with different words for what they hoped was the same purpose.  Some of them might have different intentions but, even if they had the same intentions, they would come up with different words.  The wording we have here has been through the parliamentary process in the Dáil and the parliamentary draftsman's process and is as good a form of wording as we will get to give the authority and the background against which this agency can develop. Individual words can be taken but then you have to look at how they will balance against the other parts of the Bill and whether they are covered elsewhere. That is the point I was trying to make, rather than saying people are not entitled to their views.  Of course people are entitled to their views.  The only problem is that when drafting a Bill you have got to boil it down into an essence which will <Col N="1327" /> give the authority needed.  We have that here.</P>
      <P>Senator Harte raised two interesting points.  On the one hand he wanted the agency to be involved almost as a Government Department and, on the other hand, he wanted independence for the agency.  We cannot have it both ways. We have to decide what we are to have. We want to have a statutory body as we understand statutory bodies.  We give them their functions and we allow them to get on with the job.  We ask them to report back at certain stages.  They are seen as a body who advise the Government and the Minister on the areas in question.  We want to give them the independence which we believe is necessary. The Minister can direct the other agencies or statutory bodies to co-operate with this agency.  That is enshrined elsewhere in the Bill.  Senator Harte's point is covered in that way.  We were concerned about that.  It is all very well to give an agency the power to co-operate and work with people.  We want to ensure that the agencies under the control of the State, directly or indirectly as semi-State bodies or as agencies attached to particular ministries, will co-operate if the need arises. That is covered in the Bill.  It is an interesting inclusion in the Bill in that it empowers any Minister to direct an agency under his control to co-operate with this body.  It gives a very central policy recognition in that way.</P>
      <P>Senator Harte said he had lived with and seen poverty and thought there was no great haste to get to grips with this whole question.  It is unfair to those who have gone before us to say they did not make efforts to get to grips with problems. There were housing developments in different areas.  Perhaps problems developed subsequently for various administrative or other reasons.  They made great efforts and they established new housing schemes, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from these efforts, which were made generally and are identified fairly globally, there is also the fact that particular groups or communities are not in a position to benefit from these developments. Perhaps the schemes are not having <Col N="1328" /> the impact initially intended, or they may even be wasteful.  I see this agency as being particularly valuable in terms of specifying the communities or groups which need further specific assistance.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Mahony talked about the secondary position and the fact that the advice should be on a secondary basis and said there is plenty of advice around. Generally speaking there is plenty of advice but, when you get to specific advice about specific actions and their implications, specific advice is not quite so freely available.  When you try to make changes in a complex system you often find that they may have undesirable effects.  When the agency are doing research into the schemes already in existence, or into the need for new schemes they will specify very clearly the direction which should be taken, I see that as a very central role.  It is a role which will meet Senator Harte's requirement that they be seen to be a central agency.  Senator O'Mahony requires that they be seen as the agency who represent the poor at national level.  As far as we are concerned that is what this agency will be.</P>
    <P>The point was made that £2 million is not very much.  The question is how it will be used.  It is not intended to increase old age pensions or anything else in that area.  It is intended to act as the dynamic element and influence within the communities and the groups and it can have a very big effect there.  On Second Stage Senator Ryan raised the question of the percentage of the level of payments to those on social welfare benefits.  I was particularly concerned about that.  He quoted a figure of 25 per cent of the average industrial wage or thereabouts being the 1979 position.  I have been working in that area globally since that time, and I have been very concerned about it.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that between 1979 and 1982 the position changed substantially.  The pension of a single old age contributory pensioner as a percentage of the average industrial wage in each case on the previous December was, in 1979, 24.8 per cent, in 1980 28 per cent, in 1981 29.3 per cent <Col N="1329" /> and in 1982 33.4 per cent.  I agree with Senator B. Ryan that that process had to go to a reasonable point.  Senator O'Mahony raised another question.  He asked how far that process should be applied, how it should relate with other things and the various elements in support of it &mdash; fuel schemes, ESB schemes and so on.  This has to be looked at, but at the same time there is the central requirement of moving up the basic income level of the poor, especially those who are genuinely poor, within the social welfare system.  This £2 million will give this body strength to tackle this task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to take up so much time, but the Minister will agree the Committee Stage was rushed through the Dáil and many points were not teased out.  I accept the Minister's goodwill in this but, to some extent, he contradicted himself.  He gave a fairly strong assurance that he would ensure the agency will concentrate their greatest efforts on the alleviation and combating of poverty as defined in subsection (4) and I asked how he proposed to do that.  He said it would be a matter for the agency to determine what would be their major function from time to time.  I do not believe the agency should have a discretion about what their major function is.  The problem is enormous and it cannot be an area which is concentrated on temporarily.  I would still like to know how the Minister proposes to ensure that this agency will concentrate the greater part of their resources on what we all agree they should be doing.  Will it be by amending the functions by regulation subject to the passage of legislation?  Will it be by a fairly close watch on the operations of the agency which are somewhat unacceptable?  Will it be by an unfortunately careful selection of the membership of the agency to make sure they do what the Minister thinks they should be doing?  Whatever good intention the Minister might have in doing that, it would effectively eliminate any real independence if they were such a subservient body that they would do what the Minister wants them to do on specific issues, because the temptation outside of just identifying their functions <Col N="1330" /> could well be enormous if the agency become a little awkward.  I would like the Minister to clarify for me how he proposes to ensure that this agency, in the context of the functions proposed, will concentrate the greater part of their resources on the combating and alleviation of poverty and not on some of the other functions listed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The agency will be a full statutory body.  It will be up to the agency to decide how they will perform these functions which are set out to give them the power and responsibility to do the job we require of them.  The Senator is asking how I can be sure they will do that job and, at the same time he is asking how he can be sure I will not make them do only the job I want them to do.  In effect we are giving them independence and we are providing them with very adequate resources.  It will be up to that body to take the kind of actions which are necessary to meet the functions spelled out here.  We spelled out very clearly that poverty and social deprivation must be a priority and I can direct the body to undertake a particular kind of action or task.  In other words, if I feel there is a special area where some research should be done to find out what is happening, or where some pilot study should be carried out I can direct the body to undertake such a study.  If people feel there is an area that is not being dealt with, the body can be directed to look into it.  If the body do not fulfil the conditions laid down, at the renewal of the membership of the board there will be an opportunity to change the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are between two stools.  We have to trust the board to get on with the job and then judge them as they go along.  I have no doubt that the kind of people involved will be interested in the area. The Senator has a later amendment down which relates to this.  I do not want to have a stranglehold on the board.  If anyone wants to talk to me about poverty, the community, or anything else, I am prepared to talk openly with them.  I was involved in research and development and I understand that if you do not let things come up naturally you will not get <Col N="1331" /> the best solutions.  In politics this can be more embarrassing than it is in research, but nevertheless I appreciate that if we do not do that we will not get the answers. This body are free to do the work and publish their reports.  Many people will be interested in their reports and there will be plenty of attention given to them. There is no question about that.</P>
    <P>What the Government of the day do about them is something we cannot predetermine at this stage.  That will depend on who is the Government of the day.  I <Col N="1332" /> regard it as a very positive development and, as Senator Barnes said in a couple of different ways, this body will need to have that developmental function.  It is something I identified at a very early stage in relation to the National Social Services Council.  They did not have this kind of developmental function.

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 52 and 53, to add the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) All financial or material aid given by the Agency to assist projects of community involvement or activity shall be supplemental to any financial or material aid given by any other statutory body.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing this amendment because of grave concern that has been expressed to me by various voluntary bodies, some officers of statutory agencies and other people that the National Community Development Agency instead of being what it is intended to be, an additional new resource in the struggle against <Col N="1333" /> oppression and poverty, will become a replacement for many of the present resourcing bodies, funding agencies and so on.  I am aware that in at least two health board areas it is being suggested that some of the funding that is currently coming to voluntary groups under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, will be more appropriately sought from the National Community Development Agency.  Of itself, that is bad enough but in times when the budgets of health boards, in particular, are being restricted or fairly carefully monitored, the temptation will be enormous on health boards to pare where they can.  They may try to make a plausible case that the existence of the National Community Development Agency and the fact that there are funds available relieves them of their responsibilities under section 65, and the commitments they have made, unless there is clear ministerial guidance to them to the contrary.  I am greatly worried that they will use the existence of the National Community Development Agency, and the funds available from and through it, to reduce at worst and, at least, to stand still on the funding they are currently making available.  It would be disastrous if that was done.  I hope the Minister can give me a precise figure but I understand that the sum of money involved in section 65 &mdash; grants &mdash; around the country is of the order of about £4 million.  I stand to be corrected on that figure; I do not have access to a correct one.  If this source of funding was to dry up as a consequence of the setting up of the community development agency the final outcome would be a situation far worse than we have at present.  We would have noble intentions about the community development agency.  Whatever our arguments are about the functions there is no question but that they are well intentioned.</P>
    <P>It must be clearly stated, and understood, that this £2 million is an addition to all existing funding.  In this regard I hope that the £2 million is an addition to the present budget of the National Social Service Board and that it does not incorporate the budget of the National Social Service Board.  If it is not clear that all current central funding of major voluntary <Col N="1334" /> bodies is not to be continued, maintained and extended, and if it is not clear that all local funding either through local authorities, health boards, or voluntary bodies is to be maintained, then the fine and noble intentions of this agency will be as nothing and, in fact, it will be seen to be a way of effectively reducing the amount of State commitment and support to voluntary bodies and agencies.  I am sure that is not the Minister's intention. That is why I inserted the amendment to clarify this section and to clarify the position of voluntary bodies and to hope that, perhaps, the Minister will alleviate the widespread concern that is being expressed to me that it might become a replacement for existing funding.</P>
    <P>I know of one major national voluntary organisation &mdash; I am not at liberty to name it &mdash; which formed the impression that officials of the Minister's Department had told them that, instead of their current funding coming from the Department of Health, next year they ought to make a submission to the National Community Development Agency.  That is the impression they have formed and they are greatly concerned about it. Obviously, if this is to be the case, whatever intentions and hopes we have for the National Community Development Agency will be swamped in the fact it will simply become a funding body for existing voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Senator for putting down the amendment since it gives me an opportunity to clarify the position.  I welcome the amendment on that basis, but I do not accept the amendment for a number of reasons which I will explain.  As the Senator has said, the amendment gives an opportunity to clarify the position completely.  I accept that the Senator's motive in tabling this amendment is valid but I must state quite emphatically that it is certainly not intended that any financial or material aid given by the agency to suitable projects or activities would be in replacement or in substitution for funds or other forms of aid already available from existing <Col N="1335" /> statutory sources.  For example, where any body or group may already be in receipt of assistance from a health board under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, it is not intended that such assistance would cease once the agency gives financial or material aid.  Indeed, such forms of assistance from the agency will be in addition to existing sources.  I consider that the wording of this amendment would serve on the other hand to restrict aid to bodies already in receipt of statutory support, and rule out other bodies. It could be seen to restrict the aid from the agency to bodies which have already received aid otherwise.  I know that is not the Senator's intention but there is the danger that it could be taken that way.</P>
      <P>In any event, it will fall to the agency to decide how financial and material aid will be allocated without ministerial sanction but I would expect that the agency would have a dynamic and innovatory approach in dealing with projects and activities which seek its intervention and which are not at present being funded or otherwise assisted through the statutory sources.  Therefore, while I accept the essence of the amendment, I do not consider it necessary or prudent to write such a safeguard into the Bill.</P>
      <P>In relation to the National Social Service Board which Senator Ryan memtioned, the Bill provides that the functions, funds and liabilities of the board are subsumed.  These would be additional to the funding which is to be provided for the new agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan said one group had formed an impression from discussions with officials but certainly it was not on my authorisation and I would very much doubt that.  I am in contact fairly constantly with the principal officials involved and there is no doubt in their minds as to what the position is.  All I can assume is that either it was a wrong impression to form or it was wrongly given in the first instance.  The position is very clear-cut as far as I am concerned. The Senator asked for some sort of ministerial guidance in relation to this.  I will clearly indicate the position to the health <Col N="1336" /> boards and I undertake to do that.  It would also, of course, have the effect that the funds presently allocated, whatever the figure is, £4 million or £4 million plus, would not be substituted.  I accept that also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy about the Minister's assurance in regard to the health boards.  Can he give me a similar assurance that funds at present being made available centrally to voluntary groups will be made available in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The funds to be provided here will be additional.  Whether the funds will be provided centrally will depend from year to year on circumstances in the particular year and the bodies involved.  On occasions I have found it possible to give substantial sums of money to voluntary agencies which would have difficulties peculiar to them in certain years.  I might not have such money available in the following year. We will have to let that situation evolve. In future this body will become a main grants agency for voluntary groups.  It could become a source of funds for voluntary groups, but we will have to see how that fits into the system.  I can assure the Senator that the funds now being distributed will be added to rather than substituted for.  That is the intention of the Government and the Minister &mdash; there is no question about that.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreBolger" hpid="Mrs. Bolger Mrs. Bolger">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bolger</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (c) of the terms of reference states &ldquo;to ascertain and specify communities in which there is a high degree of poverty and social deprivation.&rdquo;  Already we have ascertained at local authority level, through bad housing, lack of sanitation and overcrowding, <Col N="1337" /> and at health board and VEC level, where the communities are.  Therefore, I hope there will not be any waste of time by the agency doing the work all over again.  The information is there and I suggest the Minister might be more specific about this provision.  I should also like the Minister to explain more clearly the provision in paragraph (h) which is to promote greater awareness, accessibility and co-ordination of social services.  That seems to be vague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a little to Senator Bolger's reference to paragraph (h).  Two areas of concern in this matter relate to private groups, whether in relation to social deprivation because of lack of education, or rural deprivation because of lack of information or lack of accessibility to a centre because of distance. This concern arises again and again in consideration of social problems. There is lack of dissemination of information and accessibility, for instance, to family planning.  Even considering the co-ordination of social services that we have, much more remains to be done.</P>
      <P>Even using the present network, we still have not the answer to the needs of people in rural areas or small towns because of the lunacies we have in the Family Planning Act which allow freedom of conscience to local doctors and chemists and deny it to couples concerned. One of the problems that needs to be looked at immediately and challenged includes the restrictions in that Act.  It imposes lack of opportunity for couples living in rural areas who may have to depend on one doctor or one chemist to provide such contraceptives as might be required by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's constituency, and indeed throughout the country, there is a pressing need for the provision of far greater access to free legal aid.  One group that come to mind immediately who are most in need of such a service are those in deprived areas where a great proportion of the people would be eligible for free legal aid but staffing does not allow a full comprehensive service to be provided.  In this House we must refer continuously to the great need for a network <Col N="1338" /> of such services for people in rural areas.  When we talk about deprivation or discrimination, the gravest examples we have today are in rural areas.  I hope earnestly &mdash; I am sure the Minister joins me in it &mdash; that we can remedy the position in regard to family planning and free legal aid.  We say the services have been provided for but in reality they are almost non-existent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMallon" hpid="Mr. Mallon Mr. Mallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to reiterate a point I made last week in relation to paragraph (j) which is to promots greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty and social deprivation and the measures required to alleviate them.  In that paragraph, I suggest, we should have included the effects of poverty and social deprivation. One of the functions of the agency should be to look at and study, and even to anticipate, the effects of poverty.  It is not something that may happen within the next month or 12 months or five years; it is something that is with us now, something which will be with us in reality in the foreseeable future irrespective of efforts made by this agency or by the Government.  The effects of poverty may have salutary results in political terms because one must appreciate that social deprivation leads to social alienation and that in turn leads to political alienation. Therefore one can see the way in which poverty can become a breeding ground for what we spoke about at the beginning of today's sitting, because it is a fact that when there is great poverty and social deprivation there is great alienation from all systems of government.  That in itself can become a very dangerous thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, if we exclude study and consideration of the effects of social deprivation we are excluding any foresight or forward planning in regard to how we can translate what is becoming a national sore, north and south of the Border, into something we can come to grips with. Last week I referred especially to the effects this has in educational terms. From my experience, it seems to me that when we speak of poverty and social deprivation we think of the educational system as being cushioned from the effects <Col N="1339" /> of this.  In my view it is there that we see the stark reality of the effects of it.  One of the great tragedies of this country and of poverty itself is the way in which people, through no fault of their own, are discriminated against because despite the fact that they have the ability to proceed in educational terms they do not have the proper home background, the proper encouragement, the proper social environment and, in many ways, the proper sustenance to do it.  It is in terms of that that I would ask that the words &ldquo;and prevent&rdquo; be included after the words &ldquo;measures required to alleviate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is not enough simply to alleviate that which exists; we must try to prevent what may happen in the future.  The realities of life are that in the present economic situation poverty is going to be with us for some time; the effects are going to be seen and are being seen on the streets throughout our country.  We should not confine ourselves simply to looking at the nature and the causes and the extent of it.  We must be realistic and try to prevent it.  I may have a bee in my bonnet about this but the effects of poverty are very frightening within this country.  We have seen it in Britain as well.  We have seen what happened last summer during the heat of the summer in Toxteth and Brixton. We have seen what happened in the North.  I do not want to be depressing about it but if we do not get to grips with the effects of violence, God knows where it might happen next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to say it at this point but, as this section stands, I do not think it will bring about real changes in the situation of deprived people.  The word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; is used here and there; it seems to have been thrown in as an afterthought among concepts such as self-help, community and social deprivation, whatever they may mean.  There is no mention of justice, humanity and equality.  This gives me cause for concern, particularly when there is no emphasis on structural change or the redistribution of wealth.  Perhaps the Minister could clear the air on this but it does not seem to me that there is <Col N="1340" /> any emphasis on the redistribution of wealth which is fundamental to the question of how this agency will function and it is of paramount importance.  The freedom and flexibility to tackle comprehensively poverty and its causes do not seem to me to be front runners in this section. There is in the section the umbrella concept of community development without a full understanding of what is involved in the development of communities.  The term &ldquo;community development&rdquo; is becoming all things to all men and it is a very much used term.  It is often used to cover a range of contradictory activities. I hope the Minister can clear the air in regard to some of those.</P>
      <P>The other area of concern to me in regard to the functions is again the whole question of the &ldquo;top down&rdquo; approach. Maybe I am reading it wrongly, but it seems that there is greater emphasis given to the functions of the agency than there is to the needs of the deprived. Also, there seems to be a lack of clarity in the whole section.  If some explanation could be given as to what is meant by and what can be achieved in the area of community development, I would be much happier.  There is provision for the co-ordination of services and that is emphasised in section 4.  But the functions seem to have a very narrow range.  I thought that the amendments that were put down went a great deal of the way to broadening the functions.  As they are set out in section 4 they are not sufficiently broad or explicit on the question of dealing with deprived people.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I do not propose to say any more on the Bill this evening. But I must put it on the record that I still have misgivings as to whether the functions as set out in the Bill as it stands will do the job of really dealing with the people having regard to the involvement of the Department of Education and other Government Departments.  It seems to me that there is not going to be any scope for people to feed in to the Government's coming plan.  The functions do not appear to allow for that.  I said it earlier when I was speaking and I would like to have it recorded again now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1341" /> I trust that the Minister may be able to clear the air about these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of these areas are fairly well covered.  Section 4(c), for instance, is in regard to communities which have a high degree of poverty and social deprivation.  Senator Bolger seemed to be concerned that the ascertaining is done to a large extent and I know Senator Bolger is deeply involved in health board activities and obviously the health boards are involved in ascertaining these matters in their own local communities.  But the word &ldquo;communities&rdquo; means more than just a local regionalised group or community; it means groups like, for instance, the elderly in rural areas or the travelling people and so on.  I do not think anyone could argue at this stage that these groups are particularly well catered for in the existing circumstances.  It would also mean various other kinds of groups.</P>
      <P>Even within the health board areas there are services and needs which may not be as effectively met as they might be.  We would all recognise that.  So there is work to be done in that respect.  This is basically to provide the authority to the agency to engage in areas where it is considered it is necessary to do so.  So this is a matter for the agency.  Obviously if there are health boards which are doing all their work 100 per cent right and there are no problems in those areas they will not have any tasks to perform there.  One will probably come up against new forms of poverty in areas like that.</P>
      <P>As far as section 4 (h) is concerned, Senator Bolger spoke about the importance of access and awareness.  I would like to point out that the functions of the NSSB, which are very much related to information and awareness, are subsumed into the body so promoting greater awareness, accessibility and co-ordination of social services will leave everybody quite happy with the fact that this body will be continuing, promoting and developing that work which is going on already under the aegis of the NSSB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Barnes also spoke about some areas of lack of awareness and social deprivation, particularly the lack of services <Col N="1342" /> in rural areas.  This is one of the things which was brought out by one of the combat poverty pilot studies &mdash; the fact of the loneliness of the elderly people in rural areas as distinct from other areas. The information brought out by that study was much more precise and valuable than anything of a generalised nature that was coming forward from the existing arrangements.  I agree with the Senator that the question of the special kind of deprivation which can occur in the countryside is a matter with which the agency should be concerned.</P>
    <P>The questions about the lunacies which the Senator alleges exist in the Family Planning Act are really more a matter for that legislation than for this.  Certainly these matters are also a function of the health boards and perhaps Senator Barnes might have a word with Senator Bolger about the functions of the health boards in this respect.  There is, of course, the question of providing money, apart from the secondary question of the legislation. There are two separate areas here.</P>
    <P>The question of free legal aid is an interesting one because it relates very closely to our area of activity but comes under the Department of Justice. Obviously free legal aid is very important to many of the people with whom we would be dealing in relation to the operation of this Bill.  The need would certainly be stressed through the agency. The Free Legal Aid Board are under the aegis of the Department of Justice but the need for free legal aid would arise from the difficulties and the kinds of deprivation and poverty to be seen in the work the agency would be doing.  I appreciate that there is an area where the two aspects come very close together and the agency would therefore be concerned with it.</P>
    <P>Senator Mallon talked about section 4 (j) and he made a very important point that the question of including the effects of poverty and social deprivation is an integral part of this section.  It is the function of the agency to promote greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty and social deprivation.  We would obviously be concerned <Col N="1343" /> with the effects of poverty and that is covered by the section.  He made a very important point in relation to social and political alienation and the whole question of the background from which the individual is working.  One of the most basic needs is the need for a job.  If you can provide the job you are halfway towards solving the problems. That is quite clearly to be seen in many areas of deprivation.  The problems of the home background and the need for education and community development are inter-related in breaking the cycle of poverty which exists in particular areas or in particular sub-groups and communities. This is a very relevant point and it is one to which the agency will have to give a great deal of attention.  It is partly an answer to Senator Harte's point.  You will not break the poverty cycle unless you get into the areas which affect it and perpetuate it, like the questions of the home background, the development of the community and education facilities in particular areas.  In some communities numbers of children from difficult home backgrounds have been assisted greatly by pre-school periods which have enabled them to avail of educational opportunities and to be on a par with others who could avail more readily of them.  This is why Senator Mallon's point is so relevant.</P>
    <P>The whole question of community development and self-help is important. I know that Senator Harte has difficulty in seeing in practical terms where this fits in.  From my own experience in that area I am quite convinced that the agency's function in supporting community development is central and will be very important in their work.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte says there is more emphasis on community development and self-help than on poverty.  I would accept the point that in certain instances there will be other factors, like a simple lack of money.  Very often even the provision of the money will not change circumstances because of the background and because of the need for support in the community.  This is where the community development aspect is so important. <Col N="1344" /> This aspect is also crucial and will have a very major impact in the long-term on this question of redistribution of power and resources.</P>
    <P>Communities must develop themselves and get the confidence, ability and the capacity to analyse, evaluate and develop their own systems and demand support from the agencies that are there to provide it.  Very often the communities which do not get support are those which do not know where to look for it in the first instance or have not the time to look for it.  Often they have not the persistence to keep ensuring that they get it.  The whole community development concept would relate to that.  One would expect that in the development of communities they would themselves be in a better position to insist on a better distribution of resources.  There are plenty of examples of that.  There is one to which Members of the other House refer quite frequently, in Dublin's inner city.  I will not go into that at the moment.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte also talks about the whole question of the &ldquo;top down&rdquo; approach.  If anything this agency is a &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; approach rather that a &ldquo;top down&rdquo; one.  It will develop within the community the capacity and the ability to express themselves and to insist on their rights within our society.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte is worried about the fact that the agency are very well covered here as distinct from the deprived.  What we are trying to do is to set up an agency which will function in the areas which we define, making clear to the agency the kind of thing which we want them to do. That is why we have to be concerned in the Bill with how the agency will act and what they will see as their priorities and functions.  The whole function of the agency will be to assist, help and promote the deprived and they will have to be seen to be doing that.  In relation to all this area of community development and self-help, I know that Senator Harte is a doubting Thomas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the function of the agency is central.  I accept to a large extent that implicitly, if not explicitly, almost everything that I <Col N="1345" /> would want from an agency is contained in the wording there.  My views on the precise wording are on record.</P>
      <P>I have chosen in this debate to talk about the struggle of the oppressed and about the subversion of the established order of society.  It needs to be said over and over again that any suggestion that all that is needed to eliminate poverty is a little good will from all sides, a little extra money here and there that we forgot about these people for a while but have rediscovered them, is to simplify beyond any legitimate stage the argument and the cause of the oppressed. Since we have agreed on the functions it is important that the people nominated to the agency should be of the right calibre. We can discuss that when we come to the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make specific reference to a number of things.  One is the quality of delivery of the social services.  Unfortunately, through no fault of his own, the Minister could not be here to reply to Second Stage.  I would have been interested in his comments on a few things.  In many cases, the manner of delivery of the social services is effectively an instrument of oppression.  The service is meant to benefit people who are oppressed or poor.  The manner in which it is delivered and what people have to go through to get it effectively degrade and oppress those who are meant to benefit.  Much research is required in that area and it may well bring the agency into conflict with the public service unions.  The evidence in Britain is, at least from David Donaldson's book, <i>The Politics of Poverty</i>&mdash; he was chairman of the Supplementary Benefits Commission &mdash; that any attempt to do a real study of claimants' views on how the service was delivered was vigorously resisted by the public service unions.  As an active trade unionist, I hope the agency will not be prevented from working vigorously and actively in that area because of resistance from any vested interest, even if it is, God between us and all harm, from my own favourite homeland, the trade union movement.  I do not think it should be allowed.  I said this about a number of <Col N="1346" /> areas of trade union activity.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that those of us who are designing, planning, improving and modifying the social services rarely have to use them.  There are not that many of us who have experience of long-term unemployment, for instance, and the inhumanities involved in that.  There are relatively few of us who have to put up with some of the rigmaroles that certain groups have to put up with in getting a medical card. In the area of promoting greater public understanding of the nature, cause and extent of poverty and social deprivation, I hope the agency &mdash; and the Minister should ensure they do &mdash; will become a major force to restore the balance in the one-sided loaded and incredibly intense anti-welfare lobby which is developing in this country.</P>
    <P>It is to my amazement that I receive all this stuff about the anomalies in the social welfare system from one interest group. Nobody apparently seems to be in a position to reply convincingly and actively on behalf of the poor and the oppressed.  Let nobody suggest the contrary to me because I will not believe it. Every time an attack like this is made it is a humiliation to everybody on social welfare.  There are means of dealing with many of the anomalies, injustices and problems.  There are many anomalies in the social welfare system which hammer the poor as distinct from the few anomalies that are now being highlighted, which to some extent benefit the poor.</P>
    <P>In the area of promoting greater public understanding of the causes and extent of poverty and social deprivation and the measures required to alleviate them, there is a great need for a national voice to give the other side of the story. I am very grateful to the Minister for the information he gave us about the improvement in pensions.  That is to the credit of the various Governments which were involved.  It is more than welcome.</P>
    <P>There is no point in going on forever about the small minority of people who, it is suggested, are abusing the services, when the way those criticisms are made and the sort of newspaper headlines that are based on those criticisms degrade and humiliate everybody who is in receipt of <Col N="1347" /> those services.  Do not tell me that any unemployed young person drawing £25 a week if he is lucky &mdash; if he is living at home he will draw a lot less &mdash; will not feel humiliated by that kind of talk.  One wonders where all the jobs are which people are allegedly not filling because of disincentives to work.  I know at least 60,000 young people who would happily take any job paying £100 a week.  There is a great need to restore balance in this debate.  Otherwise, we are liable to have a level of public hostility to welfare which will make it impossible for anybody to introduce improvements or dramatic changes in the quality of our welfare services which are needed if we are to become a genuinely caring community.</P>
    <P>I wish to underline what Senator Mallon said.  This is not just an academic exercise.  With the way our society is developing, the high level of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment and the huge scale of our housing problem, which I fear will get worse before it gets better, unless we provide a public platform on which they can state their needs, irrespective of the relatively painful cost to those of us who are in a position to pay tax, then it will be created by them in a manner which will not be acceptable to us.  It will come through crime, violence or some sort of extremist polictics, not necessarily of the left.  This should be of great concern to us.  If there are riots in the inner city areas of Britain which has a stable society, then a society like ours with our population structure, our levels of unemployment and hostility to welfare recipients, is in for serious social disruption and no amount of security legislation will deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that the people appointed to the agency will see to it that the agency's functions are carried out in a hard-nosed, tough fashion. If we are to avoid serious social upheaval, the poor must be liberated from their silence, their oppression, and the fact that they believe nobody listens and nobody cares.  That ought to be the function of the agency.  There is major controversial work to be done in the area of rebuffing the anti-welfare lobby.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> There are two major areas that need to be looked at.  One can go on for ever. There is the area of social welfare appeals which is degrading and humiliating.  I hope the agency will look at that as well. I should like to feel that this agency will tackle real problems that oppress the poor in a particular way.</P>

      <P>In connection with the functions of the agency, it can only be successful if the Minister has a similar commitment to ensuring that in the first instance it is properly financed and funded.  I contend that the opening estimates of £2 million for setting up this agency will do nothing to ensure that the agency can carry out the functions that this section advocates it should do.</P>
      <P>The Minister must also have a commitment to the statutory bodies which he gives this agency a responsibility to work and identify with.  If the statutory bodies are under a financial constraint, how can the functions be carried out which the Minister wishes?  On Second Reading I pointed out that, having regard to the help the voluntary agencies give us &mdash; at times they put the statutory agencies to shame with the amount of work which they can achieve &mdash; apart from housing and other matters under the Department of the Environment, the Department specifically the responsibility of the Minister have been hamstrung for funds in the area of public health nursing, home help and social workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reply to some of the points made by Senator Ryan.  The first is about the quality of the social services delivered, his keen desire that this quality should be of a high order and that we should always be examining our services to ensure that the quality was upgraded and maintained in this respect. He mentioned that one of the difficulties <Col N="1349" /> which can arise in this respect concerns the unions involved &mdash; public service unions in most instances although there are also other unions involved from outside that area.  I think Senator Ryan appreciates the problems involved in relation to the quality of the services delivered.  I agree with him on the importance of improving the quality and even the places in which the service is delivered. If we look back over the years, very often the place in which the service was delivered was not given the status which some of the newer bodies got.  Some of these were set up as semi-State bodies. They built and developed their own independent status and set up a fine quality of delivery of service as well as developing the places in which this service could be delivered.  The health boards are at present in the process, with funds provided by the Government, of building new health centres which will assist greatly in terms of the physical situation. The employment exchanges are a much wider and more difficult area; and that problem exists there because of the situation which has developed over the years.</P>
      <P>It is one at which I am very concerned. There is a physical side and a personal side, and training is one of the major needs in relation to the personal side.  It is something into which we must put more effort and I am sure that the agency will look very closely at the quality of the delivery of services apart from any other aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other area raised by Senator Ryan was the anti-welfare lobby and the fact that there are no voices raised on the other side.  I have made very clear on television programmes and elsewhere that, as Minister for Social Welfare, I have a positive function, of providing the services which are needed at the right place, time and quality, Health is also a great part of that.  At the same time, I have a duty to ensure that abuses are prevented as far as possible.  I made this clear to the lobby and also to different groups representing the lobby when they made clear to me their views in relation to abuses.  I took great pains to put into proper perspective the reality of the situation. <Col N="1350" /> For instance, among the unemployed there are people who are abusing the system.  It is hard to devise a foolproof system.  We have a substantial investigation unit, we have officers around the country and we are continually re-appraising that position.  We will continue to do so.  We will look at the systems to see where they are allowing for this kind of abuse and we will try to close such loopholes.  We have closed a couple, which has improved matters.  I accept that where abuse exists one has to deal with it.  I agree with Senator Ryan that one of the most substantial abuses is the lack of the opportunity of a job.  That is an abuse of the person and must be the primary consideration for the Government, particularly in our present circumstances. It ill-behoves those who are well-equipped and fitted into jobs to be constantly sniping at those who are not.</P>
    <P>In the last three years 9,000 investigations were carried out by officers of the Department in relation to people who were claimed to be abusing social welfare benefits, such as unemployment benefit. Of those investigations one-third were found to be abuses.  Two out of three of the claims made about abuse were false claims.  There is the situation where a person comes into the employment exchange and admits he had worked for two days in a week.  They can have an arrangement whereby they are paid for the other days.  You will see that person drawing social welfare benefit and working at the same time but unless you are familiar with the exact details you would be misled by what you see.  It is a fact that one in three of the claims made was valid. We must be vigilant about the numbers because this is not doing any good to the service, the system or the cost involved. It is frustrating for those who are working and contributing.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the point made by Senator Ryan that in the global situation there is a need for voices of this kind so that we can get a properly balanced outcome.  As Minister, I am prepared to stand on any platform and discuss the realities of the situation, given the fact that my first duty is to provide services to those who need <Col N="1351" /> them.  I hope the agency will meet the Senator's requirements.</P>

      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to compliment the Minister and the draftsman on the excellence of that part of the section which deals with the functions of the agency.  They are to be found in 11 paragraphs, and one particular word is repeated at least five times.  The emphasis on that word to show its importance gives me great pleasure indeed.  That word is &ldquo;self-help&rdquo;. There you have the key to eliminating and reducing poverty and deprivation. Generally speaking, the poor do not want anything for nothing.  The best thing one can do in such cases is financially to lead the poor to see how they can better their lot.  Various ways were mentioned such as providing employment and so on, but the key word is self-help.  God helps those who help themselves.  That insertion of the word and its repetition are very important in showing that the Minister and his Department are on the right lines.  We wish them every success.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful for the Minister's contribution on the area of welfare abuse and I welcome his stance on it.  However, I am terrified that something he said which was perfectly clear to me might be misunderstood.  I can visualise headlines about one-third of claims being fraudulent.  I understood the Minister to say that of the 9,000 allegations of fraud that were made to his Department in a period of time only one-third or 3,000 were valid and God knows how many thousands of people are receiving social welfare benefits.  I am worried that we will have a newspaper heading tomorrow to the effect that the Minister says one-third of claimants are fiddling the dole.  I think I understood him correctly, that only one-third of allegations of fraud have turned out to be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite correct.  Disability benefit payments are close on 70,000 a week, unemployment benefit payments 150,000 a week and so on.  We are talking about weeks because these <Col N="1352" /> are claims of fraud over a period which might be a week or two weeks or something of that order.  In the whole year you are talking about millions upon millions of payments and of all those individual payments the number which was unearthed by the Department themselves or referred to the Department by employers or other people informing and so on, was a total of 9,000.  Of that number 3,000 were found to be substantiated. So you are talking about 3,000 out of all that vast number.</P>

      <P>I move that that section of the Report of the Committee of Selection which deals with the Joint Committee on Building Land be rejected because there is something very odd indeed behind this.</P>
      <P>I have had a motion on the Order Paper since the second last Seanad dealing with this question and it appears on today's Order Paper under item No. 14:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to take urgent steps in the public interest to control the cost of land required for building.</P>
      <P>I have made the same point repeatedly in my election leaflets.  I have made it in speeches outside this House, and in various discussions we have had on the Constitution here I have referred to the crucial infirmity of the Constitution on the question of private property as one of the reasons alleged for failure to deal with this national scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators may recall that last week when we were asked to approve the motion to set up the joint committee I expressed the hope that a place would be found for an Independent Member precisely because of my interest and that of Senator Brendan Ryan, whose name is coupled with mine in that motion, in this <Col N="1354" /> question.  Senator Ryan and I being very much concerned about this, both expressed an interest to find a place on the joint committee if one was to be given to an Independent and since we each had equal interest we agreed on a simple and old fashioned way of deciding which one of us would go on if we were asked to go on, by tossing a coin, and I won.  That was last Thursday before the Committee of Selection met.  It is my information &mdash; and I cannot swear to it as I am not privy to the affairs of the committee but I hope it will come out in the discussion &mdash; that Fianna Fáil were prepared to accept Senator Brendan Ryan as a member of the joint committee but they were not prepared to accept me.  My further information is that the instruction not to accept me as a member of the Joint Committee on Building Land came from outside and higher than this House.  There is another curious point about this report. Why did it take two meetings of the Committee of Selection to return this list of Members?  Was this partly because, as I have pointed out more than once, the Government party and members of the Government had over the years no clean record on the matter of land speculation and land re-zoning?  The importance of this matter as I see it is that, if there is to be an Independent on the committee, Fianna Fáil are dictating who that Independent should be.  I suggest that the House should find that totally unacceptable, that it is an insult to the House.</P>
    <P>The larger question is whether this alters the credibililty of Fianna Fáil in their intentions to proceed with this joint committee as an alternative to legislation. I must ask the House to oppose the report and I ask Senators to support me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider myself to be under some obligation to clarify a number of matters on this question since I am the single Independent member of the Committee of Selection.  I wish to make a few points fairly clearly and I hope unemotionally.  Senator Murphy's account of how we settled on who would be an Independent representative on this committee is correct.  It was done by full agreement and with the acceptance of all <Col N="1355" /> the Independent Members.  Then, unfortunately, somebody from the Labour Party, in an endeavour which I am sure was based on the best of goodwill, raised the question with Fianna Fáil of making a place available to me on that committee. That was done without my authorisation or without any consultation with me.  I am flattered that both the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil agree that I would be a suitable Member to serve on the committee to investigate the control of the price of building land.  I take that as a compliment to my activities in this House and I would have been happy to serve on the committee.  But the fact is that Senator Murphy and I had agreed on a different line of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second aspect of the matter that bothers me &mdash; and in saying this I am not implying anything &mdash; is that I was under the impression that the Committee of Selection finished their business on this matter last week and I am not too clear how it could resume business today on something that I understood we finished business on last week.  However, I understand there is an explanation for this.  I am simply saying this because I was involved in many of these matters and therefore it would be invidious if it were in any way to be suggested that I acted in any way other than to look after the interests of that group whom I represent on that committee.  Having said that and having thanked both Fianna Fáil and Labour for their flattering agreement to allow me on to the committee, I could not accept the right of Fianna Fáil to say that they would have one Independent representative rather than another on any committee.  Whether it be a committee on building land or the restaurant committee is irrelevant.  If people want to concede a position to Independents it will have to be left to that group to determine which member is on that committee. I therefore quite happily support Senator Murphy in his proposal to refer back that section of the report because I find it unacceptable, flattered though I be by the willingness of Fianna Fáil to accept me on the committee.  Some people have suggested to me that perhaps I am not <Col N="1356" /> standing where I should stand but I have always found it easy on many issues to work with Fianna Fáil in this House.  I work on the issues, whatever may be my views about personalities or otherwise in parties.</P>
    <P>But that is not the fundamental question. The fundamental question is that we as a group of Independent Senators must have the absolute right to choose whom we wish for whichever committee we wish.  Any attempt by any other political group to dictate to us would be unprecedented and would be fundamentally wrong.  I regret the confusion that arose about who was the Independent nominee.  That was not of my doing and the people who were at the Committee of Selection will be aware that from the moment it arose I made clear what the position was.  I endeavoured to contact Senator Murphy to clarify the matter.  I failed to do so and therefore I told the secretary of the committee that Senator Murphy would be the Independent nominee. My name arose because of a mistake made by somebody else, done without my knowledge, without my agreement and without any reference to me.  That is where the confusion arose. But underlying all of this is the fundamental fact that we could not allow any other political group to say which Independent Member would serve on any committee of this House.  Therefore this whole regrettable matter has to be raised and I would have to support Senator Murphy`s proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>As an independent among Independents on this issue I would just like to say that I do not intend to debate the merits of Senators Ryan and Murphy but that it seems to me that there is some very funny carry-on going on here.  The question is: was Senator Ryan acceptable as an Independent or was Senator Ryan acceptable because he was Senator Ryan?  If he was acceptable as an Independent and a place was being reserved for Independents there can be no objection to Senator Murphy at all.  If he was acceptable to Senator Ryan it is quite obvious that the Government are dictating the personalities and that they are <Col N="1357" /> fiddling the committees to suit themselves. I support what the two Independent Senators have said and I would ask the Government to withdraw one of their members and allow Senator Murphy to be a member of the committee.</P>

      <P>As my party have been mentioned in the contribution on this report I wish to set the record straight as far as we are concerned.  I am not privy to the proceedings of this committee.  I just happen to be the leader of the Labour group in the Seanad.  It is our function to sit down and nominate the various people who are entitled according to the precedents of the House to nomination on the various committees. Each party or grouping are entitled to a certain number of representatives and we nominated people on that basis for each one of them.  This committee resulted from a Labour Party Private Members Bill being initiated in the Dáil.  Needless to say my party have had a big input into this legislation.  It was formed in the main by Deputy Ruairí Quinn, who had consultations, I gather, with Senator Ryan and in the course of discussion a wish was expressed either by one or the other or jointly that it would be a committee on which Senator Ryan would like to serve. At that time the group leaders had sat and decided on the membership.  The membership, according to the precedents of the House, would be four from Fianna Fáil, two from Fine Gael and one from Labour.  I am sure that Senator Ryan has an input to make to the committee. In saying that, I am not taking from Senator Murphy but his views were not communicated to me.  As a result of what Deputy Quinn conveyed to me I considered it my duty to consult with the Fianna Fáil Whip, Senator Willie Ryan, and I expressed the view that Senator Ryan could possibly be accommodated if Fianna Fáil were good enough to concede one of their places.  He agreed to go back to the Government Whip to discuss it. That is where the matter finished as far as I was concerned.  Now I learn of the other views that have been expressed by Senator Murphy.  Perhaps Senator Ryan of the Government side of the House <Col N="1358" /> would confirm what I have said as to how the situation arose.  It is regrettable that the House is restricted to numbers as there are obviously so many people here who could make valuable contributions to this possible legislation.  The committee will have a lot of hard work to do to overcome many of the legislative and constitutional problems that will be involved in the framing of any future Bill along these lines.  The Labour Party would like to make a contribution and that is one of the reasons we insisted that we should try to hold our one place on the committee.</P>

      <P>It has been made fairly clear already from the speeches that have been made that the allocation of seats on this committee as on the other committees is in accordance with the formula that has been adopted over many years and in accordance with that formula Fianna Fáil were entitled to four seats on this committee, Fine Gael to two and Labour to one.  The recommendation was made that Senator Brendan Ryan would be a useful member of that committee and it was suggested to Fianna Fáil that they give one of their four seats to him. Having considered the matter, they agreed to do so.  Senator Ryan, for his own good reasons, decided he could not accept that position.  In the circumstances we nominated another member of this group to fill the vacancy.  That is the beginning and the end of the position.  It is regrettable that it should be necessary to discuss at all this report of the committee but in view of the excursion into fantasy land &mdash; the attempt by Senator Murphy to introduce a cloak and dagger element into this &mdash; it is necessary to explain the very simple facts of the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> In page 4, after line 55, to insert the following new subsections:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  At least three members of the Agency shall be drawn from communities or groups where there is a high degree of poverty and social deprivation, and who themselves are dependant for their income on statutory services.</P>
    <P>(3)  At least two members of the Agency shall be drawn from agencies working directly with communities and groups where there is a high degree of poverty and social deprivation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made in the final report of the pilot scheme to combat poverty about an agency capable of operating at national, regional and local levels which would develop and expand the work of that pilot scheme.  That final report listed a large number of suggested responsibilities for the proposed agency.  To be fair to the Minister, almost all of those reponsibilities are either explicitly or implicitly contained in the functions of the agency. In my view the one that is most severely lacking is the development of a national forum which would enable poor people to speak on their own behalf.  I emphasise the phrase &ldquo;speaking on their own behalf.&rdquo;  The functions of the agency are not something that one can read into any of the provisions of the Bill.  I listened to the Minister on this with great interest because I feel very strongly about it.  That is my first reason for proposing the amendment: to ensure that the agency understand well, carefully and in full the feelings, views and perspective of poor people and that at least three members of the agency shall be drawn from communities or groups where there is a high degree of poverty and social deprivation and who themselves are dependent for their incomes on statutory services.  It is paternalism in the extreme to claim to want to help the poor if we are not prepared to ensure that the poor themselves are involved in that activity.</P>
    <P>I said earlier on section 4 that I do not believe any of us who do not have to do so can understand the condition of a person who has to depend on statutory <Col N="1362" /> services for his or her income, one who must depend on the statutory services for the various other benefits and grants.  In particular those who have to live on supplementary welfare are a category who really could talk to us all about the way we humiliate those who are most dependent and vulnerable.</P>
    <P>I proposed my amendment for those two reasons: firstly, because it is an area in which it was recommended by the national committee on pilot schemes to combat poverty that there should be a forum for the poor, and, secondly, to ensure that the real views of the poor are articulated and that it is not my perception, not the Minister's perception or anybody else's perception.  It is quite conceivable that what poor people want will be different from what both the Minister wants and from what I think they want. People's perceptions of their needs, what they want from society and what are their priorities may well be different from ours.  They may run counter to our accepted wisdom; they may run counter to our conception of what are the priorities. It is not our right in any circumstances to dictate to the poor and say: &ldquo;This is the way we will make your lot better.  We know what is good for you. We want to do it and we will look after your interest.  Do not worry, we will keep you.  You come to us with your ideas and we as the National Community Development Agency will decide on your behalf.&rdquo;  I believe the agency will not have the proper delicacy of touch, the proper sensitivity or the proper priority. There is no way they can if poor people are not strongly represented on that agency.  Therefore I propose in the first part of my amendment, that at least three members of the agency shall be from communities or groups where there is a high degree of poverty and social deprivation and who themselves are dependent for their income on statutory services.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I believe, in relation to those groups who are working with poor people and have worked in poor areas or with deprived groups like, for example, homeless people or single parents, at least two members of the agency should be drawn from those groups.  The maximum number <Col N="1363" /> of the agency can be 15, so I am not talking about a majority.  I am talking about five out of 15, which is one-third. That is not an unreasonable number.  In addition the Minister will reserve to himself the right to dismiss any member of the agency if he thinks fit.  The Bill will confer this power on the Minister, so I do not think there is anything to fear fundamentally from these representatives.  It has been suggested to me what would happen if they ceased to be dependent on the statutory social services.  If they cease to be dependent on social services, they cease to be eligible for membership and, therefore, they are replaced.  I do not think that is an impossible task to get the whole collective wisdom of the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental issue of principle here that without guaranteed representatives of the poor on the committees and on the agency, who are by any category from poor areas or from poor groups and are dependent on the social services for their income, the agency will lack an important fundamental perspective on what their work, role and function should be.  For the same reason, bodies and agencies which are involved in working with poverty and social deprivation must also be represented.  It is not an excessive number.  At least ten further members will be nominated by the Minitster as he sees fit.  It is not unusual to specify categories who will be represented. The Youth Employment Agency Bill listed a large number of groups, employers, trade unions, youth organistations, all of whom would be entitled to a specific number of representatives on the agency.  I am not even suggesting an elaborate and complicated election.  I am simply saying when the Government, on the recommendation of the Minister, make their appointments, at least three should be from the groups and the income categories which I have suggested and at least two people from the agencies and the groups who work with the poor and the socially deprived.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Ryan's call for this type of membership <Col N="1364" /> of the agency.  First, I do so on the basis of the case which Senator Ryan has made, that it is essential for the Minister to realise that there are people, as has been mentioned in this amendment, who have a specific commitment.  The Minister should draw on, not alone their expertise in this field, but also their experience on the ground in this particular area.  The Minister must be aware of my resentment of how he uses political reasons for appointing people to various boards, particularly health boards and now this agency.  I have the gravest reservations if in the Minister's words to the media, he takes action along these lines, for political reasons to counterbalance what he considers an imbalance between Fine Gael and Labour as a Coalition and Fianna Fáil on a particular board.  I resent that in the strongest possible terms on the basis that the reasons the Minister gave for it are not reasons at all.  The Minister can check the record of the board where he had a recent political reason to do otherwise.  The functions of this agency will in fact identify areas which could give the Minister the very same reasons for not reappointing people because in the broadest political terms they will identify areas that could be embarrassing to any Minister, not just the present Minister.</P>
      <P>This is a useful amendment.  It will ensure that there will be people who will have the courage from their experience and expertise to highlight particular areas and they will not be clouded by political motivation for or against a particular Minister but will see the problems.  Perhaps the Minister will even concede the principle of Senator Ryan's amendment &mdash; we are still leaving him the right to nominate them &mdash; that if this agency is to function at all in the areas which are being spelled out in section 4, the people appointed must be people who know of the problem on the ground.  This amendment should be conceded by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the proposed amendment, I would like to say that on the last occasion on which I stood not so long ago to support an amendment of Senator Ryan's I was later persuaded <Col N="1365" /> by the Minister to vote on this side of the House.  However, it would take a great deal of persuasion on this matter to persuade me to do likewise.  I feel that Senator Ryan has got to the very kernel of the problem when he endeavours to show how powerless are the people whom we are trying to help in this Bill.  It seems to me, altogether apart from the powerlessness, that the ability to deal with the problems will to a large extent be determined by our very acute awareness of them.  No matter how well intentioned the members of the agency are, unless there is representation from those who are affected by social deprivation of one sort or another, it will be impossible to get across with feeling and genuine concern the real problems that exist.</P>
      <P>There is considerable difficulty here because, if we follow through Senator Ryan's suggestion, the next question I would have to ask is how are we going to select the representatives whom he would like on the agency.  Are we talking about selected or elected people?  If we are talking about elected people we are talking about the restructuring of society.  We might consider a community of the oppressed or a community of those receiving assistance but in some way we need to have &mdash; it has been discussed at length by the community groups in Northern Ireland &mdash; either a convention of community groups or an assembly place, a meeting house where community groups can meet and where these sorts of issues can be discussed and out of that meeting people can be elected to go on to semi-State or other statutory bodies.</P>
      <P>There is a problem when we discuss how we will select the three people.  Will they be the Minister's captives?  Will they be the people's representatives?  In the final analysis, the question really comes back down to what balance will be struck between having a society in which power is given by the authority of the people or in which those who have taken that power at the ballot box see it as a sort of inherent right to exercise their power over the people.  There is a balance to be struck. I do not think one should go for one total extreme or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Self-help was mentioned earlier by <Col N="1366" /> Senator Cranitch.  The point he was emphasising is that we would love to see in Ireland a self-help rather than a hand-out society.  In order to get to the point of self-help you must create social space for the people about whom we are talking.  You must create a society whose participation is not only welcome but in which the machinery exists positively to encourage it.  We must also consider how we will give, in the context of poverty and increasing unemployment, a much greater share in the whole area of natural resources and natural power.  A right of equal access to the available employment will become increasingly important.</P>
    <P>I support this amendment and even the Minister's debating power would be hard pressed to get me to do otherwise.  How does the Minister see the representation working?  Will it be selected?  How will the process of selection take place?  Is there some way in which we could restructure affairs for under-privileged people so that they would feel they had the right to elect their own representatives on to this agency?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to introduce a new dimension.  I am in full agreement with what the two previous speakers are trying to achieve and which women representing half the community have not yet achieved.  It gives me great pleasure to be in a forum where at least some voices can be raised, hopefully before it is too late.  The experience of women is essential to this agency.  Never was it more essential on an agency or any board.  We know from all the research throughout the world that the very real victims, the most vulnerable, numerous and powerless victims of all in our poverty trap, are women and their children. This is seen at every level, for instance, at the level of single parents.  All the statistics show that the highest proportion of single parent families are headed by women with poor pay conditions, or no pay conditions and living on social welfare. They and their children represent the greatest mass in the poverty trap we all know exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not asking for any tokenism.  The <Col N="1367" /> experience of women should be used.  In voluntary organisations such as bodies set up for the alleviation of poverty, and in the caring community, the most active members are women.  I am sure members of the House will agree that, when it comes to appointments to our State boards and bodies, women are lamentably absent, or there is a token woman and we are told to be satisfied with that. I am totally in agreement with this for the reasons I have given, and they are valid statistical reasons.  I would not be asking for five out of 15.  Fifty per cent of the appointees should be women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in general agreement with the previous speaker with regard to the dimension of women on boards.  In the last Seanad and in many fora around the country I have given vent to this particular aspiration.  There is no doubt that, in hard practical terms &mdash; and this agency basically are a caring agency for the community &mdash; women in all aspects of life have a practical realisation of what it is to care for disadvantaged people.</P>
      <P>I should like to return to a point which I made on the Second Stage of the Bill. The Minister was in the House at the time.  When he is appointing the members of this agency &mdash; and here I can embrace Senator Barnes' point &mdash; he should consider women who have experience in the areas of both housing and education.  I do not mean a bureaucratic person.  I mean a person who has experience on the ground of the extent to which deprivation in housing has an effect on people's lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this area women realise and can express the full extent of this deprivation. I have long held that of all the feminist issues which have been broached and shouted about, housing is the main issue on which women could have and should have a big input.  Women spend a great deal of time in the home.  Women bear the children, rear them and feed them. They have to put too many people into too small rooms.  They have to put up with inadequate housing, overcrowded housing.  Sometimes their children have to go to school in the morning with not enough food in their stomachs to last <Col N="1368" /> them through the day.  They are the same children who are supposed to have equality of access to education.  They have not, if they come from deprived houses or deprived areas.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is appointing the members of the agency he should appoint people with real living experience of the deprivation of housing and the deprivation of education, and how they can affect members of our society.  I spoke here at some length a week or two ago about the Rutland Street experiment and said I was anxious to see the outcome of this experiment. It is a pre-school activity.  Parents, and particularly mothers, went with their young children to a pre-school and shared with them the traumas, the tribulations and the joys of such schooling and particularly as it affected deprived areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Ryan's point on the appointment of persons from voluntary groups dealing with deprived areas and deprived people, the points I have made embrace that.  The appointment of persons from socially deprived areas would be very difficult to implement. I could not actively support that proposal.  In principle and in theory it sounds right and would be right, but not in practice.  The points I have made with regard to education and environment embrace those two areas as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators for their contributions on amendment No. 4.  It is not my intention in the Bill to provide for representation for any particular groups or bodies.  It is important that the Minister should be free to call on the people he considers best able to contribute to the work of the agency. However, on the amendment, I can assure Senator Ryan that when I am appointing the members of the agency I will draw on representatives of the client groups, the principal element he is concerned about.  Similarly I will draw on the relevant agencies working directly with these under-privileged groups when I am making these appointments.  This has always been my intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robb asked if this amendment were accepted what basis would one use <Col N="1369" /> for it.  The basis proposed is that the Minister will select the people.  There is no other arrangement.  It just says that at least three members should be drawn from the communities or groups where there is a high degree of poverty and social deprivation and who themselves are dependent for their income on statutory services.  I said in my reply to Senator Ryan that I will certainly do this. I will draw on representatives of what are called client groups.  There are difficulties because, as Senator Ryan said, you may have a case where someone is unemployed, what about those who are on next week or the week after.  If you look for someone who has been unemployed for a very long time, you are picking a very selected group within the unemployed group, so where do you select them?  If you take someone who is unemployed, what about those tho are on long-term invalidity pension or disability? What understanding will they have of old age pensioners' problems?  There are short-term and long-term benefits.  Senator Ryan recognises the difficulty there.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb met this point by saying that there is a need for an infrastructure which leads to this if you are going to have that kind of arrangement and some means of having a convention of community groups.  The National Social Service Board tried to bring this agency up to this level.  I have been attempting to get the National Social Service Board and the Federation of Voluntary Groups to work together as closely as possible.  I explained that the National Social Services Board are going through a process of development.  The first step was to go from the National Social Service Council, which had a very loose and a more limited brief, to the National Social Service Board, which had a tighter board, and members were selected from different areas of activity to serve on that board.  In May and June 1981 we set up the National Social Service Board.  We are now talking about subsuming that board.  That has implications of course. Senator B. Ryan is also concerned about membership of the National Social <Col N="1370" /> Service Board.  That question must be considered too.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a convention of community groups and this is the kind of thing we would like to see.  I have been keen to bring the community aspect into this Bill so that the activities, energy and capacity of these groups would be brought into the national scene.  I hope the agency will promote that goal and that the community groups will want to be involved in the agency.</P>
    <P>I can see the desirability of the general development and infrastructural development which Senator Robb referred to and I will do anything I can to encourage that development but that infrastructure must be developed if we are to nominate people to this board.  This is something which can be looked at further along the line.  At this stage the best arrangement would be to ensure that some members are appointed from these areas and I will undertake to draw on representatives from the client groups in appointing members of the agency.</P>
    <P>We have had different representations made both in the Dáil and the Seanad about who should represent whom in the agency.  We had a council with 22 or 23 members.  One of the first things I did was to reduce this to ten.  Now someone tells me its membership has been increased to 12, because we brought in two staff members.  The staff wanted to be involved.  They, as well as Senator Ryan, are very supportive of the trade unions and that is why the membership was increased from ten to 12.  We have so many groups we cannot fit them all in. Senator Barnes laid particular stress on the number of women who should be involved and this is one of the criteria.  If the Senator wishes, I will show her a list of the boards with which I have been involved and she will see the number of women who have been appointed to those boards.  We take great pains to find women who are actively involved but there are difficulties sometimes, for example when you set up a board like Comhairle na nOspidéal &mdash; not many consultants are women.  I am sure Senators can appreciate that.</P>
    <Col N="1371" />
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may interrupt, when talking about choosing from poverty groups the Minister will have no problem finding women who are interested in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but the staff want to be involved on the board. The client groups and the representatives of the clients, the voluntary organisations, the regions, the deprived communities, various kinds of communities such as the aged and the professionals, will want to be involved on the board, as will people with experience in housing, education and other relevant areas.  For instance, the members of the National Social Service Board, as they stand at the moment, wish to be represented.  We are talking about a very limited number of people because we are not going for a big broadly representative board we are trying to get a fairly dynamic board which will make things happen and which will obviously have some management experience.  No matter how much well-wishing and good will is built into a board if there is no management ability there is a fair likelihood the board will not achieve their objectives.  Therefore all these groups have to be represented.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the National Social Service Board earlier but I was talking about the National Rehabilitation Board. I reduced the membership on that board from 22 to 12.  In this case we are going for a smaller board to ensure that they will be effective in management terms. There will be a great deal of scope for that board to get involved in committees, sub-committees and in a variety of other ways.</P>
      <P>I will give Senator B. Ryan an undertaking to draw on representatives of client groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to confess I am not satisfied.  The representatives of client groups would not necessarily be people who are dependent on statutory social services.  I know it would be difficult for the Minister to name groups, but I am not sure what the term &ldquo;client groups&rdquo; means in any specific detail, and I would be grateful if the Minister can <Col N="1372" /> make it clearer.  Secondly, I believe it is important that the representation I am talking about should be a substantial proportion of the membership of the agency &mdash; it should not be just a token one person. The Minister is facing a dilemma and I wish I was facing that sort of dilemma because I would be able to do something about it.  Unfortunately, I am only a back bench member of the Seanad and I have to leave it to the Minister to resolve his dilemma.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to specify in greater detail what he means by &ldquo;representatives of client groups&rdquo;, and I would like some indication of the numbers involved, because I am not interested in one token person.  There has to be a substantial number of people to represent a substantial, coherent, vigorous voice in the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Minister's response that he accepts in principle the spirit behind this amendment and that if the section remains as it is he will do as far as possible what this amendment asks?  I gathered from his response that that was his commitment to the groups mentioned by Senator B. Ryan and that women would be represented in this agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Barnes said, there is no problem getting women involved in an area like this although in some areas there may be a difficulty, and later I will show Senator Barnes some of the committees I have established and the number of women involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yes, I accept the principle.  There is no question in relation to this area of clients. Senator Ryan has not clearly defined the clients he is talking about.  We could pick somebody from the register of unemployed, but, as I said, there are many difficulties there.  Perhaps what is needed first is more structural development.  Tenants' associations, the representatives of the travelling people and various groups like that would be &ldquo;client groups&rdquo;.  I know Senator Ryan is involved with the Simon Community and these are the sort of people we would think normally of having involved, but there are those who <Col N="1373" /> frown on that because they say these are brokers rather than ultimate clients. There is a difficulty when we get to that level and when we are talking about the national scene.  We need to have both on the rural and the urban level, an infrastructure from which one can draw appropriate representation otherwise one can only in principle agree to take representatives from these client groups. I am quite happy to take representatives who can be seen fairly to represent the groups.  If they can find people who reasonably represent the groups we have in mind I will accept that.  In principle I accept what Senator Ryan has said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the Simon Community.  I want to make it clear that I have been involved with the Simon Community for ten years but I still do not understand what it is like to be homeless.  Nobody from the Simon Community can represent the homeless properly; the homeless must do that themselves. If the Minister means by a representative of a client group somebody who is in intimate contact with the client group, I do not see that it would be such a terrible thing to have in the agency somebody who was active in one of the unemployment action groups around the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister has considerable powers in this Bill to pick people.  I envy him his dilemma.  I wish I was in the position to have that kind of dilemma.  I do not accept that somebody who is involved even in face-to-face work in a group like the Simon Community really knows what it is like to be homeless.  I do not think somebody who is assisting an unemployed action group who is employed himself really knows what it is like to be the client of the Department of Social Welfare in a labour exchange.  I have to keep saying this over and over again.  The people who have to deal on a day-to-day basis with the services should be the representatives, not any agency, however well-intentioned or close to them, who speaks on their behalf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMallon" hpid="Mr. Mallon Mr. Mallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in some difficulty about this amendment.  In many <Col N="1374" /> ways it crystallises the problem we are dealing with in relation to this Bill.  In the last analysis if the problem of social deprivation and poverty is to be grappled with, it is going to be grappled with by way of administrative decisions.  That is the root political fact.  In the debate on the various sections we come up against the problem of the extent of the will and the determination to make the administrative decisions to grapple with the problem and also to what extent we have to make an act of faith in the future.</P>
      <P>As I see it, the whole Bill falls if the Minister has not got that will and the courage to go through with it.  Irrespective of the number of amendments and the changes which may be made, in the last analysis it depends on that administrative commitment to deliver, not just in terms of the Bill itself but in terms of the political decisions which are required to get to grips with the whole problem of social deprivation.  There are many things I would like to see included but at the end of the day someone in a ministerial chair has to make the ministerial decisions which will provide the resources to eliminate poverty and help to prevent it in the future.  It is in the light of that view &mdash; I was going to call it the doctor's dilemma, but it is the dilemma the doctor has given us &mdash; that I look at this amendment.</P>
      <P>I have tremendous sympathy with the amendment and I could go along with it. I also recognise that the Minister has given an assurance on the matter.  If we did not get that assurance and if it is not put into effect, then the whole structure of this Bill will crumble.  In the last analysis, we get back to that root central point.  I welcome the Minister's assurance that he will try to include the people referred to by Senator Ryan.  I have a problem with this because if this type of amendment were to be added to the Bill I could think of other types of amendments where one could make an equally valid case for their inclusion but that is not to say that there is any invalidity in the amendment.</P>

    <P>While we must make an act of faith in the will of the Government and the Minister concerned to deal with the problems <Col N="1375" /> of social deprivation, we have no control over the decisions that are going to be taken in the future and I have found the debate very, very difficult from that point of view.  However, I have no hesitation in stating that I believe the Minister has got that will and courage to deal with the problem.  In the light of that, I am satisfied with his assurance that he will make provision for not only the points made by Senator Ryan but also the points made by Senators Barnes and O'Rourke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest the House should think that Senator Mallon and I are in cahoots, I have to express some variance with the view he has just elaborated.  There is a doctor's dilemma.  I had the experience of parents in desperation coming to my home four years ago whose boy, one of the most intelligent youngsters in Northern Ireland at GCE level and first year at University, had taken up drugs. For about five years he was in and out of intensive care units, was found in England, was picked up by the police and eventually made the great move forward of three months in an institution where he was without drugs.  He came back into the community and his parents did not know what to do with him.  As a doctor I knew nothing about the drug problem.  The only way I could deal with that problem was to learn about it and the only way I could learn about it was to take that boy into our home and learn about it.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I feel that we cannot rely on acts of faith.  I would be the first to accept the good faith of the Minister in this respect, particularly having heard him today with great patience and articulation elaborating on his plans for the future.  I have no doubt about his good faith in this matter but if we rely on acts of faith and if we do not do sufficient to bring about better understanding, then we will still be debating this problem five or ten years from now, again with good faith.  There are plenty of people in Ireland who have good faith and who have abiding good intentions but all of us lack great understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned one case in point and <Col N="1376" /> the tragedy is that that man is no longer with us.  There was no way in which he was going to be helped by our profession and the greatest criticism and the greatest frustration he had was with the medical profession.  When he faced them, the so-called experts, they shied away from the problem because they did not know how to cope with it.  In spite of their good intentions and their high motivation they were lacking in understanding and feeling. It is only by involving the people concerned that we can actually go forward in a constructive climate with a new debate and mobilise the goodwill which we have heard today from both sides of this House, and by engaging the people with the problem so that we can better understand it.</P>

      <P>I have not got any information from the Minister on numbers. Are we going to have one representative of client groups and one representative of agencies?  That would not be satisfactory. If the Minister can tell me he envisages there being more than one in each case I would be feeling reasonably well disposed, but one in each case I would regard as &ldquo;tokenism&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested in what Senators Robb and Mallon had to say.  They were very relevant contributions to the debate.  Senator Mallon pointed out the need for commitment on the part of the Minister and the board.  If we do not have a board who will have that commitment we will not get anywhere. As stated by Senator Mallon, a valid case could be made for various groups in the same respect.  One point struck me about Senator Robb's view. Senator Robb took the boy into his home to try to meet this situation.  In the example he gave he was open to the problem which existed.  He did not suggest that the boy in question should go on the board but he suggested that there should be somebody there in the medical profession who is open to this problem.  There are such people here.  In relation to travellers, I could introduce the Senator to a man who is doing a job that nobody talks <Col N="1377" /> about and he does not want anybody to talk about it because as soon as they would start talking about it they would kill the work being done.  I could do the same in other areas.  They are not the people of the media; they are like those in the example given by the Senator.  I agree that that is the concept we want but the problem is which way do we get at it.</P>
      <P>Senator Robb spoke about the way the agency should work and the kind of people who should be on the agency.  In relation to the representatives of the client groups and the clients, this is not well worked out as yet.  Naturally, I have a great respect for the Simon Community and the people who work with that organisation. I know that Senator Ryan, who works with the Simon Community, has the practical management ability to understand much of what goes on within that area.  If we had somebody like the Senator on the agency &mdash; we have precluded him in the Bill and we did not do that for any nasty reason &mdash; he would be open to the lines of communication which should be established, the type of committees that should be established with the agency.  That could be an initial development in that area.  It is a problem for me because if these organisations who are doing so much work are not represented &mdash; and represented very broadly &mdash; there is a lack in the understanding and sensitivity of the body.  I would be thinking of having more than one representative of both these groups. Obviously, we also would have a good number of women involved on the board and I accept that.  It should be possible to get people with that background.  Most of the homeless people who go to the Simon Community may be men but that will not meet Senator Barnes' point of view because most of those she was referring to are unmarried mothers, single women, deserted wives and other categories. No matter which way I go I will have problems in constructing a board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The function of the board, ultimately, will depend on the management ability of the people running that board.  Members commented today about our deficiency in the past and said we have not <Col N="1378" /> succeeded the way we should have.  We should ask ourselves why we have not succeeded.  We have not built into those bodies the kind of management that exists in industry or the IDA.  That is the reason I got Michael Killeen to go on to the Council for the Aged.  Straight away everybody involved said: &ldquo;That is wonderful, they are organised, they know the way they are going, they are involved, there is participation.&rdquo;  Those matters are all connected with management.  People like that are needed if we are to get anywhere.  If we want to look back in the future at this agency and say that it was effective, it tackled the problems, it presented reports to the Government that made the case clearly and unequivocally, then we must have people who are not just involved but who also have management ability and are able to stand up nationally in management.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan raised the question of the very strong lobbies.  That was a good point because in those areas where there is the management input and experience, very sophisticated lobbies who deliver their message.  I do not blame them for doing it; it is their job.  What has been lacking in organisations like this before is the input of similar management-type people who are able to put the message in the way it will have impact and make its impression.  They should be able to develop an organisation and control staff in such a way that they will give of their best to the organisation.  The Senator should leave it to me to do my best with this.</P>

      <P>Subsection (5) carries the usual terminology for the setting up of such a board.  It is usually acceptable that members do not receive any remuneration for acting as members of an agency. However, because of the special situation of some people who would be members of the board hopefully after the long discussion we had with the Minister regarding the personnel we should be careful about accepting the usual terminology.  It might restrict later the payment of some kind of an allowance or remuneration to allow very disadvantaged people to avail of membership of the board.  We are talking about disadvantaged people who do not have any money.  This should be looked at to give some flexibility in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section to which reference was made during the debate on section 4 when I tried to deal with the possibility of the agency properly being able to perform their functions.  As Senator Mallon had said, I said that there must be a real commitment on the part of the Minister to match the demands that will be made in the normal course by the agency for the type of money given to statutory bodies with whom the agency will have close working liaison and consultations when areas of social deprivation will have been identified.  Our experience in relation to such bodies has been that there has not been sufficient commitment by the Minister to ensure that statutory bodies like health boards will be able to help the community.  This is not a political statement, Minister, because I made the very same statement to your predecessor who was on my side of the House, and to yourself when you previously filled this office.  We pointed out to you that unless the community welfare nursing service of the health boards were given financial commitment and guarantees in respect of staffing asked for we could not deliver the kind of care to underprivileged people that the agency will be bound to identify, and therefore we will have a tremendous dilemma among the statutory bodies because your budget has been totally inadequate.  I am saying that in all fairness to you&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be as specific as I can in relation to the Minister, who is a person, a person at present responsible for the administration of public funds on behalf of the Government through a health board on which I am a person and a member.  I am trying to make the point that the functions of this agency will be funded through the provisions of section 7 and I am reminding the Minister, through the Chair, that he as a Minister has a responsibility the nature of which we have pointed out to him in the past.  We have identified areas in which there is a lack of capital and of commitment to provide capital and staff &mdash; areas which will be isolated by the agency.  Therefore, a commitment by the Minister will be of vital importance to the agency which the Minister, as a person, is trying to legislate for here today.</P>
      <P>I have emphasised the areas of public health nursing, home help and social services, and the discrepancies in my area in these services in which there have been vacancies on staffs.  If we are to fulfill our commitment to people in need, a need which has been identified by voluntary groups and by the poverty agency established not long ago, we should have provision in section 7.  Otherwise, the existence of the agency will be nonsensical because continuing to identify pockets of need without doing something specifically about them makes this just a whitewashing effort.</P>
      <P>A practical commitment to needy communities will first of all keep people out of hospitals, welfare homes, day centres, psychiatric and other State institutions. That can be done only if a proper community service is made available, properly funded and staffed.  That would lessen the tremendous demands we make on the Minister in his capacity as disburser of moneys for the health services.  The greatest demands are being made in respect of hospitalisation, particularly for specialised hospital treatment.  The demands for institutional treatment are so great that we must look to some other source which would help to keep that demand down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only through the community welfare services that this can be done.  The <Col N="1382" /> sum of £2 million provided for this agency will not do that.  The Minister must also guarantee finances for other bodies when the problem has been identified.  I have been a member of a health board for ten years and I have yet to see such a commitment. I agree there have been tremendous improvements.  Demand has increased from £8 million to £80 million in a few years, mostly created by the institutional needs of health care.  Many people can survive in the community with a good deal of self-help if we have a reversal of the trend by doctors to dispatch them to hospitals simply because there are not enough public health nurses to look after them.  Families and homes have been subjected to a lot of stress because of this and I ask the Minister for this special commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the resources available, I am committed to providing as much as can be provided for this agency. I am sorry Senator Ferris was not here earlier when I discussed this matter with Senator B. Ryan.  Senator Ryan spoke of the global situation, the need to keep things outside this agency.  Senators Bolger and Barnes referred to this as well. In recent years there has been a genuine effort to increase the level of payments to social welfare beneficiaries.  I gave the figures to Senator Ryan, taking a single old age contributory pensioner's benefit as a percentage of average industrial wages.  It was 24.8 per cent in 1979, 28 per cent in 1980, then 29.3 per cent and later 33 per cent.  I agree it is important to think of that side, but from the point of view of the health services I have given figures to show a clear policy to develop community based services.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris is correct that this part of community care is particularly important, that properly developed it would take the strain from particularly expensive institutional services.  However, I hope the Senator is not misunderstanding the position.  The provision of £2 million to the agency at the outset represents a substantial effort when one considers other efforts being made.  This is an increase on the sum provided for recently in the Estimate, which was only £250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> The overall health board side was cut back very severely, by £48 million, at the beginning of this year in the Estimate and in terms of jobs that meant that 2,500 staff were going out of the service in the health boards and hospitals.  When I became Minister I managed to get £28 million back to offset the worst effects of this.  It is a matter of record now that the very areas that I emphasised to the health boards specifically must be maintained and developed were the communitybased services, notwithstanding our other difficulties particularly, as the Senator mentioned, the question of the home helps and other care of that nature.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that the increase in the last three or four years in staff in the health services has been 7,700 and a proportion of that was in the community-based services.  I appreciate that the area that was most ready to absorb those increases was, of course, the hospital area.  I know the number of public health nurses has increased to a target but with further development of communities that is inadequate and there is a need to increase it further.  I would like to assure the Senator of my commitment in that respect within the resources which I can manage to avail of.</P>

      <P>While I understand and accept that in the creation of any agency in a Department the Minister would wish to have some control over the numbers in terms of persons employed by that agency and that therefore putting <Col N="1384" /> in a restriction of some sort is normal enough, I worry about it a little in this instance because I am aware of past experience where proposals to hire staff in the general area of anti-poverty programmes that the agency concerned ran into difficulties because the Minister at the time did not agree with the programme that the agency at that time wished to carry out.  Therefore, because there was such a restriction he was able to prevent a programme of this kind going ahead and to prevent the hiring of staff.  I would be interested if the Minister would elaborate on how he sees those words in brackets applying in practice. Ideally the agency should have a lot of freedom to design its own programmes. It has got that but it should also have freedom to hire staff appropriate to those programmes.  If the agency is prevented from hiring particular kinds of staff it can effectively lead to the non-implementation of programmes.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's interpretation of this and how he would envisage it being administered by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the provision in the Bill is the standard for all the bodies.  As Senator O'Mahony knows, this is something which is insisted on by the Department of Finance in any event.  So, I cannot accept the amendment which removes completely any control by the Minister of the number and types of staff the agency should employ.  Perhaps Senator O'Mahony's fears will be eased by the fact that the staff of the NSSB will be absorbed into the body, so they will be there for a start.  Second, I would visualise that the staff required essentially would be taken on early on and that they would be there from that time on.  In other words there would be a basic staff and the bulk of the work would be contracted out subsequently and the agency would have their own facilities to contract for research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I outlined during the Second Stage debate in the Dáil that it is my intention that the staff in the agency should be kept to an absolute minimum and that it should avail of the expertise that is available <Col N="1385" /> throughout the country when necessary rather than set up a superstructure which would be removed from the problems on the ground &mdash; and we are getting back to the debate we had here earlier in relation to involvement of people outside.</P>
    <P>The practical application of it would, in effect, be that it would be the same as all other bodies in similar situations where this measure applies.  But in practical terms the bulk of the staff would be taken on in the early stages building up a team within the organisation.  By and large the numbers of staff required after that would be relatively small and I would see no difficulty in getting sanction for small additional numbers.</P>

      <P>To delete subsection (2), page 9, lines 4 to 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first part of section 17 is fine.  It provides that a person shall not, without the consent of the agency, disclose any information obtained by him while performing duties as a member.  But it is a classic sledgehammer-to-crack-a-nut situation to have a penalty not exceeding £500.  I have been advised by people who have done a study that this section is almost unprecedented in bodies of this nature and in State agencies generally, and that the only comparison that could be made is with the National Board for Science and Technology, and even there the secrecy regulations are a good deal more constrained and more circumspect than that.  That is why I proposed the amendment.  Quite obviously an agency should be able to determine discipline among those whom it employs.  That is a normal part of the functions of any body which has a managerial function in employing staff.  Obviously unauthorised <Col N="1386" /> disclosures of information would be dealt with within the normal procedures of any employer dealing with an employee.  But to go on to a totally new tack and totally new plane and create an offence is being totally ridiculous and suggests, somewhere or other, an obsession with secrecy in this particular area which does not bode too well for the operations of the agency.  I do not understand why an offence should be created with a penalty not exceeding £500.  I cannot understand it. I would like the Minister to explain on what precedent this section is based and why he thinks it is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Indeed, I am opposed to the whole section.  Senator Ryan is right in saying that the whole section is unnecessary.  It confirms my concept of what this agency is about.  It has not very much to do with anti-poverty campaigns because they by their nature require access to information and require openness and a cross-flow of information from employees within an agency to people outside on an on-going basis.  Subsection (1) is extremely restrictive. It seems to me as an non-lawyer that it almost precludes the possibility of any kind of on-going dialogue between community employees without the consent of the agency.</P>
      <P>My principal problem with this section is that it seems to indicate a restrictive concept of what the agency should be about.  It is imposing an unnecessary additional control and I support the amendment proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous speakers.  I have participated over the past five years as a member of an agency with statutory powers and there was no such clause, nor was it ever deemed that there should be because the commitment and the responsibility both of the agency members and staff were such that they knew it would be highly damaging to the work they did if they made an irresponsible statement or, much more serious, actually damaged either the reputation or the confidence of any person who came to them.  It raises a question about the <Col N="1387" /> perception of this agency as against other agencies which have been set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier in the debate the Senators were pressing me to make this a vital central national body which would have access to the information in the Departments and would be seen as a very strong organ of State.  I was criticised for the fact that they might not be putting their information into the present national plan centre.  It think it was Senator Harte who mentioned that aspect. Obviously if it is under way in time they can put their information into the national plan which is being prepared currently; if not, they will not be there in time to have much influence on the situation. If we want it to be a central body and to have access to the information which is available within various Departments where they are relevant, then obviously the members will have to be subject to the same code of conduct as applies to other people who handle that kind of information.  If not, then they cannot operate in that way.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to facilitate rather than hinder the work of the agency.  An important part of the work of the agency will be concerned with advising on the development of Government policy and providing critical analyses of existing State services.  If the members and staff of the agency are to be given access to sensitive information, it is necessary that they should be subject to the normal requirements of confidentiality. If the subsection referred to by the Senator were to be removed, then there would be no penalty for disclosure of information and therefore no point in subsection (1) which prohibits such disclosure. I would point out that the saver clause at section 17(3) clearly provides that the agency's day-to-day work will not be restricted in any way.</P>
      <P>I would, therefore, recommend that the section stand as it is and it is for these very reasons that I believe this agency will be important in the whole State setup. They should have free access to the information which is available on a confidential basis within Departments.</P>

      <P>The Minister has something of a point.  He laboured at great length and with some conviction &mdash; and he swayed me on a couple of issues &mdash; the role of the parliamentary draftsman in this matter.  I believe it would have been possible with proper sensitivity to have drafted a clause which would ensure that confidential information obtained from bodies and State agencies could be covered in some way without the &ldquo;catch all&rdquo; we have here.  I cannot accept that if the subsection were deleted it would be unworkable.  I would have thought that any agency employing staff would be able to take appropriate disciplinary action where the staff do not observe the codes, regulations and the requirements of their employer.  Therefore if we say that a person shall not do something without the consent of the agency and the person commits that act, quite obviously that person is in breach of his or her contract with the agency and can be dealt with in the appropriate fashion, which would probably be a lot more severe than a fine of even £500 as he or she would probably lose a job.</P>
      <P>It is the first time I take real issue with the Minister on this Bill.  Maybe it is because we are both getting a bit tired but for the first time since we started I find the Minister's reply to be less than helpful. It is nonsense to say that if my amendment were carried the section would be meaningless.  It would mean exactly what the first section says, that a person in breach of his contract with the agency would be subject to disciplinary action. Under the normal principles of management if a person is in breach of confidence &mdash; and this is simply reiterating that fact in legislative form &mdash; then that person would be subject to disciplinary action.</P>

Even if someone feels there is something which needs to be reported to the Minister in relation to the agency's activities or something within it, that is covered also in section 17(3) or through reports which are involved.  It is purely a question of observing the normal arrangements of <Col N="1389" /> confidentiality in relation to the information which is made available.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing to the Seanad this Bill and asking for favourable consideration of its contents I am conscious of the fact that the Bill has already given rise to a good deal of comment.  I am, therefore, glad of this opportunity to outline the basic reasoning behind the measures which the Bill contains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the legislation disqualifying persons from <Col N="1391" /> receiving unemployment benefit or assistance while involved in a trade dispute. The Bill provides that this disqualification will not apply where it is decided that the person involved has been deprived of his employment by the unreasonable action of his employer.</P>
    <P>I hope in the course of my speech to allay certain fears which have been expressed about the intent of the Bill and the possible effects of the measures provided for in the Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is a limited one.  It does not fundamentally change the present situation with regard to the non-payment of unemployment benefit or assistance to persons involved in a trade dispute.  The general principle that unemployment resulting directly from a trade dispute in which the claimant is involved should not give him title to unemployment benefit has been in existence from the introduction of unemployment insurance in 1911.  It is a feature of unemployment insurance schemes elsewhere and in my opinion is essential to preserve the neutrality of the social insurance fund in trade dispute situations. I am not altering this basic provision and indeed nobody has suggested to me that I should do so.  What I am addressing in the Bill is a very particular and, I believe, unusual type of situation which could occur in the context of a trade dispute and in which the automatic disqualification of the employee for unemployment benefit could be regarded as unjust.</P>
    <P>The type of situation I have in mind arises where the behaviour of the employer in a trade dispute is such that the employee is effectively prevented from remaining in or resuming his employment.  This could happen for example where an employer by unilateral and arbitrary action and without the normal process of consultation seeks to impose an unwarranted worsening of terms or conditions of employment on his work force, or where an employer lays off workers without proper consultations or without utilising the normal industrial relations machinery which is availed of by employers generally.  In these types of <Col N="1392" /> situation employees may find themselves unwillingly caught up in a dispute with no real effort being made to employ normal industrial relations procedures.  The employer may have his own reasons for the way in which he handles the situation but what we are trying to resolve by means of the provisions of this Bill is whether the employee is being unfairly treated and whether his automatic disqualification from receiving unemployment payments in these circumstances is unduly harsh and inequitable.</P>
    <P>I know from the official records that the previous Government had received representations on this matter and had started the process of consideration and consultation.  On taking office following the change of Government, I also received representations.  I considered the issues raised with me in great detail and I was satisfied that there was a genuine problem which needed to be resolved.  The result is the Bill which is now before you.  Following consultation with them, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have expressed support for the measures contained in the Bill.  The Federated Union of Employers consider that the legislation is unnecessary and that the matters at issue can be resolved within the framework of the existing machinery. There are, however, good reasons why this is not possible and I will outline these later.  In general however what has emerged is that the automatic disqualification for receiving unemployment payments may be inequitable in certain types of situation to which I have referred.  The possibility of such situations arising has been highlighted in the context of a number of industrial disputes that took place earlier this year.  I make no judgments in relation to these disputes and I would not attempt to do so.  I have no doubt it is better to deal with the problem now than to sweep it under the carpet once particular disputes have been settled and hope that it will not raise its head again.</P>
    <P>The existing decisions and appeals machinery of the Department of Social Welfare simply decide whether or not a trade dispute exists in a particular situation. Once it is decided that a trade dispute exists then the persons involved are <Col N="1393" /> disqualified from receiving benefit.  The deciding officer or appeals officer makes no judgment on the nature of a dispute &mdash; whether, for example, what is involved is a walk-out or a lock-out.  It is no part of his function to pass judgment on the merits or demerits of industrial disputes, nor is he equipped to do so.  It has been suggested by the FUE that deciding officers or appeals officers could deal with the problem by simply taking account of decisions arrived at by the Labour Court. This, however, is to misunderstand the whole purpose of what is being attempted.  The function of the Labour Court is to solve disputes by putting forward solutions that it considers appropriate and acceptable.  The allocation of responsibility for the dispute is not of fundamental importance in the deliberations of the Labour Court but rather is it a question of solving the particular dispute. These considerations would be of no assistance in attempting to solve the particular difficulties with which we are confronted.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, decided that the functions of deciding officers and appeals officers should remain as they are and that when problems arise they should be tackled separately by an independent body with sufficient competence in the industrial relations field to enable it to adjudicate. Provision is made accordingly in the Bill for a Social Welfare Tribunal which will be independent of the present social welfare decisions and appeals machinery. These provisions would continue to be used and the deciding officer and appeals officer would as heretofore decide, in cases where a worker loses his employment, whether or not a trade dispute existed.  Depending on the decision benefit would be allowed or disallowed.</P>
    <P>If the decision were to disallow benefit then it would be open to the workers to apply to have their cases referred to the tribunal for adjudication if they felt that they had been unfairly treated.  The tibunal would consider the various elements present in the case and would adjudicate on whether or not the workers lost their employment in circumstances that the tribunal considered to be within the provisions of the Bill and whether or <Col N="1394" /> not unemployment benefit should in consequence be paid.  This decision of the tribunal would be binding on all parties, subject to an appeal to the High Court on a point of law.</P>
    <P>In the procedures proposed there would be no intention of adjudicating on the merits or demerits of the fundamental industrial relations problem at issue.  This is an area for which there already exists independent and impartial machinery. Rather would it be a question of investigating the manner in which workers had been deprived of their employment and all the circumstances surrounding this. The tribunal would be representative of the interests of employers and employees and would have the expertise necessary to enable it to examine the various elements in a dispute and make an authorative adjudication as to whether the workers involved have been unreasonably deprived of their employment with particular reference to the question as to whether or not normal industrial relations practices had been observed.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not tie the tribunal's hands with regard to the matters which it should consider in arriving at its adjudication but it does set out the main considerations which will be relevant to the tribunal's adjudication.  These considerations relate mainly to the conduct of the employer since the question at issue is whether or not he has acted reasonably. In this context the view has been put that the Bill makes special provision in favour of the employee without at the same time giving a balancing facility to the employer.  There are a number of points which I would like to make in relation to this.  First of all, I am endeavouring in this Bill to deal with an injustice which is only applicable to employees since they are the ones who are deprived of benefit in dispute situations there is no question of employers being deprived of benefit. Secondly there is no question of trying to shift the balance in industrial relations by giving an unfair advantage to employees in dispute situations.  Rather this provision should be looked on as an attempt to redress an imbalance which is inherent in the present situation and which can arise in the limited type of situation to <Col N="1395" /> which I have earlier referred.  In this regard I see the provisions of the Bill as contributing to an improvement in industrial relations rather than the opposite.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that there is a danger that the provisions in the Bill will be used or abused for purposes other than those intended &mdash; presumably what is in mind is that employees would use the tribunal as a means of obtaining an unfavourable decision against their employer in a dispute and thus strengthening their own bargaining position.  Of course any arrangement, no matter what the safeguards, can be open to abuse, as indeed are other areas of the social welfare code.  I think, however, that the likelihood of abuse of the kind referred to is remote.</P>
    <P>The tribunal in arriving at its adjudication will be alive to the possibility of abuse and I am sure we can all rely on the objectivity and good sense of the tribunal to ensure that no major problems will arise.  Indeed the point has likewise been made that the existing trade disputes disqualification is capable of being abused when an employer might force a dispute on his employees knowing that in the event of a dispute they will not be entitled to unemployment payments. Any system is open to abuse but in establishing the independent Social Welfare Tribunal I am doing my best to ensure that adjudications are fair and take account of the positions of all the parties involved.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I have said will have made clear the limited nature of the provision being made in this Bill and the necessity for making this provision at this time.  The cases which will fall to be dealt with by the new tribunal should be few in number because I agree with the view put forward by the FUE that the number of employers who do not utilise existing industrial relations machinery are few and exceptional.  I have pleasure, therefore, in recommending this Bill to Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreBolger" hpid="Mrs. Bolger Mrs. Bolger">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bolger</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House is extremely concerned about the proposals in this Bill, although I am glad to say that <Col N="1396" /> since amendments were accepted in the Dáil it is somewhat better than in its original form when it was put before Dáil Éireann.  We feel the implications therein will be a retrograde step for industrial relations and for the existing machinery which is there to settle disputes.  We are concerned that the provisions in the Bill will both encourage and prolong strikes. This is a very real fear that emanates from it.  It will not in the long-term be in the best interests of the employee or the employer or of the country as a whole. This important Bill was rushed through Dáil Éireann because of certain commitments to The Workers Party.  That is a very high price for any Government to have to pay for support.  It is an extremely complex Bill with very far-reaching effects on the existing industrial relations in our country and for that reason it should have been given the utmost airing and time in Dáil Éireann to be discussed and to be discussed at party level.  There was very little notice of the Bill and, in fairness, the various parties in the Dáil did not have time to discuss it among themselves fully.  For such important legislation this is very disturbing.</P>
      <P>There is a very real danger that this tribunal will be abused, no matter what the Minister has said in his address to us and the cost to the State could be disastrous. By its very nature this Bill will encourage strikers to press very quickly for an adjudication from this tribunal. We already have ample opportunity for independent and impartial investigation of disputes and, although this Bill was drafted specifically to cover two cases which come to mind, the existing machinery should have been sufficient to sort out the problems in these areas given the commitment on both sides, of management and the employees.  The establishment of this tribunal could result in no real effort being made to settle disputes through negotiation and conciliation until the tribunal had referred and strikers found themselves entitled to social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is being introduced at an extremely crucial stage in our economic development.  We are really only reaching the heart of the terrible recession we <Col N="1397" /> are going through at the moment. Employers in Ireland have many headaches at the moment between inflation, interest rates and our inability to compete in the world market.  Any legislation which is enacted to aggravate these problems further is to be abhorred.  There is no compensation whatsoever for the financial chaos that a strike causes the employer.  In this Bill this tribunal is set up literally to put the employer on trial. Very little redress is available to the employer.  We are deeply concerned on this side of the House about the many abuses of our social welfare system which are mentioned time and time again in debates on Bill after Bill in this House. There is a disincentive to work because the majority of people are better off on social welfare &mdash; we all know this.  People are working a three-day week and getting unemployment for the other three days. We all know of cases where, through the very nature of their financial position at the moment, this has to be, otherwise it is a complete shut-down, but there are abuses on both the employer's and employee's sides.  Employees unreasonably refuse job offers.  This needs very close monitoring and I hope it will, as the Minister promised earlier today, be watched very closely indeed.  I am very concerned about the Bill and I know that in the Dáil the Minister gave certain commitments about reviewing the situation in six months time.  I hope he will give us an assurance in this House today that we will get the opportunity to discuss the progress, findings and workings of this tribunal in six months time.</P>
    <P>I am certainly extremely disappointed that the Minister did not see fit to accept the amendment whereby the chairman would be a member of the legal profession because I feel this would have been the fairest decision.  We are not too clear on exactly what happened in the Dáil and maybe the Minister would enlarge upon this.</P>
    <P>I am very nervous about the consequences of this bill and I sincerely hope that the Minister will keep a very close eye on it to see that it is not abused in the coming six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the previous speaker, I would like to assure the Minister that my party welcome this legislation. It has come quickly on the stocks but it has not come quickly enough as far as my party are concerned.  We highlighted originally the anomalies that we saw in the Social Welfare Acts when the Consolidation Bill came through.  I am on record in this House as having suggested to the Minister some months ago that this anomaly was there and he would have to set it right in the interests of justice in industrial relations.  As a party, we feel that this Bill will certainly not lead to a deterioration in industrial relations but on the other hand will lead to an improvement in them.  There are certain situations in this country, and the Minister has outlined in his speech two cases in recent months, where this anomaly has occurred.  The Department of Social Welfare interpreted both of those as trade disputes whereas the employees were innocent of the disputes, so to speak.  There can be situations of a lock out by the employers without consultation with their employees and there can be employees who through no fault of their own are inconvenienced and are left with nothing to live on.  Were it not for the fact that a commitment was given to ensure that a payment from some source or other was made available to the workers in Clover Meats in Waterford, no settlement could have been arrived at in that tragic dispute which dragged on because of this anomaly in the Social Welfare Act which precluded people from a just receipt of their social welfare, because they contended &mdash; and it was proved afterwards &mdash; that it was not their situation that caused a trade dispute.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my party I welcome the legislation.  In order to be effective, the tribunal will need to give decisions very quickly in areas of dispute.  Otherwise there could still be hardships caused. Apart from any problem of the kind we are talking of, there are often delays on the part of the Department of Social Welfare. I know of one case in which the Department took 12 months in deciding the eligibility of a widow for a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> This was because of the delay in getting information from other sources.  I hope that this tribunal will give decisions quickly so that the hardship that is caused by a trade dispute, whether it is a lock out or otherwise will be avoided.  I would like to think the community welfare officer would be empowered to make a payment to people to tide them over a period and that would be refunded as is done in the normal social welfare situation. While a decision is awaited at times we have to go to the community welfare officer to take people off the bread line and hold them at some minimal standard of living until their cause has been decided.</P>
    <P>I would hope that this tribunal will not be bogged down by a large number of cases being referred to it.  I hope it will have very little action at all but it is useful for employees to know that there is another structure whereby they can have their case fairly adjudicated on and which will not interfere with the Department of Social Welfare's interpretation of what is a trade dispute.  This legislation will lead to a betterment of labour relations.  I consider the FUE's reservations to be unjustified.  I welcome the Minister's speech today in this House.  He has set down fairly the pros and cons of why he feels this legislation is necessary and certainly I commend it to the House for support for all Stages today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time moneys collected by employers in respect of social welfare are not sent to the Department of Social Welfare.  Some years ago Social Welfare officers used to call in on employees to see if their stamps were up to date but recently I have read of firms owing two and three years' money in this respect and, ultimately, not being able to meet their commitments.  The unfortunate employees did not qualify for any benefit as a result.  There is an onus on the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Finance or some Department to ensure that PRSI contributions are made when they should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seemingly, there are some people blessed by the Department with goodness <Col N="1400" /> while others have to keep their payments up to date.  If employers are remiss in making the payments a serious problem may arise of workers are out of employment in that they may not be paid benefit until the Department of Social Welfare are satisfied that the employers have not sufficient assets to enable them to return the moneys.  This is something that I have been very annoyed about for some years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been churlish of me to have departed after the previous business and not stay to compliment the Minister on this piece of legislation because I contributed substantially to his delay.  The Bill is a very good one. The Minister answered a number of the arguments as well as, if not better than I could have done myself.  That is a compliment. I support the Bill wholeheartedly and enthusiastically and I can only regret that yet again the employers' voice seems to be taking up what can only be described as a reactionary position instead of attempting to create some sort of a consensus in Irish industrial relations. I congratulate the Minister on the speedy introduction of the Bill.  I hope it goes through quickly and that it remedies what is a serious anomaly.  Now that he has gone on to thinking about tribunals in the whole area of social welfare, perhaps once and for all he can be the Minister to do something about the appallingly antiquated social welfare appeals system which urgently needs fundamental revision in the interests of natural justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment him on his speech here.  There are just a few points I should like to refer to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see it, social welfare is absolutely necessary but it is necessary as a last resort.  It should be viewed in that light and in my view it is not always regarded as the only alternative left.  As was stated earlier there are instances when it is more encouraging and more rewarding for people to be in receipt of social welfare than to be working.  That whole system is wrong in essence.  It is wrong for everybody from a worker's point of view, <Col N="1401" /> mentally, physically and every other way, it is very bad that he is forced into a position of having no work to do and of having to rely on social welfare.  Every effort must be made to bring about a situation in which it is not attractive for persons to be relying on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I would share the view expressed already that inherent in this Bill is some danger of strikes being prolonged for longer than would be necessary.  We must bear in mind that in the recent past we have seen several industries, large and small, go out of business.  This is happening almost on a daily basis.  There are several hundreds of industries, large and small, queuing up to get out of business or being forced out of business and I do not think anything should be done that might tilt the balance to put those businesses out of action if they can be kept in operation.  From everybody's point of view &mdash; workers and business people &mdash; retaining business is far better than just having payments made to persons, because in the long term if social welfare is a sort of alternative, the economy will not survive.</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that our party recognise the importance of an adequate level of social welfare, and indeed in the budget which was being introduced last January, by our then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, it was proposed to have a 25 per cent adjustment in social welfare.  That was an indication of how important we regard social welfare but I would hastily add that social welfare must be scrutinised far more fully and only genuine cases must be regarded as eligible for social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>People presently suffering hardship due to bureaucracy are left without payment longer than necessary.  Payment in these cases must be speeded up.  These genuine cases of hardship must be identified quickly and receive the payments to which they are entitled.  There should not have to be a waiting system whereby they receive payments from other sources as an interim measure.  If people are entitled to social welfare, there should be no delay in their getting it.</P>
    <P>When work is available it must be <Col N="1402" /> made attractive.  One of the reasons for the present bad state of our economy is the industrial disputes which over a period of time have weakened the whole base of the economy.</P>
    <P>I conclude by again emphasising that social welfare is an absolutely essential part of our system, but work must be made more attractive for all our people who are capable of working, so that they will work rather than rely on social welfare. In this way we will have a better society and, most important, our young people will not become accustomed to a social welfare situation in which their fathers and mothers have never had the opportunity of working.  There is no good to be gained for our young people from that kind of atmosphere.  We should all in the future make certain that work is available, but in the meantime fully support social welfare measures that are necessary and essential to keep our people going so that nobody is on the breadline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to comment on Senator Hourigan's last remark that work must be made available for our young people.  The big issue that will confront us over the next 20 years is that if we equate work with employment we will never have satisfaction in that respect.  If we are to have a society in which we espouse a super-technology &mdash; and I cannot see how we can push the waves back &mdash; more and more automation will lead to less and less employment in the traditional sense and more and more time available to our community.  This raises two questions &mdash; will we be able to share out the available employment in the traditional sense and will we be able to create the conditions in which our youngsters can do creative work, in the new sense of work that they create for themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to have increasingly more unemployment rather than less it is essential to underpin the basic standard of living of everyone resident in Ireland.  It may well be that in the next decade or so we will not think of unemployment benefit as something exceptional, but expecting the State to provide a basic means of achieving ordinary living standards for <Col N="1403" /> everyone and, on top of that, to give them space in which to do creative work and invite their participation in new, imaginative means of dealing with age old problems in a totally changed context.</P>
    <P>I do not despair of the present unemployment situation provided we use our imagination and do not deprive the unemployed of opportunity for creative expression and participation.  In that context I welcome, both in the interim and in the long-term, the thinking behind this Bill.  To be more specific, anyone who has had much contact with the unemployed who want to work and who through no fault of their own are unable even temporarily to get work and who have not the space to achieve this self-expression will feel a great sympathy for what the Minister is trying to achieve here, which is to provide them with a basic standard of living until such time, whether temporary or in the long-term, as we can readjust, and give them better opportunity and more hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senators for their contributions, which varied considerably in their content, and for their views in relation to the Bill.  Senator Bolger is still confusing this situation with the general industrial relations position. Senator Bolger mentioned people going on strike more frequently, or being encouraged to strike and not wanting to go back to work.  This limited, specific measure only applies to people who want to go back, but who are locked out and cannot get unemployment benefit.  That is all.  All that has been said to the contrary in relation to this Bill is nonsense. I am talking now about what is being said outside, not inside the Seanad.  A great deal of emotionalism has developed outside this House over this Bill.  Even the FUE have said specifically in their document circulated to all Deputies and Senators that they hold no brief for workers, trade unions, or employers who do not utilise the machinery of the Labour Court and that, in relation to these cases which the tribunal would deal with, they are few <Col N="1404" /> and exceptional cases.  They know exactly what we are talking about.  There is no question about that.  Why have all these smokescreens?  We all talk about honesty, justice and rationality.  Let us talk honestly here about the specific matter.</P>
      <P>ICTU considered the matter at great length, which was one cause of the delay in getting the Bill into the House plus the fact that the House was rising for the summer recess and the consultation process was quite lengthy, with a good deal of time and thought going into it.  They are very much involved, they do not want to encourage strikes and act very responsibly in relation to the whole operation of the economy and the whole industrial relations procedure.  If they did not function in such a responsible way, we would have very many problems that would not be resolved for a long time.  ICTU completely recognised what we were trying to do, identified it and said specifically that they were in favour of it, without question.  They had a suggestion that the definition &ldquo;a legal person&rdquo; should be broadened, but I will come to that in a moment.</P>
      <P>The FUE said again in their document:</P>
      <P>We consider that the objective of the proposed legislation would be secured if the Social Welfare Deciding Officer or Appeals Officer was enabled to take full account of the decisions and views of the Labour Court in arriving at a decision in any case which might come before them.</P>
      <P>The deciding officer is not entitled to do this.  Again, that is nonsense in relation to the reality of the situation.  Senator Bolger also raised that point of the deciding officer making broader decisions. The deciding officer should be empowered to look at the other aspects in a specified case like this.  The problem in the two cases that are involved was that the deciding officer had no powers. Nobody initially foresaw this kind of development.</P>
      <P>Senator Bolger also emphasised the reality of the present recession, which tied in with Senator Robb's remarks.  It is only in the reality of this present recession that these incidents are occurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1405" /> That is the very climate in which situations will arise which were not experienced previously and we must cater for them in the present circumstances. If it could have been covered merely by enabling the deciding officer to use a little more discretion when specific cases could be covered, that would be fair enough.  But the deciding officers and social welfare procedures must be operated within the legislation.  Indeed, it must be said that they operate with great conscience and integrity in their interpretation, ultimately of course subject to the whole legal process.  The Federated Union of Employers emphasised that other changes in our social welfare procedures rate as a higher priority.  They were not saying anything particularly about this change, which is limited to so few.  They talked about other changes and then went into the question of PRSI rebates, tax rebates, their abuses in the areas we have heard of &mdash; to which Senator B. Ryan referred several times in the course of his remarks today &mdash; and to circumstances in which employees can unreasonably refuse to accept job offers.</P>
    <P>I want Senators to be quite clear that it is a very narrow area about which we are talking here, a very restricted one in which considerable hardship has arisen. There is no question about that.  For example, if one is locked out of work and receives no money.  Here we are saying that anybody in those circumstances genuinely suffering hardship should be covered and we do not have the power to do it in present circumstances.  Then hardship must arise for those people because all they can then receive is supplementary welfare, and one can only receive that for one's wife and children. If one happens to be unmarried, one can get nothing.  After that one is back to the very low levels of welfare available for one's wife and children in any event.  I do not believe that this will really place an employer under stress.</P>
    <P>Senator Bolger raised this as well &mdash; the question of abuses generally &mdash; the three-day week, the working and drawing of benefit.  There is a review taking place at present and this will form part of the autumn programme to tackle these problems. <Col N="1406" /> Everybody talks about the three-day week.  It must be remembered that again one is talking about a period of depression.  The three-day week has been included in legislation for many years. One must ask why was it not a problem previously.  In answering that we come back to the point raised by Senator Bolger &mdash; because of the depressed circumstances now obtaining.  That is why it has become a problem.  One might ask how is that.  The answer is that at the end of 1979, going into 1980, it became clear that certain businesses would go to the wall if they were not given some type of support.  In that period the three-day week was very important to them.  Of course it was hoped that at the end of that period things would have improved and that there would be fewer people in that situation.  At present out of 1.2 million employees there are about 9,000 on a three-day week.  Therefore, in terms of abuse in relation to the overall total &mdash; reverting again to the point Senator B. Ryan was making &mdash; it constitutes a very small fraction.  It is an anomaly in the system and it is costing the taxpayer money.  At present the three-day week is based on a six-day overall week &mdash; you get three days when you are working and three days when you are off.  Also present payments are based on one-sixth.  If we were to change to a five-day week we would then have to face the possibility of paying one-fifth, in which case more would have to be paid making the total cost to the taxpayer higher.</P>
    <P>These may appear to be just technical considerations.  But people who voice opinions publicly about such matters should take the trouble of going into the situation in depth.  I am not here talking about Senators.  There has been a great deal of opinion expressed outside and I have met some deputations.  I found that such deputations did not really have much understanding of the workings of the system.  I found that they had taken up something more in the way of a slogan carried by the media and made into a bigger monster than it is.  Nevertheless that matter is being investigated in the context of this review taking place. Obviously the system will have to be <Col N="1407" /> changed to meet the circumstances obtaining.  That matter will have to be considered by the review body at present studying the situation.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that this problem arose in the difficult period following on the large oil price increase when things did not get any better.  In fact they got worse and we were faced with the fact nationwide that more people needed to avail of the benefits of the system.  I know also that at the end of that period some workers did not want to return to work because they were doing so well on the three-day-plus basis. That problem must be tackled.  I get somewhat irked at times &mdash; in this I suppose I am a little like Senator B. Ryan &mdash; because I see the large numbers of people needing help.  Therefore this problem must be approached in a constructive way, endeavouring to avoid emotionalism.</P>
    <P>On the question of the chairman and the legal profession, I do not mind whether it be a chairman with a legal background or one with an industrial relations background.  We did not want to be limited to a narrow selection which can be difficult because of the extent of the work of High Court and District Court judges.  Obviously we want somebody with an industrial relations background, which narrows it down to a smaller number.  Therefore the person chosen for a particular period could be somebody with a legal and industrial relations background.  That is a matter which will have to be considered in the establishment of the board.  For example barristers would be quite capable in the legal and industrial relations areas, so they would be quite suitable also whereas the amendment proposed in the Dáil would have restricted us to a very limited area.</P>
    <P>On the question of the review, it was proposed that the board be established and operate for 12 months after which time a committee would be set up to review its operations.  Senator Ferris welcomed the measure and understood its specific nature.  The question of taking quick decisions is one of considerable importance here.  Senator Ferris raised <Col N="1408" /> that point also.  It must be remembered that the community welfare officer intervenes in the meantime and would in any circumstances.  However, a community welfare officer is very limited in what he or she can do.</P>
    <P>Senator Reynolds was concerned about employers collecting money and not passing it on, which certainly has occurred and there are many such instances.  The Senator need not be concerned about the workers in those circumstances, except that initially there may be some delay in getting benefit.  The Department of Social Welfare give credit to the worker if it can be seen that the worker has paid the contribution.  The Department are quite reasonable and flexible in that regard and have discretion in that area.  If the Senator knows of a particular case and if he will let me have the details, I will certainly have it pursued. But that is the principle on which it operates &mdash; if the employer collects the contributions and does not pass them on then they are given as credits.  The system operates on that basis.  Of course since 1979 it is the Revenue Commissioners who collect PRSI contributions and they would do all in their power to get all of that money in.  Anybody who has ever had the Revenue Commissioners chase them would accept that they would do their best in that direction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hourigan raised the question of social welfare being the last resort.  I think Senator Robb answered that and I do not need to go into it any further.  We shall face new situations in the future which we shall have to scrutinise in a new way.  Part of the autumn review will be related to the question of people having the option to work at the place where <Col N="1409" /> they are receiving unemployment benefit, endeavouring to integrate this as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>On the subject of delays in the payment of social welfare benefits, there is a point I should like to mention in that regard, that is, that ten per cent to 12 per cent of applications received still quote no RSI number, quote a wrong number or give no name.  That entails delay in the Department.  I might also appeal to Senators when making inquiries on behalf of people to ensure that the RSI number is quoted.  From the time we changed to this new computer technology and worked on numbers it has become very difficulty to find individual applicants' details without the relevant numbers. This autumn I think we should have another advertising campaign in an effort to encourage people to quote their precise numbers and not quote numbers off the top of their heads.  In fact there was a case recently of a person complaining three times through a friend of mine.  In the end the officials in the Department threw up their hands in horror because they could find nothing at all relating to the case in question.  They went back to the applicant and it was discovered on each occasion that the person had been quoting the number from memory.  That was where the whole delay occurred.  I accept there can be other reasons for delays and we have to deal with those also.</P>
    <P>Senators Robb's point is a very interesting one because it is a very broad one and time and thought should be given to it &mdash; that is, the concept of work in the future.  If you carry on with the new technologies and the development of equipment and machinery which will do things much more easily for you, then what can you do with yourself and the rest of the population?  Time and thought need to be given to involving people creatively and to ensure that they have something creative to do.  This applies particularly at the moment to our young people who are coming out of school with great skills and creative ability and who need to be supported in that area.  It will <Col N="1410" /> be one of the main tasks of the Government to try to tackle that problem.  Certainly, Senator Robb introduced some interesting concepts to the debate.</P>

The cost would be negligible in global terms, because the number of instances would be very few.

    <P>I would like to make a short statement in relation to section 1.  When the Bill was before the Dáil I accepted an Opposition proposal that any reference to the tribunal would only be after consideration of the case by both the deciding officer and an appeals officer.  In section 1, page 2, line 14 of the Bill now before the Seanad the Opposition proposed that the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; be substituted for the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, the grammar was overlooked because &ldquo;has&rdquo; should also have been changed to &ldquo;have&rdquo;.  It should read &ldquo;a deciding officer and appeals officer have decided&rdquo; and not &ldquo;has decided&rdquo;.  This is not a substantive <Col N="1411" /> change, simply being one of a verbal or formal nature.  If the House is agreeable, I will ask the Cathaoirleach to arrange that the necessary verbal correction be made to the Bill pursuant to Standing Order No. 100 of the Seanad Standing Orders.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> If the Senator is I will be delighted to answer any questions.  The Senator has made an important point and I want to be as helpful as I can in that respect.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to introduce new provisions governing the duration of planning permissions in place of the provisions now contained in section 29 of the 1976 Planning Act.  Under section 29, all permissions granted before 1 November 1976, ceased to have effect on 31 October, 1981, and all other permissions cease to have effect five years after the date of the granting of the permission. In the latter half of 1981, numerous representations were made to the then Minister for the Environment from individuals and from their legal and other professional advisers regarding the effect of section 29.</P>
      <P>In addition, certain defects in the section, particularly in its provisions in relation to the extension of permissions, came to light and it was considered desirable that these should be put right.  In these circumstances the previous Minister announced on 16 December 1981, with the approval of the then Government, that he intended to introduce legislation at an early date to repeal and replace the law with regard to the duration of planning permissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's statement indicated that permissions which expired under existing law on 31 October 1981 would be extended for a period of one year from that date and that all other permissions would have a life of six years.  The statement indicated that the additional period now being proposed for the completion of development was considered to be justified because of the lack of awareness on the part of many people of the limit on the life of their permissions and because the five year period allowed under existing law for the completion of development was too short in the case of some <Col N="1413" /> major developments.  The preparation of legislation to implement the proposals announced in December 1981 had not been completed when the Coalition Government left office in March 1982.</P>
    <P>Having reviewed the position in some detail, the Government have decided to implement the previous Government's undertaking in regard to the extension of existing permissions and, in addition, to introduce a new procedure designed to eliminate the difficulties caused for both developers and planning authorities in dealing with applications for the extension of permissions.  Having regard to the unavoidable delay in enacting the necessary legislation it would obviously be of little benefit to many people to provide at this stage for a six year life for existing permissions.  Accordingly, to allow for the lapse of time since the previous Minister's announcement in December 1981, section 2 of the Bill provides that permissions granted before 1 November 1976 will expire on 31 November 1983.  On the other hand, the Government are satisfied that the life of permissions granted from now on should not in general exceed five years, and section 2 of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>The previous Government had intended to extend the life of all future permissions to six years.  But this is not considered to be necessary or desirable for future permissions.  The position will, therefore, be that a five year life will normally apply, but where the development has commenced within the five year period, and where substantial works have been carried out on foot of the permission, the developer will have a right to apply for and obtain an extension of the permission sufficient to enable him to complete the development.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that a five year duration for future permissions, coupled with this new extension procedure, should be perfectly adequate to cover the generality of cases and that, if the duration of permissions generally were extended beyond five years, the commencement of permitted development would be delayed in some cases with undesirable consequences in the <Col N="1414" /> area of dereliction and general urban blight.  In so far as permissions granted between November 1976 and November 1982 are concerned, section 2 provides for a form of tapering arrangement. Permissions granted during this period will last until 31 October 1987, or seven years after the granting of the permission, whichever is the shorter period.</P>
    <P>It is considered that the new provisions of section 2 will achieve a reasonable balance between the objective of encouraging early development and re-development and the practical problems encountered by developers of all kinds commencing and completing their development generally.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 31, after &ldquo;effect&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided the development starts within two years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is simple.  What I have in mind is a person who has planning permission for a five year period of a seven year period and, having done no development, re-applies for an extension. Before that extension is granted there should be a direction in the planning permission that work must commence within a period of two years.  Perhaps that is too long, or perhaps the Minister might convince me that it is not long enough.  Nobody is entitled to hold planning permission for seven years the first time, and seven years the second time.  That is the procedure at present and I do not think it is good enough or fair.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> The purpose of section 3 is to provide for a degree of flexibility in the duration of permissions allowing planning authorities, as part of a grant of permission, to specify a period of duration longer than five years in cases where they consider that the nature and extent of the development or any other material consideration would warrant this.  It is envisaged that this provision could be used in the case of continuing developments, such as quarries, or in relation to large complex developments which could take some time to get under way and be completed, or in relation to cases where difficulties and delays in commencing, and therefore completing, a permitted development might be anticipated because of the need to await the provision of services or compliance with some other consideration of the permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of this section were welcomed by the Opposition in the Dáil especially by Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick of Cavan-Monaghan.  Deputies sought to have the Bill amended so as to build in a further easement for developers.  They sought to provide that the life of a permission would not even begin to run until conditions outside the control of the applicant, such as service conditions had been complied with.  The Minister undertook to consider this in the context of a later Bill.  What is proposed in Senator Reynolds' amendment amounts to an unnecessary or undesirable limitation of the scope of section 3.  Perhaps that is <Col N="1416" /> not the Senator's intention, but I see it that way.</P>
    <P>We are all anxious to secure that permitted development will commence as quickly as possible, but there is no point in attempting to impose an arbitrary commencement date on permissions in relation to which section 3 is used.  Here I should stress that no commencement date is provided for in section 2 in relation to permissions generally.  The requirement is that the development be completed within a specified time.  There is no reason to think that planning authorities or An Board Pleanála will abuse the power to be conferred on them by section 3.  The criteria for granting a longer period than the standard one are set out in the section and a decision by a planning authority to specify a particular period may be appealed to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>There are other arguments also against the amendment.  For example, section 3 applies to outline permissions as well as to full permissions.  A two year commencement requirement could be very onerous in relation to outlines, given the need to apply for and obtain approval before any development can actually commence.  Again, there is the technical question of when a development can be said to have actually started.  This could possibly be got over by a complicated definition provision, but even then it would add yet another source of conflict to the already complicated process.  In all these circumstances I consider that the House should not adopt this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is simple.  If a person has planning permission for a development and no development is done and he reapplies at the end of the period, let it be five years or seven years, if he is to get planning permission again there should be something in that planning permission saying the development must start within two years, or within a month, or six months, or within three years.  That is my simple amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask a question which might clarify the point raised by Senator P. Reynolds.  There is very little between what I am going to ask and what Senator P. Reynolds had been trying to extract from the Minister in connection with outline planning permission. Many applications are received for outline planning permission for the purpose of the sale of a plot of land.  In order to get that permission a person <Col N="1418" /> must define for the planning authority whether that portion of land is suitable for development prior to sale.  If the sale does not take place within the five-year period prescribed in the new Bill, will a new application have to be sought to define if the land is suitable, thus putting the people to the extra cost of making another application?  If a building is under construction but is not completed in the prescribed period, section 4 provides for an extension of that period to complete the building.  That is an natural process.  In that case do I take it reapplication for planning permission will have to be made?</P>

      <P>That is a different thing.  I agree that development may have started but the work is not completed because something can go wrong with the work.  That is understandable, but I still think there are a number of applications for planning permission &mdash; from private individuals or big developers &mdash; where work may not have been started and they can reapply and get an extra period of one, two, three or seven years.  However, the Minister has convinced me that is not right, and I am prepared to accept that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> The question of placing a time limit on the period within which a planning appeal should be decided was considered during the passage through the Oireachtas of the Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1976, and on a number of occasions since then.  It was decided, however, that such a limit would not be realistic given the manner in which the board are required to operate and the widely differing classes of appeals with which they have to deal.  The board try to be as efficient and expeditious as possible in dealing with appeals but they cannot act in an arbitrary fashion or ignore the requirements of natural justice to conform to such a deadline as the Senator proposes.  It is a very considerable undertaking to deal with an intake of up to 4,500 planning appeals each year. The requirements of the Planning Acts and regulations must be complied with in every case.  In addition, there are the requirements of natural and constitutional justice.  Each appeal is important to the individual concerned and it is better to suffer some delay in the interests of natural justice than to act in an arbitrary fashion.  It must be emphasised that <Col N="1421" /> factors outside the control of the board affect the time taken in dealing with some appeals.  These factors include delays in submitting grounds of appeal, requests that appeals be held in abeyance, delays in getting documents from local authorities, the need to circulate documents and await comments or submissions on them, new issues arising and inadequate plans submitted with original applications.  It is not practicable, therefore, to impose strict statutory time limits on the board in regard to appeals.</P>
      <P>I might mention, however, that efforts are being made to speed up the process of appeals.  The Minister has indicated to the board his concern at the increase in the number of appeals on hand at the end of 1981 and he has stressed that it is imperative in the interests of the efficient operation of the planning system and of the Government's aims relating to promotion of development and employment that every effort should be made to devise means by which the output of decisions may be speeded up.  The board have stated that they share the Minister's concern that the number of appeals on hand should be kept to a minimum and they have always been conscious of the need to deal expeditiously with cases which could be large employment generators and with third party appeals involving major developments.  I can assure the House that the operation of the appeals system, and particularly the question of delays in dealing with appeals, will be kept under review and all possible steps will be taken to avoid any delays.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made a good case but I will put it to him in reverse.  Local authorities must give a decision on a planning permission within a three-month period but if there is an appeal there is no time limit put on the board.  If there is a time limit on a local authority, surely there should be a time limit on the board to whom the appeal is made?  Perhaps the Minister would state the average time for a planning appeal. Is it true that such appeals can be with the board for periods of six, eight or 12 months while the local authority have to <Col N="1422" /> deal with them within three months?  I certainly do not think that makes sense.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> As a member of a local authority I dealt with the point the Senator has made.  In certain cases the wrong emphasis may be placed on particular appeals that are processed. In actual fact, only one per cent of appeals would take 12 months.  Local authorities do not have to circulate documents. I do not think it practical to consider the point of view of the Senator.  I appreciate what he is saying but I feel the legislation adequately covers this point.</P>

If my neighbour applies for planning permission he must get a decision from the county council within the three-month period.

      <P>If permission is not granted but if there is no correspondence from the local authority then the applicant may get planning permission by default.  What really happens in the case of a local authority is that some further question is asked in connection with some aspect of the planning which allows the local authority to extend that period.  I agree with Senator Reynolds in connection with An Bord Pleanála that the time for processing applications is far too long. While the Minister in the context of good planning may not be in a position to put a limit on the time, he should give some assurance to this House and to the people concerned.  At a time of high inflation we could be talking about a development costing thousands of pounds.  I am sure the Minister is not in a position legally to put a limit on the time because he has outlined the difficulty about having the necessary information with An Bord Pleanála and trying to extract it from the different agencies.  The delay may not be the fault of An Bord Pleanála.  Everything possible should be done to expedite every appeal sent to An Bord Pleanála.

      <P>This section gives local authorities permission to build without planning permission, a matter I raised on Second Stage.  A local authority can erect a courthouse, a fire station or any other type of building they require without planning permission.  Some people hold that there is not much point in a local authority applying to themselves for planning permission, and that is understandable, but difficulties can arise.  For example, I am aware of a local authority who wanted to erect a fire station in a residential area and the residents protested with a result that the work is held up.  However, the local authority are in the happy position in that they can build that fire station without planning permission and the local people will not have an opportunity of objecting.  That is wrong. <Col N="1426" /> There is little point in having a law to cover private individuals or businessmen while local authorities, who are also the planning authorities, can build without permission.</P>
      <P>A similar situation arises in regard to the forestry section of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  They can develop a forest in any area without planning permission but anybody else anxious to make use of agricultural land must obtain planning permission.  The forestry division in my county, and in counties Sligo and Cavan, when developing forests wreck every road in the vicinity in the planting, cultivation and trimming processes. They bring in heavy machinery for their work on roads that are not capable of carrying them.  However, if a private individual did that &mdash; a person developing a quarry, for example &mdash; he would have to repair the road but the forestry division do not have to do that work.  It is left to the local authorities who do not have the money to carry out such repairs.  Private individuals carrying out any type of development are told when they are given planning permission that they must leave the road in good condition.  Something should be done about those matters under this section.</P>

A number of small farmers feel that that land should be purchased by the Land Commission and divided among them. Therefore, this is not as acceptable as the Minister seems to think.  There were many rows in my county and neighbouring counties about this &mdash; they paraded, they carried placards, no matter which Government were in power.  The main point I have been making is that private individuals cannot object to a local authority or to the Board of Works.  If the Board of Works want to build a Garda station here or there, or a military barracks here or there, they can do so without planning permission.  That is wrong.

      <P>I do not want to hold up the House any longer on this.  I can recall three cases, but that is not the point.  The ordinary taxpayer and ratepayer feels that the local authority should have to go through the same planning machinery to get permission to build fire stations or other such structures as the private individual must do.  That complaint is gathering moss at the moment and that moss will be dangerous.  I suggest that the Minister check with every local authority about it.</P>

      <P>Under this there has to be a charge by local authorities for planning permission.  We did get a figure of £280 here in Dublin for the cost of processing a planning application and £80 <Col N="1431" /> elsewhere.  Is it the intention to charge applicants here in Dublin £280 and £80 to applicants in the rural parts of the country? This has to be looked at much more seriously because young couples getting married and looking for planning permission find it hard enough to meet their other commitments.  I know that the intention is to get some finances for the local authority but I do not think that these people will be in a position to afford it.  We should do whatever we can to encourage young people to build their own houses rather than putting an extra charge on them.

They are almost in the capacity of voluntary organisations in so far as they work with little or no money.

Sometimes they have been the only watchdog &mdash; if I may call them so in the best possible sense &mdash; within the neighbourhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is even a threat that there might <Col N="1432" /> only be an assessment of the fee after they have lodged their appeal, that in itself could be a disincentive for pretty pennyless residents' associations or voluntary organisations like An Taisce to continue the good work they are doing. Yet all of us would applaud the work of such organisations and recognise that they have not got that kind of financial backing.  Therefore, could an assurance be given or written in that they would not be under threat of being charged a high fees so that it would not be a disincentive for them to apply or appeal in the first place?</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-East):</i> I sympathise with all the Senator has to say in this respect.  I certainly highly commend the work that residents' associations are doing in the community.  They are, as the Senator rightly says, watchdogs in very sensitive areas of planning that the private individual could not be expected to watch in every case.  An Taisce are also doing marvellous work.  It certainly is not my intention in any respect to make it the slightest bit difficult for such associations to operate in relation to the fee structure. In my experience local authorities welcome the contribution made by residents' associations, keep a list of them in their files, and are constantly in touch with them.  If the residents' associations were not actually looking out for irregularities taking place in districts the local authorities might find it very difficult to pinpoint them.  I share the view but there is a flexibility arrangement here and the view would be to encourage the work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for having accepted my request to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister for coming in to respond to it. With the Minister I share the concern that has been expressed in recent days arising out of the controversy that has arisen as a result of recent meetings in connection with the level of compensation under the bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication schemes.  The Minister will agree that it is nice to discuss this subject in the quiet of the Seanad <Col N="1436" /> Chamber as opposed to the hurly burly of the political hustings of east Galway.</P>
      <P>It was at a meeting in east Galway at which both the Minister and I were present that this question of the levels of compensation was discussed at some length.  The Minister will agree that financial ruin with which certain farmers are faced as a result of this scheme was outlined in a most graphic manner to both of us and Deputy Dukes on that night. We heard the Parish Priest of Killimer, the chairman of the IFA committee and ordinary farmers expressing deepest concern about the hardships that they face, not through any fault of the Minister but because the costings and the levels of compensation to farmers have not been updated since 1978.  Irrespective of whatever compensation we can give in this eradication programme, we cannot now return some farmers to viable farming because their stocks have been so depleted.  Their herds have been locked up and because of the regulations concerning the scheme they are unable to carry on any kind of farming.  This has put such people on the social welfare level of income.  That is a situation that I cannot tolerate and I am sure this House will not tolerate it.  I know that the Minister does not accept that this situation can go on indefinitely.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the Animal Health Council and chairman of a subcommittee which recommends the levels of compensation to Ministers for Agriculture.  At that meeting, as a result of recommendations from the council, the Minister gave a commitment to double the level of compensation.  The existing levels of compensation have remained at their present levels since 1978.  For cows and in-calf heifers it is £130 on top of the factory price.  If that was raised to 1982 levels, it would be £217.  For other cattle under 182 kilos the level of compensation now is £100.  If that was raised it would be £166.  If for heavier cattle &mdash; 200 kilos and upwards deadweight &mdash; it was raised it would now be £100 instead of £60.  In other words, the levels of compensation recommended were in line with the cost of living index.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made a similar case to the Minister's <Col N="1437" /> predecessor, Deputy Dukes, when he filled that office for a short period of seven months.  He adjusted the hardship fund and gave a commitment that these levels would be updated.  The committee from the Animal Health Council recommended that in view of the levels of compensation which I have suggested and in view of the fact that we were abolishing the hardship fund because it was hard to qualify for it, the levels should be raised from £217 to £250 and from £166 to £200. The level of compensation for heavier cattle would remain as it was because we felt that when animals of that weight gain were slaughtered in the factory there was a reasonable amount of compensation available to the farmer.</P>
    <P>The committee's recommendations were made in the light of the constrictions that the Minister might find himself in in a budget situation and the fact that certain levels of compensation, if they were updated to 1982, would be sufficient.  The Minister, after the meeting, felt it his duty to withdraw what was a public commitment and the rest of that meeting is now a matter of history.</P>
    <P>I suggested that we would also talk about a depopulation fund because depopulation is a necessity in this scheme if progress is to be made.  It is not a question of just identifying the animals with disease; we must identify the cause of the disease.  Otherwise this scheme on which we have spent £200 million will never be successful.  About 400 herds need to be depopulated.  They are a source of infection and the Department are aware of this.  It is a traumatic experience for a farmer to have his business totally wiped out but if there is an ongoing reactor situation &mdash; this is particularly relevant to tuberculosis and not brucellosis &mdash; the herd is a risk and should be depopulated. We suggested that there should be an additional level of compensation for such herds because otherwise, apart from the social aspects involved, the trauma and heartbreak for the farmer who has built up his herd, the farmer will be put out of business.</P>
    <P>Now that the hustings are over and the <Col N="1438" /> political pressures which were on the Minister have been removed, it is appropriate to discuss the anomaly that has arisen as a result of our meeting and the doubts people have about the disease eradication programme.  What is the Minister doing about this?  At mid-May &mdash; the June figures are not yet available &mdash; we had over 4,000 herds locked up as a result of tuberculosis and approximately 1,500 herds locked up as a result of brucellosis. That means that 5,500 farmers were out of business.  Those in milk production had some sort of income but those, particularly the people in the west, who had dry cattle or smaller stores were unable to sell them to the factories.  The animals must remain locked up until they are tested and shown to be clear on two consecutive occasions.  We have figures to prove that a farmer who loses eight cows, taking milk production, loss of calves, net replacement cost for his cows and the overall herd reduction in gallon-age, would lose in the region of £6,000. If we take from that the saving in the feeding of those cows the total net loss to a farmer would be in the region of £4,822. I could quote other cases and, whether dry stock or cows, there is a net loss to the farmer from participation in a compulsory scheme.</P>
    <P>I made these suggestions through the Animal Health Council to the Minister on the basis that the abolition of the hardship fund was part of the total package. In 1982 the Government provided £1,150,000 for a hardship fund.  Relatively few people qualified for the hardship fund this year.  Taking that into consideration and the fact that it is a fund which can be carried over from one year to another, perhaps the Minister would tell us what specific amount is now unexpended in that fund.  We are almost at the end of a round of testing and the number of reactors between the end of the round of testing and the beginning of a new accelerated programme, which is being discussed in Europe, will not be great.  There is an obligation on the Minister to answer the commitment which he gave and to do so quickly in the knowledge that he has a fund available to him from which to do it &mdash; a balance in the <Col N="1439" /> hardship fund and the fact that there is £4 million unexpended from a pre-movement test, agreed by the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, in Europe in 1981.  This has not been expended because of a staff embargo.  Taking those two funds into consideration, the Minister should not have to await a further budget to ensure that there is money available to compensate people on a realistic basis.</P>
    <P>In a statement which the Minister issued he said that the existing rate of reactor grants were fixed in 1978.  He said he was fully aware of the difficulties being experienced by farmers in certain areas and the rates of grants were currently being reviewed in the context of the extension of the disease programme for a further two years.  He said that he has received our recommendations, which were very helpful.  He expected a review of these grants to be completed very shortly.  We are still faced with the problem of trying to ensure that nothing will stymie the progress of the disease eradication programme.  While there is doubt about the level of compensation that will be paid to people and whether they will get more for their reactors next week or next month, it is only human to expect that they will refuse to co-operate.  The Minister heard farmers &mdash; even taking into consideration the levels we announced &mdash; saying they were going to refuse to co-operate unless we took their plight and their loss of income into consideration. Testing will grind to a halt and we know what happened before when testing stopped; the incidence and the level of the disease went up to an unacceptable level, and they are high enough at present.  It is a totally unacceptable level for the amount of money we have put into it.</P>
    <P>With the commitment of the Minister to the eradication of the disease and the programme we have now adopted at the Animal Health Council, in conjunction with the farming organisations, the veterinary surgeons involved in the scheme and the officials of the Department who are members of the council, I am sure they have now a specific programme for <Col N="1440" /> the total eradication of the disease accelerated in such a way that we can make progress in the foreseeable future and that we will not always be begging in Europe for derogations of directives to allow us to have a further breakdown in the time factor.  The only way we can achieve the fullest co-operation is to ensure that farmers are adequately compensated. Where there is an element of doubt and indecision on the part of the Minister about these levels of compensation, we could finish up having a diminution of the tremendous support which was there from all sides in respect of this level of compensation that became an election issue, an emotive issue and one in which all of us were subjected to certain pressures because of the situation that people found themselves in.</P>
    <P>I would welcome a commitment from the Minister tonight.  It would do a lot to bolster the goodwill that has been damaged in some way by this indecision.  If not, I would ask the Minister to seriously consider making these levels of compensation retrospective to the famous night in Portumna on 12 July, when we sowed the seed in their minds that there were additional compensations forthcoming. If we do not do that we will have let down the people who have always co-operated, the first people who went into this scheme when it was voluntary and contributed in no uncertain way to its success.</P>
    <P>In my own parish of Bansha in County Tipperary the late Canon Hayes started this scheme as a pilot scheme and we replaced the animals physically when they went down as reactors.  I know it is not possible to do that now but at least we should make some gesture to compensate people for the tremendous losses they have incurred as a result of the eradication of the disease.  They are willing and able to participate and co-operate with the veterinary practices throughout the country, the DVOs who are trying to isolate the cause of the disease and the epidemiology tests that are going on in the Department.  I commend the Minister and his predecessor for having set aside funds to do that.  If we do not identify the cause, the actual identification of the reactors is not enough.  We will get that <Col N="1441" /> co-operation if we do not have an area of indecision or doubt in people's minds and I hope that the Minister in his response to this motion will avail of the opportunity to dispel any doubts that might be in farmers' minds, either about the levels of compensation or the actual date from which it would apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear &mdash; and I have already done so in a statement last week &mdash; that I have just to hand recommendations from the Animal Health Council about a revision of their grants, which I appreciate.  Their recommendations are helpful and will be taken into account by me in the review of the grants and of existing rates which is taking place at present.</P>
      <P>I know the existing rates of reactor grants were fixed in 1978.  I am fully aware of the difficulties Senator Ferris referred to, and the rates of these grants are being looked at in a careful and constructive manner at present.  Today we have just completed the full details within the Department of the accelerated programme for the next two years for which we will be seeking substantial assistance from the European Commission.  That programme has to be submitted to the European Commission in Brussels and details approved, and I expect that to occur in the immediate weeks ahead.  At that stage, I will take into account the views of the Commission from whom we are receiving substantial financial assistance towards this accelerated two-year programme.  I will take into account the recommendations of the Animal Health Council in regard to the rates and other matters which Senator Ferris referred to in regard to other funds under the disease eradication programme such as the hardship fund and the brucellosis fund.  I will have a thorough look at the whole picture and then come forward with my specific decisions on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not in a business where one can make decisions off the top of the head. Decisions have to be carefully worked out and, in addition, I will have further proposals in regard to the future administration of this scheme so as to ensure <Col N="1442" /> we can really come to grips finally with TB eradication.  It is noteworthy that, in regard to brucellosis, we can see light at the end of the tunnel and I expect over the next four years we will see its final eradication.  We have not had the same success in regard to bovine TB eradication but that is a matter which we are examining at present.  A revival of the animal health committees with a greater devolution of functions and operational capacity at localised committee level throughout the country, in conjunction with the farming organisations, is a very likely way forward.  I have discussed this matter with the farming organisations with a view to their involvement with my Department and the veterinary profession in some sort of localised administration of the scheme under the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>This is a problem we have lived with for a long while without making the progress that we should have made in the course of eradication of bovine TB. There are a number of elements in it. Reactor compensation is one element and there is no question that that requires to be reviewed.  That is part of the recommendation that has come from the Animal Health Council.  The whole psychological attitude of farmers on the ground towards the eradication of this disease which contrasts with the psychological attitude of farmers towards the eradication of brucellosis is another aspect. Local involvement of farmers and the leadership that might be given to them by their organisations, the co-operative organisation and the two main farming bodies, co-operating together on the ground in county by county with my Department's officers and with the veterinary profession, would provide scope for a way forward.  The blitz scheme we brought in recently concentrating our resources and personnel on particularly high incidence areas has worked successfully. What we have at present is a complete investigation into a scheme which under all Governments and successive Ministers for Agriculture over a number of years has simply not succeeded, let us be frank about it, although there has been <Col N="1443" /> enormous expenditure of moneys over practically 20 years.</P>
    <P>We are engaged in a thorough investigation at present at all levels, administrative, rates of compensation &mdash; all these matters are being totally overhauled and reviewed.  Within a reasonably short period I will be coming forward with a new, comprehensive approach towards the eradication of this disease and towards disease eradication generally, although this disease has proved the most intractable.  We have had a fair amount of success in regard to brucellosis eradication, but generally the whole animal health and disease eradication areas need to be reviewed.  However, the big problem is the one referred to by the Senator.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the seriousness of the matter. I want to assure the Seanad that the matter is being approached by me in total seriousness and that everything that Senator Ferris and others have put to me in regard to this matter will be taken into account.  I cannot at this stage come to any firm conclusions or say precisely what is being done.  All I will say is that I am <Col N="1444" /> grateful for the advice that has been tendered by the Animal Health Council, by the Senator here tonight and by the farming organisations and their disease eradication committees, whom I have met, from all of whom I received a substantial body of advice.  Our programme has finally been put together today and will be with the Commission in a day or two.  I hope to have their approval so as to get the Community financing for a very real accelerated programme over the next two years which will involve substantial financing both from the Commission and from national sources and will involve also all of the other elements referred to by the Senator.  At this stage, pending the clearance of this eradication programme by the Commission, I cannot be any more specific.  All I can say is that I recognise the merits of the situation and the need to get down to grappling with the problem. The lines along which we should proceed are pretty well agreed among us all.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.45 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
